the history scotland under the house of stuart  volume i    the history of scotland from the accession of the house of stuart to that of mary  with appendixes of original papers  by john pinkerton  in two volumes  vol i  london printed for c dilly in the poultry  m dcc xcvii  preface with a considerable degree of anxiety the author at length delivers to the public candor the greatest labor of his life  the plan of this work being in some respects new it may not be unnecessary to indicate the causes of the arrangement the characters of the monarchs are delineated at the commencement not at the close of their reigns because in the most eminent historical productions when other personages ascend the scene they are thus introduced and recommended to the readers attention as he becomes more interested in the events by a previous acquaintance with the actors in the other mode the mind seems to feel some defect in gratification some desire to reperuse the reign in order to mark its correspondence with the character nor can any just cause be assigned why the princes should in this respect be distinguished from the other chief personages nor is the private personal character of a monarch always to be discerned in the public fortunes of his sovereignty often the machinations of ministers and parties though it doubtless have such influence as to deserve great attention and modern history not permitting such variety of rhetoric and digression as the ancient classical models afford it becomes the more important to preserve its legal wealth unviolated and to diversify the chronicle of wars and treaties by ethic portraiture by delineations of men and manners yet in this arrangement of the characters it becomes indispensable that the reign be first composed with complete candor from the most genuine and unbiassed sources and meditated in all its relations of time place and circumstances before a just estimate can be prefixed  another novelty is the retrospect interposed at appropriated epochs of the state of the country in civilization government laws tactics agriculture commerce literature and the arts during a preceding period the classical page of history from the age of herodotus to the latest voice of expiring rome is illuminated with such researches though commonly presented in the form of digressions but they are certainly deserving of a separate and peculiar nich in the temple of memory at the same time it would be rash too far to depart from the models venerated by the wisdom of ages or to forget that the preservation of national events is the allotted province of history these sketches must therefore be kept in due subservience to the main design least by an injudicious exuberance of extraneous matter the very nature and name of history perish and the grandest records of human instruction the most pleasing pages of general entertainment become cumbrous volumes of reference chained to the groaning shelves of libraries sufficiently difficult if performed with a due sense of its importance is the task of the historian and he needs little to encroach on other departments of science upon which for him to dilate would be as absurd as if he were to give the natural history of the animals and plants of a kingdom but when restricted within proper bounds and in some imitation of classical practice these sketches may be regarded as not only among the most instructive and interesting parts of history but as an agreeable variety and relief from the less diversified series of modern events the author was happy to find that his ideas on this topic completely corresponded with those of the late mr gibbon who was pleased warmly to express his approbation of this part of the plan of its arrangement and of the space allotted to it as calculated not to encumber and oppress the genuine province of history but to variegate enliven and adorn these remarks may at the same time answer the question why dr henrys plan was not followed and as little would the author though he warmly venerate the mutual benefits of the union be disposed to imitate his example in sinking the history of an independent and most memorable kingdom in that of a great neighboring state an injudicious mixture productive of perplexity and confusion while clear ideas can only be attained by separate and distinct views of their history and antiquities   in the important and interesting division of scottish history now before the reader no pioneer had arisen to clear the way and the author soon found that the carelessness and inaccuracy with which it had been treated exceeded any previous expectation he could have formed scarce a step could be advanced without some doubt arising in fact or in chronology so that the information of a paragraph is often the labor of a dissertation the most skillful will be the first to pardon any mistakes that may remain and the candor of all is requested for an attempt derived from so many new sources so many manuscript materials that after every care and attention not a few errors may have escaped notice  had the authors abilities been equal to his ambition it was his object and wish to have rendered the work so complete a model of modern history so perspicuous interesting various animated and elegant as to merit general approbation as to appear on the toilette as well as in the library while at the same time the events chronology references and appendixes should present an exactness impenetrable by the sharpest spear of the sternest antiquary vain hopes his less sanguine expectations may yet claim the humble merits of patience and labor the nurses not the parents of genius  may descend from the impervious mountains of ability into the vale of accuracy yet even accuracy is not the meanest merit of the historian though to attain it somewhat too much may perhaps be found to be here sacrificed in minute notes from diplomatic resources but in excuse the reader will remember that this particular division of the scottish history had never before been attempted by any writer versed in common authentication while sir david dalrymple dr robertson and other learned and able authors have minutely illustrated the preceding and succeeding periods such notes are not indeed interesting to the general reader but they occupy little space  and the learned will not blame even a superstitious regard to accuracy and illustration where much confusion and obscurity had before prevailed nor can the author be justly censured for the cruel necessity of being his own pioneer of proceeding as in an american forest with most cautious steps through the swamps and earnestly clearing his way amid the brambles and thickets of perplexity and error  not to mention the innumerable new materials used in the various reigns that of james v in particular is almost wholly composed from the original letters of the chief actors and is perhaps the first attempt of the kind in any language a few references to such documents having hitherto satisfied the ambition of truth and accuracy on a comparison with preceding accounts the reader will judge how much the modern history of all states might be verified and improved by such a plan and how many gross errors remain in the most celebrated pages of history the task is indeed laborious but what is temporary labor when compared with eternal truth  it is a trite remark that an historian should belong to no sect and no party with whatever severity and modesty he may estimate his efforts still his labors however humble must in their very nature appeal to posterity and to pollute his pages with the faction of the day would be to violate his own dignity and reject his best reward this work begun long before that change which produced the present opinions and commotions in europe was completed in a silent inattention to them and every sentiment would have been the same if the publication had taken place ten years ago  amid times of singular difficulty amid objects of far superior importance should these volumes be received with favor it would be the authors ambition to complete his design by composing on the same plan the history of scotland from the earliest accounts to the accession of the house of stuart in twentyfour books comprised in two similar volumes for the documents being more rare the divisions would be more brief he would arrange the materials contained in his enquiry into the early part and the succeeding annals of lord hailes with numerous important additions and illustrations the materials for this part are nearly complete and it would give the author great satisfaction to be encouraged in presenting at length an authentic and legitimate history of his country disencumbered from those clouds of fable and error which have so long exposed it to neglect or contempt  from the reign of mary to the union of the crowns and of the kingdoms so much has been done that little it would seem remains for future labor yet the untouched manuscript materials might occupy two or three years in the perusal and perhaps not a few discoveries might be made by indefatigable assiduity the best form of such a work might be one decade of history to the union of the crowns and one of annals to that of the kingdoms any succeeding events might appear in a chronological abstract at sufficient length to accompany the general history of a kingdom  it only remains to admonish the reader before he proceed to the perusal of this work that the letter o

regent  truce  death of robert  the accession of the family of stuart to the scottish throne deserves the particular attention of the historian      among the many families which have held the regal scepter in the various kingdoms of europe none have been hailed with equal applause none have encountered equal animosity this house being at the head of affairs when many violent effervescences of party arose the sober voice of candor has been drowned in the tumult of numerous partisans truth has sighed when she beheld all the weeds of obloquy and all the flowers of praise heaped upon the same monument  but the period is at length arrived when the violence both of religious and of political party was to suffer a considerable abatement when universal right of conscience shall order governments to refrain from the private business of the bosom and shall render even the name of toleration ridiculous by tearing down the veil which obscured the most sacred prerogatives of mankind when the interested aims of antiquated parties were to become objects of equal neglect to enlightened nations who began to see that one party alone could serve them an union of the people against their corrupters and oppressors  there is a gloomy bigotry in the spirit of party which is inimical to reason and which clouds the sunshine of the mind absurdity becomes as contagious as a pestilence and many tenets are objects of belief because they are impracticable to argument hence we cease to wonder when we behold the human character so variable in itself and so liable to every alteration of time and circumstance supposed to be constant and immutable in one family only to the jaundiced eye of party the whole house of stuart became as it were one test of political and religious opinion instead of granting according to the dictates of reason and of fact that the monarchs of that illustrious family were as various in their characters and conduct as those of any other genealogy and country faction has been so absurd as to form them into one house of fame or dispraise one character alone may indeed be ascribed to the whole family in the sacred term of unfortunate and their proverbial misfortunes as often contradict the political maxim that want of success is but another expression for defect of prudence as they confirm the rigorous observation if one other general remark be allowed it must be that most of the princes of this family were better qualified for the enjoyments and elegancies of private life than for the toil and dazzling bustle of royalty and had little of that tyrannic splendour which pleases the people so much because they regard the monarch as the public representative and exult when he shows his spirit by trampling upon them a mild sovereign may receive the appellation of a tyrant from his yielding some prerogatives and thus raising hope and resentment because he concedes not more while with equal injustice a despot may secure popular applause because his royal spirit preserves the tyranny in pure and uncorrupted pomp to confirm this observation let the houses of tudor and of stuart be compared but after these preparatory remarks it is now proper to return to the immediate course of the narration  the scepter of scotland passed to the family of stuart at an unfortunate period for the acceding progeny instead of a new sovereign who might interest the wishes of the nation by the amiable and splendid promises of youth or excite its confidence and ambition by the steady spirit of middle age the reins of government fell into a hand trembling under the weight of years  in order to enable the reader to form just ideas concerning this important event it becomes necessary to explain as briefly as possible the origin and progress of the family of stuart and its actual condition when it ascended the scottish throne  the fables of adulation have now passed away and it is acknowledged that we have no certain evidence concerning this family till the reign of david i when walter the son of alan appears as steward dapifer a term synonymous with seneschalcus in france as in scotland du cange voce seneschalcus the derivation of the latter word is not clear schak is a servant marischalcus is the servant who had the charge of the horses but seen or senet remains unexplained it may be from sean to see as inspector or from segen a banner see lie dict anglosax perhaps it is allied to senescantia convivium du c but the most plausible etymology seems to arise from senn a chief herdsman sennten a herd  scheuchzer iter alp i    as the wealth of early times consisted of herds and flocks the office is evident it was not only the chief of the household but its power from the confidence acquired by that station extended to the collection and management of the revenue to the administration of justice and even to the chief direction in war during the reigns of the first race of france the stewards are classed after the bishops and counts in the time of the second race they follow the comites palatii about the year   0 they succeeded to the extinguished office of mayors of the palace but the power was in france found too vast for a subject and in      the dignity and emoluments began to be reserved to the crown the office was gradually subdivided into those of great master of the household constable or commander in chief and high justiciary du cange ib of scotland and there is room to believe that this genealogical appellation points to the noble and ancient english family of fitz alan walter was succeeded in his high office by alan his son who was followed by the second walter no action worthy of the historic page is authentically recorded of these three and the most important intelligence which we can obtain from their charters is the situation of their lands which were chiefly in that western promontory washed by the fertile and picturesque river clyde and now called the shire of renfrew then and since the territory of the family and power of the stewards crawfords history of the shire of renfrew and of the house of stuart edin    0 folio paisley       to stewarts genealogical

of the heroes who divided the danger and the glory at bannocburn his youthful courage and tried fidelity were the following year rewarded with the largest gift which a subject could receive in his marriage with the only daughter of his sovereign his valor and his abilities were confirmed in the public esteem by the defense of berwick and by his government of the kingdom in conjunction with douglas and his early death was lamented by a grateful people crawf        stewart        dalrymple vol ii passim he died in      dalr ii      robert the seventh high steward was the only issue of walter and the princess and to him the crown of scotland was destined to devolve distinguished in early youth by his conduct at the battle of halidon by his decisive exertions against edward baliol by the singular praise of being appointed in conjunction with murray governor of scotland at the age of eighteen he did not afterward frustrate the general expectation crawf    stewart    dalr ii             the steward was sole regent            and            dalr ii  0       twice sole governor of a fierce and high spirited nation he confirmed the claim of his birth by the tenor of his actions and he afterward ascended the throne fully experienced in the duties of obedience and the arts of command  the actual state of the family when it became royal claims our next attention rewards for successive services of importance and the dower of the princely bride had increased the possessions of the stuarts to a great number and extent in various regions both in the western and eastern parts of scotland crawf passim  had the territories of douglas been as detached as those of stuart that name had never become formidable to the crown but chance and not design seems to have presided in this distant allotment the title and office of high steward had succeeded in france to the supremacy of the mairs of the palace and in that and other countries were soon found too lofty for the ambition of a subject hence it is not matter of surprise that no territorial dignity was annexed to this distinction till the year      when the earldom of strathern devolving into the hands of david ii was by him conferred on robert afterward his successor crawf    additional case of the countess of sutherland by sir d dalrymple    0 p     but in      walter a cadet of the family had become earl of

while the umfravilles of england grasped at the title for many generations crawf    stewart   0 sutherland case     robert the steward had but one brother sir john stuart of railstoun the only issue of his fathers posterior marriage with a sister of graham of abercorn crawf    stewart     and this brother sleeps in the silent shades of heraldry but the family by the extent of their possessions and connexions wanted not power to support their just title to the throne of all the great scottish families that of douglas alone seems to have been equal and perhaps superior in power the successor to the scepter was also fortified by a numerous progeny ready to assert and to perpetuate his claim by his first wife elizabeth daughter of sir adam more of rowallan he had his successor john lord of

certainly fortunate for the acceding family that it possessed such internal strength at this crisis but this chance was overbalanced by peculiar disadvantages  the king was advanced to his fifty fifth year he was born on the  d of march      dalr ii     and the weakness of his reign sufficiently testifies that age began and continued to freeze abilities which had formerly flowed in a clear and copious stream his eldest son and heir the earl of carric had been maimed by a horse fordun ii     the rebellious steed belonged to sir james douglas of dalkeith johannes comes de carrik ex percussione equi domini jacobi douglas de dalkeith quasi claudus effectus  and was lame and weak in body and of no power of intellect a personal deformity which often arouses superior spirit in an individual is pernicious to princes in whom not a defect but a superiority of dignity is matter of a general expectation so deeply rooted in our nature that savage nations often appoint their sovereigns only from superior personal appearance this remark must also be applied to robert ii himself whose eyes disfigured by imflammation disgusted the beholders froissart ii f     the ms bib reg

defects of princes  the person of robert ii was however large and majestic fordun ii      the qualities of his mind it is difficult to mark with precision the disease of his eyes seems to have induced a desire of privacy and age a propensity to indolence and the indolent are always ruled by those around them war he shunned and declined the laborious office of a general but the leaders whom he appointed were well chosen and successful in the more difficult and more truly glorious arts of peace he is entitled to considerable praise the terrors of justice he knew how to deal impartially to the guilty while he opened every gate of protection to the innocent his actions proceeded in a solid and rational tenor and his promise was the exact standard of his performance internal discords his equity appeased and though his own age and the infirmity of the apparent heir rendered his reign feeble yet his wisdom prevented it from being unfortunate in a word he is little known to history because he was a good king and a good man  upon the death of david ii the states of the kingdom assembled at lithgow feb and their determination appeared unanimous in the appointment of robert as successor to the vacant throne fordun ii      but a sudden cloud arose which threatened all the storms of civil war william earl of douglas unexpectedly claimed the crown as uniting in himself the dubious pretensions of common and the solid title of baliol yet the claim was no sooner made than withdrawn our elder historians assert that the strong interests of the earls of dunbar and murray and the yet stronger of sir robert erskine keeper of the castles of dunbarton edinburgh and stirling appearing decided for the steward induced douglas to resign his expectation while the historian of the house of douglas ascribes the desertion of the claim to its own friends fordun ii     winton ms     humes house of douglas i   0       pretensions which now strike as vague or usurpative might not wear that appearance in an age when the rights of succession were fluctuating and undetermined but prudence certainly did not conspire with ambition upon this occasion for no previous concert appears no conciliation of interest and the claim can only be recommended as a subject of speculation had robert i united his house to that of douglas the prosperity of scotland might perhaps have been more ample under a family that though subject showed a regal spirit that in war boasts a genealogy of heroes and that happened to have few of those minorities which harrassed the kingdom under the stuarts but in the more useful honors of peace the latter family seem to have been far superior and by their merit alone better deserved the scepter  robert attended by the states proceeded to scone where he

foreseen and certainly not wished nor intended it was agreed reciprocally that the subjects of the allied powers should not serve in the english armies and different scottish men who had toward the end of the preceding reign entered into them in consequence withdrew this circumstance was considered as an indication of war and joined with the jealousy naturally arising from the renewal and

attentive payment of the ransom though the english sovereign continued to deny his title and only condescended to use that of most noble and potent prince our dear cousin of scotland and when disposed

against civil war but in another as the apparent heir was infirm and had no children at the time it perhaps lent a fanction and support to the ambition of the second son which had such violent effects

english throne two wars pregnant with various and important events distinguish the latter part of the reign of robert ii and it is the not unuseful province of history to delineate hostilities in

vessels suddenly displayed his motley squadron before scarborough and captured some valuable english ships of merchandise because that his father a wealthy merchant residing in france had been taken at sea by some northumbrians and imprisoned at that place the father was a man of importance at the french court esteemed by charles the wise and his advice followed in many points detrimental to the english and advantageous to the french commerce walsingham expresses unaffected concern that the earl of northumberland had executed justice in soon delivering him without ransom for adds he if he had been ransomed by the common rules he might have enriched the king and kingdom with inestimable wealth nam si redemptus fuisset captivorum more regem et regnum inestimabili pecunia divited effecisset p

defying the maritim power of england till john philpot a wealthy and ingenious merchant of london stung with the disgrace offered to the commerce of his country fitted out ships of force provided with one thousand men raised at his own expense who assaulted and took mercer his newly acquired prey and fifteen spanish ships which assisted him walls      the duke of lancaster who swayed the councils

difficult to discover the real pretext or occasion of the capture of the castle of berwick by the scots this year nov and the events of this period are not a little embroiled by various and discordant

froissart it was the consequence of a war commenced by the determination of the scottish government this last account we are disposed to follow and to infer from the narrative of it is author that the counsels of france which aimed to divert the attention of richard ii from the ambitious views of his grandfather had a share in stimulating the scots already stung with repeated insults to regard the dubious truce in the same light with the english and to break it when it suited their convenience mezeray abr iii    relates that the scots now broke the truce with england instigated by advantages

under the command of douglas murray and mar while this host was gradually assembling and esquire named alexander ramsay proceeded with forty companions to berwick sending a spy to discover the state of the castle it was found that there was no water in the ditches and no guard on the walls ramsay and his followers immediately planted ladders scaled the walls and came to the keep where the commander was in bed it being apparently early in the day and he was killed in attempting to escape an alarm being given the governor of the town ordered the stop and pillars of the drawbridge to be destroyed and upon the assailants finding that they could not pass the governor and his people shouted are you there remain where you are you shall not escape without our permission ramsay resolved to

melrose at midnight but a tempest of wind and rain blowing in their faces they could hardly withstand it is force and wandered from their way halting under a wood and making fires they remained till dawn when the tempest abated and as they were forced to forage they had some skirmishes with musgraves men who were alike employed and he determined to advance to the right in order to join the english army but the scots amounting to seven hundred lances and two thousand uncouthly armed lay in the wood and intercepted his progress a conflict being unavoidable douglas according to the custom of the times knighted james his son and robert and david two sons of the king the battle was quickly decided archibald douglas lighting on foot and wielding a sword of enormous length which another man could hardly have held made great slaughter musgrave his son and many knights and squires were taken the scottish army retired toward edinburgh with their captives while northumberland and nottingham could not pursue them because of the tempestuous season of the year and were forced to return and dismiss their men while the scots were rejoicing and ransoming their captives at large sums

the march of the historian who lost as in the moving sands of a desert sighs for the pleasing landscape of peace or the grandeur of some important scene  the duke of lancaster who managed the councils of his sovereign had assumed the title of king of castile and determined to prosecute his pretensions to that kingdom arising from his marriage with the daughter of peter the cruel by assisting the portugueze against the reigning prince rapin acta regia sub anno  it was improtant to his purpose that a truce should be established with scotland either by the terrors of a decisive war or by the conciliating respect of an honorable embassy and he resolved to be himself the bearer of both with a royal commission to adjust the terms of peace and with a formidable army he advanced to borders of scotland this armed negotiation was successful for in answer to his invitation the bishops of dunkeld and glasgow the earls of douglas and march and archibald douglas lord of galloway appeared as commissioners from scotland and a truce was concluded at berwick to last for one year rymer vii          nov the english not apprized of lancasters original intentions murmured to see their northern counties consumed by his numerous army and the expense of the negotiation which ended in delaying the ransom of david ii and in other concessions enereased their discontent walls     the expense was   000 marks   according to an agreement made in concluding the truce      june lancaster again proceeded to scotland in the following summer but only with his usual train and he was instigated to use his best endeavors for a treaty by a promise of the english council that if he could confirm a truce for three years they should assert his pretensions to castile and furnish him with a competent force to join with that of portugal froissart ii fol     meeting the earl of carric heir of the kingdom and other scottish commissioners at alchester near aytown an important conference ensued the scots complained that during the truce of fourteen years many infractions had been made by the english upon their freedom of intercourse and commerce with england established by that truce and the fact being denied they offered to submit the evidence to an equal number of noblemen of both nations but the english waved the affair by offering the vague expedient of calling in the mediation of some neighboring sovereign lancaster however consented that the payment of any further part of the ransom should be deferred till candlemas      to which period the treaty was extended and agreed again to meet the earl of carric in july that year rymer vii      the insurrection of wat tyler prevented the dukes immediate return to england he being apprehensive of the fury of the rebels from his attachment to wickliff and other unpopular actions he proceeded to the castle of edinburgh which as a mark of honor was given up to him and his attendants and hi resided there till the subjection of the rebels rendered his return to england secure fordun ii     winton       a truce of one year concluded between england and france      contributed still further to give a respite to the horrors of war and as treaties were in that age understood only to bind the sovereigns who contracted and not their heirs the scottish king sent an embassy to the succeeding french monarch charles vi who engaged when war should recommence between england and scotland to send to the latter kingdom one thousand men at arms a formidable force at that period in which a few knights in panoply were wont to defeat armies of rude infantry he also promised a thousand sets of armor for as many scottish gentlemen and a sum of money to conciliate the court and nobles to enterprises certainly foreign to the real interests of their country register fol    du tillet recueil f v     charles vi had succeeded his father on the   th sept    0 the treaty was signed at paris on the  th april and ratified by robert on the  0th august      register fol     0  the ignominious barter of the blood and prosperity of the nation for french gold cannot be palliated but by the confession that it was necessary to maintain an active alliance with france and that the sums drawn from that country were reputed a compensation to scotland for being commonly engaged in war solely by her ally to suppose that any treaty existed preceding the unhappy and imprudent reign of john baliol is to suppose that france was capable of the utmost treachery and impolicy when she permitted the ruin of scotland by edward i and that the scots were so improvident as to submit the determination of their crown to an inimical sovereign instead of their ancient ally that old league counted amongst the fables of the ancient palladines drum hift p     and even after the active alliance appears during the reign of david ii an alliance to be written with the tears and signed with the blood of scotland scarcely can history mention one war into which france did not conduct that country but had scotland been blessed with a more free and democratic government her peace her industry her learning her happiness had not been sacrificed to a corrupt aristocracy for as to the monarch supposing that he wished for peace and had the public interest at heart how could he at once reject the desire of a necessary ally and the wishes of an uncontrouled nobility  the duke of lancaster and the earl of carric again met july and the latter agreed to a compensation for some damage done by the scottish borderers this year to the castle of wark and other places in england but a definitive treaty being again mentioned carric declared that he had no powers for that purpose and the conference dissolved without any further renewal of the pacification rymer vii  0  compare walls   0 ypod       the truce being thus permitted to expire      a war of real importance and of a singular and interesting complexion took place oct to july france had made a brief truce with england after the part both had taken in the flemish commotions to last till midsummer this year but by some neglect scotland had not been included and this circumstance was esteemed sufficient to justify an invasion of that country the duke of lancaster and the earls of northumberland and nottingham with a considerable army easter    mar entered scotland by berwick and ravaged the country up to the walls of edinburgh then as now the capital city froissart ii fol     he informs us f   0 that edinburgh was not so large as tournay or valenciennes but contained only about four thousand houses  from an amiable regard for a place which had been his asylum on a recent occasion lancaster would not permit the destruction of edinburgh but withdrew his army and with an inadequate prey regained england before the scots who were unprepared could intercept his retreat fordun ii     winton     says edinburgh was ransomed both recite a defeat of a party of the english who had landed from their vessels near queensferry and the continuator of fordun piously ascribes it to the interference of st columba whose monastery in an island of the forth they had attempted to consume with fire  a few villages were burned in this expedition but the scottish houses were then slight huts of wood and easily refitted and they found time to remove their cattle and effects into the forests and even to carry off the straw roofs of the houses in the capital as some security against a conflagration walls     a curious and minute account but the historian is prejudiced against the generous lancaster the patron of the wicklifites he accuses the waste of time in north of england and the liberality of his enmity and adds that on easter eve the english encamping in a marsh to avoid surprise they lost fifty horses by the cold and snow and the duke would not permit any forage which would indeed have been fruitless as the scots had withdrawn their effects to their forests beyond the forth leaving famine to combat the english unaccustomed to his new enemy  we learn from froissart that robert summoned an army but that the french envoys mean time arrived to notify the truce although about thirty french knights and esquires finding no further employ in flanders now came to scotland as a theater of arms froiss ii f      the king wished for peace but the barons opposed his intentions and meeting in the church of st giles at edinburgh resolved on war and informed the french knights that their spirit should be immediately called into action without the avowal of the king an expedition was set on foot and   000 of such cavalry as scotland then had were assembled on the borders who ravaged the lands belonging to northumberland nottingham and mowbray and returned loaded with spoil before the english had time to collect any force froiss ii f   0  the earl of northumberland ravaged the south of scotland again and as soon as he dismissed his army the scots retaliated so that the summer passed in mutual inroads walls       the french knights taking leave the scottish barons desired them to send their friends to enter this new career of glory by carrying the war into england and it is said that jehan de vienne admiral of france and other potent persons of that country were instigated by their discourses upon their return as much as by the recent treaty to fulfill its conditions next year froiss ii f      a resolution pregnant with such ruin to scotland as even to threaten the subjugation of the kingdom  at this time the papal

been regarded as patient objects of increased exactions both by the nobility and clergy few other events of importance happened this year william earl of douglas brought tividale into a state of

england fordun ii  0    meanwhile richard ii had made great preparations and summoned almost the whole force of his kingdom and finding that the commotions in flanders had frustrated the southern invasion of the french      aug he determined to exert all his power against scotland if we credit an english historian his army was numerous beyong precedent and more than three hundred thousand horses were employed in various services walf      the youthful monarch chose this as his first expedition and solemn entry into the field of military fame and was attended by his uncles and by the chief nobles of england the destruction of the abbey of melrose long respected by the religious awe of the english to whom it had afforded early saints and teachers was the first warlike act of richard ii the disgrace of his arms and the omen of his mental weakness dryburgh and newbottel two venerable monasteries and edinburgh with her churches were successively given to the flames the scots unable openly to contend with an enemy so superior in numbers prudently followed the advice ascribed to robert the great by withdrawing their cattle and effects into forests and wilds and harrassing their foes by unceasing ambuscades and excursions the green crops were alone left and the harvest was trampled and destroyed after remaining five days at edinburgh the english marched to stirling which with an abbey adjacent was burnt to the ground one hundred and twenty vessels carried provisions for the army which still advancing destroyed perth and dundee and many abbeys and monasteries and the couriers and vanguard even proceeded as far as aberdeen according to froissart but from the old english and scottish accounts it rather appears that the english expedition only extended to the

car oncques si mauvaises gens ne virent ne ne trouverent si faulx et si trahysires ne de si petite congnoissance the french had equally disgusted the scots by their usual petulance and vienne himself

editions by sauvages have been always neglected in this work   the northumbrians having learned that a scottish army was collecting resolved to prepare and if the scots entered england by the western to repay the invasion by the eastern marches an english gentleman went to espy the intentions of the enemy who had advanced to the chapel of salom a noted station near the borders and entering the chapel in the disguise of a servant saw the scottish nobles assembled and heard much of their designs when he withdrew he expected to have found his horse tied to a tree as he had left him but he was stolen and the gentlemans fear or negligence of art in walking away without any enquiry led to suspicion he was seized and confessed that the northumbrians unable to encounter the inimical numbers had determined on whatever side england was invaded to assail scotland on the opposite this induced the scottish leaders to restrain the main army to the protection of their own country and to order only a strong detachment under the tried heroism of the earl of douglas to advance into england at the head of three hundred men at arms and of two thousand chosen infantry douglas proceeded without pillaging the country or attacking any place passed the tine three miles above newcastle and with the suddenness and destruction of lightning darted on the county of durham when the distant flames and smoke of burning villages had given the first tidings of the scottish arrival the earl of northumberland then at alnwick sent his two sons henry and ralph to newcastle to assemble a force in pursuit of the enemy while he should gather another on the north and preclude their retreat all the country being pillaged to the gates of york this is confessed by the english monarch himself in a deed published by rymer vii      and the unfortified towns and villages destroyed douglas returned with the spoil repassed the tine at the same place and came before newcastle whither the chief people of the neighboring counties had crowded to gain the protection of a walled city and of the two gallant percies henry surnamed hotspur and ralph his brother in birth and arms many skirmishes ensuing at one of them douglas won the pennon of henry percy to the great mortification of that undaunted leader and of his followers and to add to the disgrace douglas vaounted this i shall carry as a sign of thy prowess to scotland and shall place it on the pinnacle of my castle to be known by all percy retorted with an oath thou shall never bear it out of northumberland and in the end shall have little cause to boast to which douglas replied then thou must come this night and take it from before my tent next morning the scots pursued their march and assailing a castle without success wished to proceed but douglas commanded them to encamp in order to see if percy would advance to recover his pennon and that being refreshed they should again attack the fortress in the morning they accordingly fortified their station with felled trees to prevent a surprise and next day captured the castle and pursued their journey toward the main army till they came to otterburn a hamlet amid the wilds of the parish of elsdon about thirty miles northwest of newcastle and about twenty from the scottish borders which was to be a scene of celebrity to the bard and to the historian  meanwhile percy wished to pursue the scottish detachment but was restrained by the tidings that the main army was near and ready to support douglas till the couriers brought certain intelligence that they were far distant and incapable of effecting a junction for some days percy with his usual impetuosity instantly cried to horse it being early in the morning and left newcastle attended by six hundred lances or knights and squires and eight thousand infantry accoutred with the dreadful longbows of england after a forced march they reached the scottish camp at otterburn late in the evening the scots had supped some had even retired to rest fatigued with various exertion and the english began to enter the outer entrenchment where the servants were stationed shouting percy percy but they found it well fortified some infantry was ordered to support the servants by the scottish chiefs who in the mean time armed in haste and arrayed their men under their banners night was now advanced but the moon shone clear in a serene sky of the month of august    aug   the scots armed and arranged proceeded not toward the assailants but around an eminence and attacking the enemy in the rear raised all at once the cry of battle upon which the english in surprise turned strengthened their ranks and refounded percy in answer to the scottish acclaim of douglas after a severe contest the scots were on the point of yielding to numbers when the earl of douglas ardently pushed forward his banner and both the percies advanced against him with equal impetuosity so that the scots recoiled and had not the valor of the two hepburns opposed the banner of douglas had been taken douglas irritated by the apprehension of disgrace rouzed all his strength and courage and brandishing a twohanded battleax opened the thick files of the foe as with a long avenue despising numerous blows and committing his life to the temper of his armor he had advanced far from his battalions when he fell under three mortal wounds but ignorance of his fate forbad the english to triumph and the scots to despair the former only saw that some valiant man at arms had fallen and the latter were inspirited by the earls of march and moray to follow a tract which they knew not had conducted their leader to death fortune now began to favor the scots ralph percy advancing too far in return was severly wounded and taken prisoner by maxwell a knight who followed moray and the english exhausted with a fatiguing march and an obstinate contest bagan to exhibit symptoms of depression and defeat  douglas faint with the loss of blood and sensible of the approaches of death was defended by his valiant chaplain william of northberwick his banner lay on the ground not far from him the bearer being slain when lindsay sinclair and some other knights pierced through the now yielding foe and reached the spot and bespoke their general even trifles in such a conversation are interesting cousin how goes it said sinclair douglas answered but so so praised be god few of my ancestors have died in chambers or beds  avenge me for i die  my heart faints too repeatedly raise again my banner and shout douglas but tell neither friend nor foe how it fares with me for my enemies would exult and my friends be disconsolate the banner was erected the whole field resound with the animating cry of douglas and the scots excited as with the voice of victory instantly formed one phalanx and with levelled spears pushed the enemy to flight  henry percy was taken prisoner by montgomery and the defeat was complete radman the governor of berwick was almost the only englishman of note who escaped and the scots pursued the chase for five miles the number of the english slain is computed at twelve hundred such was the battle at otterburn which froissart represents as the most eminent fought in his time for heroic bravery on both sides and the real spirit of war he also highly applauds the courtesy shown by the scots to their prisoners and observes that both nations were not less laudable for their benevolence after a battle than for their courage during its rage froissar iii f       douglas was carried to his tent where he soon expired but though dispirited at the loss of their leader the scots determined to maintain their strong station against the fresh english army which approached for the bishop of durham had reached newcastle the night of the battle with seven thousand men two thousand of whom were cavalry but a conjunction was prevented by percys impetuosity advancing next morning he was met by the fugitives from otterburn whose tidings raised such dismay that all his followers fled back to newcastle except five hundred with whom the bishop was at last also constrained to regain that city here he found means to inspirit his followers and the inhabitants so that he marched next morning in quest of the scots attended by ten thousand the scottish scouts the day after notifying his approach their chiefs determined not to leave their camp as they had many wounded and prisoners to attend and when the bishop came within a miles distance they began all at once to sound their horns in a loud discordance of warlike music after a pause the same horrible din of defiance was repeated and the bishop arranging his host and advancing within two bowshots was again saluted with the thundering noise observing the strength of the rude fortification and that its possessors were too prudent to desert its advantages the english after a brief council retreated and the scots having refreshed themselves prepared to march ralph percy requesting permission to go to newcastle to have his wounds attended the earl of moray consented and ordered him to be conveyed in a litter the scottish march instead of triumphant seemed funereal and the joy of success was tempered with tears for the body of douglas enclosed in a coffin and borne on a car formed the chief object in the progress froissart iii f

latter seems from the parliamentary acts of this reign to have formerly stood in that high capacity and the king commonly shunned the pomp and it is suspected the duties of royalty by residing on his parental estate and example followed by his successor though impolitic in an eminent degree preferring the remote mansions of the stuarts to the centrical and accustomed residences of the scottish sovereigns they seemed to forget their rank their office their people and removed form the scene of action from the vital heart of the kingdom the monarch could only be seen by the nation in a dangerous representative assemblies of the states seem to have been seldom held an aristocratic council decided upon peace and war and upon the best interests of the people but this fault was common to england and most european kingdoms at this period while the appointment of the second son as governor of the state to the prejudice of the heir apparent may be regarded as a new and dangerous precedent declarative of great weakness upon the one part and upon the other of baneful ambition  the new regent desirous to signalize the commencement of his power assembled an army on the borders against the earl of nottingham marshal of england lately appointed warden of the eastern marches and who in the usual concomitance of pride and weakness had reproached the percies for the loss at otterburn where their army was far more numerous than that of the scots and boasted that he hoped to vanquish even if opposed by number doubling his own but when fife accompanied by archibald the succeeding earl of douglas and by other nobles poured his array into england the earl marshal restrained his men in a secure and inaccessible station and to a challenge of the regent inviting him to descend and fulfill his threats he replied that he had no orders to expose the lieges of his sovereign to any danger this answer was received with peals of laughter and the scottish army after standing in defiance half the day with banners displayed ravaged the adjacent country and returned fordun ii     winton     walsingham only mentions the burning of tinmouth by the scots ypod       a

consent of scotland the envoys were by the governor remitted to the king who agreed as from deference to france the earls of salisbury and march appear to have been named in this truce in consequence of their claims to the isle of man and some debateable lands upon the borders the lords of the isles were really independent of scotland and by their fleets maintained their power in the isles and over the western highlands while the scottish kings had no fleet to oppose them and could not attack mountainous regions inaccessible to armies the brief ard confined conquests of alexander iii and robert i had not overcome the old norwegian spirit and the hebudes must be regarded with truth as an independent principality till the sixteenth century had the lords been told of their occasional submission to scotland they would have retorted by instances of the like necessity forced upon that country be england but the circumstance which especially induced the mention of these princes in the

to the monk than to the philosopher who knows that the virtues of a king are the virtues of ability and of action and that the most acceptable service to the deity consists in the service of mankind the lenity of robert iii may be vindicated from the yet new elevation of a family accustomed to regard the nobles as equals and brothers but it unhappily tended to increase the power of the aristocracy and add to the consequent stock of public calamity yet the years of his reign were fertile and the people were contented though in the continuous struggles with england for political freedom it is no wonder that internal liberty made no progress and that the scots remembered that they were soldiers but forgot that they were men for the character of robert iii compare bowar ii   0

proposed were treated with due contempt but robert accepted the treaty of leilinghen ib f    n   which continued for the first eight years of this reign in a state of external peace but were somewhat disturbed at home by inroads of the highlanders distinguished by french and domestic writers from early times to the present century as the savages of scotland  one of their incursions into angus has been esteemed worthy of historical preservation      according to bowar the continuator of fordun it was conducted by duncan stuart a natural son of the earl of buchan but wintons account bears by three highland chieftains thomas patrick and gibbon sons of one duncan sir david lindsay of glenesk hearing that an inroad was intended sent a spy to discover the circumstances of the design but he never returned and the highlanders exceeding three hundred in number rushed into the plains sir walter ogilvy sheriff of angus and sir patrick gray collected their followers and marched against the plunderers whom they found at glasclune in stormont and a conflict began during which the sheriff was joined by sir david lindsay the highland ferocity prevailed and the sheriff with his halfbrother walter lichton and sixty of his people were slain and lindsay and gray wounded bowar   0 winton      that any chastisement was inflicted on the marauders does not appear from the original account but it would have been happy if robert iii had possessed sufficient benevolence and ability to impart some degree of civilization to this unhappy part of his subjects and to have fulfilled the noblest duties of royalty by the propagation of law peace and industry  the insanity of charles vi of france which appeared this summer and the consequent distracted state of affairs in that kingdom conspired with the english discontents under the maladministration of richard ii to render a prolongation of the truce of leilinghen expedient and it was accordingly extended at different times to michaelmas         aug and afterward to the same term in      rymer vii         etc  this constant repetition of truces between england and scotland unknown to any other history is tedious and unpleasing in every view one is led to imagine that the system of hobbes is founded in truth and that war is the natural state of man but peculiar circumstances contributed to this inveterate and lengthened enmity the conduct of edward i when chosen the friendly arbiter of the disputes concerning the scottish succession was unkingly and ungenerous beyond example and destroyed the most sacred rules of society and every bond of mutual confidence and of public faith it is no wonder then that the scottish nation had converted all their ancient regard for the english into a rooted enmity and that the situation of the two nations confined on one island occasioned continuous war the ambition of sovereigns that chief scourge of mankind and spring of slaughter led the english kings to maintain the lofty pretensions of edward i and untaught by experience to hope the vain conquest of scotland nor could they abandon their claims lest justice should be interpreted want of power and the highest wisdom accounted imbecility such evils could arise from the ambition of one man the inadmission or dubious grant of the title of the scottish sovereigns was an insult to them and to the nation which with the unjust pretensions on the one side and jealousy and revenge on the other precluded all hopes of solid and lasting peace when we find henry viii in      repeating the extravagant claims of the first

viii    a letter of carric to john of gaunt occurs vesp f vii f    n    it is not improbable that the superior title of the english duke led to some claim of precedence or respect not relished by the scottish princes    april for in the course of this summer we find the first appearance of the ducal title in scotland bowar     winton      and its appropriation affords another proof of the kings weakness and of the governors insatiable ambition the heir apparent of the kingdom was created duke of rothsay a miserable hamlet in the isle of bute while the whole island would not have afforded a territorial title to a baron and the earl of fife had the real style of heir apparent in the title of duke of albany or of all scotland north of the firths of clyde and forth that such a perversion should have continued to our own times is only an instance of that inattention and blind imitation so natural to mankind these titles were conferred in a solemn council held at scone and prince david then in his twentieth year appeared as the leader of a tournament exhibited at edinburgh by the queens command bowar     says it was held near the north loch ubi nunc est lacus does this imply that

an actor in the splendid tournaments of richard ii bowar          winton       a fresh congress of commissioners was held october to establish further articles of truce and guarantees were appointed

capture of a scottish vessel having on board sir john hamilton of cadyou ancestor of the dukes of hamilton and other men of rank by immediate restoration deliverance and compensation for the damages ibid     but the family of douglas seem not to have been pleased with the appearances of amity between the kingdoms which the critical situation of richard ii owing to the revolt of ireland had led him to wish for the earls son with sir william stuart and others broke down the bridge at roxburgh plundered the town and ravaged the adjacent lands ibid winton   0 seems to narrate this incident but has erroneously put jedburgh  this expedition may however have been a mere sally of intemperate courage for the earl of douglas soon after consented   nov as warden of the western marches to observe the truce and gave securities for that purpose rymer viii       etc  the english king intent upon his irish expedition was now anxious to establish a real and lasting peace with scotland and instructed his ambassadors to use every endeavor for this end or at any rate to procure a long truce the dukes of lancaster and rothsay again met but only confirmed the truce formerly established to last till michaelmas      rymer viii     lancaster had long been lord lieutenant of the english marches and being of course the chief instrument in the negociations it is not matter of surprise that they did not succeed when we consider the differences between him and richard feb      upon his death in the ensuing year his son irritated by the injustice of his sovereign returned from his short banishment sept  0 dethroned richard ii and is known by the name of henry iv as the successful usurper of the english crown  while the parliament of england was occupied with the deposition of one sovereign and the appointment of another winton       0 tells a strange story of richard ii being discovered in the hebudes by an irish lady named bisset wedded to the brother of the lord of the isles this richard was however maintained by robert iii and by albany the regent he was indevout and seemed distracted says winton bowar     believes the tale the riming chronicler gives p   0 an incoherent account of the seizure of dumbarton castle by the parson of kincardin o neil  the scottish borderers took and ruined the castle of wark the governor sir thomas gray then being absent upon his parliamentary duty and ravaged the adjacent country walls  0  but umfraville defeated the scots at redswyre on another inroad harding f      henry iv soon after nominated ralph neville earl of westmoreland to treat with scotland and in case that a peace or truce could not be obtained to offer an agreement that the towns of dumfries in scotland and penrith in england should be declared free from any hostility rymer viii  0  abercromby unaccountably styles westmoreland the brother of henry iv in which he is blindly followed by guthrie robert had in his letters only addressed henry as duke of lancaster vesp f vii f    n   dated   nov and f    n    this and another commission granted in the of the year were alike ineffectual  the malady of the monarch      and the disturbed condition of france prevented any exertion against the new english king though that power did not behold with indifference her ally richard ii hurled from the throne and the intrusion of a prudent and spirited usurper she excited scotland to revenge her quarrel by vexatious inroads   00 and early in the year henry summoned his council to consider the most effectual means of retorting vengeance rymer viii

horse rymer viii       june yet in march douglas herald had been sent by robert to propose an accommodation vesp f vii f    n    political knowledge must have been very confined in a country which permitted this constant mortification for if the necessary naval force could not be procured to constrain yet art and industry might have invited allegiance the earl of march enraged by a violent affront from the scottish government the circumstances of which will appear with more connection and advantage in a succeeding part of the narration was preparing to throw himself into the arms of england a country to which situation and interest had always too much attached his family the first letter of march to henry offering his allegiance is dated dunbar    feb vesp f vii f      some scottish ships under the command of sir robert logan were taken by the english this admiral had boasted that he would destroy the english fleets and especially that employed in fishing near aberdeen but the event was otherwise and the english ships ravaged some of the orkneys then held of the crown of norway by a scottish earl walls  0  the captors of logans vessels were of lynn per viros de lemnia  it is surprising that a country so well adapted for maritim power as scotland should have neglected that strong engine of defensive or offensive war a powerful navy while the kings of denmark and sweden whose resources were little superior had numerous fleets  henry iv at length determined by the most vigorous measures to render the commencement of his reign illustrious in the eye of his subjects and dreadful to his foes he resolved upon a personal invasion of scotland being the last to be performed by an english monarch it is asserted that his chief irritation to this project arose from some intercepted letters from the scottish governor the duke of albany to france in which henry was branded with the appellation of a preeminent traitor and an insult must wound deeply when sharpened by malice and truth bowar   0  the prudence of henry had sufficiently weighed the situations of scotland and of france before he ventured to try his new power in this expedition   june he summoned the whole military force of england to meet him at york    june and to save appearances with france he ordered protection to her ships and to those of all countries except scotland rymer viii             july arriving at newcastle he admitted march to his homage and fealty and granted a pension to his wife and heirs ibid      the proud usurper then fulminated a letter to the scottish king and another to the prelates and nobles commanding them to meet him at edinburgh by the twenty third day of august to pay homage to their lord paramount in these letters the whole fabulous claim of the first edward is revived and deducted with great faith from old locrinus rymer viii      a pitiful ballad which has reached our times seems to have been the only and proper answer of the scots to this demand it is preserved in the maitland ms pepysian lib cambridge and is called the ring reign of the roy robert from the first line it was written by a dean named david steel and is printed but incorrectly by watson in his collection of scottish poetry edin   0   vo part ii p iii  revenge for the insult which he had received from the scottish government must have incited henry to such an arrogant manifesto for his prudence is too firmly established to permit a belief that he entertained views of effectually subduing scotland  the english army entered that kingdom    aug while a powerful fleet coasted along with provisions an order to lynn for ships    july r   occurs vesp f vii f    n    after celebrating the ascension of the virgin at hadington henry marched to leith where he remained three days and made repeated assaults on the castle of edinburgh which was bravely defended by the duke of rothsay attended by the earl of douglas and many noblemen and gentlemen of the southern part of scotland mean time the duke of albany had collected a copious army and advanced to caldermoor in east lothian a singular intercourse took place between the english king and the dukes of rothsay and albany rothsay sent a message to the invader that his pretensions to the scottish crown might occasion the effusion of much christian blood which to prevent he was willing to settle the dispute by a combat of one two or three nobles against an equal number of the english henry parried this amiable sally of youthful vivacity by a piece of wit answering that he was surprised that rothsay who showed such aversion to shed christian blood should propose a combat of the nobles whose blood was certainly christian albany on his side sent a letter promising that if henry would keep his station for six days he should give him battle and either die in the field or force him to raise the siege the english monarch with his usual spirit gave his royal word that he should await the term mentioned and to testify his pleasure at the tidings he presented to the herald his upper garment and a chain of gold albany however did not fulfill his rhodomontade but kept aloof and left his nephew in imminent danger of death or captivity walsingham p  0  in very brief compare bowar   0 winton   0 rymer vii         but albanys message seems to rest with echard and abercromby ii     falsely quotes buchanan yet see here oct   0    henrys lenity and moderation during the whole of this expedition were remarkable and sufficiently contrast his character with that of richard ii whose outrage proclaims his weakness while this invasion showed that cruelty and destruction are seldom the companions of courage and wisdom to the towns villages monasteries and even fortresses which submitted he instantly sent a banner painted with his arms to be displayed as the fixed signal that none of his army should approach them and when two canons of holyroodhouse came into his presence at leith to request the preservation of their monastery he answered with great affability far be from my arms the disgrace of molesting any holy church and especially yours in which my father the duke of lancaster found a refuge i am myself half a scotishman being a common by maternal descent and i call god to witness that nothing but gross provocation could have brought me here as a foe but there are in your government people who write letters in a singular style and my intention is little to injure the country but to see if the writer dare to maintain his words by meeting in battle him whom he terms a traitor finding that albany declined an engagement and not thinking the castle of edinburgh an object worthy of longer delay or despairing of taking that fortress perhaps even unwilling to expose to the chance of destruction a place which had afforded an asylum to his father henry raised the siege and withdrew his army into england bowar   0 winton     mentions the destruction of the house of dalhousie as the sole ravage of henrys arms  it is not improbable at the same time that a failure of provision and the rumoured insurrection of owen glendour in wales afforded strong arguments for this retreat  but if it be difficult to account for the motives of henry what are we to think of those of albany upon this occasion at the head of a numerous army he was the idle spectator of a triumphant enemy in the heart of his country and beheld with indifference the danger of the heir apparent whose ransom must have cost the nation an immense sum the prudence of declining a battle with the force of england conducted by the monarch seems to have been fully established in scottish politics by the latter maxims of robert i and the modern axiom that battles are the issue of ignorance and that a weak general fights when he knows not what to do was apparently not unknown in former times so much may be offered in albanys vindication but the character of this man will soon develope all its blackness and the consistency of wicked ambition must force us to infer that to such a mind base motives must be the most effectual our ancient accounts ascribe albanys conduct to a previous enmity with rothsay bowar   0  and it is probable that this gallant youth conscious of his birth and expected royalty saw with impatience his father his king his country under such mean control apparently a coward certainly unknown in war albany might from baseness decline the combat with a bold and capable monarch and from yet greater baseness might have exulted to see in the capture or death of rothsay the security the prolongation of his regency  some events which preceded the english invasion have been reserved to this place in order to present a clear and connected account of internal transactions in scotland interesting and important in an eminent degree the kings infirmities increased with his age and the duke of albany must be regarded as the chief agent in affairs which from the monarchs residence on distant parental estates sometimes hardly reached the royal ear except by the voice of the nation it is to be regreted that the meagreness of our annals seldom permits a near acquaintance with historical characters till the reign of the first james suspended in the darkness of ignorance and the distance of time the portraits rarely appear distinct except when enlightened by the splendour of the diadem hence arises a barrenness in an interesting province of history the varied and strong delineation of character so necessary to form just and complete ideas of important events  the duke of rothsay had now attained his twenty second year and his mental features nearly resemble those of the prince of wales his contemporary that warm effervescence of vigorous youth which tamed by reason experience and time affords mature materials of a firm and spirited character had led him into some excesses especially of the amorous kind which afforded pretexts of constraint from his uncle the governor and of reproof from his royal parents a fondness for riotous pastime and arch roguery were also laid to the princes charge who to candid eyes sufficiently compensated these youthful and trivial defects by his good qualities endued with a comely person an honest heart an able head a most sweet and affable temper and even deeply tinctured with learning for that century his virtues and not his vices attracted the regents enmity bowar     the character of rothsay is chiefly from winton     our lord the king is eldest sone sueite and vertuose young and fair and his nerrest lauchful air honest abill and awenand our lord our prince in all plesand connand into literature a semely persoun in stature    robert iii only knew his own son from the malicious reports of albany but the queen annablella formerly famed for beauty and still for sense spirit and generosity was not the dupe of such practices and appears to have suggested the marriage of the prince as a proper and usual expedient to overcome his wildness by the sweetness of lawful love and domestic ties this project must have alarmed albany and he employed every resource of little cunning to defeat it while he did not dare a public opposition to bring the scheme into contempt to gratify his own avarice to sow dissentions and obstacles to procure delay and perhaps abandonment he held up the marriage of his prince to sale among the peers of scotland instead of demanding a foreign princess whose connexions might have aided her husband and have overturned the regents ambitious plans the earl of march a friend of albany was the highest bidder and having paid a large sum his daughter elizabeth was affianced to rothsay but at the instigation of the kings council the earl of douglas archibald the grim oftered a larger sum which was also received and the regent not daring to trifle with that illustrious family the prince actually married marjory the daughter of douglas at bothwell bowar       the only excuse oftered to march was that the consent of the three estates had not been procured to the marriage and as no meeting of parliament is mentioned it is to be presumed that in this rude age the kings council consisting of members clerical noble and common was regarded as representing the three estates when inconvenient to summon that formidable body nay the repayment of the sum advanced was refused or delayed and march burning with indignation procured a safe conduct from the king of england and retired to that country leaving his castle of dunbar in the custody of sir robert maitland the first letter of march to henry as above mentioned is dated dunbar    feb it states that he is greatly wronged by rothsay who espoused his daughter and though bound by his letter and seal is about to marry another the earl requests help as the kinsman of henry alice de beaumont being guddame grandmother of henry and marjory common her full sister guddame of march he offers his own allegiance and that of his vassals desires that lord furneval or westmoreland be sent to confer with him and a safe conduct for himself and  00 followers after apologizing for writing in english as he understands that speech better than latin or french he signs in french le count de la march descoce vesp f vii f    furneval was sent ib f    n   on the   th of march westmoreland was commissioned to enquire the determination of the scottish earl ib f    but the precise date of marchs retreat into england is not apparent though it seems that he remained in scotland till he met henry at newcastle on the   th of july see redpath      after the retreat of henry an army was raised to besiege that important fortress which if betrayed to the english might have afforded a dangerous post to the enemy and robert iii himself appeared as general but before he reached dunbar maitland was intimidated and yielded the castle to the son of douglas bowar      if the scottish king had no opportunity to show his martial talents he at least evinced his goodness and justice in this expedition after waiting at hadington three days till various reinforcements arrived the army prepared to march the trumpets sounded and the kings foot was in the stirrup to mount his horse when a poor butcher begged an audience the complaint was against an officer of the royal household who had not paid for the meats ordered the monarch heard the claim affably and patiently and sent for the officer who not being found he paid the sum himself he then ordered a proclamation at the market cross that all debts due by his attendants should be instantly demanded and paid and in future always observed this custom on leaving any place an useful example to his subjects in an age when different statutes were required to enforce a like practice in the nobles the people upon this occasion remembered with pleasure his similar conduct at his coronation when he ordered payment to the monastery of scone for the growing corn trodden under foot by the multitude bowar          such matters are often esteemed beneath the dignity of history but far be that pride which would prevent a good action to the meanest of mankind or its commemoration and if this historic dignity be inimical to amiable views of manners and to humanity it is rather an object of scorn than of admiration  though in november and december   0  some conferences between the english and scottish commissioners had been held only truces of a few weeks had been adjusted rymer viii          and the war soon resumed its depredations henrys demands were exorbitant as he had been irritated by roberts neglect and by being treated as an usurper the english monarch instructed his commissioners to require the homage of scotland if refused an annuity or lands were held out as temptations to robert should this pretension prove fruitless a marriage treaty beween their families was to be proposed or at least a truce of thirty years instructions vesp f vii f       n   written from intrinsic evidence after henrys return  all these terms were rendered nugatory by the scottish alliance with france  robert in vain demanded that march should be delivered up and that earl required the restitution of his estates with as little success henry iv knew from experience the value of a traitor and extended to march his friends and followers the warmest protection eager to wipe off the stain of his captivity henry percy joined march who was inflamed with revange and anxious to evince his importance by his services   feb and they entered scotland at the head of two thousand chosen men piercing by peebles to linton they assaulted without success the castle of hales burned three villages and encamped at preston but the son of the earl of douglas advancing from edinburgh against them with a body of his followers they made a precipitate retreat leaving their spoils and tents and prepared provisions the scots pursued them a whole dreary night of that season of the year and captured many at colbrandspath the rest escaping to berwick at the very gates of which town the lance and pennon of the lord thomas talbot were taken bowar      the heir of douglas a few months after wore the brilliant coronet of that house upon the death of his father archibald surnamed the grim a peer recommended to fame by his wisdom as much as by his hereditary valor bowar     these events have been dated   00 by our historians misled by bowars inattention to the commencement of the year but the preceding narrative and notes evince them to belong to   0  redpath     shows little acumen in not being able to solve so slender a perplexity  in   0  northumberland and his son demanded  000 marks form henry for an inroad vesp f vii f  0 probably this from this letter it also appears that they had  000 l a year for the wardenship of berwick and the east marches and   00 l for that of carlisle and the west on the   th june   0  the manor of clippeston was granted to march by the english king rymer viii  0      this year forms an epoch in the history of scottish legislation the more important as after the various laws of robert ii no further intelligence arises till the luminous period commences with the statutes of james i  the ordinances passed in a parliament held at scone are    feb numerous these laws are published by skene in his collection known by the name of regiam majestatem from the first words of a treatise prefixed they were extant in the register in his time as he mentions in his tract de verborum significatione and their authenticity is unquestioned see also ms harley   00 the date is accurately marked in that ms and by skene  many concern private property then in an obscure and precarious condition under the feudal oppression and rapacity of the great but the following chiefly deserve historical commemoration it was decreed that the kings lieutenant general the earl of fife and other royal ministers should hear the causes of churchmen widows orphans and minors without taking sureties and judge without delay that during the papal schism any excommunicated person might appeal to the conservator of the church and afterward to the general congregation of the clergy that the duel should only be permitted in four cases the crime must infer death it must be secretly designed or perpetrated the suspicions must bear verisimilitude and the truth was not to be discovered by witnesses or writings among the causes why gifts are revocable are classed the arts of monks in persuading the laity to donations usury or interest is not to be allowed against a minor who is only to pay the principal as a check on the sheriffs their clerks are to be appointed by the king and only amenable to him to prevent any connivance in injustice the justiciary courts are to be held twice in the year on either side of the forth the coroner is empowered to arrest persons indicted the lords of regalities sheriffs and barons are to hold their journies of justice twice in the year and abbreviate the terms of appearance the kings justiciary may remove sheriffs or other royal officers in case of default till the fitting of the next parliament which is to judge the cause a singular statute confounding the legislative and executive powers to prevent the great and horrible ravages depredations fires and homicides which are daily committed in every part of the kingdom it is ordained that all the sheriffs in the realm make public proclamations that no person traveling shall be allowed more attendants than those whose maintenance he defrays ravagers depredators incendiaries robbers murderers are to be punished by death and confiscation the sheriff shall arrest malefactors and take bail for their appearance at the next journey of justice or circuit their nonappearance infers rebellion and forfeiture of the bail if no bail be found they are at once to be tried by an assize and if found guilty forfeit their lives if they flee from one sheriffdom to another the first sheriff is to send a precept to the second for their deliverance to trial a similar procedure is to be used to lords and officers of regalities and all lieges are to assist among the more minute statutes may be named that allowing the lieges to purchase victuals where they please on paying the customs that against burning the heath of moors in summer or autumn when the corn might be damaged those against the killing of salmon or hares at prohibited seasons that which orders farmers who rent lands for a term not to alienate the lease for a term exceeding the agreement these laws like the ruins of an ancient hall of justice inspire reverence from their pristine majesty and utility and will interest the philosophic reader as relics of the progress of society and of the history of man  the effects of marchs vengeance have already been narrated but a scene of a blacker and more deplorable kind is now to open in the murder of the duke of rothsay the power and sense of the queen the gravity of trail bishop of st andrews a chief promoter of concord the valor and wisdom of the first archibald earl of douglas had balanced the ambition of albany but these three supporters of the monarchy died within a short period the fourth pestilence which had ravaged scotland appeared in   0  but it appears not that any of these great persons fell a victim to it winton      and the governors passions had no longer any control save from rothsays merit and just pretensions archibald the second earl of douglas of that name born to adorn that family by his valor but to disgrace it by his conduct was married to the elder daughter of robert iii as his father had espoused a daughter of the preceding king thus doubly connected with the royal family he seems to have regarded rothsay who had wedded his sister not with fraternal affection but with the malevolent eyes of a rival in ambition joined in strict friendship with albany and his second son john afterward earl of buchan and misled by their offers or by a pique at rothsay he shared their detestable schemes   0  the young prince had been married about two years but had no children and perhaps hating the wife forced upon him by his uncles avarice he pursued his former courses albany on pretense of restraining his wildness had set a band of his partisans to watch his conduct and now that the occasion opened the regent gave the hint and this band represented to the king that his son would no longer bear counsel nor restraint indeed this impudent plan of albany this council of guardians appointed to watch a man of sense and spirit and that man the heir of royalty was a certain mode to irritate and inflame youthful passions but never could tend to moderate their influence the decrepit and infirm monarch was as usual distant from the public scene and guided by those around him among whom was now unhappily one ramorgny a knight who had formerly suggested to rothsay the assassination of albany but the generous nature of the prince had rejected the proposal with horror and indignation a successful criminal may be honored but a crime offered and refused exposes the character to certain hatred and contempt and it is not matter of wonder that ramorgny became in his turn the bitter enemy of rothsay at his suggestion which may be construed that of albany robert sent a written order to the regent to arrest his son and confine him for a short time in order to subdue his stubborn spirit forgetful of the certain disgrace which the confinement of the heir apparent must entail on his reign perhaps on the future forgetful of the stain on the succession and danger of consequent disaffection in the subjects forgetful how short a path leads a prince from the prison to the grave  the royal mandate was born by ramorgny and by another enemy of rothsay sir william lindsay whose sister euphemia had also been affianced to the prince and rejected bowar      from these circumstances it may be perceived that the scheme was laid and conducted with all the deep and dark art of consummate villainy albany receiving the order with joy resolved on its immediate enforcement and that the bearers should be the executors privacy was necessary and rothsay was inveigled into fife upon pretense that he should take possession for the king of the castle of st andrews till the appointment of another bishop when the unsuspecting prince was riding with a small attendance between nydie and straburn near st andrews he was seized and held a prisoner in the castle till the governor and his council assembled at culros should determine the place of his confinement the tower of falkland was named and thither albany and douglas with a strong band of followers conducted the prince seated on a laboring horse and covered with a russet cloak to defend him from the falling rain here under the custody of john selkirk and john wright two assassins employed by albany the most cruel of deaths easter    mar that of famine awaited the heir of the monarchy and he was buried in a private manner at lindoris distant from the tombs of the scottish kings or those of his family the conspirators not daring by a funereal pomp to awaken the attention and detection of the people bowar         winton     writing in fife the earldom of albany and under his regency conceals all the circumstances and only mentions the death and burial of david buchanan x  0 says a woman supplied the unfortunate prince with thin cakes of barley while another gave him milk from her breasts but they were detected and removed the tale seems from boyce f v   0 who adds that the prince devoured his own fingers in famine and despair   a great security to crimes arises from the good nature of honesty which believes their commission impossible and as albany had conducted his horrible plot with great skill and gave out that his nephew had unexpectedly died of a dysentery and for the imprisonment there was the kings positive mandate it is no wonder that the nation was beguiled to secure and to continue his regency it was however proper that every doubt should be cleared    may and a parliament was called and met at edinburgh an assembly which the long government of albany had sufficiently taught him how to choose and influence in a mock examination albany and douglas confessed the imprisonment but imputed the death to divine providence a remission was however thought necessary and was given by the infirm sovereign in terms as ample  0 may as if they had murdered the heir apparent in this pardon which is extant the confinement of the prince is ascribed to the cause of public utility but the immediate motives of the perpetrators are expressly said to be concealed for a sufficient reason this curious paper is preserved in the  to register often quoted f v    whence it was published by sir david dalrymple remarks p      does this singular declaration refer to the kings mandate which might in the vulgar eye have appeared a consent to the death of his son or to some crime falsely imputed to rothsay by the conspirators as for example a design to murder his father or uncle this is dark but it is certain that folly and wickedness are companions and that the means used by albany to clear his character are precisely those which fully establish his guilt  to divert the public attention it was resolved to continue the war with england which had been interrupted by a short truce and some negotiations for peace in vesp f vii f     is a letter from douglas to henry dated edybredschellis   feb and signed le conte de douglas seigneur de galway et de dunbar and henrys answer    feb occurs f    from these letters it appears that on the   th may   0  see in rymer viii   0 a truce of   th april   0  douglas and northumberland had met at camelspath and agreed to a truce of a year to martinmas   0  douglas complains that northumberland does not observe the treaty henry in return blames douglas for burning bamborough yet promises to send commissioners the transactions of the various years the title of dunbar etc show these letters to have been written in   0  yet on the  0th sept r    0  henry had issued instructions to demand homage of scotland admitting however that if there were no evidence the claims ought to be abandoned and a treaty of thirty years proposed england retaining berwick roxburgh and jedburgh vesp f vii f       a fair pretext arose from the incursions of march and his adherents that earl and his son being pensioned by the english king for the maintenance of a small body of troops during the scottish hostilities by the advice and support of the young earl of douglas then resident at dunbar the chief landholders of lothian agreed to conduct separate expeditions into england because the people of the merse favored the exiled earl and did not exert their usual inroads the leader of the first incursion was john haliburton of dirlton who advanced a considerable way into the inimical country carrying fire and ravage in his progress and returned with success and spoil but the second conducted by patrick hepburn of hales met with a different fate for having advanced too far into england and remained too long the earl of march found time to unite the power of northumberland with his own and to intercept hepburn and his followers in their return    june at westnisbet in the merse three miles south of duns an obstinate conflict ensued rather favorable to the scots till the son of march arrived with a fresh reinforcement when victory declared for the english the scottish leader was slain with several other gentlemen and the flower of the youth of lothian many were mortally wounded and john and thomas haliburtons john and william cockburns lauder of bass and many others remained captives bowar         the spot was afterward called slaughter hill hume dougl i     an original letter from henry to his council dated hareburgh  0 june is extant vesp f vii f    he informs them that the son of march with  00 soldiers of berwick had defeated  00 scots and among   0 taken and slain are john haliburton and three other knights captives while sir patrick hepburn fell he adds that   000 scots had ravaged the country around carlisle and intended another invasion so the necessary directions for defense must be issued northumberland and his son appear from this letter to have been high in henrys favor   douglas stung with regret for the loss of his brave friends and countrymen and inflamed with rage against march his particular enemy immediately applied to albany for a body of troops to be added to his own power upon an expedition into england the governor consented and dispatched a considerable force under murdac his eldest son the earls of angus and moray also joined douglas who entered england with an army of ten thousand men carrying terror and devastation to the walls of newcastle henry iv was now engaged in the welsh war against owen glendour but the earl of northumberland and his son the hotspur percy with the earl of march collected a numerous array and awaited the return of the scots impeded with spoil near milfield in the northern part of northumberland douglas had reached wooler in his return and perceiving the enemy seized a strong post between the two armies called homildon hill in this method he rivalled his predecessor at the battle of otterburn    sept but not with like success the english advanced to the assault and henry percy was about to lead them up the hill when march caught his bridle and advised him to advance no further but to pour the dreadful shower of english arrows into the enemy this advice was followed with the usual fortune for in all ages the bow was the english instrument of victory and though the scots and perhaps the french were superior in the use of the spear yet this weapon was useless after the distant bow had decided the combat robert the great sensible of this at the battle of banocburn ordered a prepared detachment of cavalry to rush among the english archers at the commencement totally to disperse them and stop the deadly effusion but douglas now used no such precaution and the consequence was that his people drawn up on the face of a hill presented one general mark to the enemy none of whose arrows descended in vain the scots fell without sight and unrevenged till a spirited knight swinton exclaimed aloud o my brave countrymen what fascination has seized you today that you stand like deer to be shot instead of indulging your ancient courage and meeting your enemies hand to hand let those who will descend with me that we may gain victory or life or fall like men this being heard by adam gordon between whom and swinton there existed an ancient and deadly feud attended with the mutual slaughter of many followers he instantly fell on his knees before swinton begged his pardon and desired to be dubbed a knight by him whom he must now regard as the wisest and boldest of that order in britain the ceremony performed swinton and gordon descended the hill accompanied only by one hundred men and a desperate valor led the whole body to death had a similar spirit been shown by the scottish army it is probable that the event of the day would have been different douglas who was certainly deficient in the most important qualities of a general seeing his army begin to disperse at length attempted to descend the hill but the english archers retiring a little sent a flight of arrows so sharp and strong that no armor could withstand and the scottish leader himself whose panoply was of remarkable temper fell under five wounds though not mortal the english men of arms knights of squires did not strike one blow but remained spectators of the rout which was now complete great numbers of the scots were slain and near five hundred perished in the river tweed upon their flight among the illustrious captives were douglas whose chief wound deprived him of an eye murdac son of albany the earls of moray and angus and about twenty four gentlemen of eminent rank and power the chief slain were swinton gordon livingston of calendar ramsay of dalhousie walter sinclair roger gordon walter scot and others such was the issue of the unfortunate battle of homildon bowar          winton          walls  0   0  otterburn     walsingham gives a strange idea of the force of the english arrows ut ipsos

bright beam of victory shone on saint georges cross bishop percy who inspected the spot informed the author that there is a sudden scar or little precipice on the side of the hill which the scots descended and which being unperceived by them contributed much to their confusion and rout the anonymous historian of le laboureur says i     that percy had only   00 cavalry and  000 archers pierre des essars a french knight was taken for whose ransom and that of douglas a benevolence was raised in france see also des ursins p         henry percy disgraced the victory by an act of cruelty among the captives was sir william stuart of forest and percy insisted that he being a native of tividale when under the english power should be regarded as a traitor stuart a man of wisdom and eloquence defended himself so well that he was acquitted by three successive juries but the malice of percy led him to appoint a new jury of his followers and stuart was drawn and quartered amidst the murmurs of the english who knew that his merit was the only cause of his death bowar     winton     who adds that a squire named thomas ker was tried with stuart for the same alleged offense and condemned in the same illegal way their quarters were exposed on the gates of york an atrocity soon retaliated on percy himself as winton observes p       henry iv on receiving intelligence of the battle of homildon desired the percies not to ransom nor deliver their prisoners without his consent and to palliate this apparently harsh mandate he generously granted the earldom of douglas with eskdale lidsdale lauderdale the lordship of selkirk forest of ettrick county of tividale and all the other appendages of that high house to the earl of northumberland who smiled at this liberal gift of a country neither conquered nor likely to be an object of easy seizure rymer viii          but the percies resolved to take the king in his own snare and to make this conquest the pretended object of arms instantly to be turned against the granter meantime murdac the regents son sometimes termed earl of fife and some other prisoners were sent to henry  0 oct and were presented in full parliament sir adam forester one of these captives made a speech before that great audience which would have been wiser if better timed representing the advantages of solid and durable peace between the nations but henry checked the oration because forester had formerly deceived him concerning albanys intentions to fight at the siege of edinburgh castle parl hist ii       london         vols  vo  the heir of albany was freed upon his word of honor not to withdraw from england the inferior prisoners were committed to an easy confinement the earl of march requested the parliament that he might be restored to his lands in proportion as subdued by the english and that such of his people as chose to observe allegiance to england should be received all which was willingly granted but it was insisted that his people should take an oath of fidelity the commons recommended him to the king walls       an incident occurred   0  which contributes to paint the features of the times and of the government sir malcom drummond brother of the late queen had been married for some years to isabella in her own right countess of mar he was suddenly surprised in his castle by a band of ruffians and imprisoned till he died of his hard captivity in the next year a decent term having expired alexander stuart natural son of alexander the deceased earl of buchan brother of albany forced the countess to wed him and as he was a noted leader of the highland freebooters there is no room to doubt that he had been the murderer of her husband in order to attain this wealthy marriage these unworthy deeds were sanctioned by the government the kings name being boldly set by the regent to a charter confirming the earldom to a lawless intruder winton         sir d dalrymple sutherland case chapter v p

kings family and connexions  the earl of northumberland and his son were now intent upon open rebellion against henry iv and to color the raising of their troops and gain time for adding fresh musters it was resolved to make a short incursion into scotland on pretense of rendering effectual the grant of the earldom of douglas accordingly henry percy and the earl of march proceeding with a considerable force besieged coklawis a strong tower in tividale on the confines of the merse bowar     it was in or near the site of the present ormiston about three miles to the south of kelso in a letter to the english council newcastle  0 may vesp f vii f    northumberland mentions that he and his son have indentures and hostages for the surrender of ormiston castle in scotland on the  st of august if not delivered by battle and he requires money for his services in a letter to henry    june ib f    the earl demands money as he had received none though it was maliciously reported that  0000 l had passed into his hands since the kings coronation he assures his magestee royalle that he shall be at ormiston on the day appointed the letters are in french  june but found so obstinate a defense that both parties being fatigued it was agreed between percy and greenlaw the captain that if no aid were sent by the scottish king or governor the fortress should surrender on the first of august being six weeks from the date of the convention gladstane the proprietor of coklawis who had remained concealed in the place soon hastened to the king who referred him to the governor albany assembling a council of prelates and nobles at falkland laid the affair before them and they knowing him little inclined to war pretended that it was better to give up that paltry turret than encounter further danger from england when the scots were weakened and disheartened by the late defeat upon which to their surprise the regent who apparently had intelligence of the commotion raised by the percies and that the north of england was incapable either of offense or defense started up and exclaimed i vow to god and st fillan that i shall prevent the appointed day although none should attend me save that youth my groom pointing to peter de kinbuk then holding his horse at a distance the council effectually duped and astonished by the governors new spirit answered with tears of joy may god confirm his work in you and by his aid we engage that our help shall not be deficient albany was soon at the head of a numerous army consisting according to our ancient accounts of not less than fifty thousand rude cavalry and as many infantry with some loss he took the fort of inwerwick in lothian the situation of this place is compared to baiae in the description of lothian blaeus atlas  which had been seized by the english after the destruction of the flower of lothian at homildon and was approaching coklawis when a messenger brought him tidings that percy was defeated and slain at shrewsbury upon this the governor encamped his wide battalions around coklawis and ordered a herald to proclaim the joyful intelligence then dismissed his army and returned as in triumph

regaining jedburgh roxburgh or berwick or otherwise assailing the north of england in its weak and disaffected state and avenging the affronts and the losses of his country the people of scotland were then almost unknown in their own government but the patience of the nobles and gentlemen under this long and disgraceful regency yet further to be lengthened and disgraced can only be accounted for by inferring that albany shared with them the spoils of the king and of the people and thus indulged to the utmost the natural spirit of aristocracy  an impostor appearing in scotland   0  under the name of richard ii winton       0 quoted under      walls      the policy of henry iv perceived that dangerous commotions might arise from this pretext and his desires of peace were increased he wished to include the scots in the long truce formerly ratified with france but not succeeding used other pacific negotiations and robert iii on his side appointed commissioners to treat for the ransom of

a secure retreat for the heir of the kingdom from the brutal force or dark art of albany bowar      the polished education to be received in that celebrated country afforded a fair pretense for this plan and the regent seems not to have opposed it hoping perhaps somewhat from accident divining the unpopularity of a foreign education nor regreting to unite the public attention by being the nearest heir of the monarchy left in scotland henry sinclair earl of orkney was appointed chief attendant of the prince in this voyage and a ship was ordered to the isle of bass in the firth of forth to receive the important charge david fleming of cumbernald a relation of the king and several chief gentlemen of lothian conducted the prince and saw him safe on board on their return they were pursued by james douglas uncle of the earl and a conflict followed at hermanston moor    feb in which fleming and many others fell bowar     winton      walsingham         informs us that fleming was slain in revenge for his advice to northumberland to escape into wales as the scottish nobles intended to have delivered him up in exchange for one or two of the peers captured at homildon if so this event must have happened in   0  the gross errors of chronology in bowar winton and even our later historians occasion perpetual difficulties that robert iii died on the  th of april   0  is evinced beyond all doubt by the learned ruddiman in his notes on buchanan p     who at the same time expresses his opinion that the prince was captured in   0  as bowars inconsistent account bears that the capture happened on the  0th march and that the father died of grief on the   th march while winton expressly dates these events in the years   0  and   0  it is clear from our historians and walsingham that the earl of orkney accompanied the prince and he was a captive in england in aug   0  when his brothers were permitted to visit england as may be inferred from rymer viii   0 on the   th sept   0  a safe conduct was granted to orkney then a prisoner to visit scotland his brothers apparently hostages rymer viii     yet it is singular that no mention of the prince occurs in any writing of that year john son of henry says in a letter to his father vesp f vii f    n   that orkney had joined northumberland and bardolf at berwick the letter is dated durham   june in all appearance   0  yet bowar and winton agree that orkney and the prince were captured in march or april the same writers concur that fleming was slain on his return from accompanying the prince on shipboard yet walsingham seems rightly to place the slaughter in   0  he is however mistaken in dating the capture   0  as appears from the passports to orkney when the materials are so complex and discordant the candor of the reader must be requested   the prince had only proceeded as far as flamborough head when he was intercepted by a ship belonging to cley in norfolk and the scottish vessel being small and unarmed was taken without defense  0 mar the royal captive and his attendants were immediately sent to the english king who faid with sarcastic joy had the scots been grateful they ought to have sent this youth

extinguished the flame some of the earls confederates were seized and executed while he himself fled into scotland june accompanied by his infant grandson and by lord bardolf walls         bowar     original letters of henry on this rebellion may be found in vesp f vii   the scots availed themselves of the confusion to manifest their sense of henrys injustice some joined northumberland at berwick

earl of northumberland two years before to negotiate a truce with scotland till the following easter rymer viii  0   upon the retreat of northumberland into their country the scots gave the town of berwick to theflames but the castle which was held for the rebel earl soon after surrendered to the english king otterburn     says that the scots burned all the town except the churches and monasteries it is suspected that it was on this occasion that a spirited letter was written by james douglas second son of the earl bowar     to the english king who complained that the followers of that nobleman had in the time of truce burned berwick and some places in england douglas answers that the english had killed many scots and taken some scottish ships that they had ravaged arran and

countenance amiable temperance affability eloquence real generosity apparent benignity a degree of cool prudence bordering upon wisdom may be reckoned among his virtues but the shades of his vices are deeper an insatiate ambition unrelenting cruelty and its attendant cowardice or at least an absolute defect of military fame a contempt of the best human affections a long practice in all the dark paths of art and dissimulation his administration he studied to recommend not by promoting the public good but by sharing the spoils of the monarchy with the nobles by a patient connivance at their enormities by a dazzling pomp of expenditure in the pleasures of the feast and in the conciliation of munificence as fortune preserved his government from any signal unsuccess so it would be an abuse of terms to bestow upon a wary management which only regarded his own interest the praise of political wisdom for the character of robert duke of albany compare bowar p     convivus quotidianus vir

the conquest and grant of his estates   0  by the english monarch was not indisposed to return to his own country and the regent and the nobles of scotland knew from experience that his enmity and his friendship were not unimportant a new government having taken place albany could now throw the blame of the injuries offered to this nobleman upon the late king and an accommodation was effected from the liberality of henry iv march had acquired some estates in england which served to indemnify his loss and douglas restored his scottish domains upon condition however of retaining the lordship of annandale and its castle of lochmaben bowar       a scene it is believed before unknown in scotland disgraces the annals of this year james resby an english priest of the school of wickliffe was condemned for heresy by a clerical council presided by lawrence lindoris an inquisitor and delivered to the secular arm and to the flames at perth the articles of his heresy amounted to about forty and the first and chief was that the pope is not the vicar of christ bowar           winton particularly praises albany for his aversion to lollards and to heresy and for his devotion to the catholic church and from this incident the reputation appears to have been well founded but it did little honor to his government to institute the first example to his country of fanatic cruelty though much of the blame must rest upon priestly persecution upon the examples of other countries and the spirit of the times the sacred light of philosophy which establishes absolute right of conscience and unlimited scope of opinion was yet far from its dawn and the barbarism of the age thought to honor religion by crime and the deity by the destruction of man  the truces   0  which had extended from the commencement of the regency to this time having expired without renewal some of the commons of tividale a people hardened by their limitory situation and constant exposure to war assaulted and

from different letters vesp f vii p    etc  the walls were so hardly cemented together that much labor was required to destroy them as was resolved in order to prevent the foe from regaining so firm a hold and it was agitated in a parliament held at perth that a tax of two pennies upon every hearth should be raised for this purpose but the regent anxious for popularity opposed this resolution saying that during his regency no tax had ever been levied nor should he now begin to merit by that abuse the malediction of the poor and he accordingly ordered the expense to be defrayed out of the royal customs bowar      one of the inconsistencies of human affairs is that a power irregularly or criminally acquired is often exerted in a manner far more excellent than the just tenor of authority for the latter rests upon an indispensable claim while the former requires support from the affections of the people  to revenge the loss of jedburgh    0 robert umfraville of the english family which claimed the title of angus entered the forth with ten ships and took fourteen vessels laden with drapery and grain and afterward ravaged various parts of the scottish coast the supply of corn which he brought on his return was so seasonable to england then afflicted with a scarcity that he was honored with the vulgar appellation of robert mendmarket harding c  0   but it is uncertain whether the corn captured in the forth was an import into or an export from scotland nor were the scots deficient in successful hostility for patrick dunbar the son of march took by stratagem the fortress of fastcastle on the northern shore of the merse which had been for a short time in the english power bowar       although henry iv was irritated by the loss of jedburgh and meditated a blow against the

rymer viii      as henrys title to his crown was not so good as albanys to the scottish and a considerable similarity occurs in the progress of their ambition it is no wonder that such expressions seemed to imply pride or reproach  but the most important event during this regency now arises in the rebellion      as it was termed of the lord of the isles the subject of dispute was the earldom of ross a title of uncertain creation but which at least ascends to the twelfth century the ancient line failed in euphemia ross wedded to walter lesley whose issue were alexander earl of ross and a daughter espoused to donald lord of the isles euphemia upon lesleys death married alexander earl of buchan son of robert ii alexander earl of ross had by his wife a daughter of albany an only child also named euphemia who became a nun probably by the instigation of her mothers family and with the intention of resigning the dignity to john earl of buchan second son of the regent when she came of age but the resignation was not executed till four years after this period sir d dalrymple sutherland case chapter v sect   from many records there quoted  as euphemia by entering into a nunnery was regarded as dead in law donald lord of the isles resolved to defeat the machinations of the family of albany by an immediate seizure of the earldom which included the island of sky and lay contiguous to his dominions not contented with this acquisition to show his scorn of the regent and recommend his alliance to the english king donald raised an army of ten thousand men of the hebudes and of ross and advanced as far as mar in his desolating inroad intending to sack aberdeen and ravage the country even down to the tay bowar       to stop his destructive career alexander stuart earl of mar and ogilby sheriff of angus hastily collected some troops from buchan mar garioch angus and merns and met the invader at harlaw    july about ten miles northwest of aberdeen mars army was inferior in number and the battle was obstinate and fierce but indecisive on the side of donald the chiefs of maclean and macintosh fell with about nine hundred and mar lost five hundred men among whom were some of rank as scrymger constable of dundee george ogilby heir of the family and most of the gentlemen of buchan ibid     contemporary poem the battle of harlaw mar appears to have married the heiress of doffle in brabant and returned to scotland in   0  he lived till      stewarts genesis      the lord of the isles was however so much weakened that he was forced to retire and the regent immediately collecting an army marched to the castle of dingwall in ross which he took and garrisoned toward the end of autumn next summer albany set three armies on foot to invade donalds territories who was obliged to abandon his pretensions to ross to make a personal submission and give oaths and hostages for indemnification and future observance of peace bowar      as the interests of the regent were concerned the motives of his conduct deserve no applause but the conduct itself was in this instance spirited and political for it might have proved dangerous to have permitted a large and contiguous accession of territory to an independent chief the ally of england  meantime it appears not that henry iv made any exertion to assist his ally a greater field having opened to his ambition in the affairs of france the long dissensions of which kingdom had now ripened into civil war henry prepared the future conquests of his son by engaging in the party of burgundy to whom he this year sent a supply of troops and it became an object of his prudence to prevent any disturbance of his designs by terminating hostilities with scotland the publication of a remarkable papal bull given by urban v in      but not openly current till now also contributed to this end abercr ii   0  in this pontifical mandate it is forbidden under pain of excommunication and interdiction to all persons ecclesiastical or secular of whatever rank to form any leagues against the government of scotland or to enter that kingdom hostilely or make any depredations in it or even to protect or assist any who shall infringe this prohibition to the terrors of excommunication other penalties are added and infamy degradation incapacity of any places of honor or trust are held out to the violators and if kings their subjects are absolved from their allegiance this last threat may have had some influence with henry whose title little required any additional shock urban v was a frenchman and warm in the interests of his country struggling at the period of this bull with edward iii the origin of this fulmination is therefore easily explained and it appears to have lain dormant at first from a discovery of the friendly dispositions of david ii toward england and afterward neglected and forgotten to have been revived by accident at the present epoch  various negotiations for a truce between england and scotland occupied this and the following year and occasioned a suspension of arms nevertheless douglas of drumlanrig and gawin dunbar broke down the bridge of roxburgh and set fire to the town bowar      but neither this insult nor the loss of jedburgh could divert the english king from his attention to france and the earl of douglas finding no employment for his martial spirit in his own country resolved to bear a part in the french deeds of arms thrice says a monastic historian he was repelled by contrary winds till by the advice of the earl of orkney his companion in the voyage he visited the isle of st colm in the firth of forth and addressed his supplications to the tutelary saint columba then he sailed to flanders and by the saints assistance soon returned ibid the period

earl of northumberland son of hotspur who had been left in scotland by his grandfather when he retired into wales that he was detained as a captive after the seizure of the scottish prince can hardly be imputed to injustice but he was liberally educated at st andrews by the bishop and met with such honorable hospitality that grateful impressions alone filled his mind before henry proceeded to france this exchange had been determined but was postponed on account of the ungenerous flight of murdac who was however taken and the captor liberally rewarded rymer ix   0  the anxiety of the regent

suspecting the numbers of the foe and only seeing the ineffectual expedition treated this attempt of albany with great derision  the council of constance having set a laudable example in the deposition of benedict xiii and in asserting the superiority of councils over the popes after securing the consent of the other catholic kingdoms at last sent an envoy to scotland for that purpose a parliament being summoned to perth the abbot of pontiniac produced letters from the council and from the emperor sigismund and the case was examined benedict applied to the regent who rather favored his cause and appointed robert harding an englishman to defend it who was so unfortunate as to fall into heretical propositions in the attempt and the university of st andrews and most of the clergy supporting martin v the new pope chosen by the council it was resolved that scotland should follow the example of the other catholic states bowar            the fortress of work was taken by william

all the northern parts of france and the dauphin was left almost destitute of friends or resources in this necessity he sent an embassy to the scottish regent requiring assistance in conformity with long existing treaties and a parliament being held it was resolved to comply with the dauphins demand in consequence albany sent his second son john stuart earl of buchan with a chosen army of seven thousand men among whom were some nobles and many knights and esquires and upon their arrival in france the dauphin immediately united them with his little army then about to attempt the reduction of

thirteenth year of his sole regency after a life of upwards of eighty years to his high office his son murdac succeeded a man of a very different character indolent and remiss even to weakness and not capable of paternal far less of princely authority bowar          but the circumstances of the times maintained him in his difficult station for four years at the end of which james assumed the scepter of his fathers  few incidents worth notice arise during the short regency of murdac except the transactions of the scots in france a new scene but which more properly belongs to the french history however at the end of this book a brief account shall be exhibited of these deeds of arms which reflected no small credit upon scottish valor  the earl of douglas    0 entering england with a considerable force took the town of alnwick and burned it to the ground bowar   0  in the next year henry v proceeded to york and invited douglas to a conference in which he found means to engage the

treasonable treaty are not sufficiently apparent but it seems that the weakness of the scottish government concurred with the english gold to instigate this irregular conduct  to add to the domestic calamities of scotland under the feeble regency of murdac that country was afflicted with a new and wide malady proceeding from irregular seasons this was a contagious fever and dysentery in which many of all ranks perished among the persons of note were henry sinclair earl of orkney james douglas lord of dalkeith and george dunbar earl of march a nobleman most fortunate in war the side upon

prospect to james of his deliverance from a lengthened captivity         aug   the duke of bedford being appointed protector of england justly considered it as a superior policy to form an alliance with the scottish king and deliver him upon ransom james was accordingly permitted to send for commissioners from scotland to confer at pomfret with those of england        july whose instructions were sufficiently moderate they were to demand forty thousand pounds as a recompense for the maintenance of james while he resided in england the name of ransom being unjust and invidious for a prince not taken in war nor by his tender age capable of arms they were to take hostages for the payment in proportions of two thousand pounds a year to offer perpetual peace or if rejected a long truce to obtain an agreement that no more scots should proceed to france and that those already there be recalled artfully to induce the scots to demand an english lady in marriage for the king and lastly to

also assigned to mar on such foundations stood the power of the regents  his own sons instead of being awed by the important office of their father seemed to share his dignity for the sake of license and to regard his authority as a protection for their vices there is a tradition the simplicity of which seems to speak its truth that the regent had a favorite falcon which his son walter had often requested unsuccessfully and at last vexed with repeated refusal he tore it from his fathers hand and twisted its neck upon which murdac mildly exclaimed since you pay me so little respect i must invite him whom both must obey boyce f v     in oct      murdac swore to the observance of the alliance with france du tillet f       but whether the regents consent proceeded from his wishes or from his weakness and want of influence and ability to withstand the national desire it is certain that the scottish commissioners acted with sincerity the conclusive treaty only bears that forty thousand pounds should be paid for the maintenance of james within six years by halfyearly payments that hostages should be given and that the scottish regent should send ambassadors empowered to close the marriage of james with an english lady of rank the last clause must refer to the consent of parliament necessary to effect the espousal and adjust the dower and a space of time being required to accomplish these affairs the month of march in the approaching year was fixed for the final arrangement the scottish commissioners afterward proceeded to london and came under solemn engagements to fulfill the agreement and among other articles undertook to procure four obligations from the burghs of edinburgh perth dundee and aberdeen for the whole money to be paid rymer x      0  henry v only

sovereign   april and james amid the acclamations of the people entered at last his own realm bowar      but before proceeding to his memorable and spirited reign it will be proper briefly to review the deeds and fate of the scots in france  the year after the arrival of the scottish auxiliaries we find henry v using the company of james his captive as a mean of preventing the hostilities of his subjects but without effect for they continued to serve the dauphin justly regarding their sovereigns will as ineffectual while under constraint the first important action in which the scots appear is the battle of bauge so called from a village in anjou twenty two miles to the east of angers the dauphin had appointed the scots led by the earls of buchan and wigton and stuart of darnley to guard that province against the duke of clarence whom henry v had detached for its reduction on the twenty second day of march      the english when foraging took four scots and brought them to clarence who thus learned that the scottish army and a few french lay at bauge the duke instantly sprung from the table exclaiming let us attack them they are ours but let none follow save the men at arms and after a quick march he came to little bauge where a few french defended the church and gained time for buchan to arrange his troops the english aware of this left the church untaken and advanced but to a complete defeat clarence distinguished by a coronet of gold and jewels upon his helmet was the first slain and a similar fate awaited the earl of kent the lords gray and ross and above fourteen hundred men at arms the earls of huntingdon and somerset and many others of note were made captives to reward the earl of buchan who had slain clarence with his own hand the dauphin gave him the high distinction of constable of france des ursins     st remy at the end of the anonymous historian of le laboureur p     history by berry ascribed to alain chartier p    monstrelet c     bowar       0

scots on hearing the tidings the pontiff martin v said ludicrously in truth the scots are the only antidote of the english     in the following year the constable took avranches in normandy and probably learning the agreement which his fatherinlaw the earl of douglas had made with henry v he resolved to detach him from the english interest for which purpose he visited scotland empowered to offer the earl the duchy of touraine and douglas consented to bring five thousand men into france the dauphin now charles vii rewarded stuart of darnley with the lordship of aubigny in berry and the family and title were to become not a little illustrious the death of henry v had checked the english exertions and buchan and douglas were only ordered to defend the loire and prevent the foe from

against salisbury but aubigny laid siege to crevan and sent for cannon which were refused as he neglected his orders salisbury advanced to raise the siege and an action ensued in which the scots were defeated stuart of darnley and aubigny constable of the scottish army was taken prisoner and soon after exchanged for the marshal of burgundy sir william hamilton and about nine hundred were left on

at this place this was the memorable battle of verneuil in normandy fought on the seventeenth of august      the archbishop of rheims had been sent ambassador to scotland to procure a reinforcement which landed in bretagne and douglas now duke of touraine advanced to raise the siege of yvry undertaken by the english but the french king learning that a battle must be risqued before the place was relieved assembled all his troops and leaving tours with buchan the constable he met his barons at chateaudun and advanced to verneuil bedford upon this raised the siege of yvry and marched to meet the french and scots arriving near verneuil he sent a herald to douglas who had in derision called him john with the leaden sword informing him that he had come to drink with him and that he would wait till he had that honor the duke of touraine answered that he was most welcome that he had come from scotland to find him and he begged him to come quickly if in these minute matters the manner of plutarch be imitated it is because it interests and paints men and manners the battalions were soon arranged upon either side and douglas resolved not to lose an advantageous station but to await the english the vicomte of narbonne the french general unhappily thought otherwise and proceeded with the national rashness which had decided the battles of cressy poitiers azincour douglas was forced to follow the example and the army lost breath rank and station while the enemy retained all the french sent two thousand to attack the rear of the foe but they were defeated by the english archers and a general rout ensued the duke of touraine and his soninlaw the constable of france and most of the scotishmen of note were slain and of the french the vicomte de narbonne the count daumale and many

prejudices of several scottish historians if any blame must fall let it fall where it ought upon the misrule of the house of albany to a people who had lived for half a century under a loose and delegated government and who had been accustomed to regard license as liberty it is no wonder that the punishment of crimes seemed quite a new and strange cruelty that a salutary strength of

negotiations may now be diversified with more interesting intelligence and the arts of peace may afford a pleasing contrast to the devastations of war in this national council it was decreed that the ancient privileges and freedom of the church be confirmed that the kings peace be firmly held and no private wars allowed that no man should travel with more followers than he could maintain acts f   c    that efficient administrators of law be appointed through all the realm that no extortions from churchmen or farmers in particular be admitted that the customs and borough rates be assigned to the king and mines of gold and silver under certain restrictions that the clergy shall not pass the sea without the kings permission nor have pensions out of benefices in scotland that gold and silver should not be exported but upon paying a high custom that all persons exceeding twelve years of age should be taught archery that agriculture be protected by the destruction of rooks and by a prevention from setting fire to heathy ground while the corn was standing that certain customs be raised on horse cattle and sheep and herrings and on furs that inns be kept in every borough and no beggars allowed except permitted by the sheriff in the country and in towns by the aldermen or bailies ib f v   f     such were the salutary regulations of this parliament many of them bespeaking political prudence and others an amiable simplicity of manners but there were two others of remarkable import and therefore reserved for a separate consideration the first orders the sheriffs to enquire what lands belonged to the crown under the preceding monarchs david ii and the two last roberts declaring at the same time that the king may summon the holders to show their charters ib f v    the second imposes a large subsidy in order to defray the sum payable to england for the kings maintenance ib f   see appendix  though the justice of these ordinances cannot be questioned yet their policy may the former it is believed produced no effect except suspicion and discontent among a number of the subjects and the latter excited an almost universal dissatisfaction though a subsidy to defray the kings ransom if taken prisoner was one of the few taxes authorized by the feudal system yet the present circumstances did not to the public mind justify the imposition the tax consisted of twelve pennies in the pound of all sorts of production farms and annual rents cattle and grain whether of the clergy or of the laity and to continue for two years auditors or chief receivers were appointed who in the first year collected about fourteen thousand marks but in the second year the popular expostulations increased and prevailed bowar     himself one of the auditors  the consequence was that the sum payable for the kings maintenance in england was never defrayed  it was not to be expected that the usurpations of the family of albany should pass unrevenged      and james was no sooner firm on the throne of his ancestors than he thought of discharging this great duty in a spirited manner as their power had continued for a long time and was deeply rooted in the nation it was necessary to try the public pulse an proceed by degrees accordingly in the very commencement of his exercise of authority james had ordered walter the eldest son of the late regent murdac into custody and at the same time probably only to veil his designs and prevent the family of albany from being regarded as the sole objects of his resentment malcom fleming of cumbernald and thomas boyd of kilmarnoc shared the same fate but were soon after released bowar     dates this imprisonment on the   th may      before the kings coronation  the next objects of imprisonment were duncan earl of lennox father in law to murdac and sir robert graham bowar     this sir robert graham was the same who afterward assassinated james buch x     at length the public inclination being sufficiently explored james ventured on a most daring expedient and summoning a parliament to perth he gave orders to arrest at once murdac duke of albany    mar and alexander stuart his second son with the earls of douglas angus march and not less than twenty gentlemen of great ancestry and power ibid  as it is certain that the revenge only extended to the house of albany and was meant to proceed no further historians find some difficulty in accounting for the pretext or motive to this large exertion of authority the pretext might perhaps be that the prisoners had not complied with the late act of parliament in producing their charters and as most of them if not all had been warm supporters of the family of albany the motive appears more certainly to have been the prevention of any insurrection in favor of that house instantly upon the seizure of albany the king took possession of his castles of falkland in fife and down in menteith murdac was committed to carlaveroc castle and isabella his duchess to tantallon places remote from the seat of their feudal influence bowar       that the precaution used by james in securing the friends of albany was not vain may appear from the conduct of james stuart the youngest son of the duke having escaped his intended arrest he with the assistance of finlay bishop of lismore or argyle raised a band of highland freebooters assaulted and burned the town of dunbarton   may and put to the sword sir john stuart of dundonald uncle to the king with thirty two men the monarch justly enraged at this insult ordered the son of albany to be proclaimed a felon and so hot was the pursuit that he was forced with the bishop and other accomplices to seek refuge in ireland whence they never returned five of his band being taken in a few days suffered the most ignominious and extreme punishment of the law bowar       after a delay of two months necessary to collect sufficient proofs of albanys guilt and to prepare the minds of the people    may james adjourned the parliament to stirling and this important trial was instituted the jury consisted of twenty one members of parliament all of whom as forming only one house were in scotland regarded as peers home lord kaims hist law tracts      the judge was the king himself fitting on the throne of justice with all the pomp of royalty and this usual practice of the monarch presiding in his own cause may be vindicated from the ancient ideas concerning a jury who were esteemed arbitrators of fact and of law the judge being only the organ of their verdict it is remarkable that among the jury we find walter stuart earl of athole archibald earl of douglas william earl of angus george earl of march and three gentlemen who had been arrested with albany bowar      as by the scottish law a majority was sufficient to condemn a prisoner this jury seems to have been artfully managed in order to remove any suspicion from the king and to throw the severity of the verdict upon albanys own adherents walter the regents eldest son was first tried found guilty    may and instantly beheaded any delay serving no purpose in such a case but to create danger being a man of tall and comely stature eloquent and affable he was rather regreted nor did the vulgar voice less commiserate his brothers gigantic shape the former authority of albany the venerable age of lennox a nobleman approaching his eightieth year who were all three executed on the following day bowar     the coupar ms ib note says walter stuart was convicted of robbery a hint that the depredation of the royal domains and revenues was the chief charge against all the criminals  we are left in the dark concerning the ostensible grounds of their condemnation but it is probable that their seizure of the royal lands and property formed a chief article the estates of fife menteith and lennox with others thus became the property of the crown and contributed in some degree to compensate the defalcations which had happened under the regencies but the estate of lennox was not forfeited and continued in a kind of abeyance douglas peer       it must not be omitted that in the second parliament of this reign held at perth as above mentioned several prudent laws were passed for the more effectual punishment of those who infringed the acts of the national council acts f    for preventing any leagues among the subjects an edict evidently pointing to the present circumstances of albanys adherents as does another punishing the receivers of rebels by forfeiture and another noted statute condemning to death and confiscation all guilty of propagating falsehoods between the king and the people other laws of this assembly contain regulations relating to trade and agriculture and the administration of justice on which last head it is ordered that all the inferior judges abide by the strict tenor of the law and that the king may warn them so to do as well those within regalities as others that if a poor person cannot see an advocate the king shall provide one that if the sovereign pardons on condition of the damage being compensated to the plaintiff consideration be had of the highlanders who before the kings return were used to rob and kill each other for from them the compensation cannot be raised but from the lowlanders acts f      the officers of state appointed by james appear from scotstarvets calendars to have been john cameron bishop of glasgow chancellor sir john forester chamberlain myrton dean of glasgow treasurer robert lauder of bass justiciary walter ogilvy master of the household john shevis clerk of register william foulis secretary afterward keeper of the privy seal john of spens comptroller on the  th june      james issued a commission to henry bishop of st andrews authorizing him to resume all alienations from the church with power of anathema and orders to all justiciaries to assist this curious paper is preserved in harl ms      vol iii f     with an unimportant deed of that patriotic prelate    april          while james was celebrating the anniversary of his birth at st andrews aug attended by douglas mar murray angus and other nobles he gave audience to the flemish ambassadors who had been deputed to settle some commercial differences the scottish merchants had during the regencies been treated with great arrogance nay even letters of marque had been issued against them in flanders which with the duke of burgundy sustained the english party against france james had in consequence ordered the scottish trade to be transferred to middleburg in zealand but upon the offer of compensation and enlarged privileges by the ambassadors the commerce was restored to flanders bowar      as venice was the grand seat of trade between asia and europe so bruges in flanders was the commercial link which connected the merchandise of venice and the south of europe with its northern countries most articles of manufacture being also imported from flanders by the scots who were yet little versed in the arts of industry it is no wonder that the flemish were eager to retain a commerce which was one great cause of impoverishing scotland and contributed not a little to the riches of flanders  it is with much complacency that this narration now proceeds with the history of peace for which ample materials begin with this reign to be found in scotland         mar in a third parliament it was ordered that all merchants should import some armor and arms with their cargoes acts f v    that all the lieges should be governed by the laws of the realm and not by particular laws or privileges or by the laws of other countries that no man who had accused another should be of the jury on his trial that the prelates earls barons and freeholders of the king should appear personally in parliament and not by procurators except on lawful cause that the books of the law be examined and reformed that to support the inns travelers should lodge in them and not with friends that none should pass into ireland without license as the rebels had been there received nor should the irish come to scotland as they might be spies for the english that a court of session be instituted the chancellor and certain discreet persons of the three estates to sit thrice a year for a period of time and hear all causes that they who have nothing shall labor for their living that the acts of parliament be registered and copies given to prelates barons and burgesses at their expense ibid f v ii  this last act was particularly necessary in order to render the parliamentary institutions known and practical and after all it is recorded as an apophthegm of buchanan that in scotland one great act of parliament was wanted namely a decree to enjoin the strict observance of the others for a chief part of government though unobserved by politicians rests in the spirit of the people laws are vain without manners and a nation accustomed to loose misrule regards even law as a part of its license as a sermon and not as a duty as a splendid theory and not as solid practice in a special assize of this parliament regulations were introduced into weights and measures and provisions were made against the fatal effects of domestic fire acts f    the date is    march      which by modern computation is      but the next acts are of sept      the mistake seems to have arisen from this parliament having sitten till after the year      commenced on the th march  the frequent assembling of the national council does great honor to james for monarchs inclined to despotism have ever trembled to meet the representatives of their people and the acts reflect praise on the patriotism and the wisdom of the institutors  to renew the treaty with denmark and adjust the debt due to that kingdom for the dereliction of the hebudes to alexander iii may the scottish king sent sir william crichton his chamberlain and two other envoys to bergen where the debt being completely cleared an amicable arrangement was signed torf orc       0  bowar  0      july   another parliament held in the same year acts f    compare glendooks folio edition p      0 sept after some regulations concerning trade and agriculture ordered that every lord beyond the grampian mountains in whose lands ancient castles stood should repair and dwell in them or at least one of his friends in order to govern the country and expend the produce in the territory to give an example james commanded the castle of inverness to be repaired bewar      and finding that the highland chiefs were strangers to his laws and government he resolved to inculcate into their obduracy some principles of good order by a salutary severity the lords of the isles in particular by their constant confederacy with england and repeated inroads well deserved a signal chastisement in pursuance of these motives certainly just and laudable the king assembled a parliament at inverness in the spring      which the highland chieftains were specially summoned to attend and suddenly arrested alexander lord of the isles and his mother the countess of ross angus duff leader of four thousand mackays of strathnavern kenneth more chief of two thousand john ross william lesley angus moray and macmaken each also a chief of two thousand and in short about fifty principal heads of lawless clans two of them leaders of a thousand each were instantly tried condemned and beheaded and one who had murdered the late lord of the isles was also executed in impartial justice the others were scattered as prisoners among the castles of different lords through the kingdom and after a time some were condemned to death and some were restored to liberty the lord of the isles and his mother were retained in captivity till apparently after a year or more the former was delivered while the latter seems in vain to have been retained as an hostage for his fidelity bowar         she was daughter and heiress of sir walter lesley who with his brother norman took alexandria in the time of david ii and had a french title ib  such were the proceedings upon this occasion which by some have been termed sanguinary but if necessity be the tyrants plea it is also that of law and of justice lenient and conciliatory measures would have had the same effect as music upon the deaf and could have served no end but to increase the pride of these chieftains and to debase the laws and the monarchy perhaps it might however have proved more political if james upon the capture of the chiefs had insisted upon receiving their sons or nearest relations as hostages and thus not only have had pledges for their good behavior but also an opportunity of contributing to civilize the highlands by bestowing on the future chiefs a proper education a conduct which might have passed into a perpetual rule but in the choice of difficulties it is almost impossible to seize the exact mean and if equity enforce the acknowledgement that james was apt to do too much and too little the peculiarities of the country and of the time must come in for a share of the blame  it was ordered in a parliament held at perth   july that those burgesses who were summoned to parliament and were absent without lawful cause should be fined in ten pounds each that the lawsuits of scottish merchants in zealand flanders or other foreign countries be decided in scotland and several acts appear for the punishment of murder and felony acts f        in the original the date is      but errors in the numerals are not uncommon in

freeholders might dispense with their attendance in the national council upon appointing two commissioners from each shire these representatives were to have the privilege of choosing the speaker of parliament and the expense of their attendance was to be defrayed by those who formerly owed that duty ibid f v     july another remarkable decree afterward appeared enjoining the successors and heirs of prelates and barons to take an oath of fidelity to the queen ibid f     an institution probably pointing to her regency in case of the kings demise and the immaturity of the prince  some trifling negotiations had taken place in the preceding year with england now governed by the duke of gloucester and cardinal beaufort but james though indebted to that kingdom for an education excellent and truly royal to which and to the school of adversity he owed the expansion of his talents had yet no reason to be satisfied with the generosity or the friendship of the english court rymer x     erroneously ascribes a commission of james iv to the bishop of moray for a personal conference with henry vii to this year mistaking the   d of james iv   0  for the   d of james i      abercromby who easily misleads and is misled has fallen ii   0 guthrie iii         is as usual ludicrously wise upon the occasion though the mistake had been detected by keith bishops    henry vi was only six year of age  the scottish monarch was therefore well inclined to follow the former tide of politics toward france whose king charles vii was still in a most reduced situation and nearly overwhelmed by the power of england and burgundy resolved by every concession to procure the aid of scotland charles dispatched the archbishop of rheims and john stuart count de dreux and lord of darnley aubigny was now in abeyance  for that purpose in consequence of their instructions the ambassadors offered to conclude a contract of marriage between louis the dauphin afterward louis xi and margaret the eldest daughter of scotland both then infants upon condition that james should send six thousand effective men to the assistance of charles being the only dower required the princess was nevertheless provided in an income and contingencies as ample and honorable as had been ever granted upon any royal marriage of france such terms could not be refused and the contract was signed and ratified nay the two monarchs mutually swore to observe the former alliances entered into between their kingdoms and charles assigned to the scottish king the county of xaintonge and lordship of rochfort ms leagues france and scotland harl      sub anno signed by james    july by charles    oct      instead of xaintonge the duchy of berry was offered ib but neither was actually given though the former

were in france under kennedy and assisted la hire in the noted relief of montargis jean chartier p        the six thousand men were to be sent when the french fleet arrived to transmit them but the state of affairs which changed in favor of charles the following year rendered the maid of orleans an object of greater attention to the increasing prosperity of france the aid was unnecessary and was never sent nor demanded but as no infringement could be charged the treaty of marriage maintained its force and seven years after was fully completed  the government of england was rather alarmed at this new connection between scotland and france      and an interview was proposed between james and cardinal beaufort the king was to be attended by a thousand horse  0 feb and the cardinal obtained permission from the english court to meet him either on the borders or in scotland rymer x   0 on the  st dec      a safe conduct had been issued to james to meet the cardinal at durham or newcastle ib  0  but the king rejected the proposal yet he renewed the truce    july      ib      but the interview was apparently not carried into effect and was perhaps found to be unnecessary as the french alliance did not actually occasion any infringement of the truce  the lord of the isles who had been at last set at liberty after many admonitions and injunctions of fidelity soon indulged his revenge by gathering his lawless bands and burning the town of inverness james justly enraged collected an army and overtook the invader in a marshy ground near lochaber    june where the freebooting lord was totally defeated his force consisted of about ten thousand men of whom two clans chatan and cameron on the sight of the royal standard acceded to the king bowar     who adds that on the  0th march following    0 the former clan surprised the latter in a church and destroyed almost all its people  the lord of the isles reduced to despair sent an embassy to entreat peace which being refused he resolved to put himself entirely in the kings mercy for which purpose he came privately to edinburgh and on a solemn day    aug only attired in his shirt and drawers he before the high altar of holy rood church upon his knees presented his drawn sword to the king in the presence of the queen and many nobles his life was granted in consequence of his humble submission but he was committed to the castle of tantallon under the care of his nephew the earl of angus and his mother the countess of ross to the island of inch colm in the firth of forth ibid   0   a commercial league of one hundred

which ranked him among the chief potentates of europe  several patriotic regulations were issued by the parliament concerning the forms of procedure    0 march and a sumptuary law was passed permitting no men to wear silk or furs except lords and knights and their eldest sons and heirs the different sorts of armor and arms to be used by various ranks of persons were accurately prescribed and it was ordered that the same laws should be observed in relation to wrecked vessels as were used in the countries to which they belonged and that advocates should swear to their belief in the justice of the cause which they pleaded all scotishmen who travel to england without the kings leave are declared traitors and by a remarkable decree all barons and lords having lands on the western or the northern seas particularly those opposite to the islands are enjoined to furnish a certain number of galleys according to the terms of their tenures acts f v     f     the want of a fleet to keep the islands in due subordination must have suggested this last institution the policy was laudable and it must be allowed that james attempted more than all his predecessors to join the discordant parts of his kingdom in firm and compact union but this decree like most other scottish acts of parliament seems to have been carefully eluded  the prosperity of james was further advanced by his becoming the father of maletwins    oct one of whom james was to ascend the throne upon the premature death of his father but alexander the firstborn died in early infancy bowar   0   the truce

vain glory of war his patriotic cares for the establishment of law and order in his dominions for unknown causes james ordered the earl of douglas and sir john kennedy his own nephews by the maternal side to be imprisoned perhaps douglas had been guilty of some private practices with england or the king wished to secure the peace of the south of scotland while he was employed in quelling the northern insurrections by retaining douglas its chief leader in captivity conjecture wanders in such enquiry but it is certain that douglas remained a prisoner till the end of september this year when the king in a parliament held as usual at perth consented at the request of the queen nobles and prelates to deliver both douglas and the lord of the isles bowar   0   meanwhile in spite of all the endeavors of james the highlands remained in a state of constant rebellion and savage anarchy in strathnavern angus duff and angus moray both of them lately delivered from the imprisonment ordered at

passed in quieting the commotions in the highlands of which no further intelligence occurs during this reign      the scene of public affairs again opens the english government sufficiently alarmed at the declining state of their power in france became more and more anxious to prevent the now impending completion of the marriage treaty between that kingdom and scotland and for this purpose sent

could justly claim bowar     in vesp f vii f    is a paper    july    h        being an answer to the credence of roulle the envoy of james and promising that lord scrope should soon be sent to promote peace  there is reason to believe that the english were sincere but the honor of the king and of the nation and the mutual interests of france and scotland were motives momentous enough to cause the rejection of even superior terms the discussion of this affair ended rather ludicrously oct a parliament being called at perth the propositions were agitated before the king in the dominican church and the nobles and prelates seemed to accept the terms saying that peace and liberty were the objects of their chief desire but the abbots of scone and inchcolm fitter assistants at a monastic dispute than at a public deliberation asserted that the scottish king could not treat of peace with england because of the confederacy with france which had been examined by the university of paris and confirmed by the pope other objections were also started and the day being wasted in discussion it was agreed to resume the subject on the morrow when john fogo abbot of melrose alleged on the other side that no person could abide by the divine laws who depended on the will of another and that no king could lawfully swear to another that he would not make peace with a third except by the consent of the second violent altercations among the clergy now arose the parliament was transformed into a hall of ecclesiastic disputes and as such disputes never decide any thing the members separated without determination only the very want of decision left the alliance with france in full force and the english propositions were considered as rejected lindoris the inquisitor called fogo to account for his sentiments as savouring of heresy and fogo retorted by several epistles but was at last forced to make concessions bowar the abbot of inch colm      00  this strange affair calls to remembrance the latter history of the greek empire when vehement churchmen ruined the national concerns by idle disputes and so totally useless is learning out of its place that a senate of american savages exerting only their plain sense would have discussed such a subject with far more ability than all the abbots in the world to complete the absurdity the scottish churchmen gave out that the only intention of england had been to excite schisms and heresies in scotland ibid     a letter of james to the council of busle aug      occurs in martenes anecdota paris      folio tom viii p

march had been long remarkable for their dubious fidelity to scotland and repeated ingratitude to its sovereigns nor was the memory of the late revolt and the mischiefs which it had produced in the preceding reign easily to be extinguished having therefore quelled the isles and highlands which as the most important office engaged his first cares the king resolved to complete his own power and that of his kingdom by removing the family of march from a territory which had been the free gift of a scottish king to an english exile and by placing that house in a more northern and secure part of scotland in pursuance of this just and prudent plan james ordered the earl of march to be confined in the castle of edinburgh and took possession of the fortress of dunbar the chief seat of the family bowar  00   a parliament being summoned       0 jan two clergymen and seven commons were appointed to hear and report all causes during the session abercromby ii     gives their names  an institution

advocates alleged that the father of march having engaged in open rebellion against the kingdom it was not in the power of robert duke of albany the regent to pardon him a privilege belonging to the crown only but that the estates were forfeited and that by the laws of scotland all alienations of crown lands to which description the forfeited estates of march belonged were void when made during the minority or captivity of the sovereign after a long debate the parliament decreed by the mouth of david dempster the speaker that the estates of march were forfeited and remained a part of the royal property ibid acts f v     the king completed his design by immediately granting to march the earldom of buchan which had some time before reverted to the crown bowar  00 the earl of buchan

foreign wars being a natural son of alexander the fourth son of robert ii his estates and effects as provided by the old scottish laws concerning bastardy fell to the king bowar  00  there may be a surmize that walter earl of athole only surviving uncle of the king being also uncle of mar who left no surviving issue mars son thomas died before his father sutherland case chapter v p     had entertained ambitious hopes of adding this contiguous earldom to his own and that of strathern which the king had bestowed on him eight years before and that his disappointment was one incentive to

sinclair earl of orkney the admiral and john bishop of brechin the others amounted to sixteen knights and squires and a hundred and forty young gentlemen they were guarded by a thousand armed men in three galleys and six barges the english government irritated at the rejection of their proposals sent out a fleet of one hundred and eighty vessels to intercept the princess and they awaited her appearance in the channel meantime a number of flemish merchant ships appeared loaded with wine from rochelle which were captured by the english but a spanish fleet suddenly approaching recaptured the prizes during these contests the royal bride arrived safe at rochelle may being forced to reach that part of france as the english and their allies possessed the north and a dispensation of age being granted by the archbishop of tours as diocesan    june the marriage was soon after solemnized   july though james was by the feudal law entitled to a subsidy from his people upon this occasion yet he

love of learning her taste for poetry her affability could save her from the pangs of domestic distress after an unfruitful marriage of nine years her extreme delicacy of mind caused her to fall a sacrifice to a vague word of a villainous courtier see the notes on the year        enraged at the manifest hostility committed by the english in the attempt to intercept his daughter the delay of redress for the incursion of the former year and probably desirous of preventing any machinations of his nobility in consequence of his vigorous measures james resolved upon a war with england a step to which he might also have been induced by his treaties with france now completed by the marriage of the dauphin and margaret he summoned the whole array of his kingdom computed at nearly two hundred thousand men mounted on small horses but not entitled to the appellation of cavalry and yet a greater number of rude infantry and loose attendants on the army with this unwieldy force he besieged roxburgh   aug and after wasting fifteen days and almost all the missive arms of the kingdom he was forced to abandon the siege and return inglorious bowar  0  he estimates the force at  00000 but inglorii remearunt the affair is singular and rather obscure harding c       0 says that the connection of james with burgundy led him to this invasion and that he fled on northumberlands advancing with  0000 men the nobles probably showed their discontent by dissension as in the reigns of james iii and v burgundy had abandoned the english interest in      and james was in strict alliance with him  such is the account of our monastic historian whose constant warmth in the praise of james justifies his candor latter writers upon no authority say that the king dismissed his army because he heard of a conspiracy which would have been the best reason for retaining it the real cause seems to have been that james found that he was consuming his own kingdom by so numerous an host and could not dismiss a part without an affront or that the spirit of the nobles shown under his successors began to operate in a contempt of the regal authority and in the sacrifice of their country to their resentments  the last parliament of james i met at edinbugh    oct it was decreed that jurymen should swear that they had received no bribes that trespassors may be accused at the kings instance though no private prosecutor appear that to secure the importation of bullion merchants should bring three ounces of bullion for every sack of wool exported and a similar rate for hydes and hamburgh barrels that no persons be permitted to remain in taverns after nine oclock at night that no english goods be brought into scotland and that no english man import such except by special permission that no scotishman sell salmon to the english except the latter have safe conduct and pay english gold that no scotishman buy wine of certain flemings in scotland that no person be permitted to remove gold silver or jewels out of scotland acts f        the commercial regulations seem more calculated to fetter than to encourage trade but it was long before the real spirit of commerce was understood even in more enlightened countries  the cruel terminating scene of the life of james approaches      a very minute and interesting account of this melancholy transaction is contained in a manuscript of the period hitherto unknown to our historians and which shall be here followed this memoir is printed in the appendix and is not only extremely curious and important in itself but as it presents a specimen of the english language between the time of chaucer and that of fortescue  and it is hoped that the singularity and importance of the scene will afford a sufficient excuse for a degree of prolixity  sir robert graham uncle of the earl of strathern afterward of menteith had been imprisoned in      as is above mentioned but the cause is unknown two years afterward james had resumed the earldom of strathern upon pretext as seems that it was confined to heirs male and had given it to his uncle walter earl of athole for his life assigning in recompense that of menteith to malis graham the former earl of strathern see the sutherland case by sir d dalrymple chapter v p       from the original charters  robert graham may have been discontented at this exchange of his nephews dignity but it is not easy to conceive that his wrath upon this account could have excited him to the murder of his sovereign and far less that he could have wished to serve the ambition of athole to whom his nephews former earldom had passed the art of this man seems to have equalled his audacity and he must have instigated athole now approaching if not exceeding his seventieth year walter earl of athole and strathern the second son of robert ii by euphemia ross must have been born about      at the latest  to this conspiracy by ambitious views only fit to captivate the dotage of age or inexperience of youth and inspired by graham solely to promote his own desperate revenge this idea is favored by the following narration which also explains the violent causes which inflamed this assassin but it would be neither a matter of paradox nor blame to infer that athole and his family were really innocent and that they were accused by graham to gratify his animosity because athole held his nephews estates and dignity it shall only be further premised that sir robert stuart grandson of athole on whom the conspirators pretended to bestow the crown was the son of david eldest son of that earl left an hostage in england for james ever since his arrival in his kingdom and who apparently died there either before this period or soon after  according to this ancient relation james had discontented his nobles by his vigorous procedure against them and they asserted that his avarice of confiscated estates and not his justice induced him to such actions the people were also displeased because of the subsidies imposed to which they had long been strangers and were even inclined to pronounce his government tyrannic in this posture of affairs and probably in the year      after march had been confined and his estates seized sir robert graham now delivered from his first imprisonment and irritated by that disgrace proposed in a meeting of the lords and chief men that he would represent their grievances to the king if they would support him as he was eloquent and versed in the laws they willingly assented accordingly in the next parliament or that held for the forfeiture of march in january      grahams violence led him to exceed his commission for he rose with an enraged countenance and approaching the royal seat laid his hand on the king saying i arrest you in the name of all the three estates of your realm here assembled in parliament for as your people have sworn to obey you so are you constrained by an equal oath to govern by law and not to wrong your subjects but in justice to maintain and defend them then turning around he exclaimed is it not thus as i say but the members struck with consternation at grahams rashness remained in profound silence and the king instantly ordered the audacious censor to prison to which he was conveyed after a severe sarcasm on the meanness of spirit shown by those who had promised to support him soon after graham was ordered into banishment and all his possessions forfeited to the king  the bold and gloomy exile retired into the furthest highlands meditating revenge and he had even the audacity formally to renounce his allegiance and to send a defiance to the king in writing asserting that james had ruined him his wife and children and possessions by his cruel tyranny and that he should kill his sovereign with his own hand if occasion offered upon this a proclamation was made promising three thousand demies of gold each worth half an english noble to any person who should bring in graham dead or alive meantime that ardent spirit was employed in digesting his scheme and he sent messages to several of the members of parliament during its session in october      offering to assassinate the king and bestow the crown on sir robert stuart atholes grandson nephew and favorite of james  the court held the festival of christmas at perth and the contemporary narrative details some popular stories concerning omens which happened to james the worst omen was his vigorous administration which had created many enemies among whom the conspiracy spread like a fire among combustible materials and had even reached the most intimate attendants of the palace without exciting any suspicion thrice did christopher chambers one of the traitors and who had been a squire of the duke of albany approach the royal presence to disclose the plot and as often did he fail from accident or from a mistaken sense of honor or pity to his associates  at length the conspiracy being fully ripened  0 feb a night was fixed for its execution being that of the second wednesday in lent according to monstrelet or the twenty seventh day of february in the year one thousand four hundred and thirtyseven but that of the first wednesday

earl of athole and sir robert stuart were at the court that evening which was passed before supper and after to a late hour in the amusements of the time in playing at chess and tables reading romances singing and music an irish or highland woman pretending to magic who had long before given the king a hint of the plot and had only met with laughter again came to unfold it but was referred till the morrow as the king was busy at play an hour after james called for the parting cup and he and the company drank and withdrew sir robert stuart private chamberlain to the king and his chief favorite is accused of spoiling the locks of the royal chambers to prevent their being shut and even of laying boards across a deep ditch that environed the garden of the dominican monastery at perth where james was now lodged in order to enable the conspirators to pass but these offices seem to belong to meaner associates and the guilt of athole and his grandson is doubtful after midnight graham with about three hundred persons mostly raised in the highlands as may be inferred entered the garden the king was now in his bedchamber standing before the fire only dressed in his nightgown and conversing gayly with the queen and her ladies when just as he threw off his nightgown to go to bed he heard a great noise as of men in armor crouding and clashing together and perceived a blaze of torches suspicions of treason instantly arising the queen and ladies ran to the chamber door but could not fasten it the locks being spoiled and the king requesting them if possible to keep the door shut attempted to escape by the windows but found them closely barred with iron perceiving no other refuge he with the firetongs and an exertion of strength tore up a board of the chamberfloor and letting himself down dropped the board above him he was now in one of these incommodious necessaries usual in old edifices but still could not escape outward for by a sad fatality a square aperture in the place had been filled with stone only three days before by the kings command because the balls were apt to enter it when he played at tennis nevertheless he might here have remained safe had not his own impatience betrayed him  meanwhile the traitors burst open the chamber door and several of the ladies were hurt particularly as our historians say catherine douglas who with a spirit worthy of her name had her arm broken by thrusting it into the staple instead of a bar the ladies shrieking with horror fled to the furthest corner of the room but the queen was so extremely agitated that she stood without power of speech or motion and a villain basely wounded and would have slain her had not a son of graham interfered saying what will will you do for shame of yourself to the queen she is but a woman let us go and seek the king the queen was then permitted to withdraw while the ladies remained lost in tears and consternation  the traitors sought the king in every part of the chamber and another adjoining without success most of them had gone to extend their search and a temporary quiet succeeded when the king most unhappily after having heard no noise for some time and thinking that the conspirators were gone called to the ladies to bring sheets and draw him up from his uncomfortable concealment in the attempt elizabeth douglas fell down into the place and chambers one of the assassins entering with a torch perceived the king and the lady and called to his fellows with savage merriment sirs the bride is found for whom we have sought and caroled all night upon this another traitor sir john hall leaped down with a dagger in his hand but the king seized him behind and threw him under his feet halls brother met with the same chance yet the king in vain tried to wrest a dagger from either and only wounded his hands and rendered himself incapable of further defense graham himself now entered the kings retreat who requested his mercy but graham exclaimed thou cruel tyrant thou never had mercy upon thy noble kindred nor others so expect none james said i beseech thee that for my souls salvation thou will let me have a confessor but graham retorted thou shall have no confessor but this sword and stabbed the king who in vain cried for mercy and offered half his kingdom for his life the assassin somewhat relenting was about to withdraw when his comrades above desired him to complete their intention else he should himself encounter death at their hands graham and the two halls then accomplished the horrid deed by multiplied wounds  thus perished james i in the fortyfourth year of his age and the thirtyfirst of his nominal reign but only the thirteenth of his active authority  not satiated with the murder of their monarch the assassins sought the queen fearing her revenge but she had now escaped the rumor at length reaching the outer court where the servants were lodged and thence the town itself numbers approached with arms and torches upon which the conspirators hastily withdrew sir david dunbar arriving alone attacked them slew one and wounded another but was overpowered and left disabled straiton a page was slain and the band made good their retreat to the highlands only regreting that the queen had been saved whose vengeance they dreaded nor without cause for in less than a month all the chief actors were in jail  the first taken were sir robert stuart and christopher chambers who were executed with cruel tortures at edinburgh and the formers confession of guilt may have been forced from his pangs athole was taken by angus tried and condemned    mar but easter approaching the cross upon which his grandson had been tormented was taken down as unbecoming that solemnity and he was fastened to a pillar with a paper crown upon his head thrice inscribed with the term traitor antony bishop of urbino the papal legate in scotland heard the confessions of stuart and athole eneas sylvius is substituted for

proceeded to the council of basil on his return and was afterward distinguished by his embassies to germany france and spain in narrating the murder of james i jean chartier p    says that the perpetrators were chiefly servants of albany and other lords slain by james who was a brave and just prince and well beloved by his people    the latter asserted his innocence but said that his grandson had proposed the conspiracy from which he had dissuaded him and understood that he had succeeded it might be said that stuart having been forced by torture to confess guilt athole was of course obliged to accord with his grandsons testimony for it is difficult to conceive that stuart could have been guilty of such black ingratitude to his beneficent sovereign and of such a total sacrifice of common prudence as to engage in this conspiracy from which to expect the diadem must have been the infatuation of frenzy but grahams art may have practiced upon his youth and weakness to this degree and the evidence of his guilt at last rather preponderates as to athole his hoary head might well have been saved the laws concerning misprision of treason are most severe calling for a sacrifice of kindred of friendship and of human nature his grandsons scheme he seems to have regarded as too wild for any man of common understanding to attempt and was he for what he expected to pass as idle discourse to proclaim his grandson a madman or a traitor and to ruin his posterity but to leave this discussion the aged earl was beheaded at edinburgh and his head was fixed upon a spear encircled with a crown of iron  graham and many others of the traitors were tortured and put to death at stirling the daring chief of the assassins had the insolence to plead that having renounced his allegiance under his hand and seal he had a right to kill the king as his mortal enemy nay he addressed his judges and the spectators assuring them that they should soon pray for his soul as one to whom they were indebted for their deliverance from a tyrant nor was his courage less than his dark fanaticism of vengeance as appeared from the spirit with which he bore his horrid torments some of the associates asserted that they knew not even the nature of the conspiracy but had been prevailed on to join the party upon pretense that the intention was only to carry off a young lady of the court whom sir robert stuart was to marry a circumstance apparently alluded to in the expressions of chambers abovementioned the son of graham thomas hall and chambers are particularly mentioned among the victims and the latter would express no repentance for the kings death this full and minute relation is given not only as presenting all the circumstances of an important event but as it serves to

language    ornamental arts manners dress  section i state of the people and of civilization whether education       climate or government produce most effect on national character is an important problem discussed by many able writers but hitherto not sufficiently resolved it must however be granted by all that each has its share in exciting or depressing mental energy in establishing general industry or indolence in promoting public happiness or misery but of these grand causes education seems deservedly to claim the preeminence to deny the power of climate would be to forget that man is subject to the skyey influences yet his industry or care my generally overcome or elude its effects and soil is almost equally subservient to labor government exerts a more pervading influence even the peasant in his cottage is oppressed by the burning heat of despotism or the blasting storms of anarchy the rewards of his labor cease amid the general distress the caprice of some little tyrant for slaves are ever tyrants where they can or the revenge of a foe may assail his hovel and while his family perishes in penury the labourer joins the mountain robbers and falls the victim of those laws which afforded him no protection even moderate governments affect domestic life and individuals more than is commonly conceived a war a tax an unwise law becomes an universal misfortune while the benignity and skill of the rulers enlarge the happiness of all the influence like that of the electric element is rarely unveiled to the popular eye though the subtle fluid operate most widely on the public health  in the oriental legislations the connection between laws and manners is often indissoluble and the laws become perpetual by being grafted on the habits of that creature of habit man in europe on the contrary the laws and manners are proverbially distinct jurisdiction punishes crimes but rewards not virtues far less can it improve domestic morals or diffuse the light of instruction over a benighted nation these are the sacred provinces of education a cause of national character more prevalent than either of the former as it strikes the very root of offense and sows lasting seeds of intelligence and worth  but education on the extensive scale here implied remains an experiment even to the most civilized nations and its effects must neither be regarded as speedy nor infinite even infants display some a perverse others a placid disposition and it is doubtful whether any care or art can eradicate or subdue the inborn temper if the bad habits of an individual prove often unconquerable by reason or virtue how deeply must such habits be rooted in a whole people where example operates like a contagion  hence it is that the spirit and manners of the people ought to present the main object of political discussion on any particular state and the more especially where government and education have little force in whatever form of administration only a part can shine upon the public theater and thus attract the notice of history the mass of the nation remains in obscurity even in enlightened ages and philosophy can only estimate its history by that of its manners for which the best materials are to be found not in the pages of the annalist but in poems novels and romances barren however as are the annals of the poor their state may always be justly estimated by that of the actors who vaunt and vanish in the historic scene and from the progress of nations as savage barbarous or civilized the monkish page presents but a small pulse yet from it the health or sickness of the whole body may be gathered with considerable certainty  in scotland at the period now under review the people were slowly advancing from barbarism toward civilization a peace of some duration had taken place before the accession of the house of stuart and the consequent intercourse with england a country then rapidly progressive in the arts of life must have increased the national energy yet the feudal setters continued to be firmly rivetted every man was the soldier or the menial attendant of his chief and flocks herds agriculture afforded only subservient occupations while the single science of the great was war their sole amusement hunting their chief magnificence a numerous train it is no wonder that the poor were ferocious and idle secure during health of a maintenance from their lords and in sickness of monastic charity courage honesty frankness attachment to their chiefs constituted the chief virtues of the peasantry temperance and sobriety were the virtues of the soil spirituous liquors that bane of the poor were as yet unknown in europe except among the stores of the physician nor had religious fanaticism that unintermitting intoxication yet poisoned the popular mind with habitual gloom the poor chiefly knew the christian religion from its charity from the public exhortations of the preaching friars and from the gay exhibitions of the roman catholic system  by more polished foreigners scotland continued to be regarded as a country completely barbarous the author of the dittamundi allows that it is rich in fish flesh and milk but

low countries greatly obstructed the progress of industry and civilization and this intestine evil more pernicious than foreign invasion continued to a late period strangers to that industry which excites the swiss peasant to cultivate the precipice and the norwegian to derive that support from the sea which the land refuses the highlanders supplied their wants by rapine and the civil animosity was increased by the difference of origin language and manners so that the difficulties with which the government had to struggle and the obstacles against order were perhaps greater in scotland than in any other european kingdom the example of henry ii of england who planted a flemish colony in wales escaped the observation or exceeded the power of our monarchs and the complete transposition of the population of a province though an expedient far from unknown to the persians greeks and romans appears to surpass the wisdom or the enterprise of any later government  though the peasantry were in fact the slaves of their lords by menial or by feudal bondage yet few instances occur of absolute villanage and it is believed no example appears in our records of an estate sold with the farmers laborers and families attached to the soil nisbet in his heraldry vol i p     gives an extract of a charter of robert i regni    from the chartulary of dunfermlin declaring adam adamson and his four sons free declaratum est quod adamus filius adami non est homo noster ligius seu nativus quin pro voluntate sua and he and sons were delivered ab omni jugo et onere servitutis executed coram justiciario nostro  the appellation husbond given to the scottish farmers seems indeed to imply that they were considered as bond slaves of their lords house or as fixed to their own particular farmhouses yet what little evidence remains teaches us to consider them rather as slaves in custom than in law the husband lands or farms were divided into tillage and pasturage were always small and the farmers of course poor skene de sign verb voce husbandland originally about six acres  the cotter who rears his hovel of turf and straw under an old thorn and cultivates three or four acres of the

the actions of robert i he presents many pictures of the times and manners the lapse of half a century being imperceptible in the slow progress of civilization but the curiosity of froissart a

from flattering concerning scotland he found these things worthy of repetition it is an island joined to england stretching two hundred miles to the north and about fifty broad a cold country fertile of few sorts of grain and generally void of trees but there is a sulphurous stone dug up which is used for firing the towns are unwalled the houses commonly built without lime and in villages roofed with turf while a cows hide supplies the place of a door the commonalty are poor and uneducated have abundance of flesh and fish but eat bread as a dainty the men are small in stature but bold the women fair and comely and prone to the pleasures of love kisses being there esteemed of less consequence than pressing the hand is in italy the wine is all imported the horses are mostly small ambling

this period the statutes were concealed from the nation in the darkness of the latin language the good sense of this monarch ordered them to be issued in the scottish tongue while in england the laws were to be dictated in latin and french till the reign of richard iii thus religion and law the sole rules of popular conduct were veiled from the people but there is no absurdity which man has not reduced to practice the statures of james are wisely ordained to advance civilization and the sanguine theorist may exult in their effects but they rather proclaim the intelligence of the monarch and of his ecclesiastic ministers than the national advancement ordinances prepared in the cabinet by wise and good men were passed by the lords of the articles while the peers and landholders with whom the jurisdiction lay either did not attend or voted with a smile and the frequent repetition of the same laws even so late as the reigns of james iv an v conspires with the records of history to convince us that the statutes rather indicate the evils that did exist than the remedy of these evils the roots of national habits are too deep to be affected by the thunder of laws the slow divulsion of education can alone explode them  among the statures of the first james the following are the most pertinent to the present discussion that no private wars be allowed that none travel with more attendants than they maintain that no sornars shall force their residence upon the clergy or farmers that in burghs and no high ways inns be erected and that no beggars be permitted except distinguished by a badge importing the leave of the magistrates and the hospitals for the poor and sick are ordered to be reformed a remarkable law ordains that all idle persons without means of livelihood shall be imprisoned till they give security and shall within forty days betake themselves to some service or craft the trial of the causes of the poor is declared to be gratuitous acts f             the institution of inns repeatedly enforced was perhaps calculated to save the monasteries from the frequent intrusion of numerous guests but the necessity of such laws indicates a radical defect in civilization the first object of the romans after the conquest of a barbaric country was to open high ways through it for on mutual and easy intercourse all civilization depends yet this first and indispensable step is unknown in our statutes some regulations appear concerning ferries but till within these fifty years the roads in scotland were hardly passable and while the swiss cuts his way through the alps our mole hills in the highlands present insuperable barriers the civilization of a country is always in exact proportion to the number and condition of its high ways the omission of this one law was radical and obstructed all the others the first scottish statute concerning highways is of the reign of charles ii      cap      in the burghs a greater degree of

election of deacons of crafts perhaps they abused their power in exciting sedition perhaps the genuine spirit of a corporation began to operate in monopoly and oppression but a warden and council are ordered to regulate prices the warden to be chosen by the council of the burgh and not as the deacons by the craftsmen themselves masons carpenters smiths tailors weavers are the only trades mentioned in the statute acts f        the institution of corporations by patent seems unknown in scotland till the reign of james iv the crafts embodied and regulated themselves and the attention of government was hardly diverted to them except to prevent imposition they would have charged for holidays and undertaken more work than they could accomplish while one craftsman would refuse the work neglected by another ib    confrairies first appear in france about      le grand i   0  the sole intention of these acts seems to have been to break the monopoly to these hints concerning burghs it may be added that harlots are ordered to dwell in the skirts of the towns to prevent hazard from fire concerning which regulations are enacted ib f v      james i has himself delineated the manners of the common people in his poem called peblis to the play this play was probably an annual festival in honor of the saint to whom the church was dedicated or on some other occasion and such wakes are yet known in the north of england the humor and jollity of the meeting end in tumult and uproar but display a very different character to the gloomy fanaticism of the two succeeding centuries from this singular poem among other articles of manners we learn that the women wore kerchiefs and hoods and tippets the music arose from the bagpipe the men sometimes wore hats of birchtwigs interwoven the hat being any high covering of the head while the bonnet was flat a tavern with fair table linen and a regular score on the wall are introduced the reckoning twopence halfpenny a piece is collected in a wooden trencher the cadger or packman who carries fish etc through the country on his little horse the salmon dance consisting in exertions of high leaping and other anecdotes of popular manners diversify the piece select scottish ballads vol ii p     the dress of the common people consisted chiefly of a doublet and cloak and a kind of short trowse the head was covered with a hat of basketwork or felt or with a woolen bonnet while the logs and feet remained bare a practice prevalent among the common people of england on this period even the feet of many of the english archers were bare in battle st remy p     shirts were hardly known even to the great the female dress was a kerchief or a hood and a tippet about the neck the kirtle or close gown was rarely accompanied either with the wylicot or under petticoat or with the mantle and the feet were naked  as the state of society was rather pastoral than agricultural milk and its various preparations formed a chief article of food meat boiled with oatmeal or fish supplied more solemn meals bread and vegetables were little used a circumstance to which it may perhaps be imputed that the leprosy was not uncommon the chief fish was the salmon concerning the capture of which many regulations occur in the acts of parliament and which also formed a grand article in the scottish exports  section ii government laws tactics the government and laws of a country are so intimately connected with its history when composed in a proper manner and with philosophic views that little remains to be added on these important topics except to glean a few remarks and present some general observations  the policy concerning the highlands formed a chief object in the scottish government david ii had excited the chieftains to destroy each other by bestowing the estate of the slaughtered leader on his assassin and by the reign of terror had established tranquillity fordun ii   0  this cruel policy was abandoned by the house of stuart robert ii assigned the highlands to the care of his son the earl of carric and other peers who were empowered to call the chiefs before them and concert means of justice register f v     but this plan erred in the other extreme of mildness and james i after having been obliged so exempt the highlanders from the law of retribution because as the statute bears they had been accustomed to rob and kill each other acts f    was at length constrained as we have seen to have recourse to severity  the reign of this prince revived the long dormant power of the laws and the boldest of the peers dared not to oppose his mandates or messengers the people adds the old historiographers then sat in the opulence of peace secure from ravagers elate in heart and tranquil in mind because the monarch had wisely expelled quarrels and rapine from the state had appeased discord and reconciled enmity bowar   0  but the regal jurisdiction though much confined by the feudal system was carried by james i to a height that proved fatal to himself  it is unnecessary to dwell on the feudal government so ably discussed by numerous authors a singular feature of it in scotland was the freedom from taxes and that at a period when france was overwhelmed with them and the blood of the poor as usual was mingled with the wine of the rich in      the taxes were so numerous in france that many emigrated des ursins p     another remarkable distinction from modern times was that the royal authority was weakened in war and increased in peace the soldiers belonged to their chiefs and not the sovereign but the execution of the laws was a prerogative of the latter  an idea of the royal revenue may be formed from the marriage contracts of our princes the dower of the wife being estimated at one third of the whole robert ii and iii were married before the accession of the family and the avaricious conduct of the english court in the marriage of james i rendered any contract to this effect unnecessary but that of james ii and mary of gelder is extant and though the evidence be somewhat excursive it is sufficiently in point ms harl      vol iii f v    the dower assigned is  0000 crowns of gold and these crowns in a contemporary statute are estimated at six shillings and eight pence each scottish money acts of       hence  0000 gold crowns equalled  000 marks scottish money and the royal revenue was   000 marks scottish or about   00 marks sterling of that time in weight about   000 pounds of silver in efficacy about seventy thousand pounds of modern currency but the rapacity of statesmen and favorites and other causes which did not affect the estates of the aristocracy considerably dilapidated the revenue of the crown and rendered it subject to fuch variations that fifty thousand pounds may most safely be assumed as a medium perhaps the earls of douglas possessed a revenue equal to two thirds of the royal which however certainly more than doubled that of any other peer in the estimate of the revenues of the hostages for james i rymer x         the highest are those of argyle and dalkeith   00 marks sterling each but that of douglas must have been far larger the   00 marks might now equal   000 l it must not be forgotten that the royal expenses were almost wholly domestic there being neither civil nor military lift the officers of state and administrators of law being only paid by perquisites and even embassies were defrayed by the members of parliament or by the merchants the revenue of henry v of england was       l  0 s rymer x     or about   0000 modern pounds     the revenue of the crown arose chiefly from its demesnes from the various feudal casualties ward relief marriage escheat forfeiture from vacant bishoprics fines presents for grants and from customs on merchandise its prerogatives appear to have been   to summon the parliament and propose laws which seldom or never failed to pass   the administration of justice   creation of honors and dignities   command of the national array   nomination to ecclesiastic preferments as the first of these prerogatives encroached on the legislative power so on the other hand the parliament regulated embasses and treaties and ordered peace or war this important fact is evinced from many documents in this work see particularly the reign of james v  the coinage of money belonged to the crown but any alteration was regarded as unconstitutional if not sanctioned by parliament  hence it appears that the revenues and power of the scottish monarchs were in themselves sufficiently respectable but the age of robert ii the weakness of his successor the disorders of the regencies and above all the extreme avarice of the aristocracy ever preying on the royal domains and revenue were causes that greatly injured both the wealth and influence of the crown  in passing to the national council or parliament the most striking object is the number of ecclesiastics which exceeded that of the peers in the parliament at cambuskenneth      the number of abbots already amounted to    scone kelso arbroth holyrood lindoris newbottel caput paisley dunfermlin lincluden inchaffray st colm deer sweetheart the priors   coldingham restenoth st andrews pittenweem lochleven add the bishops    and the sum is thirtytwo  but till the days of forman and the betons priestly ambition seems to have been little known in scotland and the statutes generally evince great wisdom and patriotism in the legislative body the members unhappily did not assemble in two chambers as in england the burgesses were annihilated in presence of the powerful aristocracy who themselves only skilled in arms left legislative discussion to the clergy an opposition was scarce ever known in the scottish parliament because its operations were previously settled by the wellknown committees of lords of the articles and approved by the king so that in fact the statutes were presented for its sanction not its discussion nay there is room to believe that an opposition in parliament was viewed in as treasonable a light as opposition in the field and that the minority only testified its dissatisfaction by its nonappearance  the administration of the laws was the chief difficulty and the king and parliament often recommended this great object to the peers in their respective territories during a minority the parliament alone had the power of nominating a regent and council see the reign of james v when the parliament declare that by the kings demise the power had devolved to the three estates who had appointed albany regent yet the will of the deceased monarch was commonly respected and the queens of james i ii and iv were acknowledged as regents for a time  at what precise period the kings privy council fucceeded the aula regis or council of great officers of state is dubious it was much on the same model being composed of the chancellor chamberlain treasurer privy seal secretary and a few other members its power during a minority was great but at other times entirely under the control of the sovereign and hardly known in history far superior was the fate of the privy council in denmark and sweden where the members usurped the chief power and under the name of senates controuled the monarchs the want of titular nobility in these countries was a radical cause of this singularity for the prelates having no balance to their ascendancy and most of them being senators in virtue of their sees the landholders burgesses and peasants could not struggle against so powerful an aristocracy in scotland on the contrary the bishops and the church were a public benefit as they balanced the power of the ferocious nobles and supported the monarch and the laws all institutions depend on time and circumstances and the bane of one country may be the felicity of another  had our kings possessed the nomination of the administrators of justice the aristocratic influence would have been considerably checked but most of the legal officers enjoyed hereditary and indefeasible right such were the sheriffs though esteemed the kings peculiar officers nay the peers were sometimes hereditary sheriffs in their own jurisdictions  even in burghs the aldermen and baillies were more frequently devoted to some neighboring chief than to the king  of the mair and serjands little is known an act of james i seems to evince that the office of mair and kings serjand was synonymous and it shows that the barons had also their serjands the mair was destinguished by a red wand the officer of regality by a similar badge red at one end and white at the other while the baron serjand had a white wand and he of the burgh a red all bore horns to sound occasionally acts f    another statute f v    mentions mairs of fee or hereditary of the sheriffdom or of part and authorizes them to have deputies to execute arrests and summonses it is suspected that the murmor of the eleventh century enq into sc hist ii     was the mur mar or great mair of a province a term synonymous to the ancient earl in the glossary of ducange the word mair or major implies in numerous instances great authority the office of coroner seems to have confined to criminal cases that of mair to civil in the isle of man there were moares for every sheading or district of three parishes order of the tinwald      in townleys journal whitehaven      ii         by one of those singular changes which occur in society the sheriff remains a most honorable office and the mair formerly almost his equal has dwindled into the bailiff  the terms mair and serjand have varied more in signification than perhaps any others even now a sergeant at law is a very remote office from a sergeant in the army and a maire of paris from a scottish mair in its primitive meaning the term mair is in various countries of high dignity but had now been degraded in scotland from the magistrate to the messenger the mair and sergeants were the heralds of the law but their office was in those times arduous and honorable and worthy of the attention of the legislature even these offices were often hereditary and skene mentions that in his time there were mairs of fee de verb sign voce marus   the legal jurisdiction of the crown chiefly appeared in the brief or short writ issued from the chancery these brieves were of two kinds one directed to the sheriff or the mair or serjand messengers of the law ordering the party to be cited the other empowering the judge to try the cause home hist law tracts p       the royal power though eminent in times of peace and uncircurnscribed by any senate was nevertheless balanced by that of the aristocracy which during war or minorities even assumed the ascendancy coronation oaths are solemn trifles and they appear unknown to our old annals according to nisbet her ii     the clergy peers and commons in order asked the new sovereign if he were willing to accept the crown which being put on his head a bishop cried god bless the king another answered god bless the people and the king and again god bless the king and the people  the baron was in fact a king in his own jurisdiction and the operation of the laws was directed by his loyalty or his dissatisfaction the former was hardly to be secured except by a munificence which weakened the royal revenue and power this avaricious spirit of the nobility was increased by the accession of the house of stuart and the peculiar circumstances which accompanied that event a family formerly their equal ascended the throne there was no regal ancestry no foreign splendour to command awe and obedience and a dubious loyalty was only to be won by concessions or promises fatal to the constitutional ascendency of the crown age weakness regencies conspired to increase the wealth and preponderance of the aristocracy and when james i regained his scepter many an effort was required in order to replace its chief gems  the few peers their number hardly exceeding twenty continued to be chiefly denominated from the counties into which scotland was then divided the chief deviations were that there never was an earl of mearns but crawford supplied the place levenx or the banks of the leven now lennox gave a title corresponding to dumbartonshire yet so strong was the original idea that bowar     confounds the counties with the carldoms strathern was a county palatine earls david and walter stuart euphemia the countess and john stuart   0  du tillet     all appear as palatines the title of thane seems to have been introduced after the time of malcom iii and existed long in scotland robert ii grants the thanedom of kintore to the earl of moray reserving the office of the free tenants scotst call harl   0  p    james i grants a charter to donald thane of caldor id no    0 the same ms records a charter to john meyners of the office of  cochachderatie of kyncollonie and lands of ferrochie and coulentyne lyland in the abthanrie of dull yet the difference between a thane and baron is unknown and some doubts arise that ignorance may have blended the saxon thane and the irish tanist  the military force of the shire and the greater part of its civil jurisdiction were in the hands of these potentates and the inferior barons were attached to them by tenure by clan by interest and expectation or by bonds of manrent  the progress of government legislation and the useful arts and sciences ought to occupy most attention in history but these pacific objects yield to wars and revolutions war unhappily forms the grand basis of the annals of man and one battle often produces the happiness or misery of many millions for many centuries hence the ancient classical historians are ample in describing the tactics of various nations while modern writers seem to vie with those of the middle ages in their negligence of this important theme which form its infinite consequences deserves to be arranged in the same class with the government and laws of a country  it is well known that the chief weapon of the scots was the spear often ineffectual against the english longbow because it was not accompanied as in the macedonian phalanx with strong defensive armor the buckler in particular seems to have been small and weak being only of wicker work covered with leather the sallad or iron cap and the doublet of fence must have afforded little protection against the english arrows which like the parthian even pierced the mail of the knight other offensive weapons were the brogged staff or pike the axe the sword the knife or dagger winton ms         acts f v   f     such were the arms of the common people but the chiefs knights and squires were arrayed in platearmour which had now succeeded the habergeon or coat of small inwoven rings and they wielded the battleaxe the two handed sword the iron mace or the spear persons worth ten pounds of yearly rent or fifty pounds in goods were ordered to have a hat or helmet and gorget a pesan braced before and behind with plates to cover the front or the thighs and legs and gauntlets the yeomen worth twenty pounds in effects were to have the habergeon iron hat bow quiver sword buckler knife and if not archers an axe or a pike the burgess worth fifty pounds in goods was to arm completely as a gentleman while he who possessed not above twenty appeared in the array of the yeoman acts f      james i was particularly anxious to establish the use of the bow and ordered frequent assemblies near the parish churches for the exercise of archery but after his death the national habits prevailed and among a hundred attendants of a baron hardly six archers could be found the remainder resuming their spears bowar      it appears that armor nay spears and bows and arrows were chiefly imported act f v   in particular the heads of arrows and of spears seem to have been entirely imported form flanders  the martial music as is well known consisted of horns some chosen followers were arrayed in the livery of their chiefs but the rest of the army presented a motley mixture froissart loses all temper in speaking of scotland and the scots on account of the treatment of vienne and his petulant knights the admiral says he told the french king that he would rather be earl of savoy or artois than king of scotland the force of which consisted of about  00 lances  000 men at arms and  0 00 commoners of no avail against english archers or  000 men at arms fol     t ii the common arms he describes as voulges hunting spears dagues or knives and bastons darmes   the discipline and exercise were trivial the arrangement was by clans on the march almost every man rode a small horse to save fatigue but none except the knights or fixed cavalry remained on horseback in a battle each man carried provisions for forty days chiefly oatmeal but meat was supplied by pillage the right wing became the van the left the rear while the center retained its station  the exact order of battle the arrangement of the ranks and files are subjects enveloped in much obscurity and while with all the lights of the roman classics it remains doubtful whether that great people arranged their hastati principes and triarii in single lines or in deep files there is less room to wonder at the carelessness of the monkish historians yet it appears sufficiently clear that deep files were used and that the battles or battalions were almost square though sometimes they fought in an eschelle or circle sometimes perhaps in the gothic wedge the eschelle was by the scots termed a shiltrum the host was sometimes divided into three or four of these shiltrums of the heavy armed and spearmen amid which the archers and light infantry were sheltered as by fortresses see holinsheds description of the battle of falkirk  thin files of two or three seem a modern invention long posterior to the use of cannon and fire arms but the utility of the deep masses formerly used is not easily discovered not above three spears could come into contact and the rest seems an idle depth exposed to the arrows of the enemy this theme must be submitted to military men and it is doubtful if the materials be sufficient for precise investigation  the most eminent or skilful peers who were present commanded the grand divisions commonly four the right and left wings the center and reserve under them the smaller barons acted as inferior officers in feudal gradation and often by hereditary right  in sieges cannon now began to be used instead of the sows battering rams and other engines the relics of roman skill but no memorable siege happening after the accession of the house of stuart and the scots having been singularly deficient in this art it is unnecessary to illustrate the topic  these remarks shall be closed with an abstract of the agreement in the beginning of june      between the earl of carric and other peers and jehan de vienne the leader of the french forces in scotland it bears that they shall march toward the borders on the twenty third of july and shall lay siege to some fortresses but as battle is expected their strength is not to be wasted in doubtful assaults that none shall pillage in advancing to the marches but shall pay for what they have on pain of beheading and all persons coming to the army to sell victuals shall be safe if any man slay another it is instant death if any common soldier strike a gentleman he shall lose his hand or ear if one gentleman strike another justice shall be administered by the captains in riots between the french and scots the byestanders must seize the guilty who if knights are to lose horse and armor if commoners a hand or an ear the like penalty for those who shall dislodge their companions or disorder the march all scots and french are to wear before and behind a white cross of st andrew if the armor be white it must be borne on a square or a circle of black cloth if any scot insult a frenchman he is to be seized by the french and brought before a scottish chief and so in the contrary he who unhorses an englishman is to have half his ransom none shall set sire to a church kill a woman or a child or commit rape on the penalty above mentioned of knight and common soldier the prisoner shall belong to that captor who first received his plighted hand if taken from him the captain shall order restitution if the prisoner be killed a reasonable ransom shall be allowed all safe conducts granted by vienne shall be observed by the scottish lords and captains and the french leaders shall pay like reverence to those of the scottish generals register f v     such is this curious ordinance which throws considerable light on the military manners of the times  section iii agriculture useful arts on these topics only a few brief illustrations occur though scotland was already denuded of wood as before evinced it was not owing to the progress of agriculture james i ordered that each poor person who ought to be a labourer should either be the half proprietor of one ox in the plough or dig every day a square of seven feet of ground a toil which extended through the year must not have been inconsiderable acts f v    his statutes also ordain that every farmer using a plough of eight oxen shall sow every year a firlot or four scottish pecks of wheat half that quantity of pease and forty beans under the penalty of ten shillings to the baron ibid f v     oats and barley were almost the sole crops not only wheat but pease and beans were extremely rare and peasebannocs were till lately esteemed the next regale to wheaten bread the acts concerning wolves and rooks and burning of heath at improper seasons need not be recapitulated stealers or peelers of green wood breakers of orchards destroyers of rabbit warrens and dovecots were all justly punished by this wise prince who also established a new extent or valuation of landed property home hist law tracts p     seq   the frequent wars between scotland and england since the death of alexander iii had occasioned to the former country the loss of more than a century in the progress of civilization while in england only the northern provinces were exposed to the scottish incursions scotland suffered in its most civilized departments it is apparent that in the reign of alexander iii the kingdom was more abundant in the useful arts and manufactures than it was in the time of robert iii  when james i concluded the commercial treaty with flanders it is highly probable that he invited flemish artisans to settle in his dominions with his admirable talents for government it seems impossible that he could overlook the advantages of a plan certainly pursued by his successors boyce f     affirms that james i procured flemish artists but a conjecture is better than his authority from bowar  0  it appears that james delighted in the mechanic arts   yet the evidence concerning useful arts and manufactures continues barren in a statute of      masons carpenters smiths tailors weavers are mentioned acts f     and perhaps one or two others crafts as cordiners or the like may be omitted the weavers were apparently solely employed in coarse linens and perhaps some woolen stuffs but while ireland from its english settlements exported the latter scotland had certainly no manufactured export the dittamundi testifies the export from ireland of say says or thin woolen stuffs  the rich were wholly clothed in foreign products which seem even to have furnished the holiday dresses of the poor  section iv commerce money navigation the grand emporia of commerce at this period were venice england flanders and the hanse towns venice in particular concentrated the commerce of the east and south and flanders that of the west and north hence the extreme opulence of the netherlands and the rapid progress of their useful and luxurious arts to them almost the whole scottish trade was confined some voyages to norway denmark and one or two of the hanse towns and some to france for wines formed perhaps the only varieties  the imports from flanders extended as has already appeared from froissart even to the commonest necessaries the exports by the account of pope pius ii were hides wool saltfish and pearls scotland was long celebrated for pearls julius caesar is accused of invading britain to procure that precious article and there seems no evidence that they were found in the south alexander i had a vast collection dalr ann i    the tay still furnishes some pearls  the statutes further supply horses kine sheep various skins for furs as mertrik fulmart otter fox heart and roe and woolen cloths probably of scottish wool manufactured in flanders for scottish merchants acts f     herring fresh salted and red are also mentioned talch or tallow is forbidden to be exported  the customs on imports and exports amounted to about two shillings in the pound or a tyth but the extent of the trade cannot be ascertained ib f v   etc  the balance was however greatly against scotland as may appear from the gradual impoverishment of the country and rise in the value of the coin and no less than five statutes of james i appear against the exportation of money  the merchants often went abroad with their cargoes but none was permitted to use this privilege except he were worth three serplaiths of wool each serplaith being eighty stone weight or about two sacks acts f   skene voce serplath   campvere does not appear to have been the staple port till after the marriage of its lord to a daughter of james i the dam or amsterdam sluys bruges are mentioned as the places of resort and in the latter city james i founded a scottish chapel to be supported by some duties on vessels acts j iii      prohibiting further intercourse with the swyn the sluys the dam or bruges a statute of james i f    implies no staple as it mentions indifferently zeland and flanders the chapel appears in a grant of james iv      scotst call   in the old manuscripts of our laws those concerning shipping appear certainly not later than the reign of the first james but they throw no light on commerce it is remarkable that they always name berwick in mentioning a seaport and bourdeaux is almost the only foreign haven known to their doubtful pages they are merely private regulations probably english and composed at berwick which when ships were of fifty tons aspired to be a port and even so late as the reign of james v demanded to be considered as the staple for all scottish salmon imported into england ms harl   00 written about    0 and perhaps the oldest extant of the regiam majestatem and see the reign of james v   domestic traffic was chiefly carried on at fairs an amiable and useful invention of the roman catholic superstition they were commonly held on the day of the saint to whom the parish church was dedicated and sometimes on sundays thither the merchant or the chapman brought his goods and the farmer and the peasant disposed of their products and returned to their wives daughters or mistresses with necessaries or little luxuries the cloths and tools of flanders or the silks and spices of venice and the east  yet the defect of industry in agriculture pasturage and manufactures occasioned as above mentioned a great balance against scotland and affected the coinage which till the year      had been equal in name weight and purity to the english in a parliament of june      it was ordered that the moneyer should issue coin of sterling purity either from bullion foreign money or vases and other plate and render out of the pound weight of silver twentynine shillings and four pennies or in other words three hundred and fiftytwo pennies those who bring blanks of france are to have the same weight except the loss of six blanks in the pound the english noble of six shillings and eight pence is ordered to go for seven shillings and eight pence scottish the french crown of    deniers for    scottish pennies and that of flanders for    and a halfpenny while the french mouton is to bear  0 the exportation of money by sea or land is prohibited on pain of forfeiting the sum and even the life of the offender to be in the kings power except foreign merchants who bring corn wine boards or the like necessaries who may export their profits register f     in the reigns of robert iii and james i scottish money was to the english as one to two the gold coinage of scotland commences with the accession of the house of stuart anderson dipl grants of robert iii appear to thomas melville officer of the mint and to galfur goldsmith coiner scots call harl   0  f     the latter was probably a foreigner fleming or lombard it is probable that the engravers for the mint also executed the seals of the middle ages the best productions of art in these times   navigation continued in state of imperfection the short and heavy shape of the ships with a high chamber on the poop and prow or fore and back castle large tops like galleries in the masts and other inartificial mechanism presents a striking contrast to the light elegance and rapid movements of modern vessels even the galleys or ships with oars displayed their high castles and a form far from agile the ships had thus less command of the sea and were more exposed to the storm so that it is no wonder that sailing in the winter months was strictly prohibited james i ordered with great justice that in case of shipwrecks on the scottish coasts foreign vessels should undergo the same laws as were practiced in the countries to which they belonged acts f v    a carrick of lombardy was wrecked near leith oct      bowar     to judge from what little evidence arises few foreign ships visited scotland and the little trade was chiefly conducted by the natives  section v ecclesiastic history literature language in the middle ages the history of literature is intimately connected with that of the church and it is a singular reverse of chance and time when literary men themselves the priests of the muses become enemies of their predecessors the priests and monks whose influence was only that of knowledge over ignorance during those barbarous times when science was neglected and force alone reigned a literary man could not pursue his studies except in a monastery and there is reason to believe that many cordially despised the superstitions which they professed and had like the ancient philosophers their exoteric doctrine for the people and their esoteric for the learned at least this seems the most rational way of accounting for the preservation of many classics and works of philosophy little accordant with the christian purity and doctrine and for some minute but singular circumstances in several sculptures and manuscripts of those times  that christianity had an eminent effect in the progress of civilization it would be absurd to deny its enemies assert that it introduced only new motives of discord proscribed all vigor of intellect by the imbecility of belief excited innumerable wars of religion a contradiction in terms almost unknown to the ancient world murdered millions for any absurd dogma and even by the severity of its doctrines tended to vitiate or madden mankind unable to observe laws repugnant to their nature but such are human affairs that no eminent advantage can be produced without great concomitant disasters and the objections proceed upon a fallacious ground as being estimated from a partial view of the influence of christianity in civilized times instead of a general retrospect of its influence on barbarous nations and periods the tenets of the ancient philosophers had been confined to a few individuals but the christian system was diffused through all ranks of men and its progress into the northern kingdoms is marked by the first dawn of science and civilization it was in itself a system of education and thus accomplished what no conquest intercourse nor form of government could have supplied and even where its first steps are marked with blood the temporary evil produced a lasting benefit by abolishing the constant wars and slaughters of savage life and the immolation of human victims to deformed idols reason has as yet had no power over nations and enthusiasm alone could produce such wide and lasting effects but while some may doubt whether any particular system of religion be designed by providence as an eternal fabric or as a scaffolding to hide and accomplish some great design let us be contented to ascribe to christianity its just merits in advancing the state of barbaric society  the history of the church of scotland preceding the reformation presents few important events and the chief are inwoven with the national annals only some detached facts and remarks are reserved for this place  the privileges of the scottish church are often confirmed in the statutes but are no where precisely enumerated they seem to have been an exemption from tribute and war and from the sentence of a temporal judge a judicial authority in the spiritual causes of tithes testaments matrimonial and heretical affairs freedom to let lands and tithes submission to no foreign church but to the pope alone a power of holding provincial councils for the regulation of the national church in benefices the pontiff had only the right of confirmation and deprivation and the purchase of any benefice at rome was strictly prohibited the bishops were elected by the chapter and the royal recommendation seems seldom to have intervened abbots were chosen by the monks alone the secular clergy were named by the proprietors of the lands these clergy were either parsons rectors or vicars many were in the appointment of the bishops and of collegiate bodies whose chapters they formed hence the lay patronage was much confined the parochial antiquities of scotland have been little explored but the number of parish churches seems to have increased since the reformation it appears from the foundation charter of the collegiate church of dunbar that a vicars salary was about ten marks sterling or about seventy pounds modern currency  many sees and abbeys were opulent but james iii seems to have been the first monarch who seized and made a traffic of the nomination  winton gives a singular tale unknown to other writers concerning the appointment of a bishop of st andrews in the year      walter danielston parson of kincardin o neil in aberdeenshire by some means took possession of the castle of dunbarton three years after on the death of trial bishop of st andrews thomas stuart brother to the king was

different ages among the ancients the chief repast at that time beguiled the fatigues of the day but the barbaric customs of a large dinner in the morning and a slight supper three or four hours after noon left the evening listless solitary and vacant the game of tables or draughts supplied modern cards and the minstrels now and then atoned for the want of theatric exhibitions the evenings of james

present unquestionable evidence but it is not in the fixed formality of such writings that the most interesting details of history are to be found and any regular epistolary correspondence concerning public affairs scotland cannot display till toward the end of the reign of james iv these remarks are introduced to solicit some indulgence for this particular part of the narration in which however no labor shall be spared to recover authentic facts and to place them in a distinct point of view bowar the continuator of fordun terminates his historical labors with the death of james i the scanty

narrative of english affairs abridging the real object of his work hector boyce closed the first edition of his fables      with the death of james i and happy had it been for our history if he had not written the reign of james ii at great length which after circulating in ms and being translated with the interpolation of two large passages after mentioned by lindsay of pitscottie was published in the second edition of boyces history by ferrerius paris      not only has lindsay translated boyces fabulous account but lesley and buchanan have been contented to abridge it without corrections or

except granted by the consent of the three states and to declare all future alienations void save those warranted in like manner until the king shall have attained his twentyfirst year acts ibid   in our defect of constitutional information it is not to be discovered by whom this parliament was summoned late writers assert that this high privilege was exerted by the officers of state but their duty certainly expired with the deceased sovereign and the sacred truth that such officers belong to the nation is a modern discovery the same authors carelessly inform us that the government was divided by the parliament between sir william crichton the chancellor and sir alexander livingston appointed keeper of the kings person both accounts seem more than doubtful there is every reason to believe from the repeated oaths of fidelity ordered by james i to be taken to his queen and from other circumstances that the late monarch had by his testament appointed the queen regent with a chosen council the contemporary ms on the death of james i ascribes the punishment of the regicides to the queen an indication that the chief power was in her hands of the ms annals of this reign by sir james balfour a transcript has been obtained but they are of little value and chiefly abridged from boyces history he mentions the following persons as the council of regency sir william crichton archibald earl of douglas william lord hay great constable james lord lindsay walter haliburton treasurer james kennedy bishop of st andrews henry lighton bishop of moray mr william trumbull keeper of the privy seal livingston as keeper of the kings person sir james regards as possessed of the chief authority but this council is probably from some record as he dates its election   th march yet kennedy was not bishop of st andrews till    0 the bishop of moray was john winchester lighton was bishop of aberdeen keiths bishops so much for sir jamess accuracy  from scotstarvets calendars the

of the privy seal sir robert lauder of edrington and bass justiciary john railston secretary richard craig director of chancery walter haliburton treasurer john shevis clerk of register nicol ottirburn official of lothian    that the parliament was called by the regency and that crichton and livingston were not indebted to the national council for their power but derived it from the will of james i it is most improbable that a proud aristocracy should have forsaken their pretensions upon this great occasion but that the late king should have appointed two gentlemen of reputed wisdom and integrity in opposition to the dangerous ambition of the nobles is concordant with his character and highly credible a similar series of events ensued to those which occur in the minority of james v the spirit of the nation and of the times was little adapted to the conduct of a female hand not only feeble but exposed to just suspicion because the queen was a native of england between which country and scotland had long subsisted either open enmity or inveterate jealousy finding that her power could not command confidence nor influence she soon shrunk from it and left crichton and livingston to maintain their turbulent elevation  an open war with england had taken place before the death of james i and the spirit of that prince was not such as to solicit peace but the present state of scotland under the distractions of a minority rendered a treaty desirable after some negotiation    sept a safe conduct was granted by henry vi to john bishop of glasgow alexander seton of

erroneously supposes the murder of james i to have happened between the commissions of september and november a strange mistake as any scottish history might have shown that it happened in lent   if we credit the doubtful accounts which we have of this reign crichton had found means probably by the superior influence of his office as chancellor to gain possession of the infant king whom he retained in the castle of edinburgh the queen favoring the just claim of livingston by a stratagem obtained and conveyed her son to stirling and delivered him to the care of his legal guardian the

livingston confined him and his elder brother and even the queen till they engaged not to support the house of douglas    0 the fruit of livingstons insolence was that the chancellor by another stratagem recovered the possession of the kings person and conveyed him to edinburgh but by the mediation of friends a lasting agreement was at length formed between them and the king was committed to livingstons care as ordered by his deceased father boyce lib xviii lindsays translation        the imprisonment of the queen is evidenced by a charter to alexander napier comptroller for his service

of a chief magistrate bound equally with the meanest subject to an obedience to the laws yet it may be suspected that this new style used by the parliament flowed from temporary circumstances and not from fixed principles of the constitution the nonage of the king evidently pointing the act to those who had the custody of his person as implying that the sovereign was not to be the prisoner of an individual but the free inspector of his kingdom at large  the power of the house of douglas had arisen to a formidable height and was during this reign to contend with the royal authority galloway annandale and other extensive territories in scotland the duchy of touraine and lordship of longueville in france rendered to the chief of that family revenues perhaps equivalent to those of the

power of douglas instead of bearing with the young earls insolence in the hopes that a few years would infuse moderation and prudence into his conduct instead of secretly using the kings influence with the court of france that the foreign titles and possessions might be withdrawn from the family crichton resolved to cut off the earl and his brother a measure which might perhaps have admitted some apology had they been advanced to maturer age for it seems strictly equitable that an oppressor who is above the procedure of justice may be sacrificed to the laws without any procedure of justice but which while we consider the tender age of the offenders must be pronounced unjust murderous and tyrannical nay when the consequences are seen this act will appear weak and impolitic and will incur the bitterest charge of depravity that of ineffectual guilt  by plausible invitations and flatteries william earl of douglas his brother david and malcom fleming of cumbernauld a faithful

probably now discovered by both that the aged experience and abilities of crichton were necessary to give some stability and order to government and restore greater respect to the laws douglas seems to have found that by grasping all he would lose all and that the accession of crichtons talents and fame would much strengthen the power of his administration it also appears that crichton had never been cordially united with livingston but had from necessity only consented to concord and now when the death of the queen mother had left livingston destitute of strong influence he ungenerously made his peace with douglas by the sacrifice of his colleague it has surprised some that douglas satiated his revenge upon livingston and his family who were innocent of the murder of his two relations and that crichton was never charged with that assassination but it is reasonable to infer that there were powerful motives for this conduct the king himself had been present at the murder and in the jealousy of his authority might consider it as a matter rather too delicate for discussion douglas might have had little inclination to condemn an action which laid the foundation of his power and the intention of which was perhaps not unknown to his father who might otherwise have immediately instigated the whole force of the house of douglas against the government yet the violence of livingston

of the royal domains ibid  as many large estates had fallen to the crown in the preceding reign this measure seems intended to increase the kings influence in parliament and such was the spirit of the times that to increase the power of the sovereign was to enlarge the freedom and happiness of the people laboring under the worst tyranny that of a feudal aristocracy other prudent statutes concern the punishment of robbery the regulation of the coin and the penalties of contumacy against the course of justice ibid f        such laws shine like a coruscation amid the night of barbarism but it is

these appear trivial offense when compared with a grand measure now entered into by douglas and which threatened destruction to the king and the kingdom as douglas was by far the most powerful noble of the south of scotland or rather a petty sovereign in that department so alexander lindsay earl of crawford and john earl of ross lord of the isles held the highest authority in the north the policy and vengeance of douglas conciliated a league with these potent nobles strictly obliging all the parties to mutual defense against every injury ibid lindsay adds the earl of moray who was the brother of douglas and before in the strictest union with him compare mair     who only mentions crawford in july      douglas had resigned most of his lands into the kings hands and procured new charters notwithstanding any crimes of forfeitry etc committed by him or his uncle archibald scotst call    and to such a conjunction the laws themselves were injuries the monarch trembled at this confederacy the power of which was in fact superior to the royal authority but he resolved to dissemble for a season though the nation in a just alarm already beheld the king dethroned and the country passing from aristocratic tyranny and discord into a subjection to foreign dominion  an incident however soon occurred      which hastened the execution of the royal vengeance douglas had persuaded or overawed most of his vassals especially those in galloway kyle carrick cunningham and the districts adjacent into an engagement of attendance and aid even against the sovereign himself but a few of the more moderate and prudent were averse to such illegal ties and among these was distinguished maclelan guardian of the heir of bomby and a near relation of sir patrick gray who was son of lord gray and captain of the kings guard an office of the greatest confidence among some slight variations lindsay has inserted this story in his translation of boyce p        and its naif veracity is far remote from the manner of boyce in p        is another similar interpolation afterward to be used the royal guard now appears for the first time perhaps in imitation of the scottish guards of france

boyce it was demolished in    0 and threw him into strict durance upon hearing this sir patrick gray laid the affair before the king and instantly obtained a mild letter rather of supplication than of command requesting douglas to deliver the prisoner to gray the earl was sitting at dinner in the castle of douglas when he was told that gray a familiar servant of the king was at the gate and in some surprise arose to receive him with much apparent civility and invited him to partake of the repast during the enjoyments of the table douglas was revolving what grays commission could be and guessing the truth gave a secret order in consequence of which the prisoner was led to a green beside the castle where his head was struck off and taken away and a cloth was spread over the body the meal ended gray produced the royal letter which was received with all the respect of fraud and the earl having perused it said i am beholden to you for bringing me so gracious a letter from the king especially considering how matters stand between us at present the demand shall instantly be granted and the more favorably for your sake he then took gray by the hand and led him to the green where removing the cloth douglas coldly said sir patrick you are come a little too late this is your sisters son but he wants the head take his body and do with it what you will gray replied in anguish my lord since you have taken his head you may dispose of his body then calling for his horses he mounted and said to the earl my lord if i live you shall be rewarded for your present labor according to your demerits douglas enraged at this threat called for his horse but sir patrick by the goodness of his led steed escaped the pursuit which extended near to edinburgh  the king irritated beyond measure at such repeated insults aggravated by the most sanguinary cruelty and the most profligate contempt of the laws and anxious to prevent the effects of the formidable league formed against his authority called a chosen council to deliberate upon the measures to be followed it was resolved in order to avoid the horrors of civil war that douglas should be inveigled into court by flattery and upon pretense that the king forgave his past enormities and only desired him to reform his future conduct boyce lib xviii lindsay        jan about this time a passport was obtained from the english king for douglas his brother james and lord hamilton joined with crichton montgomery gray three bishops and others to go in pilgrimage to canterbury rymer xi  0   this safe conduct was apparently never used and douglas and his enemies are so strangely blended in it that there is room to suspect that under the pretext of a pilgrimage of mutual repentance and conciliation a scheme had been formed to assail douglas when in the defenseless garb of a pilgrim  however this be the earl was prevailed upon toward the beginning of lent which this year happened in the end of february to visit the court at the castle of stirling lindsay p    says that according to the report of some douglas obtained a safe conduct from james under the great seal hume i     asserts this as fact and p     he mentions that this safe conduct was contumeliously dragged at a horses tail after the assassination that authors prejudices may be doubted yet lesley and buchanan confirm the safe conduct  after supper the king taking him apart into a secret chamber where only some of the privy council and the guard were in attendance mildly informed him that he had heard of the league with crawford and other nobles and desired him to break such illegal engagements douglas proudly refused and had the arrogance to upbraid the king with his procedures against him which had forced him as he asserted to form this confederacy the sense of repeated insults and of an outrageous contempt of his authority conspired with the present personal affront to kindle a flame of instantaneous fury and the monarch exclaiming

and committed to the candor of the reader  the death of crichton the chancellor who had long moderated public affairs seems to have opened the way to the succeeding tumults crawford off  0 dates his death      and is followed by douglas yet crawford    says orkney was made chancellor on the death of crichton and the former now appears in that capacity see in abercr ii   0 the fabulous titles of orkney so in      douglas peerage     styles william of nithsdale prince of danskin dantzic and lord of spruce prussia these gentlemen seem ignorant that foreign countries have historians  meanwhile

soon after a safe conduct appears to beatrix    june countess of douglas widow of james the gross and margaret widow of william with john douglas lord of balveny on pretense of a pilgrimage to england but probably to form treasonable connections between their family and that country ibid  the contests between the houses of york and lancaster had now commenced and the duke of york being at this period possessed of the supreme power he favored the house of douglas in opposition to james who in conjunction with france supported the interests of henry  crawford who had joined in the bond which proved fatal to the late earl of douglas had been punished with forfeiture but was pardoned on submission boyce lib xviii puts a fabulous oration into the mouth of crawford which lindsay        enlarges with family affection  yet moray and ormond the brothers of douglas again excited a rebellion in the north and ravaged the lands of huntley and other loyal persons huntley assembling his followers gave half of elgin to the flames because that part of the town supported moray and though defeated at dunkinty he raised fresh troops and forced the douglases moray and ormond to leave the north of scotland and take shelter in the hebudes whence they proceeded to join their brother in his grand rebellion compare boyce lib xviii lindsays translation    with humes douglases i     but the events of      are intermixed  autumn   to understand this rebellion aright it seems necessary to throw a brief glance on the affairs of england in the end of the preceding year henry vi a prince whose weakness rendered his whole reign one minority had fallen into a state of insanity and richard duke of york had been soon after declared protector of the realm as james was ever firmly attached to henry and evinced on subsequent occasions an eagerness to support his interests there is reason to infer that york excited or favored the rebellion of douglas in order to prevent james from an interference in the affairs of england nor in case of the success of douglas in driving james from his throne would the example have been unuseful to the designs of york nor the supreme power of douglas in scotland unimportant to his purposes the intercourse between york and douglas appears to have been mediated by beatrix the mother of the latter and john lord balveny his brother who as is abovementioned had proceeded to england and who were afterward specially included in the forfeiture of the family for designs on the scottish monarchy supported by english influence  when to the aid of york are added the internal causes the native ambition of the house of douglas unsatiated even by the highest honors of regal favor its latent but deep enmity excited by the destruction of two of its chiefs during the present reign and by other injuries and mortifications its consciousness that no monarch could ever sincerely pardon a family which formed one nursery of rebellion which despised the laws and rivalled the throne its apprehensions from the recent ruin of its power in the north that if effectual resistance were not instantly opposed the annihilation of the stem and other branches might follow when these considerations are weighed the sources of this grand rebellion may not perhaps appear obscure the inflammatory principles had long existed and were deeply and widely scattered the power of york the money and protection of england the overthrow of moray and ormond and the consequent stings of apprehension and revenge were only temporary circumstances which set fire to the train that shook scotland to its center  such appear to have been the causes of this grand rebellion which threatened to overturn the scottish throne and which our elder writers ignorantly consider as a prolongation of that which arose in      on the assassination of william earl of douglas but which as is evident from original documents above adduced was wholly extinguished in that year later writers have either followed their example in confounding distinct events or have under the general term of england blended the remote and opposite interests of york and of henry they also tell us that soon after the death of the former earl beatrix his mother and margaret the fair maid of galloway his widow took refuge in england that douglas accepted the embassy in the view of securing the hand of margaret whose domains were large and in order to obtain a dispensation he afterward procured a safe conduct for a pretended pilgrimage to rome the safe conduct is for four years and might be intended as a resource in case the rebellion failed and whether henry or york should happen to be in power  that a dispensation being refused he nevertheless wedded margaret who in disgust fled to the scottish king and he bestowing her in marriage on his uterine brother athole the consequence was a civil war but there is no evidence that james now earl of douglas wedded his brothers widow or that she returned to scotland before the ruin of the family the same writers who state this affair as the origin of the war also assert that douglas and his brothers were in july this year summoned before a parliament to answer for their crimes and upon nonappearance were declared rebels and forfeited this latter circumstance would of itself present a sufficient cause of the commotion but the difficulty in the account of these authors consists in discovering what new crimes the house of douglas had committed and the act of forfeiture      is infallibly the first and sole act against the family as is clear from the records  the facts and authorities about to be adduced will be found unanimous in the support of the previous observations above given nor is there any evidence that james had planned the ruin of the potent family of douglas as theoretic writers would infer for he was unprepared and trembled at the impending danger the instrument of august      the honorable embassy of the following year indicate complete reconciliation and though embers of jealousy might at this season be revived by the ruin of moray and ormond and by the kings interference in frustrating the earls design to wed his brothers widow yet the ambition of douglas joined with the other causes above mentioned will to a candid mind appear the chief springs of this memorable contest  unfortunately there is not for its commencement in the autumn of this year that clear evidence which attends its termination in the next the first events rest upon doubtful and inaccurate authorities the use of which necessity alone can vindicate and all that can be done is to select the most important and probable circumstances omitting such as are contradicted by the genuine records of the ensuing year  it appears that james discovering the treasonable correspondence carried on by douglas in england and suspecting his designs sent an herald to summon him to appear before the privy council or perhaps the parliament far from showing obedience that potent earl sent secret messengers to affix in the night placards upon the churchdoors of edinburgh charging the king with the murder of the two chiefs of the house of douglas and replete with insulting expressions boyce lib xviii lindsays transl  0   instantly assembling a small array james ravaged some lands belonging to douglas it being the time of harvest the king not only felt repugnance in destroying the corn but could not except in the most urgent necessity harrass his subjects by assembling a large force he therefore returned and dismissing a part of his followers he ordered the remainder to besiege abercorn a strong castle belonging to douglas and which from its proximity to the capital was an object of peculiar jealousy ibid   yet the suddenness of the attack on his domains had so much alarmed douglas who little expected such promptitude that he withdrew to the borders whence he sent lord hamilton into england to request yorks assistance and a sum of money was immediately remitted boyce lib xviii lindsay    after this the incidents of      are better authenticated by the second and last large interpolation of lindsay          the circumstances of douglas were now reduced to that crisis that the only choice lay between a bold exertion of his whole strength in the ardent execution of great and extreme measures or a patient submission to total ruin reinforced by the pecuniary supply from england by the imagined fidelity of vassals long oppressed by the martial influence of that name which a succession of heroes had rendered the trumpet of war he resolved to oppose his power in the open field to that of the king the armed force that would arise at the call of douglas was estimated at forty thousand men most of them from their situation near the borders and constant exercise in fight far superior to any other troops of scotland  james had sent the earls of orkney and angus with six thousand men to besiege the castle of abercorn when douglas summoned all his force to meet him at douglas on the tenth day with provision for twenty days to pass with him to abercorn there to rescue the fortress or give the king battle and force him to fight or to leave the kingdom surprised at this intelligence the king justly distrusting the south of scotland the chief seat of the power of douglas passed in a ship to st andrews and his despair even suggested to him an intention to abandon scotland but the prudent and respectable bishop of that see james kennedy a son of the countess of angus daughter of robert iii insinuated motives of consolation and of courage by his advice the king issued proclamations summoning the array of the north and offering amnesty to all who should now join his service and in a few days a considerable force arrived the royal banner was raised in st andrews and the army marched to falkland in order of battle entering stirling attended by the barons of fife strathern and angus james remained there till the more northern troops should approach and upon their junction he found himself at the head of forty thousand men he then advanced against douglas whose army amounting to near forty thousand among whom hamilton at the head of three hundred horse and as many chosen infantry was to render himself remarkable had encamped on the south side of the carron in his march toward abercorn  a battle was believed inevitable which was to decide whether james or douglas should have the dominion of scotland but bishop kennedy anxious to prevent the effusion of blood had attended the royal army and now sent a secret message to hamilton his nephew assuring him in the kings name not only of remission but of high reward if he would leave douglas hamilton returned rather a favorable answer yet hesitated between the laws of friendship and the advantages of loyalty when the haughtiness of douglas conspired to induce him to embrace the latter a herald arriving from the king charged the rebels to disperse under pain of treason douglas sent him back with derision and immediately arrayed his host and marched toward the royal army but seeing its strength and doubting the effect of the proclamation of amnesty nay thinking that he perceived its influence in the dubious service and fallen spirit of his people he conducted them back into their camp hoping to reanimate their fidelity and courage before he led them to battle in the morning this imprudent procedure was little approved by the barons and leaders especially by hamilton who immediately went to the earl and inquired if he intended to give the king battle or not affirming at the same time that the delay was full of danger as his people were deserting while the royal army was upon the increase douglas answered with contempt if you are tired you may depart when you please and hamilton that night passed to the king the other chiefs alarmed at his departure and suspecting each other also disbanded so that in the morning douglas trembled when he beheld a silent and desert camp not one hundred men remaining besides those who belonged to his household or were his immediate servants upon this unexpected change the earl fled to annandale where he lurked with his brothers till the ensuing spring in this surprising manner fell for ever the enormous power of the house of douglas which had arisen from patriotic heroism and was conducted to perdition by aristocratic tyranny and the most ungrateful rebellion  the events of the subsequent year are happily illustrated by original evidence      and particularly by a letter from james to charles vii king of france reciting at some length the termination of the rebellion of douglas this important letter is

land and was constrained to abandon the enterprise letter of james    july he sent rothsay herald to france with a letter relating this and the other events of the year   july while henry or rather the english government remitted letters of acknowledgment to northumberland the warden of the marches and others for the defense of berwick and the english parliament granted supplies to guard it against the scots who are accused of besieging it during a truce the letters of henry are preserved in rymers unprinted papers no      art         and are dated  th july regni    the intelligence was sent to london on the  d july the attempt of james was probably on the  st or  d as a recompense henry excused northumberland from his attendance on parliament the supplies appear in the parliamentary history ii     this parliament met at westminster  th july      ib   douglas was received with favor by the ruling party in england and a pension was granted to him for services to be done till he could recover his estates seized as the record expresses by the person who calls himself king of scotland rymer xi      when such is the language of a period depressed by civil war we no longer wonder at the truces between england and scotland and that no solid pacification could exist the subjection of scotland was ever the chief object of the english kings and a contemporary writer of that nation hesitates not to prefer its importance to that of france harding f v      the scottish court well knew that this obstinately weak and ambitious pretension might seem to sleep but was always alive  the transactions of parliament are interesting and important acts f    in f    appears a statute prohibiting on pain of treason any intercourse with douglas his mother or brother john lord balveny    aug the first statute concerns the annexation of lands to the royal domains and mentions that the poverty of the crown often causes that of the realm for which reason and others not expressed it is ordained that in every part of the kingdom there be certain lordships and castles perpetually annexed to the royal property and never to be alienated except by the advice of parliament that any other alienation shall be void and resumeable by the sovereign at pleasure with all the profits which have resulted and that the king and his successors be sworn to observe this statute this last clause seems to indicate that the legislative power possessed a title to direct the executive but it is suspected that neither the king nor the parliament then knew the nature of absolute power or of liberty the ordinance proceeds to declare that the whole customs of the kingdom as they stood at the death of james i shall be vested in the present monarch and to specify the lands annexed to the crown among which we sind ettrick forest and galloway which belonged to the family of douglas but no other lands of that house seem to be mentioned a circumstance unaccounted for by our careless writers and which probably arose from the other extensive domains of douglas being shared among the nobles and others who assisted in suppressing the revolt on the  d july      was a grant to lord hamilton of the sheriffdom of lanark forfeited by douglas see dougl peer     on the   d oct appears a charter to the same and euphemia countess dowager of douglas and lady bothwell his spouse confirmed      scotst call several new peerages were erected on the fall of the family of douglas see carmichaels tracts etc  the other chief territories recorded as belonging to the crown are the castle of edinburgh with some lands in lothian that of stirling with its dependent grounds that of dunbarton with some small estates the earldom of fife with the palace of falkland the earldom of strathern the lordship of brechin the castle of inverness and the lordships of urquhart and abernethy with other northern domains the redcastle in the south east of rosshire with the appended lordship of ross a minute limb of that great earldom probably retained by james i when he pardoned the earl of ross the lord of the isles as a key to that distant and dubious province  this parliament further ordered that the office of warden of the marches should not be hereditary that all regalities in the kings hands be annexed to the royalty and that no regalities be granted in future without the sanction of the states that no office be hereditary and that all offices granted since the death of james i be revoked except the wardenship of the marches bestowed on the infant alexander earl of march and lord of annandale second son of the king and afterward duke of albany it is also decreed that in the boroughs a council of eight or twelve persons according to the extent of the town be established to decide petty suits and that the members of parliament wear particular habits which are minutely described acts f       annandale had belonged to douglas   the national council having again met on the thirteenth of october took into consideration the report of an intended english invasion and gave directions concerning the arrangement of beacons and other necessary preparations they then ordered that persons suspected of treason should be imprisoned that none should pass into england in time of war without permission under pain of treason and several other regulations appear all relating to hostilities but not of such importance as to merit especial consideration to the apprehension of war was added a more immediate calamity that of the pestilence which extended its ravages through the kingdom and perhaps preserved it from any invasion at this infectious period ibid f         if credit be given to the late      and doubtful accounts of this reign two invasions of scotland took place this year the first was conducted by john lord of the isles who is said to have committed several ravages and even to have burnt inverness he then retired and was some time after pardoned on submission boyce lib xviii lindsays transl    when boyce is at a loss for incidents he has always recourse from the earliest periods to the last to a donald of the isles the lord at this time was john sutherland case chapter v p    douglas peerage      this seems fabulous and perhaps the same character may be assigned to the more probable account that douglas and the earl of northumberland ravaging the borders were defeated by angus with small loss on either side boyce lib xviii lindsays transl      from superior authority it appears that james enraged at the conduct of the english court in the supply and reception of douglas entered the north of england with a large army but was met at the river cayle by two english ambassadors by whose arts he was so far deceived as to return and dismiss his forces the fraud being soon discovered the scottish monarch in twenty days raised a more formidable army than the former ravaged northumberland with fire and sword levelled many castles with the ground and returned with some show of military fame contin of bowar   0 mair     boyce ever fabulous supposes that james was fighting on yorks side lindsay    the ambassadors probably appeared in henrys name and

in may    0 douglas peer    the marriage probably did not take place till      the confusion of chronology springs from the grand fountain of historical error hector boyce   a parliament was held at edinburgh    oct which published a few ordinances regulating the manner of national defense against england the power of the duke of york the enemy of james and the invasion of that country leading the scots to expect reprisals certain rules were established concerning those infected with the pestilence which still desolated the kingdom being it is believed the fifth great visitation of that horrid contagion the value of coin foreign and domestic was considerably raised so that the scottish money became to the english as one to three and some abuses committed by the kings officers in exacting the customs at fairs were repressed the most important act which was however altered in the next parliament concerns the holding of the sessions or high court of justice which was ordered to sit for three months at a time and was to consist of three eminent clergy three barons and three commissioners of the burghs to be changed each month and who were to be sworn in the royal presence impartially to administer the laws the instructions sent to france were voted sufficient but their purport is unknown acts f v          a truce with england      june where york was no longer in authority was negociated and at length concluded at conventry to last till the sixth day of july      rymer xi     york had remained in power till february this year to counteract him margaret proposed to the court of france that the two daughters of james i who went thither when the dauphiness died should be married to the two sons of the late duke of somerset her partizan at the same time margaret prevailed on the french king of assist scotland against the duke of york and loheac and breze invaded the south of england and ravaged port portsmouth de coucy  0  carte ii   0  the territory immediately appertaining to the earldom of douglas with douglasdale and the appendant domains was now granted to the earl of angus in which family a branch of the former it was to remain humes dougl ii       the earldom of angus passed to the house of douglas by marriage about      from george second son of william first earl of douglas the house of angus lineally descended and the present earl george was the fifth of that illustrious branch hume ii        this measure was imprudent as it raised the house of angus to a power little inferior to that of the preceding lineage of douglas and which was afterward too deeply felt in the kingdom but individuals learn from experience while nations and successive kings seldom draw wisdom from former faults that our monarchs were strangers to the fixed plan of humbling the aristocracy imputed to them by theoretic writers is sufficiently clear no sooner had angus succeeded to the power of douglas than the followers of the latter house joined the former see the bond of lord hamilton in hume ii    it is dated   th may        about this time a negotiation was proceeding at paris      concerning the claim of denmark to an annual sum for the cession of the hebudes about two centuries before torf orc     a singular lawsuit happened this year between james and lord erskine concerning the earldom of mar and the king unjustly gained the cause nor was the family of erskine admitted to its right till      see a minute detail of this grand process in douglas peer     seq  this affair unimportant in itself led to the reunion of the orkneys to the scottish crown in the succeeding reign  the national council        march being summoned to edinburgh distinguished itself by enacting a great number of prudent laws the ordinance of the year      concerning the supreme court of judicature was revised and it was decreed that the sessions were only to continue for forty days at a time but should be held three times in the year at three different cities edinburgh perth and aberdeen that is once a year at each place in successive periods this court consisted as has above appeared of committees of parliament and from a specification in the act it seems that the scottish parliament did not now exceed one hundred and ninety members each committee consisted of nine members three clergymen three barons three burgesses these distinct committees in the year amount to twentyseven members and the act bears that on this plan the judicial capacity of each member would not revolve above once in seven years which infers a total of one hundred and eightynine  the rotation of these committees of justice was a laudable measure and partook more of a free constitution than the foundation of james v originally projected by john duke of albany on the model of a french judicatory parliament after despotism had tainted the government of france this institution also contributes somewhat to instruct us how a french parliament dwindled into a court of law particular regulations were enacted concerning the causes to be tried by this court of session and the mode of procedure      but it is unjustly and impoliticly ordered that the members should defray their own expenses other acts concern the regulation of the coin of the hospitals and of military discipline particularly for the encouragement of archery a curious sumptuary law appears which shall be reserved for future consideration and one common rate of measure is ordered to be followed through the kingdom the decrees for the promotion of agriculture deserve applause they ordain that lands may be let in feefarm and that the king shall set the example that woods trees and hedges be planted that wheat peace and beans be regularly sown game is recommended to preservation wolves and birds of prey to destruction a decent and peaceable attendance on the courts of justice is enforced the violent seizure of lands is guarded against he who attains the royal remission is nevertheless to make compensation to the plaintiff for any robbery or spoil negligent or corrupt officers of justice are to lose their office and profits for a year and a day if heritable if not for ever acts f v     f v      the famous statute of james i is confirmed concerning leasing making or the propagation of falsehoods between the king and the people ibid f    c  00  a law perhaps not deserving of much blame during the struggles between monarchy and aristocracy but which afterward became an oppressive engine of state two other acts particularly regard the constitution by the one it is wisely ordained that no leagues or bonds of association be entered into nor any commotions raised under the pain of confiscation and even the life of the guilty to be in the kings mercy and that under the same penalty no inhabitants of boroughs shall engage in bonds of attendance or ride in armor save with the king his officers or the lord of the borough the other act declares that no freeholder that holds of the king a property of less value than twenty pounds a year be constrained to come to the parliament or general council as a member except he be a baron or be commanded by the kings officer or writ acts f v    c    and f    c     this ordinance really intended as a relief of the subjects at a period when attendance on parliament was regarded as a burdensome expense and loss of time has been construed into an intention of undue influence  the patriotic exertions of this last parliament of james ii are terminated with a decree that the proper officers order its statutes to be copied and proclaimed through the kingdom in order that none may pretend ignorance the members conclude with an affecting peroration to the effect that since god has sent their sovereign such prosperity that all rebels and infringers of justice are banished and no party able to excite commotion remains in the realm if the king and his ministers be inclined to the quiet and utility of the state and to dispense justice and equity among the people the parliament therefore exhorts and requires the monarch diligently to enforce these statutes that he may meet with the approbation of heaven and of all his subjects and expresses gratitude to god who has sent them such a prince to be their governor and defender ibid f    c  0   alas two short years were to close their hopes and their gratitude a fatal chance was again to reduce scotland to the confusions of a minority and to retard the civilization and the glory of that illfated kingdom that the happiness of millions should depend upon the infancy of one is a paradox in human affairs which may provoke the smiles of those who think and the tears of those who feel but such instances seldom occur and must be suffered to avoid greater evils severe however as are the misfortunes of elective monarchy when compared with the hereditary calamities of scotland they lose their terrors and assume the aspect of felicity  plenipotentiaries were named      july to extend the truce with england which expired this year and it was prolonged for nine years to the  th july      rymer xi     it is dated    sept and

other curious deeds in scotstarvets calendars is a grant to john dalrumpill the kings merchant for services at home and abroad jan and aug in feb james issued a singular and rather arbitrary mandate forbidding john swift a burgess of edinburgh to disinherit his eldest son it is published by hay vind of e more p      a commission was issued to sir william monipeny of rattray nov and mr john kennedy provost of st andrews to proceed on an embassy to france and demand the earldom of xaintonge which had been granted to james i they were also to form a treaty with castille and to join patrick fokart captain of the scottish guard in ascertaining and settling the debt due by scotland to denmark and afterward to pass to rome with mr hugh douglas archdeacon of st andrews in order to testify the kings obedience to the new pontiff pius ii scotst call   in the deficiency of historical materials    0 it is not easy to discover the pretenses or causes which induced james to break the truce by besieging roxburgh it is certain that in june he sent ambassadors to england to confirm the truce and to compose any slight infringements which might have occurred since its commencement rymer xi      and that on the third of august he was slain that in the contest between the families of york and lancaster the scottish monarch inclined to the latter is to be inferred from his personal relation by the mother with the families of somerset and gaunt and from the assistance lent by the french king his ally to henry vi and is ascertained by the treaties when henry maintained his authority and the intervals of war when york was in power and by the flight of henry and his queen into scotland the castle of roxburgh was in the custody of william nevil lord fauconberg of the house of warwick the chief pillar of yorks honorable cause calendars of ancient charters    h   p      it appears therefore that the embassy of june which consisted of not less than two bishops three abbots and three peers had far superior intentions to those expressed in the commission and was sent to promise aid to henry upon certain previous terms probably that roxburgh and berwick held by the enemies of henry should be restored to scotland if taken by james on the tenth of july the lancastrians had been defeated at northampton and henry reduced to captivity an event which seems instantly to have excited the scottish monarch to arms and he proceeded to secure the concessions in the first place as not only a necessary object of prudence upon his part but as affording a distraction to the arms of york or a motive to their blame by holding them out to the english as the origin of national disaster and disgrace  accordingly toward the end of july james with a numerous army well furnished with cannon and warlike machinery proceeded to the siege of roxburgh castle which had ever since the battle of durham remained in the hands of the english and presented a monument of jealousy and envy to scotland

the death of the queen mother he appears to have retained the chief management of affairs by the declared will or implied consent of the nation to the foundation of the college at st andrews this prelate added two other monuments of his wealth his tomb of the finest gothic construction      and a ship of great size called the bishops barge the former was sacred to the idle pride of the times but in the latter he might reproach his nation with inattention to commerce and maritime affairs and hold out an example for their imitation it is asserted that the expense of these three objects amounted to ten thousand pounds sterling each or a total sum equal at present to about three hundred thousand pounds but it is hardly conceiveable that even in twentysix years of prelacy and five of public emolument such a treasure could have been amassed eminent in knowledge of the civil law in the learning of the age in the experience of men and manners and politics the late king the nobles submitted to his wisdom as to that of a public parent nor was the bishop less respectable than the counselor of state in enforcing the residence of his clergy their regular preaching and visitation of the sick and in affording an example by preaching four times in the year at every church of his diocese by inspecting the maintenance of the poor and the education of youth and by the vigorous punishment of clerical negligence compare mair     who amid much praise justly blames kennedy for holding the commendam of pittenweem with his bishopric and for the proud expense of his tomb it is

the further security of the public peace high fines were imposed upon the burrows or pledges of those who had been obliged to give security for their behavior and afterward violated the paction this parliament further ordained that no person should send money out of the kingdom nor take more with him than was necessary for his expenses under pain of forfeiting the sum and ten pounds more an ineffectual provision for the want of industry and calculated to fetter commerce and increase that poverty which it was intended to prevent the increasing wealth of england rendered the poverty of scotland more conspicuous but we in vain peruse the scottish acts of parliament to find encouragement given to the woollen trade or to manufactures or any invitation to foreign manufacturers to settle in the kingdom on the contrary the regulations seem only adapted to banish commerce and in consequence depress industry and as it can hardly be conceived that the commissioners of the burghs were blind to their own interest there is room to believe that the overbearing nobles and prelates intended to crush the wealth of the citizens a subject of their envy and scorn the scottish money was now to the english as one to three and the scottish silver penny became a most diminutive coin so that it could not be cut into quarters or farthings as formerly for the benefit of the poor this parliament decreed that billon farthings of copper mixed with a small portion of silver should be issued being the first example of that coinage in scotland acts f     f v      the national council

of a weak or a pernicious government scottish money now became to the english as one to four a circumstance rather imputable perhaps to the increasing wealth of england than to the penury of scotland though in the latter country a great source of abundance had been stopped by the long discontinuance of inroads into england whence a degree of opulence had arisen from the spoil and the ransom of captives however this be the unpopular example of james iii long served as a beacon to warn the succeeding monarchs and there is no further alteration in the value of money till the reign of mary  among the singular incongruities of human affairs may be classed the fortune of the third james his feeble and tyrannic reign was in its commencement graced with the capture of roxburgh the reddition of berwick and the important annexation of the orkneys to the scottish monarchy any one of which events would have reflected honor on the able reigns of his father or grandfather let us then abandon the maxim that political prudence and success are the same the acquisition of the orkneys forms an incident so remarkable in itself and attended with such lasting consequences that no apology need be offered for entering into some detail upon this interesting subject  that the orkneys were considered as a part of pikland till the norwegians seized them with the hebudes in the ninth century      has been before explained when the latter islands were in      so far recovered by alexander iii that the norwegian kings resigned the title of their sovereignty to the scottish though the lords of the isles never paid homage except by a constraint which seldom occurred the orkneys still remained an earldom acknowledging no superior but the king of norway the norwegian line of earls failed about the year    0 in the person of magnus v and the earldom passed by female succession to malis earl of strathern his right is rather obscure but it appears to have been by marriage diploma of      in wall ork and orkn saga p      who leaving only daughters william sinclair obtained the orkneys in right of his marriage ibid     william was succeeded by henry sinclair the first of that name            he was followed by the second henry who died in    0 the next was william the celebrated chancellor who in    0 surrendered the orkneys to the crown crawf off     and in this family they long remained the undoubted superiority however rested with the kings of denmark to which norway had been annexed since the year      they continued to give the investiture and on the failure of heirs or any pretext of rebellion or neglect of allegiance might have resumed the property the norwegian and danish monarchs even considered the house of sinclair as rather invested with the titular than with the real succession and sometimes appointed other governors torf hist orc       when hakon vi in      admitted the claim of henry sinclair to this earldom his investiture was burdened with severe conditions   sinclair was considered as being appointed governor and earl of the orkneys by an absolute grace of the king   besides precise fidelity upon all occasions he is bound to serve his sovereign with one hundred men completely armed when required upon a notice of three months   to defend the orkneys and shetland against any invasion not only with the native force but with the whole power of his house   to exert both the said powers in assistance of his norwegian sovereign when he attacked any foreign state   not to build any castles or forts in the islands without the royal consent   to maintain all the inhabitants in their own laws   not to sell or impledge the earldom or the right to it   to be bound to answer for maladministration according to the laws of norway   to attend the king upon any just cause or at national council  0 to assist hakon against the bishop of orkney    the earldom is to return to the king in case there are no male heirs    sinclair is to pay to the king one thousand gold nobles the deed contains other strict clauses unnecessary here to commemorate nor need it be added that sinclair in case of a war must have chosen between his scottish and norwegian fidelity in a certainty that the possessions under both could not be retained deed of investiture in torf orc          in    0 happened the strange voyage of nicola zeno to shetland

circle of literature     the direct sovereighty of the kings of denmark and norway over the orkneys appears most evidently in the years between      and      when different governors were appointed as would seem during a minority in the house of sinclair for in the latter year the investiture of this earldom was by eric the danish monarch conferred upon the celebrated william sinclair afterward chancellor of scotaland to this great man who held the earldom when the cession was made it may appear that scotland was not a litte indebted for this advantage in      john sinclair paid homage to eric king of denmark for hialtland or shetland torf     in      the earldom of orkney was assigned to thomas the bishop ibid in      to david meyner of weems a scotishman ib perhaps weymes of weems in      it was restored to the bishop torf     earl henry died in    0 bowar   0 william was not invested till      torf       another object to be considered upon the present occasion as leading to the final treaty between denmark and scotland is the annual of norway as it is termed in a scottish act of parliament acts      f     when after the unsuccessful expedition and death of hakon iv magnus v king of norway had in      ceded the hebudes to scotland it was stipulated in the treaty that the scottish kings should pay the annual sum of one hundred marks as an acknowledgment for the renunciation this small sum as might be expected was rather allowed to accumulate than regularly paid especially when any commotions intervened in the scottish government the treaty had been confirmed by robert i in      and by james i in      torf      but in      the payment had been neglected for a long period and christiern i in whom the house of oldenburg had nine years before ascended the danish throne having at length attained possession of the sceptres of denmark norway and sweden and having in the preceding year concluded an alliance with france remonstrated even with menaces upon this account to the second james ibid     the name is spelled christiern miles christi by the kings themselves till about    0 when christian appears many papers vesp f iii  the object had been considered as of such importance by the danish monarch that in the treaty with france a special article bore that in case of any dispute with the scottish king upon this occasion denmark should be secure of the friendship of france ibid  it appears indeed that the sum demanded by denmark was large for the penalty of ten thousand marks for each failure was charged and the aggregate in forty years of omission arose to four hundred and four thousands of marks sterling or nearly ten millions present currency torf     speaks of forty years in p     of twentysix the last seems an error arising from a date      p     yet from      to    0 are but thirtyfour years see here may       after some negotiation the commissioners of denmark and scotland at length appeared at paris in the year    0 in the presence of the french king charles vii the danes only producing a copy of the agreement between eric and james i and the duplicate original of the scottish archives being in the possession of the bishop of st andrews the chief of the embassy who had been arrested by sickness at bruges the scottish envoys seized the occasion to start objections the penalty they affirmed could not be incurred as the treaty had not been infringed but only neglected and they even hinted that the long forbearance on the part of denmark implied a prescription charles wishing to conciliate his allies alleged the absence of the orginal treaty as a ground of indecision but prudently recommended a marriage between the heir of scotland and the daughter of the danish sovereign as the best mean of terminating the difference after some consideration of this proposal the scottish envoys who appear to have had previous powers assented upon condition that the arrears of the annual sum payable for the hebudes should be discharged and the payment for ever remitted that the king of denmark should abandon his right to the orkneys and shetland and pay one hundred thousand crowns for the decoration of the royal bride the danes required time to consult their court but in the meanwhile james ii was slain upon which event the king and council of france recommended delay and deliberation torf            it was not to be supposed that the scottish government would neglect an object of such moment and the kings approach to maturity recommended it to increasing attention the parliament of      had considered the marriage of james as connected with the annual of norway but nothing further arises till the present year when christiern sent to demand the payment expressing at the same time his wishes of amity with the scottish monarch in his answer james protested an equal desire of friendship with denmark a country of such proximity to scotland and so much connected by mutual commerce and promised to send ambassadors in order to conciliate this and other affairs torf         july accordingly full powers were granted to lord evandale chancellor of scotland boyd earl of arran the bishops of glasgow and the orkneys and other persons of inferior note to visit the courts of france england spain denmark burgundy bretagne savoy and other regions that they might select a wife for james and contract the marriage a general commission either intended to provide for a failure in denmark or to flatter the danish court by the appearance of choice and preference commission in torf      this honorable embassy proceeded to copenhagen and awaited christierns return from sweden torf       christiern i was one of the most powerful monarchs who had ever held the danish scepter possessed of the three northern kingdoms and of the duchies of sleswick and holstein pious prudent liberal and a lover of peace he was regarded with veneration by the neighboring princes who constantly chose him as the arbiter of their differences but the frequent tumults of sweden and the repeated ascents of charles canutson upon the throne of that kingdom one of which happened this year joined with the sums paid for the acquisition of sleswick and holstein had exhausted the penury of the danish treasure no king of denmark had ever rendered his influence so much known in europe by foreign alliances among which that formed with france against england was the chief and a connection with scotland important in itself was further recommended by mutual friendship and enmity these circumstances considered will abate any surprise at the conduct of christiern in abandoning to scotland the islands of orkney and shetland remote and little profitable to denmark and commanded by a scottish family of divided and uncertain fidelity  but to scotland the proximity of these islands and the universal belief that they had anciently belonged to the monarchy rendered their acquisition a matter of glory and importance not to mention their intrinsic value which was far from being inconsiderable the scottish ambassadors aware of the weight of their negotiation conducted it with zeal and prudence but could not prevaiol upon christiern to grant an immediate dereliction of the orkneys and shetland while his desire of the alliance and his poverty consented to impledge them for the greater part of his daughters portion the chief articles of this memorable treaty were   sept   that the arrears of the annual sum arising from the hebudes should be remitted with all the penalties and no future payment should be demanded from the king and queen of scotland their heirs and children eorumque heredibus ac liberis duntaxat torf        that the brides portion should amount to sixty thousand florins of which ten thousand are to be disbursed before she leaves denmark with the ambassadors and for the remaining fifty thousand christiern with the advice and consent of the prelates peers and chiefs of norway assigns the islands of orkney as a pledge to be retained till redeemed by him or any future norwegian king   that james should in case of death confirm margaret of denmark in the possession of the palace of linlithgow and castle of down in menteith with their territories and in a revenue of one third part of the royal income   that if the queen should in widowhood choose to leave scotland she should instead of this provision accept one hundred and twenty thousand florins of which fifty thousand should be esteemed paid upon the redeliverance of the orkneys provided that the queen did not marry any englishman of whatever rank ibid           the swedish commotions continuing to consume the danish revenues the delay of the payment agreed on protracted the residence of the scottish embassy at copenhagen and arran returned to scotland to lay the terms before james and obtain instructions concerning the conveyance of the bride torf      winter now approached and the ice and storms of a scandinavian sea being dreadful to the ambassadors and their fair charge it was resolved that the voyage should be delayed till spring      when arran with a noble train again proceeded to denmark ferrer f v     buch xii     the scottish peers envied not his commission but resolved to avail themselves of his absence by completing what on his former departure they had commenced his ruin and that of his family christiern had not replenished his treasury  0 may and his despair of supply prompted him while he alleged the swedish war as an apology to offer the islands of shetland on the same terms with those of orkney but a pledge only for eight thousand florins while he paid the remaining two thousand a sum now equal to about twenty thousand pounds torf      the offer was instantly accepted and since that period the orkneys and shetland have been gems of the scottish crown in    0 william sinclair earl of orkney resigned his claims to the

and their pride had created numerous and powerful enemies during the last absence of arran such influence had been exerted that james had passed from extreme favor into a total alienation from that family and it was natural that as he advanced in years and intelligence he should become inimical to a house which had so grossly abused his power and his youth as soon as the ships which conveyed the danish princess and her attendants had arrived in the forth the sister of james with a laudable zeal for her husband hastened on board to inform arran that scotland was now to him a hostile and

the relaxation of his government obnoxious to the united evils of anarchy and tyranny for besides a fixed inclination to despotism his impatience of slow and moderate measures prompted him to sudden acts of outrage and his favorites oppressed the people while the indolence of the king abandoned the reins of justice and his lenity to the bad was cruelty to the good his scepter was so little

annual clamours and by a ridiculous aristocracy the old council of each burgh is to choose the new and both united are to appoint the alderman the baillies and other officers the institution of the lords of the articles is lost in the darkness of the fourteenth century and that innovation seems rather an ignorant than a designed attempt upon the liberties of the parliament and of the nation but the present was a flagrant infringement of the freedom of the people and though the commissioners of the burghs were generally magistrates who gained by the court or by private interest sanctioned this measure yet the nation saw it in a proper light and the monarch soon became an object of public detestation another statute of this parliament speaks a new and strange language it is thought proper that the court of parliament justices court chamberlains court and such like courts which continue their sessions need not be continued from day to day but that they be of the same force until the time that they be dissolved the parliament by the king the justices court by the justice the chamberlains by the chamberlain and so in other such like courts it is unnecessary to add that the legislative assembly of the nation is here for the first time put upon the mean and dependent footing of a mere court of justice existing by the royal pleasure and assimilated in terms of contempt with the inferior courts acts f v    c    continued is prorogued adjourned it is risible to observe guthrie amid much wise discussion pass these acts in silence iv  0  while at a loss to find instances of the despotism ascribed to this king he interprets as such iv  0  the fate of the boyds and the marriage of the kings sister to hamilton  this novelty calls for a pause to discover if possible the motives and advisers of such measures  the youth of james at this period and the weakness he afterward discovered lead to a strong suspicion that some favorite minister or ministers were the real authors of the despotic procedure which during this reign disgusted all orders of men but so barren are still our materials concerning the internal government of the kingdom that conjecture and probability must supply the defect of clear information the power of the chancellor became in this reign yet more remarkable than at any prior period and he now obtained the high distinction of a precedence next to that of the princes of royal blood dr gilbert stuart on the public law and constitution of scotland chap iv p    edit       in parliament he presided and directed the lords of the articles and in fact the whole legislative body this office during the far greater part of this reign from    0 to      was filled by andrew stuart lord evandale the natural son of sir james stuart son of murdac duke of albany it appears to be a novelty in our history that one so nearly connected with the royal family especially when evandale and his brothers were legitimated by the kings mandate in      should hold this important office and there is room to suspect that evandale sacrificed his duty to the nation to the aggrandizement of the royal family which he regarded as his own besides this motive other circumstances conspired to extend the prerogative during this reign unhappily not upon the prudent plan soon after to be followed by henry vii of england in depressing the nobles and raising the people but upon that already established by louis xi of france in crushing the spirit and freedom of the commons with those of the aristocracy in scotland the people never knew their own weight and the government turned between aristocracy and despotism the nobles and the king commonly forgetting the nation which deserved the neglect while it silently abandoned its awful claim but till james vi acceded to the english throne and left the scottish nobles at a great distance and in a degrading inferiority despotism made but a slow progress in scotland and the chief evils arose from the aristocracy which prevented the progress of industry and civilization yet the conduct of james iii seems to evince that the nation could have no reason to prefer the power of the king to that of the nobles for the despot who prescribed degrading laws and expressed open contempt for the nation represented in its legislative assembly was yet more inimical than the aristocracy which even by its dissensions maintained in some degree the freedom the vital current of the nation a chief motive of the arbitrary procedure of james iii appears to have arisen from the temporary humiliation of the nobility who though still possessed of equal power as they were after to show in the imprisonment and slaughter of their sovereign yet were awed for a time by the ruinous examples of the houses of douglas and boyd the contemporary reign of louis xi    0       buchanan xii    adds the cruel example of edward iv of england    0       and the succeeding one of richard iii in fact james appears to have been more attached to england than to france nor is there a renewal of the french league from      till      recorded in du tillet or the ms leagues but the politics of james were in constant fluctuation see      seems also to have corrupted the counsels of james for not only did the alliance with france introduce at different times many imitations of the french government and institutions into scotland but james seems to have selected louis for his particular model yet as a man of abilities never imitates so happily in the present instance abilities cannot be imitated crimes and faults may and we behold louis reflected so to speak by james in the heavy suspicion of a brothers blood in contempt of the nobility and in the choice of low favorites in an appearance of devotion in attachment to astrology in avarice in a life of retirement and jealousy and in the love of arbitrary power in their attention to some sciences they were also similar and the patronage of louis to an ingenious foreigner galeotus martius is rivalled by that of james to another william roger the english composer of music mezeray abr iii   0 ferrerius f v   0  but the success of their political plans was very different louis assisted by chance and circumstances laid the lasting foundation of absolute power levelled the nobility crushed the people and by discontinuing the states general annihilated national freedom james wished to establish arbitrary government by the depression of the nobles and the people and by converting the national council which neither his abilities nor his power would permit him to discontinue into a mere court but he forgot that neither his revenue nor his authority corresponded with his designs and fell a sacrifice to the aristocracy whose influence resumed its former sway these reflections have been excited by the importance of the subject but their prolixity having already exceeded the intention it is proper to return to the narration  after a silent year in the scottish annals        may the first object which arrests attention is another parliament of which some ordinances deserve historical commemoration acts f     the statute of the last parliament against murder is enforced and enlarged that crime being again declared to have become common it is decreed considering the great poverty of the realm that none shall wear silk the importation being so expensive except knights minstrels that is performers of music and heralds and those worth one hundred pounds in the annual income of lands another statute shows that the interests of the country began to be somewhat understood it concerns the fisheries an object of repeated attention and endeavors for three centuries and now it is to be hoped the successful care of a patriotic society this remarkable act is conceived in these terms      the lords all members of parliament were denominated lords of parliament as a commoner or a private clergyman if ambassador was styled lord ambassador so dr magnus in the time of james v the custom is still retained in lords of session barons of the exchequer think expedient for the common good of the realm and the great importation of riches to be brought into the realm from other countries that certain lords spiritual and temporal and some burghs cause equip large ships busses and other great pinkboats with nets and all necessaries for fishing the execution of this object and the form and number to be considered at the prorogation of this parliament acts f v    c  0  but the subject was not resumed and the scheme only excites a sigh at the consideration how easily nations are excited to war or any ruinous project and with what extreme difficulty any plan of public benefit is carried into execution another prudent statute provides against the encroachments of the roman church now arising to such enormity as in half a century provoked the reformation by prohibiting the clergy under pain of treason to procure any benefices from the court of rome not formerly held by the popes disposal or to collect more money for the papal treasury than had been regulated by the ancient taxation of bagimont acts f    lesley     ridiculously dates the taxation of bagimont in      instead of       in this act the clergys title to free election of their dignitaries is mentioned and confirmed but two years after we find that james despoiled the pope only for his own purpose and crushed even this mean relict of freedom the monks of dunfermlin having chosen an abbot the king probably won by a sum of money recommended another to the pope obtained his confirmation and this new tyranny became inviolable custom ferrerius f v     lesl     buch xii     among the secular clergy also the monarch usurped the rights of the bishops and gave or sold benefices to laymen as well as abbacies and priories a source of great national disorder and discontent iidem ib lesleys invective against this odious novelty by which the alms assigned to the poor were consumed in the luxury of the rich is emphatic even the protestant buchanan murmurs high indignation  james was unconscious of the weakness of an unsupported throne and his wild despotism assailed all orders of men  nevertheless the scottish clergy now attained greater consistence and dignity from the appointment of a primate patrick graham the successor of kennedy in the bishopric of st andrews obtained from the pontiff a bull erecting that see into an archbishopric and to this new dignity he added the titles of papal nuntio and legate a latere instead of congratulating their order upon this accession of importance and the kingdom upon the honor and advantage of a metropolitan see at this period to be found in all the other chief states of christendom and the want of which as religion then stood might bear a derogatory interpretation and had induced and might induce the usurping claims of the primates of york a spirit of envy seized the scottish clergy by an offer of eleven thousand marks the bishops excited james to oppose and insult the archbishop reciprocal interests and abuses concurred to unite the king and the prelates against

proceeded into scotland and by gifts or promises prevailed on james to agree to a specific continuation of the english truce for two years without prejudice of the long pacification rymer xi     the truce bears to be sanctioned by james at the request of burgundy his ally one of the paston letters    april      bears that the earl of oxford was at dieppe and intended to proceed to scotland with

the courts of england and scotland edward iv was aware of the arts by which louis xi had endeavored to fix the scottish monarch in his interests and resolved to frustrate the design by the display of superior advantages in      the duke of bretagne had accused louis of inviting the scots to assault that duchy upon a promise of assigning it to james a charge apparently well founded for louis had commissioned his envoy concressault to persuade the scottish king to equip as many vessels as he could      and engage troops from denmark duclos ii       lobineau hist de bretagne i     the lords of concressault were of scottish extract torf orc     has johannes de monizon dominus de congressault ad    0 monipeny see       as the offer of bretagne was a proof of the artifice of louis though too gross to be attempted except with a young monarch and unexperienced council so the demand of a scottish fleet was a mark of his ignorance scotland having no ships of war and none to spare from her scanty commerce on the other side james appears not to have acted without duplicity for while he consented to the truce requested by england and burgundy he imparted their designs to louis and insinuated that he could listen to no proposal inimical to the french alliance at the same time he desired permission to pass through france in a pilgrimage to rome a design which may have proceeded from the known superstition of james but which rather seems from the circumstances to have been founded upon the supposition that his absence might excuse the scots from lending any assistance to france louis in return sent monipeny his chamberlain to request james not to leave his kingdom in the present conjuncture and the advantages offered by england inducing the scottish king to a decision in favor of that kingdom the advice of louis was followed though not the motive duclos ii     his work is composed from the best original documents even in july      james designed to pass to france and many arrangements were made in parliament records in carm tracts p    the intention of a pilgrimage to the holy land also occupied the more vigorous mind of james iv the violent deaths of prince david of james i and ii seem to have impressed their successors with an idea that the divine wrath impended over the family and that an expiation was due but it is impossible to account for the dreams of a superstitious age   to counteract the arts of france and to fix the wavering resolution of james the english monarch entered into a treaty with scotland upon a more solid foundation the scottish ambassadors who had entered england in july rymer xi      returned to edinburgh in october accompanied by the bishop of durham lord scrope and two other english commissioners who having met with the bishops of glasgow and orkney the earls of argyle and crawford and others appointed on the part of scotland established an alliance upon the following terms    oct   that in order to promote the wealth peace honor and interest of this noble isle callit great britane a marriage shall be contracted between james the prince of scotland and cecilia youngest daughter of edward iv both in early infancy   that the truce of fifty four years extending till      shall remain in full force   that during the truce both monarchs shall assist each other against rebels if required   that the prince being only two years of age and the bride four the kings shall solemnly engage to accomplish the marriage in due time   that the prince and princess shall during the life of james enjoy the usual lands of the heir of scotland being the dukedom of rothsay the earldom of carric and the lordships called the stuartlands   that edward shall give with his daughter the sum of twenty thousand marks sterling now equivalent to about one hundred and forty thousand pounds of which two thousand shall be paid yearly in the parish church of st giles at edinburgh the first payment to be made on the second day of february next      and lastly it was agreed that in case of the death of the prince or princess the heir of scotland should marry a daughter of england upon the same terms otherwise all the sums advanced shall be repaid within four years except the sum of two thousand five hundred marks which edward agrees to abandon in consideration of the intended amity rymer xi            such was this memorable treaty which had it been observed might have proved highly advantageous to both kingdoms and in particular might have saved scotland from the loss of berwick and from the ruinous battle at flodden the annual payments of cecilias portion may be regarded as a subsidy of importance amounting as may be conjectured to an increase of nearly one third in the royal revenue of scotland and the english policy in this advanced mode of disbursement seems assumed in order to secure the continuance of the scottish amity a lively writer has observed that a poor state which is adjacent to a wealthy must in the natural course of human affairs expect to be ruled by the money of her neighbor voltaire hist genesis speaking of scotland a d       and when we behold sparta in the pay of persia

down a scheme of policy concerning scotland which was afterward to be resumed and continued with success till the accession of james vi to the english scepter resolving to rival or exceed france in pecuniary gratifications england found gold more powerful than steel in fixing the fidelity of her northern neighbor while scotland must find an excuse in her penury and in the general defects of human nature for exposing her fidelity to the mutual temptations of french and english subsidies nor must it be forgotten that the most able politician might have been perplexed in the decision whether the connection with england or that with france would most advance the honor and interest of scotland so that no blame of treason to their country can rest with the receivers of the gold of either kingdom  the treaty      which edward iv had entered into had been negotiated at edinburgh a mark of friendship before unknown between the countries as the english monarchs from precedence of rank had ever insisted on the negotiations being conducted in their own kingdom to maintain the new intercourse with scotland april edward sent dr alexander legh his almoner on an embassy to that country he was instructed to give complete redress to the admiral of scotland for a ship fitted out by james himself which by a singular chance had been captured by the mayflower a vessel belonging to richard duke of gloucester after a long interval            it is with pleasure that original papers are quoted the instructions to legh occur vesp c xvi f     and as they mention that edward was

a change of political views was speedily to terminate this plan of pacification  of the next national council the chief statute concerns the importation of provisions   aug the congregated wisdom of the nation is not ashamed to declare that provisions being usually very scarce the chief support of the realm lay in the hands of strangers who import them from various countries and who are of course entitled to a favorable and honorable reception any restriction or imposition is therefore withdrawn and it is ordered that after the foreign provisions are entered in the tolbooth or guildhall the king and lords of the council shall have the choice at the market price and the remainder shall be open to general sale acts f v    c     the state of the kingdom may be better discerned by this statute than by volumes of declamation and it is almost unnecessary to add that this want of common industry led to a gradual increase of impoverishment for scotland possessed not like ancient athens or modern holland commerce arts and manufactures far more than sufficient to counterbalance the great disadvantage of acquiring subsistence by foreign purchase  this parliament also decreed that an embassy should be sent to the duke of burgundy at the expense of the burghs to confirm and renew the alliance formerly contracted and to obtain a ratification and if possible an enlargement of the immunities granted to scottish merchants and a redress of any damages ibid f     this potent prince had sent conciliating letters to the scottish court as the act expresses but could the parliament be yet ignorant that the dead body of burgundy had been trampled into the ice and mud before nanci on the fifth of january and that mary his only daughter was unmarried not having united those wide territories to the house of austria by her marriage with maximilian till the eighteenth of august but it is probable that the parliament sat a considerable time and that the latter may be the duke

king rymer xii     yet the journey was deferred and james was contented with striking a large medal of gold which he sent to be appended to the shrine du cange traite hist du chef de st jean paris       to p       the fresh disputes between england and scotland appear to have originated in this or the preceding year but their cause has not been accurately explained the death of the duke of burgundy which changed the views of france and england seems to have been the chief source of this alteration louis xi having been delivered from this dreadful foe and having secured himself from the enmity of edward iv by a truce for their lives by the punctual remission of pensions to the english king and court and by flattering edward with the marriage of the dauphin to elizabeth his eldest daughter there was reason to expect a lasting peace between their kingdoms duclos ii          00  in consequence edward whose temporary fears and interest had alone formed the treaty with scotland and whose only desires were money and luxury began to regret the annual disbursements and to wish for another war as a pretext of raising money for his pleasures and profusion but their sacrifice of the french alliance and their intestine commotions prevented the scots from hastening into an open enmity with england  the reign of james had hitherto been successful and fortune had showered favors upon him which to his wiser predecessors had been denied the acquisition of roxburgh berwick the orkneys and shetland the honorable marriage treaty with england the resumption of the earldom of ross were splendid events which prevented the eruption of public discontent at many new and arbitrary measures but james had provoked deep and inveterate hatred and having no standing army could not rule by fear alone a great alteration is now to take place imprudence is to incur the usual destiny and a thick cloud of crimes and misfortunes is to darken the succeeding years of this reign  the character of james was strongly contrasted by those of his brothers alexander duke of albany and john earl of mar while the king in solitary retirement indulged his favorite studies of music architecture and astrology he forgot the duties amid the idle amusements of a monarch the nobles in the feudal ages seldom visiting the court except upon occasions of business or high festivals and being ignorant of the arts in which james delighted he had recourse to the conversation of those who excelled in them but forgot the majesty of the sovereign so far as to make companions and favorites of men of mean origin imitating louis xi who had raised his barber oliver le dain to great wealth and high dignities but a stranger to the standing army large revenue and other resources which enabled that king to crush the lofty and exalt the humble cochran a mason or architect and rogers the english master of music were respectable names among the favorites of the scottish king when followed by those of leonard a smith hommil a tailor and torphichan a fencing master ferrer f      the contempt and indignation of the nobility were extreme when they beheld the public favor of the sovereign to those minions joined with a pointed neglect of their haughty order  albany was a sensible and spirited prince fond of martial exercises of fine horses and of attendants tall and vigorous in person he was of a middle stature strong and well proportioned his broad shoulders and blooming yet stern countenance engaged the praise of a martial age and his known courage if we believe an historian was the only cause why the nobles did not rebel against james while he lived in amity with this brother lindsay          mar added superior stature to youth beauty and elegance of person his gentle manners won every heart nor did he yield to his brother in the favorite exercises of the nobility or in his attention to the breed of his warhorses and in hunting hawking and every knightly pastime his skill and grace were admired id       the wardenship of the eastern marches had been assigned to albany for life by his father james ii to which the honors of governor of berwick and lord lieutenant of the borders had been added from his father he also derived the earldom of march and its strong castle of dunbar ibid the act of forfeiture etc  if we credit lindsay who somewhat depraves his information by representing alexander lord home as chamberlain since the reign of james ii while he held not that office till the commencement of that of james iv a violent enmity had taken place between albany and the homes and hepburns whose estates lay contiguous to his earldom of march in order to ruin albany his enemies applied to cochran who resented that princes contempt while he dreaded his power this favorite knowing the weak part of his sovereigns character procured a witch to pronounce to james that he should be slain by one of his nearest kindred and his children being infants the suspicion fell upon his brothers and led to their ruin buchanan imputes the kings enmity against his brothers to a prophesy of andrew a flemish astrologer and favorite of james that in scotland a lion should be devoured by his whelps which if a real prediction was singular in its accomplishment but the account of lindsay is more probable as the latter emblem could not point to brothers from the account of ferrerius which is the most ancient it appears that mar was accused of using magical arts against the kings life lindsay         buch xii    ferrer f v     followed by lesley   0  in our choice of weak motives we are however left certain that the tyranny of james was strong nor is there the smallest reason to infer from the base treaty made with edward iv by albany in      and to which he was driven by despair and resentment that he now entertained any disloyal designs far less any intercourse with england could any connections between albany mar and england be discovered preceding      they might vindicate james for certain it is that albany afterward branded the king as a bastard see letters of dacre in the reign of james v and openly assumed the royal title it is remarkable that the peers in      never objected the death of mar or exile of albany to james  which kingdom he did not visit till three years after his escape to france and even then was induced by the special invitation and interested views of edward it is however not improbable that albany and mar having also encountered the kings indifference shared the resentments of the nobles and with them conspired against the royal favorites who had sufficient interest and address to confound their safety with that of the government amid the darkness which attends the commission of crimes it belongs to candor and reason to infer a motive strong enough to blunt the feelings and corrupt the heart for human depravity cannot at once proceed to the utmost degree but when we speak of the good old times let us reflect that the three contemporary sovereigns of france england and scotland were all stained with a brothers blood  however obscure the origin of the tempest might be      its effects were apparent and dreadful mar was seized by the kings command and confined a close prisoner in the castle of craigmillar near edinburgh albany was committed to edinburgh castle and evandale the chancellor was sent to besiege his fortress of dunbar which soon yielded the garrison withdrawing in boats to the english coast the accounts of ferrerius and lindsay are singularly confused the former dates the flight of albany to france in      the latter blends events and periods totally distinct lesley and buchanan are more accurate at the siege of dunbar the lairds of luss and craigywallace and shaw of

excellent wines and sent to the castle to request the duke to honor him by the first choice two small casks of malmsey then a favorite wine were ordered and the captain in one of them concealed a roll

and having ordered the gates to be shut and set the watch he returned by appointment to albanys chamber to enjoy a collation and wine the duke and his servant were abstemious while they artfully engaged the commander and three of the garrison who guarded the prisoner in repeated draughts of intoxication secure in their sleep or in their death for according to some accounts the odious guests were slain albany and his domestic proceeded to a retired part of the wall concealed from the view of the watch and the rope being fixed and let down the servant first explored the dangerous height but from the shortness of the rope fell and broke his thigh the duke guarded against the same fate by increasing the length with the torn sheets of his bed and descending safely first carried his faithful domestic on his back to a place of security and then proceeding to newhaven made the signal appointed and was received on board the ship which immediately sailed for france the king was so much surprised at this escape almost from his own presence that he would not yield to conviction till he had himself examined the prisoners apartment and seen the spot and instrument of his flight

hawthorndens history is that mar being seized with fever and frenzy was put into a bath and some veins opened for his cure but he died through his own rage or the neglect of the attendants for this he

begin to be    0 more unfrequent and upon this account to deserve greater attention that which now commenced is the most memorable since the battle of sark a space of more than thirty years and similar distances divide the present contention the battle of flodden and that of pinkie the great inequality of the contest is matter of glory to the smaller state which unhappily either declined or was stationary in wealth and power while the other was rapidly progressive henceforth defeated in every great contest the spirit of scotland remained unimpaired and while her soldiers knew not the name of fear they might execrate the caprice of chance and the want of military skill patience and genius in their leaders the historian of the house of douglas hesitates not to pronounce that since the fall of that family scotland has performed few deeds of arms humes dougl i      many of that illustrious progeny were indeed born generals and the deficiency of such singular genius which depends upon great and prompt faculties cool intuition and a kind of prescience and to which the impetuosity of the national character is highly adverse was repeatedly felt by this warlike kingdom  if it be often dubious even in modern times which of two warring nations was the aggressor a superior certainty is not to be expected in remote ages some assert that edward iv was the author of hostilities while others affirm that louis xi excited the scottish king to arms the latter opinion might be supported by the treaty which was entered into in the end of the year      between edward iv and the dukes of austria and bretagne the foes of louis duclos ii      but as the french monarch pretended ignorance of that transaction and continued to pay edwards pension and to cultivate his amity dreading lest he should openly assist the flemings with whom the french were at war it does not seem probable that he should wish by inciting the scots to arms to provoke the decided enmity of england a diversion of a part of edwards force was all that could have been gained while the practices of louis might have been punished by the remainder other arguments against this supposition arise from the silence of comines that great contemporary and other french writers concerning this war or any part taken by louis in its provocation and from the reception of albany in france which argues no friendship between louis and james the truce of fiftyfour years and the marriage treaty with england having considerably impaired the connection between france and scotland on the other hand as is before observed it is certain that in      edward by discontinuing the payment of cecilias portion had infringed the amity with scotland whose resentment had only been suppressed by the commotions in the royal family and by the long disuse of war but to guard against any hostile intention of the scots edward on the twelfth day of may    0 had named his brother richard duke of gloucester the future usurper lieutenant general of the north and appointed him to lead an army against his inveterate enemy the scottish king whom he accuses of an intention to violate the truce and enter the english territories in contempt of his own same rymer xii     spreta ipsius nominis omnisque nobilitatis fama it is risible to observe the ignorance of abercromby ii     and granger maitlands hist ii     who

remained three days in england    but in the same of crimes edward and james were equal and to that of virtues their pretensions were similar some incursions having been made by the scots edward on the twentieth of june following commanded his array to be in readiness yet no important hostility followed till the ensuing year  in his aversion for war james sent a herald to the english court      offering to redress any infringements of the truce committed by his subjects provided that edward would condescend to the same terms but the herald was dismissed without answer a circumstance which of itself sixes the violation upon edward acts      f v     louis xi having fallen into the malady which in two years terminated his existence edward had entered into an active alliance with maximilian duke of austria who engaged to pay him a pension equal to that allowed by louis so that the english king was now at liberty to pursue his own measures rymer xii            march accordingly he ordered preparations to be made for the march of his army to the frontiers ibid   0  and from the writs it seems that a siege was proposed which it is reasonable to infer was to be directed against berwick the loss of which was not a little regretted by the english  to provide against the designs of the enemy   april a parliament was assembled the statutes of which and of some in preceding reigns leave it doubtful whether the right of peace and war was conceived to belong to the king or to the national council but in those ignorant ages no political department was properly divided or understood yet the fears and conscious unpopularity of james induced him to desert his despotism on this occasion and to submit much to the deliberations of parliament besides regulations concerning the length of spears and nature of defensive armor all persons assembling to the army are prohibited on severe penalties to commit any damage or spoil in the scottish dominions and the castles on the borders and eastern coast are ordered to be repaired and provided with garrisons and provision acts f    a tax of  000 marks was granted to victual berwick for forty days carm tracts      the campaign

and not of advice declare that if edward invade scotland in person the scottish king shall appear in the field at the head of the whole force of his realm and the members express their firm resolution to live or die with their monarch acts f v     those who are attached to systems the bane of history might build a splendid speculation upon such decrees but the wiser who prefer even inconsistency to system will be perhaps inclined to found little upon the fluctuating views of a rude age in which no branch of power was properly defined or circumscribed yet a degree of bigotry must be required not to perceive principles of eminent dignity and freedom in these transactions the parliament was doubtless aristocratic and the scots having unfortunately no house of commons the deputies of the burghs were annihilated by the pomp of the nobles and prelates but such had been the despotism of james that the cause of the nobles became that of the people perhaps the usual royal influence guided this assembly and the fears of james exposed at once to internal discord and foreign war led him to extraordinary concessions in order to strengthen his throne by popularity perhaps the aristocracy seized this critical period to regain lost authority and by plausible measures to secure the favor of the nation in the meditated scheme against the kings favorites however this be the loyalty and unanimity expressed by the parliament were completely delusive  other statutes of this assembly are essential to history it is ordered by the king and parliament of scotland that an embassy be sent from them to the king of france and parliament of paris to desire aid to assure them that james had ever been and would be ready to act reciprocally and to complain that louis had returned no answer to repeated letters of james upon this subject acts f     this furnishes an additional proof that louis was not the author of the war but did the strange compliment to the parliament of paris proceed from ignorance or from a design to collate the scottish legislature with a court of justice a high reward is offered for the slaughter or capture of james the exiled earl of douglas and even his followers

to lord evandale with the wards and marriages of all the vassals scotst call yet buchanan xii    specially mentions the title of mar as the chief source of the hatred of the nobility the silence of the records may arise from the crazures of merited scorn  this high honor disgraceful to the infatuation of james and of his favorite was followed by the utmost hatred and scorn of the nobility and by the execrations of the people but the new earl of mar unconscious that his extreme elevation was an infallible step to the deepest ruin continued to abuse his power and that of his sovereign and to increase his wealth by every species of peculation his oppression extended to all ranks of men the nobles beheld the places formerly given by the king to their sons now sold to mars followers the prelates and dignitaries of the church sighed at the increase of simony even the daily pittance of the poor did not escape for cochran had debased the current silver with a degree of alloy which rendered it black money a fraud which led to his ruin and that of his master and which has been erroneously confounded with the billon coinage ordained by the parliament of      which was intended for the benefit of the poor and was continued in all the succeeding reigns but this corruption of the money was peculiar to that of james iii and was such that the merchants and farmers rather chose to let the grain rot in their granaries than to receive the price in such dubious metal and the populace afterward repeated with exultation the prophesy of mar who when he was told that his coin would be recalled answered as an impossibility that day i shall be hanged in short the whole honor and welfare of the king and kingdom were sacrificed on the domestic altar of this base and covetous minion lindsay       0 ferrerius     cochran was of eminent strength and had first attracted the kings attention by his valor in a single combat buch xii      some of the peers had formerly assembled and consulted upon the means of delivering the realm from the disgrace and destruction inflicted by cochran and the other royal favorites a nobel deputation had even been sent to the king requesting that he would dismiss these pernicious counselors and restore the confidence placed by his ancestors in the loyalty of the nobility the answer of james was far from satisfactory but the peers assented to delay and dissembled till some decisive occasion should arise an occasion now occurred such as the scottish nobles to their singular disgrace have been accustomed to seize from the reign of the first to the termination of that of the fifth james instead of using the proper period of peace the proper place of parliament the day of war and the camp have afforded the ruinous scene of internal dissension and the sacred interests and glory of their country have often been abandoned by the nobility to gratify a just or unjust resentment against their sovereign but the fatal forms of a scottish parliament so well adapted to royal influence the conception that it was a royal court the incapacity of rude nobles to speak against an educated clergy ever devoted to the king the source of their fleeting dignities contribute greatly to absolve the nobles from this imputation and it is matter of regret rather than of surprise that they always seized the only occasion when their power was collected and firm  the scottish array amounting to about fifty thousands had crowded to the royal banner at burroughmuir near edinburgh july whence they marched to soutray and to lauder at which

hundred men armed with light battleaxes and distinguished by his livery of white with black fillets he was clothed in a riding cloak of black velvet and wore a large chain of gold around his neck his

earnest and so thou abused our princes favor but no longer expect such advantage for thou and thy followers shall now reap the deserved reward  having secured mar the lords dispatched some men at arms

conveyed to the castle of edinburgh without commotion or murmur here he was served with respect but was attended by some of the peers to observe his conduct and prevent his escape till he should give ample security not to revenge the death of his favorites to which he showed obstinate repugnance except this constraint his will was unviolated and the royal authority remained unimpaired ibid   meanwhile the english army had acquired possession of the town of berwick and the generals gloucester and albany learning that the scottish army was disbanded and the king imprisoned left a party to conduct the siege of berwick castle and advanced with the main force to endinburgh ferrer     lesley     buch xii     their subsequent conduct is not a little mysterious the capture or death of james and the coronation of albany might have been expected from the english treaty but the next authentic paper presents to us albany suing for his pardon from james and our early historians ignorant of albanys ambition represent him as the deliverer of his brother from the power of the nobles if with some writers we believe that james was not imprisoned in the castle of edinburgh but chose that fortress as a secure retreat the difficulty remains the same or greater the imprisonment is however certain from two charters ruddimans preface to andersons diplomata and notes on buchanan i      even records cannot atone for the want of contemporary historians and in such england and scotland are at this period barren that edward iv and albany were sincere in their agreement appears from its renewal in the following year which also instructs us that angus and gray were then if not before engaged in the treasonable ambition of albany hence almost the only rational view which presents itself is that albany finding a great majority of the nobles and the popular voice completely adverse to his unnatural and base schemes the continuator of harding positively says that gloucester gave peace to scotland because the peers did not join albany  was forced to temporize and accept a pardon and the restoration of his estates in the hopes that his presence and influence might strengthen his pretensions before their open declaration the acquisition of berwick would afford a prize sufficient to satisfy gloucester who might judge from personal knowledge that a delay was more expedient than the perdition of the scheme by precipitation  the english army amounted only to about sixteen thousand and the materials for a siege had been left before berwick hence the capture of the castle of edinburgh and of james could hardly be attempted by so few battalions liable soon to be surrounded or intercepted by a superior force a scottish army was actually assembling at haddington under the command of several patriotic peers and even the courage of gloucester might tremble at the prospect of a battle without the possibility of a retreat ferrer     lesley      an historian informs us that those peers prevailed on albany to pass to their party upon an offer of appointing him lieutenant general of the kingdom lesley     who adds that the earldoms of mar and march were to be given to

defender of james iii and enemy of albany denies the fact ii     but a partizan is little calculated to throw light where even a candid writer may be bewildered neither albany nor james were entitled to complete fame or reproach they wavered like the many between vice and virtue albany seems to have aspired to the government on the plan of his predecessors in the title robert and murdac this probably was the cause of his forfeiture in      and when he gained this in august      he was satisfied but finding that the former council of james contested his authority and usurped the royal power in the name of the captive monarch whom athole one of their cabal guarded he would naturally wish to have the king in his own power and seems to have offered to free james provided that he was named lord lieutenant of the kingdom and had a gift of mar and garioch this easy theory reconciles history and records  lesley errs concerning the resignation of the archbishopric by shevis so called

corn fell from   l to  0 s a boll or about of the english quarter     the parliament of december appears to have been wholly influenced by albany      but that princes unbounded ambition and avarice

of margaret the sister of james by whom he had a daughter named margaret crichton who died not long before our great historian composed his work nay according to that hater of kings before this adultery of margaret she had lost her virginity in the incestuous embraces of her royal brother buch xii     the reader may assent or disbelieve according to the weight of the evidence but buchanan deserves more implicit credit in the information that crichton was restored a short time before the death of james in order that his former wife now being dead he might compensate the dishonor of the princess by marrying her but crichton dying soon after this alliance produced no other progeny though many writers have labored the genealogies of the house of stuart yet the marriage of margaret

years to any persons guilty of treason murder setting fire to houses rape robbery theft or forging the coin he also consented to several statutes especially proposed by the commissioners of the burghs importing among less matters that merchants engaged in foreign trade should have a certain property and respectable character that no craftsmen should engage in foreign trade that the magistrates of burghs should be chosen as specified in a former act the act referred to in this important statute is not evident but it is mentioned as guarding against partiality and mastership apparently the interference of peers or great neighboring landholders in the election of the magistrates a practice to be reprobated by statutes of subsequent reigns even the act of      perhaps alluded to might have served as some antidote to this interference  that some commissioners of the burghs should meet once a year at innerkeithing to deliberate concerning commerce and the interests of their towns these transactions were popular and the states express much satisfaction that the sovereign has so benignly granted to them all their desires and requests but whether james really saw his errors and resolved to cultivate a new mode of government or those apparent concessions were extorted by his sense of discontent and apprehensions of a dangerous conspiracy must be left in doubt however this be the lords spiritual and temporal barons freeholders and commons engaged on their part that they should not support the cause of their criminal friends or relations by appearing with armed followers a practice frequent in this and the following century and which leads to the best interpretation of this statute they moreover engage to contribute their assistance to the exact administration of justice several ordinances follow strongly indicative of the height of feudal anarchy the violence of the great and the oppression of the poor the feeble voice of the law appears to have been drowned in the public tumult and civil order seems to have endured a violent relapse since the death of the first james the blame can hardly be ascribed to external violence time or fortune and while candor confesses the barbarism of the period and country it must at the same time allow that the relaxation of government by the royal neglect and the sale of justice by the royal favorites conspired to constitute the worst of tyrannies upon which a complete satire is authentically conveyed in the national decrees such was the increase of crimes that justices general are appointed for the division north and south of the forth to hold courts in every part of the realm with all expedition supported by their own power and what aid the king could spare in order to bring transgressors to punishment

rothsay and a daughter of edward the marquis of ormond second son of james and catharine the third daughter of the same english sovereign and that to conclude these contracts and to terminate the controversy concerning berwick which the scottish king ardently desired to regain a congress should be held at edinburgh on the twentyfourth day of january next another in may and an interview between the kings in july rymer xii      this treaty evinces the strong desire of henry vii to secure the amity of scotland and at same time the attachment of james to the english laudable in itself and concordant with the best interests of his kingdom but impolitic considering the period and national prejudices  the final events of the reign of james iii approach      interesting from their novelty and magnitude a gradual confederacy of many nobles had long been forming against the feeble and despotic government of this monarch but amid materials not eminent in opulence or accuracy amid the various interests and political views of modern writers it is difficult to ascertain the different actors in this important scene there is no evidence that the congress appointed to be held by the commissioners of england and scotland in january took effect and it even seems that the caprice of the scottish king may or some other cause had alienated henry who granted a safe conduct in terms rather unusual to the bishops of glasgow and dunkeld the earl of argyle chancellor of scotland the lords hales and lyle the masters or heirs of darnley and home with one hundred and sixty attendants

property the first and the last nobleman being the chief authors of the rebellion the power of the hepburns was led into it by lord hales and the treason of the lords drummond and lyle is equally unquestionable darnley or lennox is obnoxious to the same charge from the strong testimony of the earliest narration and from the mention of his son in the english passport which fixes a stain on argyle the less easily to be overcome as he also appears in the most ancient account when it is added that to these great names afterward acceded huntley errol the earl marshal and lord glamis the impolicy of james which could alienate so many chiefs must appear in a striking point of view and the rebellious war of douglas in the preceding reign sinks into unimportance when compared with this grand confederacy for the names of the peers who opposed james compare ferrerius f     lesley who however seems here to copy the former p     lindsay     names angus evandale the hepburns so understand his erroneous earl of bothwell home   0 gray drummond and from p     it appears that the men were chiefly borderers whom the justice of james wished to repress it must be observed that lord

the earl of northumberland and sir william tilder a singular obscurity surrounds the events of      and      james probably applied to northumberland to assist him by invading the borders the

important negotiations see rymer xii                                 in perkins manifesto      tyler is mentioned as one of the mean persons employed by henry carte ii      the professed intention to dethrone and imprison james and assign the royalty or regency to his son  of the events which preceded the decisive engagement buchanan has contrary to his usual practice given the most ample and accurate detail and the most concordant with the original records according to that historian james showed distinguished favor to crawford whom he afterward created duke of montrose and to angus whose conduct at lauder and attachment to albany he affected to forget but the kings dissimulation and insincerity being known angus regarded this new affection as only the snare of his own destruction and even suspected that his powerful concurrence was courted against the peers with a view to sow division and ruin afterward to recoil upon his own head it is asserted that the factious nobles being assembled at edinburgh jan the king invited angus to the castle and proposed to him to lend his assistance in making them prisoners instead of compliance the earl disclosed the design to the peers and joined them in their retreat buchan xii       the deep shades of this historian are somewhat softened he says that james proposed to angus to assassinate the rebellious peers but ferrerius  00 allows that the king had a marked aversion to shedding blood the assemblage of the peers at edinburgh could only have been on account of the session of parliament there held on the   th jan in which james as abovementioned created four new peers carm    with a view to weaken the old aristocracy but one of them drummond ungratefully joined the rebels on the rebellion of douglas      many new peers had been for the same reason created   in consequence of this most imprudent confidence after the desertion of angus the chief potentate on the south of the forth who could have assisted him against the rebellious inclinations of the remainder james distrusting the whole of that region resolved to pass into the north which remained devoted to his interests with his usual imprudence he crossed the forth in one of sir andrew woods vessels employed in the flemish trade a report immediately spread that the king overcome by his fears had quitted the realm to retire into flanders and amid the general consternation the rebels took the castle of dunbar and advanced to leith having issued order to the array of fife strathern and angus to attend his standard upon an appointed day james proceeded to aberdeen where the northern counties eagerly poured forth their bands in defense of the royal cause lesleys account         is very defective ferrerius f v     f  00 confounds the affair at blackness with that at sauchy and lindsay falls into the same error p        at p     of his history a hiatus should be marked before the paragraph thus the king being in order etc as all before relates to the first encounter and after to the second   the king now returned to perth with his standard displayed and followed by athole his uncle by huntley crawford and many northern peers and chiefs and by a numerous army as he advanced david lindsay of the byres who had gathered warlike experience in the campaigns of france joined him with a thousand horse and three thousand infantry if we credit the perhaps partial relation of lindsay the historian who adds that the king accepted from his hands the ominous present of a gray courser more fit as would seem for flight than for attack among others who furnished their array lord ruthven was also remarkable who led a thousand gentlemen on horseback provided with defensive armor and spears a thousand bowmen and a thousand armed with swords and mail when james had reached stirling he was followed by thirty thousand men who only wanted a leader lindsay   0 who adds by commons or exclusive of the common attendants of an army ferrerius  00 estimates forty thousand   thus prepared he advanced against the rebels who had not been deficient in their preparations april he found them near blackness on the south of the forth and an indecisive skirmish followed in which crawford sir thomas turnbull who bore the royal banner and innes of innes eminently distinguished their valor but both parties being sensible of the odiousness of shedding civil blood and dreading the absolute decision of the contest a negotiation commenced the king subscribed some unknown articles and delivered athole to hales as a pledge of their accomplishment the armies were dismissed and tranquillity was for a very short time restored even buchanan blends with this singular transaction some circumstances palpably belonging to the events of june as the capture of the prince by the rebels which if it had occurred would have rendered the deliverance of athole as a pledge useless a superior security being already in their hands nor does he hint at any conflict though the battle at blackness be mentioned in the creation of crawford duke of montrose for his services in the said battle scotst call    may      rudd buch i     of the same

till   0   thus did the timidity of james lose an occasion never to be recalled  the demands of the rebels appear to have been exorbitant and james eluding or delaying their accomplishment the confederates gradually extended their influence and projects till at length they insisted on the kings abdication and the substitution of his son in the regency or on the throne buch xii      the monarch learning this formidable design dispatched envoys to france and england to solicit the immediate interference of these powers by ambassadors to mediate between him and the discontented aristocracy but this mediation if effected was fruitless ferrer f v     lesl     buch xii     the royal heralds sent to summon the refractory peers were treated with contempt and personal injury and their written mandates torn in derision both parties again prepared to terminate the dispute in the field james fortified the castle of edinburgh may where the treasure accumulated by the unwise avarice of many years was placed and again sent to summon the northern chiefs to his standard  meanwhile the conspiring peers found means to corrupt shaw of sauchy in whose charge the prince had been left at stirling and the infamous governor surrendered the innocent youth who was conducted to linlithgow and by constraint was to appear guilty of a fathers blood it was artfully proclaimed that james sought the life of his son whose defense had called the peers to war and the princes name was itself an army a part of the kings treasure which had formerly been seized at leith contributed to provide wagons for baggage and stores and to attract the desperate and the mercenary lindsay       0 buch xii    our historians seem unanimous that the prince was in the hands of the faction before the affair of blackness but some difficulties attend that supposition and they as mentioned confound the transactions   james proceeded to stirling to join the peers of the north and west who were advancing with their troops on his arrival the treacherous governor denied him admittance in the north huntley errol the earl marshal and glamis had now deserted the royal cause and the junction of such distant troops as continued their attachment was attended with necessary delay in the impatience of irresolution james was led to commit his fortunes to a battle glencairn and other peers of the west having joined the royal army the king advanced to meet the rebels who had passed the carron and a field about a mile south of the famous scene of bannocburn was to be the spot of this civil conslict it is called little canglar on the east side of sauchyburn nimmos stirlingshire      the army of the peers was apparently superior in number to the royal battalions    june but the cowardice and instantaneous flight of the king terminated the action with small effusion of blood it was in vain to defend a cause thus betrayed by its patron and the adverse ranks shrunk from the horrors of mutual slaughter yet a few showers of arrows had darkened the air and the long spears of annandale had made an impression on his array before james left the field glencairn ruthven erskine and a few others of rank were slain and many were wounded fetrer  00 lindsay     buch xii    the date also appears in the chartulary of glasgow ms harl        as the king in his slight was about to pass the rivulet bannocburn at the hamlet of miltown nimmo   0  a woman who was drawing water alarmed at his appearance and rapidity fled and left her pitcher which startled the steed or disordered his career so that the unexperienced rider fell from the saddle and oppressed with the weight of his armor fainted away a miller and his wife conveyed their unknown sovereign into a corner of the mill and to conceal the stranger from any pursuers they covered him with a cloth some time after he resumed his senses but perceiving himself much hurt and very weak he called for a priest to hear his confession and to his blunt hosts who enquired his name and quality his impatience answered i was your king this morning the woman upon this ran into the road wringing her hands and calling aloud for a priest to the king it so chanced that some of the rebels were in the neighborhood engaged in disorderly pursuit and a priest one of lord grays followers as is said riding up exclaimed i am a priest where is the king being conducted to the place he knew his sovereign and kneeling enquired if he thought he might survive by the help of surgery to which james answered i believe that i might but let me have a priest to hear my confession and to bring me the eucharist the priest it is averred heard his confession and then stabbed the unfortunate monarch whose weakness deserved a milder fate than to fall the victim of a lawless aristocracy more inimical to public order and prosperity than the feeble despotism of their sovereign ferrer f  00 lesley     lindsay         buch xii    nimmo   0 says the house where this atrocious deed was committed is still in existence and is called betons miln probably from its proprietor at the time   on this important event some reflections naturally arise had james been victorious the power of the scottish aristocracy might have been crushed for ever and weak and despotic as he was it would have been better for the people to have had one tyrant than many but this monarch if we set the dubious murder of his brother aside was more weak than vicious and even when his feebleness and impolicy are mentioned it is rather in a relative than in a positive view for his conduct was chiefly blameable because illadapted to the ferocious times and people which required in the character of sovereign the duties of a magistrate and the valor and skill of a general had james lived a century or two later his faults would perhaps have escaped observation but the conduct of the rebellious peers whose sanguinary lust of power and eagerness to continue their lawless rapine opposed the son in open combat against his father that last infamy of civil war cannot be too severely reprobated they excite horror while the monarch attracts a reverential compassion loyalty in some cases only the virtue of a slave is in many the truest patriotism and it is no wonder that men of eminent sense and integrity have manifested an attachment to the house of stuart approaching even to enthusiasm for its interests in opposition to those of that wild ignorant and ferocious aristocracy which long continued to disgrace scotland were those of the country at large the exuberant power of the peers ever eager to gratify their private ambition at the expense of the nation was the sole spring of the noted misfortunes of the house of stuart a long reign it is remarkable that some historians hint that james iv fell not at flodden but by the hands of some one of his peers and perhaps a theorist might infer that the cannon which destroyed the second james was not overcharged without design but the deaths of james i the iii the v were caused solely by the aristocracy  a stable government would have circumscribed their ruinous sway would have prevented their plans of public plunder and they sighed for a minority a regency the peculiar season of their arrogance of their spoil the regency of robert duke of albany had taught them the sweets of sharing the royal power domains and revenue and had contributed to the separation of their interests from those of the monarch whose influence rested on their support and whose limited wealth and authority could little withstand their continued encroachments yet by uncandid or superficial observers the desire of our kings to resume their just magistracy and to enforce equal laws has been interpreted as a design to overturn the aristocracy while the royal measures were solely those of defense but as the peers really possessed the chief power it is no wonder that historians living at the period flattered as usual the leading authority and have diffused over their pages calumnies against their sovereigns easy to form and difficult to eradicate in england and in france the fall of the aristocracy about this time was occasioned by chance by the revolution of human affairs in the former country by the wars of york and lancaster in which most of the ancient noble families perished in the latter by a similar destruction in the struggles against england no power of the sovereign could have effectuated so vast a plan even in those more civilized countries and to impute such a design to the successive princes of the house of stuart seems the excess of system and theory the bane of historical veracity  james iii fell the victim of the ambition of others and not of his own he had held the scepter

exertion of human power or wisdom in india and egypt countries distinguished by the first dawn of science the natural fertility of the soil redeemed much time from labor and gave leisure to the mind to build speculations of knowledge and improvement of art and luxury yet that much depends upon the ability of the governors may be judged from the example of the lawgivers of antiquity and of peter the great and others in modern times  no theme can be more important than the means of diffusing civilization in a barbarous country yet the richest libraries will be found to present no disquisition on this grand topic sir walter raleigh has observed that the wisdom of one age is the foolishness of another and the remark is peculiarly verified in the labyrinths of fruitless science while the paths of useful knowledge are seldom explored many eminent writers have recently reviewed the progress of society from the forest to the city from the feeble canoe to the wooden fortress which conveys a thousand mariners and thunders its mandates in the most distant seas but the sacred plans of improving whole nations of educating the barbaric mind to industry and peace of speedily advancing a community from rudeness to refinement have not yet attracted the attention which their high importance demands the very theory would afford useful views and expand political and moral knowledge but leaving this vast theme to the sedulous labor of philosophy the present object only warrants a few brief reflections  amid the various questions concerning government it has rarely been discussed to what particular stages of society the different forms are best adapted one of the chief intentions of government and society is to advance the national wisdom and prosperity and it seems a selfevident proposition that a democracy of savages or barbarians would be a mere anarchy and that equality of ignorance and equality of misery would be among the most sacred rights of its constitution as the advantages of laws would be unknown it would be vain to expect a lawgiver to arise and the more sagacious could only consolidate the mass by the cement of some degrading superstition in itself the very strongest obstacle to knowledge and improvement but the habits of man forbid such a state to exist except in theory and an aristocracy of chiefs and of priests of strength and of wisdom is the earliest stage of society yet discovered in any country even here the smallness of the communities their jarring interests their continual conflicts present an insuperable barrier to improvement and such is the path of providence in drawing good from evil that the first tyrant who overcomes all the others and usurps the style of monarch may be hailed as the father of his country superstition the execration of civilized nations is in this stage most useful as uniting the people in one great body politic and as assisting the imperfection of the laws the blended tribes aspire to be a nation the government assumes a stable form the monarch must employ the most able men in the country or invite foreign talents to render his authority lasting and respectable and the court thus becomes a focus of civilization which must enlarge the more rapidly in proportion to the ascendancy of the regal power uncivilized nations may be regarded as in a state of infancy incapable of judging what is for their benefit and exertions even of despotism to render a nation more happy may it is believed be pardoned by the warmest advocate for universal democracy  such have been the uniform steps of civilization in all ancient and modern nations the democracies of greece had passed through the ordeal of monarchy and if the republican form of government be ever found convenient and durable in a large country even after the invention of representation it must be when the national character has been enlightened and improved in a superlative degree  no error can be more fatal to the balance of historical truth than the estimation of ancient times by modern ideas an institution eminently useful at one period may at another become most pernicious and the bane of one epoch may become come the felicity of another while in a barbaric country the regal power forms the chief engine of civilization and prosperity and an ignorant aristocracy the grand obstacle to these important ends in a more advanced period an enlightened aristocracy may diffuse multiplied rays through the national mass and kindle the flame of industry and improvement in the most remote corners of a wide empire may by their presence and example vanquish prejudices irradicable by the laws or regal power or by any democratic scheme in which the people may assert their right to ignorance and fanaticism in short whatever form of government most promotes domestic comfort and universal prosperity during any particular period of the national progress may be regarded as the most eligible without attention to any universal theory or predilection for particular constitutions a barbarous commonwealth if such ever existed without an aristocracy could only become enlightened by the conquest of civilized states sparta and poland loudly proclaim the disadvantages of an ignorant aristocracy destructive of all art science and national advancement that despotism is the worst of all forms for a civilized people the desolated regions of the east murmur with a melancholy echo  the state of scotland continues to present a considerable degree of barbarism during the reigns of james ii and iii the laudable efforts of the first james to introduce public order were followed by fatal minorities and confusions and the aristocratic storms again ruined the welfare of the community in impressive language bowar who flourished in the minority of james ii bewails the misery of his country long appears to us o king the time of thy arrival at majority when thou may be able to deliver us confounded as we are with daily tyranny oppressed with rapine and spoil when thou may dictate laws and exercise justice that the poor who among us have no helper but god and thee may be freed from the hand of the powerful may thou remember that thou art a legistator in order that thou may crush the robber and restrain those who deal in rapine the groans of the humble and the miseries of the poor whom i myself who write this have seen this very day in my own neighborhood stripped of their garments and inhumanely despoiled of their domestic utensils constrain me to exclaim with him who says i have seen the injuries which are done the tears of the innocent and no comforter and that the destitute cannot resist violence i have praised the dead more than the living and happier than both have i esteemed the unborn the sole strangers to the evils of this world and in another passage comparing the reign of james i with his own times woe to us miserable wretches exposed to rapine and injury how can we endure to live who enjoyed such prosperity in the days of that most illustrious king and now by a sad change of fortune experience the complete reverse cont fordun               it is remarkable that this contemporary author clearly indicates the monarch as the legislator a circumstance which confirms the idea formerly advanced that the king and his council prepared the laws which afterward received the sanction of parliament nor did james ii fail in the hopes which bowar entertained for numerous are his laws calculated for the advantage of the poor the preceding pages present the more memorable ordinances but a brief recapitulation may not be improper the strict observation of universal internal peace with the privilege of demanding a surety from the turbulent the equal administration of justice the punishment of those who assist infringers of the law the security of leases for the safety of the poor people who labor the ground whatever change lords might happen the privilege to farmers of church lands not to be expelled on a vacancy of the benefice the severe decrees against despoliation parl    0      etc the privilege to farmers of church lands occurs in a charter of    0 harl      vol i  a singular act merits transcription it is statute and ordained for the awayputting of sornars overlyars and masterful beggars with horse hounds or other goods that all officers sheriffs barons aldermen baillies as well within the burgh as without take an inquisition at every court which they hold concerning these matters and if any such persons be found that their horses hounds or other goods be escheated to the king and their persons secured till his will be known and also that the sheriffs baillies and officers inquire at every court if there be any pretended fools bards or other such like vagabonds and if any be found that they be put in custody or in irons for their trespass as long as they have wherewith to live and when they have not their ear to be nailed to the trone or a tree then cut off and they banished the country to which if they return they shall be hanged parl    0 c     this forcible lodging of some of the pretended great and idle upon the poor was a notable grievance and they are deservedly placed with contempt in the same statute which condemns pretended fools and highland bards by another statute these sornars are punished with death the country though long since delivered from such oppressive lodgers still classes sturdy beggars among its grievances see the valuable statistical account of scotland by sir john sinclair passim   this prince also regulated the customs exacted at fairs but apparently not with a sufficient liberality to trade james iii justly extended the prohibition and forbad any exaction from the poor who carried their little articles to the fairs      c     jean bonhomme has in all ages left a great part of his fleece either on the brambles of aristocratic oppression or shorn by the polished scizzars of taxation often only a circuitous mode of oligarchic avarice and extortion the regulation of the hospitals for the sickly poor and other statutes of humane import confer honor on the intentions of the legislature  james iii ordered copper coin to be issued for the convenience of the indigent that on account of the holidays and divine service no distress for rent should take place till three days after whitsunday and martinmas that the proprietors of ferryboats be restricted to certain freights that persons advancing to the army refrain from injuring grass or corn      c         c         c      of the laws concerning the buroughs passed in these two reigns some account has already been given in the historical narrative the municipal authority became an oligarchy in the reign of james iii on pretense that great contention had arisen through the multitude and clamor of common simple persons      c  0  and this form was unhappily to continue because a few are more easily influenced by government than a great number but it is surely the genuine interest of a government to stand upon as wide a basis as possible and for the fake of a few to render a number discontented cannot be an act of political prudence  edinburgh is at this period by an english contemporary historian styled a very rich town cont ann croyland ap gale vol i p     ditissimum oppidum the author blames

presents curious intelligence concerning the manners of the citizens the tales of the priests of peebles in scarce scottish poems reprinted london      vol i p    a question is proposed why the wealth of burgesses commonly expires with their immediate heirs the reasons assigned are that their fathers begin in rigid poverty with good luck and a halfpenny and a lambs skin then proceed to the

sold sheepskins keeps many servants spends his time in the tavern or playing at hazard till sinking into penury he become the follower of some lords son at court  in the same poem the maladministration of justice is repeatedly mentioned as a chief cause of the oppression of the poor the coroners the justices the serjands or mairs derived their impious emoluments by extortion on various pretexts from the more thriving yeomen till they reduced them to poverty or forced them to leave their jurisdictions when their successors suffered the same fate bribes alone could secure an audience an honest farmer would be accused of theft or rapine and the fine imposed was measured by the prosperity of his industry ibid p       etc  the very laws intended for the protection of the poor were converted into instruments of their oppression while the repeated statutes for the due administration of justice were eluded during the regal sway and fell asleep during a minority even so late as marys reign the balance of justice was commonly used in weighing which bribe was heaviest it was reserved for england to set the first example to the world of complete and impartial justice one of the chief blessings of civilized society and though the expense of the law be great that of a potent bribe might far exceed it while equality of wealth could alone secure an equitable decision

savages de coucy at the end of the history by jean chartier paris      folio p      the contrast between a polished burgundian of the most splendid court in europe at the time and a scottish highlander must indeed have been striking  of this barbarism the want of education was a chief source a defect which scotland has since supplied in a most laudable manner by innumerable schools where the mind may be cultivated at an expense accessible by the most indigent it is only to be regretted that so little attention is paid to the salaries of the humble teachers who while their income ought not to raise them above their office of educating the poor ought however to be enabled to preserve the ease and respect due to so useful an order of men  the dress of the common people continued a long time in the state described in the former retrospect the sumptuary law of james ii ordained that no burghers except bearing a municipal office shall wear gowns of silk or scarlet cloth or decked with mertrick furs the regulation is extended to their wives and daughters who are moreover to use no gowns with long trains except on holidays and to wear short kerchiefs with little hoods as are used in flanders england and other countries inferior barons and gentlemen are alike restricted none of the clergy are to wear gowns of scarlet or mertrick furs except they be dignitaries of a cathedral or collegiate church or doctors or such as may yearly spend two hundred marks or english nobles and with regard to the commons that no laborers nor husbandmen wear on the work day other than gray or white and on the holiday only light blue green or red and their wives the same and kerchiefs of their own making and that it exceed not the price of forty pence the eln and that no woman come

preeminence he adds that the king of scots who last died had only from apprehensions of his rebelling expelled douglas whose livelihood and might were nearly equivalent to his own in this the venerable chief justice was misinformed as the reader has seen that more than apprehensions existed  it has already been remarked that in the treaty with france      it was agreed that on a failure of immediate heirs the succession to either crown should be determined by the prelates and nobles by an act of      it was decreed that the dowry of the future queen should be a third of the kings rents

constitution of the scottish parliament has been reserved for this epoch as a centrical point upon which the various information bears only desultory knowledge could have been acquired by dividing the minute authorities into different periods and the interesting nature of the subject will excuse some length in the discussion till the year      when the representation of the shires was fixed and ascertained there is hardly a variation in the model of the scottish parliament and the present view will of course anticipate a century as well as revert to the records of preceding ages nor till the present period are the collective materials sufficiently ample to authorize accurate disquisition though the statutes themselves assume a regular form at the commencement of the actual reign of the

as all the freemen of a burgh could not appear in parliament they selected persons for that purpose and instituted the first example of representation that grand secret of modern government and which forms a basis of liberty unknown to all the ancient states  the able reign of robert the great was unhappily followed by the disturbed minority of his son david ii yet the reign of this feeble prince

mar john of the isles and gillespic cambel ibid f v      the model of this noted parliament being imitated by the kings of the stuart line as mentioned in their statutes it is proper to lend it due illustration the preamble bears that as the chief purport of this general council was to consider the state of the realm the royal revenue and some points relating to the administration of justice it was not expedient that all the members should attend for which reason some were elected by the general and unanimous consent and assent of the three communities assembled to order those things that concern common justice such as the contradicted judgments or appeals questions and other complaints which ought to be discussed and determined by parliament and others were elected by the same consent and assent of the communities to treat and deliberate on certain special and secret affairs of the king and kingdom before they came to the knowledge of the said general council ibid per generalem et unanimum consensum et assensum trium communitatum congregatarum ad ea quae concernunt communem justiciam videlicet judicia contradicta questiones et querelas alias quae per parlamentum debuerant terminari discutiendas et determinandas et alii per earundem consensum et assensum communitatum electi ad tractandum et deliberandum super certis et specialibus et secretis regis et regni negotiis antequam veniant ad notitiam dicti consilii generalis lord pitmedden about the beginning of this century had made some inaccurate extracts from this invaluable register and the above is among them see lord hailess annals ii         for the matters concerning the administration of justice were chosen six of the clergy ten knights and four others for the barons and seven burgesses  for the secret affairs three clergy and ten others among whom the steward and the earls of carrick and march are first named and the last is duncan wallace one of the attorneys of the earl of douglas it is specially added that the king may name any others  this as far as appears was the very first institution of the famous lords of the articles originally only a committee for secret affairs selected by the voice of the whole legislative body but the power assigned to the king of adding any members he thought proper led to great abuses  after the accession of the house of stuart the earliest memorable parliament is that of scone  d march      in the first year of robert ii the burgesses present continued to be specially summoned ex causa for a certain cause and as the general council is held for purposes relating to the king and realm and the administration of common justice in imitation of the order and method which were observed in the parliament held at perth in the time of king david of venerable memory and of his reign the fortieth year    feb    0 some were chosen by the general and unanimous consent and assent of the three communities for matters concerning common justice and others by the consent and assent of the said communities to treat and deliberate on certain special affairs of the king and kingdom before they come to the knowledge of the general council the other members were dismissed for the names of those chosen we are referred to another register it is remarkable that in this parliament the plea of secrecy is omitted and the lords of the articles are only chosen for special affairs ibid f v    imitando videlicet ordinem illum et modum qui servabatur in parlamento tento apud perth tempore venerandae memoriae domim regis david anno regni ipsius quadragesimo et alii per consensum et assensum earundem communitatum electi ad tractandum et deliberandum super certis specialibus regis et regni negotiis antequam perveniant ad notitiam concilii generalis the statutes of david ii are inaccurately copied in a bad hand but the writing of those of robert ii is greatly improved whence this passage serves to illustrate the genuine reading of the former     the parliament of robert iii in february   0  only bears that there were present the bishops abbots priors dukes earls barons freeholders and burgesses who hold of our lord the king in capite apud skene reg maj  but that the institution of the lords of the articles continued an inveterate usage appears from the parliament of perth   th may      the first of james i acts edit      fol   electae fuerunt certae perfonae ad articulos datos per dominum regem determinandos data caeteris licentia recedendi before they were only to treat and deliberate now to determine  and the first it is believed in which the style of the articles appears and from numerous succeeding parliaments it is also certain that the usage of dismissing the other members after the committees of justice and of the articles had been selected was continued to the parliament of      if not long after so that the prolongation of the session after the appointment of these committees was a mere stretch of the prerogative as well as the latter corrupt mode of choosing the lords of the articles at what precise epoch the committee of justice was divided into two   ad judicia or of judgments in criminal cases and   ad causas or of civil causes and lawsuits in the last appeal does not appear but such was the method in the reign of james iii records of parliament register office passim  yet even at this period the lords of the articles were modestly named last after the two former committees had been appointed not first as was afterward the usage when the lords of the articles were named by the influence of the court whose demands usurped a preference over the administration of justice  the steps that led to this radical alteration of the constitution of the scottish parliament which was at first to preclude the power of debate by only requiring the sanction of a full parliament to decrees already adjusted and was afterward to make that assembly a mere instrument of the crown deserve particular investigation the chief cause was the indolence and avarice of the members who regarded their attendance in parliament to which they were not only bound by their tenures but under a sine of ten pounds for absence as a most heavy constraint and intolerable burden even in england at this period committees were frequently appointed and leave given to the other members to depart see rolls of parliament edward iii in    0 ordered that in every parliament a prelate two earls and two barons should sit to judge appeals    e   cap   barrington on the statutes p     and see wight     the sole distinction was that in scotland the custom by a political solecism remained while the parliament itself continued in full session this apparently slight difference and the equally slight circumstance that in england the members were too numerous to meet in one room decided the destinies of the two kingdoms england had a free parliament for discussion and a house of commons scotland an influenced parliament for assent and her commons were overpowered by the presence of the superior orders  from the advantage which was afterward taken of this institution of lords of the articles it would seem a device of some cunning augustus to sap the freedom of his country it was on the contrary the mere product of chance and weakness the appointment of committees and dismission of the other members in september      and march      the first on account of the harvest the second an unexpectedly severe season and scarcity evince the progress of chance and the character of david ii and his hatred at the time to the stuarts who were to be the heirs of his power show the want of design the unanimous consent and assent of the whole three estates assembled testifies that they exulted in their deliverance from the slavery of attending in parliament and regarded the eighteenth day of february thirteen hundred and seventy as a jubilee of freedom  the subsequent statutes which illustrate the constitution of parliament are far from numerous the most memorable is the next in chronological order that of james i in march      acts f v      the king with consent of the whole general council has ordained that the small barons and freetenants need not come to the parliament or general council provided that each sheriffdom send two or more wise men chosen at the head court of the sheriffdom according to its extent except the sheriffdoms of clackmanan and kinross which may only send one member for each  these members shall be called commissaries of the shire and by these commissaries of all the shires shall be chosen a wise man and expert called the common speaker of the parliament who shall propose all and sundry necessities and causes pertaining to the commons in the parliament or general council the common speaker is a mere abbreviated phrase for the commons speaker or speaker of the commons it could never be intended that a commissioner of the shire should supplant the chancellor and become general speaker of the parliament   the commissaries shall have full and entire power from the rest of the sheriffdom testified by the seal of the sheriff and those of several barons of the shire to hear treat and finally to determine all causes to be proposed in the council or parliament  which commissaries and speaker shall have their expense defrayed by those of each shire who owe appearance in the parliament or council an equal assessment being laid on every pound of rent except those of bishops abbots priors dukes earls lords of parliament and banrents whom the king directs to be summoned and admitted to parliament by his special precept  such is this remarkable statute the intentions of which are supposed never to have been fulfilled till      when it was revived and enforced and the first regular representation for counties commenced in scotland it is evident that this great monarch wished to establish a house of commons on the english model and to lay the foundations of genuine liberty by dividing the landed gentlemen from the peers and thus strengthening the third estate which only consisted of a few burgesses unable to contend against the whole landed interest united a french noblesse instead of a distinct order of noblemen like those of england but when this act was revived in      cap      the clause concerning the common speaker or speaker of the commons was carefully omitted and thus the chief intention was eluded and the commissaries of the shires and burghs continued to sit in the same house with the peers  it has already been observed in the historical narrative that in      it was enacted that no freeholder shall be constrained to attend as a member of parliament if he hold of the king under the sum of twenty pounds in land in   0  the exemption is under one hundred marks of the extent that now is and an extent implies annual value twenty pounds in      scottish money being to the english as one to three and its power being to the present as ten to one may nearly equal seventy pounds sterling of modern currency in   0  the coin was as one to four and one hundred marks might equal one hundred and sixty of our pounds the english parliament had enacted in      that none should vote for knight of the shire who had not freeholds of the value of forty shillings but in scotland it was esteemed a great privilege to be exempted from sitting in parliament and voting could not be enforced even by the united efforts of the monarch and legislative body  from   0  till      there are no statutes concerning the constitution of parliament  to return to the consideration of the period under review we have seen that in      an oligarchic plan of appointing the council and magistrates of burghs was instituted and the parliament was compared with common courts of justice and in      the mention of the parliament of paris indicates that the french idea of a parliament was by the court preferred to the english the numerous clergy present at a scottish parliament and the want of an opposition are features delineated and explained in the preceding retrospect  in      as has already been observed the titled nobles of scotland amounted to about forty the ducal denominations were mostly confined to the royal family the others were earls and lords but these greater barons had no privileges above the smaller all were peers or pares in courts of justice a lord and a lard are the same and the latin only admitted dominus for either the lard or lord was designed from his estate and his wife was lady by the same designation even down to modern times for distinction the titled lords were created and styled lords of parliament while there was no house of commons there was no house of peers every landed gentleman holding of the crown might sit and vote but he could not be constrained to attend except his estate amounted to a certain sum  had the great plan of james i been carried into execution as much additional respect would have accrued to the peers as to the commons greater luster more important privileges would have arisen to the former as well as to the latter a distinct legislative capacity a marked line of separation from the landed gentlemen might have gratified the pride and stimulated the abilities of the peers while the esquires united with the burgesses might have learned by degrees the eminent advantages which commerce and agriculture derive from each other  the lesser barons or lairds corresponding with the english lords of manors form such a singular and amphibious class in the scottish parliament that they excite curiosity and disquisition the roll of parliament      will give us an idea of their proportion to the other members which seems to have greatly exceeded that of the roll of      abovementioned  on the   th day of february in the presence of our sovereign lord the king and the bishops abbots priors and the noble dukes earls lords

settling dates of creations and precedencies their imperfection is most excuseable   in this parliament the lesser barons almost equal in number the clergy and peers the rolls indeed seem imperfect for none apparently remains which enumerates more than about eighty member while in a stature of      they are estimated as we have seen at about one hundred and ninety and this though one of the most ample omits no less than twenty of the burghs but it is not the number of the lairds or tenants in capite which surprises it is their fewness which merits investigation  an idle tradition prevailed in the middle ages that one of our monarchs distributed all the lands of scotland among his great barons reserving none for himself except the moothill of scone this tradition though vague expressed the state of the country chiefly divided into large territories the potentates of which held of the king while their numerous vassals enjoying greater or smaller allotments held of their lords hence the numerous charters of confirmation in our records only lending the royal sanction to charters granted by the barons and a list of the tenants in capite including even the smaller would not it is believed for the writers who might be expected to illustrate this topic prefer declamation on the feudal system a rich mine but already exhausted by the labors of montesquieu and other able authors the learned craig ought to be named among the chief his work de feuds being the exuberant and often the silent source of the riches of more modern authors the reader who wishes to study this important topic so long the destiny of europe may begin with that great work if the prefer not to ascend to the original anothors gerardus niger or capagistus and obertus de orto two milanese of consideration who about the year    0 composed the books de usibus feudorum the early standard of feudal law see craig lib i tit         etc but the editions are so scarce as not to occur in the most ample catalogues  those parts of our history and antiquites which are clear have been illustrated with great force and precision while the obscure even require a taper to make the darkness visible  in england the baron was a lord a peer in scotland he was only a lord a man of landed property the word indeed originally only implies a man of courage a chief leges langob and in modern spanish varon is either a man or a noble not to mention the french baron et femme in like manner the term iarl or earl apparently introduced by the danish conquest of england in the eleventh century only signified originally a man thus iarl  wagh via viri sticrnhook de june sneonum p     it corresponds with the german carl a strong man  from domesday book it appears that the immediate vassals of the crown amounted after the conquest to about seven hundred exclusive of the eccesiastic fees dalr on feudal property      of these seven hundred a few were earls and lords the remainder would in scotland have been termed barons or lairds in the latter kingdom it may seem that the immediate vassals of the crown could not before the reign of david i exceed two hundred and the profuse donations of that prince to the church must have diminished the number of layfees  these vassals of the crown or tenants in capite were however speedily to be multiplied by various causes new donations of the regal demesne forfeitures of great fiefs afterward divided into smaller gifts of land by vassals themselves to their followers coheirship and at length purchase by the acquisitions of commerce or chance were among the operations which increased the number of the vassals in chief hence in the reign of henry iii of england representatives appear for the counties at the same time with those of the burghs and so rapid was the progress of liberty in that fortunate kingdom that from the first appearance of representation for the conties all and had a right to vote who held lands or tenements of whatever lord or superior while in scotland when this representation was attempted in      and established in      the privilege or servitude of voting was confined to the freeholders of the crown  one great cause which defeated the representation for counties in scotland and rendered even that for the burghs irregular and incomplete was the avarice of the freeholders and citizens which shrunk from paying the costage or salaries of the representatives and they not only abhorred the duty or bondage as they supposed of sitting in parliament but they even detested the trouble of giving their votes another cause was that the members of parliament had no privileges whatever not even the peers themselves considered in that capacity while the political wisdom of england had stimulated emulation and had inspired respect for the meanest member of the national council by the freedom from arrest and other immunities had james i in his eager wish to render the nation free industrious and happy assigned special privileges to the representatives of counties and burghs it is probable he might have succeeded in establishing two houses and an excellent constitution the struggle is singular the court insisted on diffusing some degree of freedom and the people opposed their deliverance with surprising zeal and perseverance  to return to the consideration of the barons or lairds they were hardly to be distinguished either in common or legal language from the titled nobility they were not only denominated from their estates but to a late period they used a titular signature as well as the peers peer and peerage do not indeed appear to be scottish terms in england when a lord of parliament was created he was styled a peer but there seems no vestige of this usage in scotland and there being no house of peers or equals to which he could be called the nobles were peers of the realm and not peers of parliament the term peerage is indeed vague even at present an english peerage is an inelective hereditary right to sit in parliament while a scottish peerage is only a right to vote for sixteen representatives the reader who is desirous to see a clear subject embarrassed by a strange mixture of new names and old ideas and old names and new ideas joined with a similar confusion of chronology may consult wallace on ancient peerages edin       vo  in strict propriety the word has no connection with the parliament or general council it is an honor at first territorial and passing with the land like a scottish lairdship afterward personal and hereditary but ever implying power territory rank precedence investiture by the monarch distinction of seat and dress on solemn occasions in france the twelve peers seem ot have succeeded the comites or companion of the early monarchs after the latter title had dwindled into the count or earl and acknowledging no superior but the sovereign they bore the humble and proud title of peers or equals the normans introduced the term into england where it was to be extended to all who were solemnly ennobled by the king and thereby attained a right of sitting in the upper house only known in that country and thence styled the house of peers but in scotland the peers having at no period a separate house and after the extinction of the scottish parliament by the union having only a right to select sixteen of their number the title remains in its original state quite distinct from any reference to parliament  the banrents or bannerets were an intermediate order between the peers and the larids possessing estates of such extent and of so many knights fees that they could lead a great number of followers to the field whence they had a title to display a banner the standard was confined to the king or general the banner to peers and potent chiefs the guidon was a small flag with two peaks or points and superior to the pencill or penon which every knight might put on his lance see gross hist of engl army         they were also distinguished by their peculiar enseigny or cri de guerre and by supporters to their armorial bearings  but the scottish barons or lairds had none of these high distinctions however small their freeholds they had a title to sit in parliament as appears from the above acts exempting those under a certain revenue from any constraint for appearance in civil matters they could decide questions of debt and many of possession within their baronies regulate work and wages and enforce the payment of their rents all criminal cases fell under the cognizance of the lord except treason and the four pleas of the crown he had the power of pit and gallows or drowning female and hanging male culprits convicted of theft or robbery and his jurisdiction comprised many penal statutes erskine principles of sc law b i t        on the other hand numerous were the distinctions between the lord and the lord the latter had no permanent denomination no personal honor his existence was merely territorial he had no solemn investiture no fixed rank no precedence nor was he addressed with any appropriated term his tenants indeed called him master not landlord but this was a slavish relic of the days of villenage and hence apparently the scottish phrase of master for the heir apparent to an estate thus master of huntley of darnley and the like frequent in our history and records and still retained where there is no second title  the same causes which operated in england were by slower degrees to increase the number of the scottish tenants in capite money being scarce gifts and rewards were commonly assigned in lands and even a messenger of good tidings was recompensed by a small estate scotst call passim this important catalogue was some years ago discovered by the author in the harleian library and is now it is believed printing in scotland the first volume is a transcript but sir john scott clerk of the register has avouched the others by his signature at the end of every quire the charters extend from   0  to      or later  the nobles and lairds maintained their friends and secured the fidelity of their followers by similar donations in that singular work of poetry in prose a true history of several honorable families of the name of scott by capt walter scott edin            to we find p    an account of numerous pensioners of scott of buccleugh twenty three of his own name all enjoying grants of lands clanship easily spread when surnames were hardly known and to assume a name was to secure an inheritance there is a fund of odd sense in that book among other points the military poet says the rear is the second place if soldiers be but stout they are sure to have the van if the word be face about     but the tenure being from themselves as superiors the number of persons entitled to sit in parliament or vote had representatives been established was little swelled by their alienations an inborn preference which most men give to land above all other kinds of property the desire of retirement ease and a rural life so natural to the busy citizen conspired to render the purchase of land a great object of ambition to the industrious merchant and to the fortunate adventurer entails were unknown in scotland till the seventeenth century a deed of taillie merely regulating the manner of succession and commonly altering it from heirs general to heirs male dalr on feudal property         where it is also shown that craig who wrote about the year   00 knew nothing of entails in the modern sense it was in the reign of charles ii that they began to be frequent in scotland ib     in the reign of james vi the lairds amounted to about one thousand certain matters etc       but other obstacles prevented the free acquisition of land so essential to the circulation of the blood of the state an able judge even supposes that the jus retracius prevailed by which a right of redemption exposed the purchaser to an uncertainty in his property a bar at once to its enjoyment and improvement while the famous statute of quia emptores was to diffuse wealth and cultivation through england in the adjacent kingdom the heritable proprietor was to be distinguished by the heritable sterility of his possessions and by a firm entail of indolence and poverty yet by degrees commerce and industry were to assert their rights private vices were to become public benefits and landed prodigality was to minister to the national advancement and though many of the purchased lands held of the under lords there is little room to doubt that the freeholders of the crown were increased by this progress of society but a just estimate of their number could only be formed from an enumeration of the charters in the register at various periods a toil perhaps surpassing the value of the information  that no representatives for the counties appeared till      is sufficiently clear from the silence of the statutes and records and the act of james ii concerning the parliamentary dress is mute concerning the commissioners of the shires or even the lesser barons in general though most particular in regard to the earls lords and burgesses it is hence to be inferred that the lairds appeared in parliament in their usual dress nor does it appear that in latter times the representatives of shires were distinguishable by their apparel from the burgesses  to close this discussion concerning the lesser barons the length of which can only be excused by their importance in the national and constitutional scale and the singularity of their rank in society when compared with more civilized governments it shall only be further observed that the term lord has become of no respect and is even ironically applied to the portioner of land whose estate is half a field but who joins the industry of an artisan to the healthy pursuits of his little agriculture for the denomination being territorial is only honorable in proportion to the territory while the english term esquire assigned to any man who bears a shield or in other words has an armorial blazon is a personal distinction extended to opulence to eminence of talents to fortunate industry as well as to considerable possessions of land  in passing to the last division of the national council the burgesses it is first to be observed that the royal burghs alone had a right or rather to speak in the language of the times were burdened by their tenures from the crown with the heavy duty of sending representatives to parliament the burghs of barony or those that held of great barons whether temporal or spiritual were exempt from this slavery glasgow for instance though a burgh of some consequence even then as holding of the bishop sent no commissioner to those already mentioned in the above roll may be added berwick jedburgh selkirk peebles lanark dunbar kinghorn forfar brechin wigton kirkudbright irvin dunbarton north berwick inverkeithing coupar perth montrose and others see carm    part      in      they amounted to sixty present skate of scotland london       vo p           so that the representatives for the burghs might have amounted to between thirty and forty if another singular practice had not prevailed that of many of the burghs appointing the representatives of the others to be proxies every method of exemption from attendance being sedulously practiced in order to avoid the trouble and expense  as the session of a parliament commonly lasted only a few days the chief magistrates of the burghs could attend without a long absence from their duty and it appears that they were generally the representatives the oligarchic form of municipality introduced by james iii necessarily confined the election to the towncouncil the body of the burgesses or freemen being excluded hence it is computed that there are not in scotland at this day above three thousand voters for national representatives either of counties or towns dalr   0   in the earliest scottish parliaments of which we have any record it appears that deputies for the burghs attended to settle the proportion of taxes which the towns were to bear and it is not improbable that the magistrates of the principal burghs may be included in the sapientes probi homines or preudhommes and tota communitas regni of the most ancient national councils for those of scotland see the statuta willielmi et alexandri secundi apud skene reg maj  many ancient english customs may be traced in more modern scottish usages and for this reason the study of the latter is important to science in both kingdoms that the magistrates of the chief towns were in an appropriated sense members of the national council before the reign of henry iii in england and robert i in scotland there is unhappily no positive proof but that they attended especially in cases of taxation and probably at the bar there is some proof and every reason to infer in scotland there were neither towns nor commerce till a comparatively late period but the usages are evidently of english origin constant intercourse and an amity seldom interrupted having prevailed between the nations till the base and unkingly conduct of edward i forced scotland into the arms of france now in england as in other european kingdoms no representatives from towns could appear in early times and the numerous barbaric codes of laws though most minute in other points are it is believed completely silent not only on this head but on municipal regulation the reason is clear it was because the barbarians who overturned the roman empire detested the civic life and preserved their ancient rural manners and occupations the towns being conquered had no right to expect a representation in the national assemblies of their victors held in ample plains under the canopy of heaven and it was to the contempt and indifference of the conquerors that they were commonly indebted for such privileges as they retained as the right of electing their own magistrates and other minute relics of freedom when the saxons when the normans conquered england the same causes must have operated the english representatives of london must have made a strange appearance in an assembly of norman freeholders to whose language and laws they were absolute strangers but the magistrates might be called to the bar to advise and give their consent to the best manner of proportioning a tax and enforcing its collection in their respective towns the language of money being very audible and clear  on looking into the history of the scottish parliaments we accordingly sind the burgesses specially mentioned on the occasion of a tax imposed by william fordun i     a d       even in the reign of james ii as will afterward appear in this retrospect they sat at the bar of the national council in that of james iii several acts bear to be passed by the clergy and lords in   0  a special statute appears ordaining that the commissaries and headsmen of the burghs be warned when taxes or contributions are given to have their advice therein as one of the three estates of the realm cap     in    0 we find ten provosts of the chief towns among the lords of the articles robertson append no iv  as the statutes are silent concerning the mode of election and representation for burghs it would seem that one or two of the magistrates were nominated by the others or by the council  the royal burghs were indeed bound by their tenures as holding in chief of the crown to attend the parliament but as proxies were allowed and the fine itself for absence was only ten pounds the tenure was neglected and illuded nor could the incorporation of a burgh by royal charter be an usage of much antiquity in scotland perhaps not more ancient than the reign of david i  so much for the burgesses the only real commons of scotland the lesser barons having weakly preferred an insignificant mixture with the peers to the noble ambition of heading a separate assembly modern party has embroiled many of the questions on this subject a whig wishing to increase the antiquity and power of the commons while a tory endeavors to diminish them but to plain sense and cool reason the topic is only important as illustrative of history nor can the discussion of barbaric customs hinder or advance the cause of enlightened freedom  having thus considered the several classes of men which composed the three estates of the national council one of the most interesting objects in modern history some other particulars remain to be stated in order to present clear information concerning its constitution and procedure  the number of the members we have seen amounted to about one hundred and ninety but from the rolls there never appears more than half the number the others being absent from sickness distance feuds nonage especial affairs or other reasonable causes and some from contumacy or an opposition to the measures of the court at the time even in modern times to secure the attendance of a certain number in a national council the members ought to double that number james i ordered in      that no prelate earl baron or freeholder should appear by a procurator except on proving a lawful cause of absence cap    the act of   0  allows procurators to appear for the lesser barons mr wight p    seems rightly to infer that both the statutes of      and   0  only absolve the persons from attendance on condition that they sent proxies  it would seem that the procurators are omitted in the rolls and often indeed one member might appear for many but sometimes a lawyer was proxy for an absent peer and the omission might be according to the forms or intended to discountenance the practice at any rate the omission of the procurators must considerably abbreviate the rolls of parliament  it was a royal prerogative to summon the general council which was done by letters under the signet to the clerical members and greater barons and by precepts from chancery to the sheriffs for general summonses to all members resident in each shire during a minority this prerogative was exerted by the council of regency but few or no permanent laws were ever passed except when the sovereign had attained the years of majority prescribed by law  the members having a day or two before arrived in the city or town where the parliament was to be held on the morning of the meeting they assembled at an appointed place and proceeded on horseback in grant state to their hall this procession was called the riding of the parliament and was a singularity retained to the latest period of the scottish legislature amid the sound of numerous trumpets and the armorial displays of heralds first appeared the commissioners of the burghs then the lesser barons followed by the lords the bishops the earls the archbishops the dukes three chosen peers bore the crown scepter and sword before the monarch who was attended by his guards at the door of the hall sat the lord high constable to receive the members as they alighted and probably in his original office of giving orders concerning the stabling of their horses till their return see the prints of the riding of the scottish parliament in the reign of charles ii   the clergy probably took their seats on the right the peers on the left of the throne as in england and so numerous were the former that the lesser barons present would merely complete the left ranks at the bottom near or perhaps without the bar sat the commissioners of the burghs the clerk of the register was apparently the clerk of parliament and it is to be inferred that he and some other officers of state sat in the middle before the throne the author of the present state of scotland      says the chancellor and other officers of state sat under the throne and below them the lords of session or judges in the middle were two tables one bearing the regalia by which sat the constable and marshall at the other was the clerk of register with his deputy clerks who are the clerks of parliament p       in call b v     is an account of the scottish parliament in the reign of james vi at that time the members continued in town while the lords of the articles sat being a week or two and all met on the last day to approve or condemn parliament was either deserted or current the former case required a proclamation of forty days before another could be held the latter only of fifteen days     the roll being called and some other formalities arranged the chancellor or sometimes the secretary made a short speech and as they were commonly churchmen it was in the nature of a sermon of the time seasoned with latin quotations from scripture the three estates then proceeded to their chief office the appointment of commitees of justice and of the articles who being selected the other members were at liberty to depart to their respective homes and often did not assemble till next year when they gave their sanction to the laws prepared by the committees but it also often happened that the statutes and ordinances were already fashioned by the chancellor and other officers of state or could easily be forwarded so that the members remained in the town and even continued their session occasionally from five to fifteen days the last of which was appropriated to the pronunciation of the decisions of the committee of justice in presence of the whole house the vote of non liquet was latterly allowed as in the roman senate but the usual votes were approve or not approve pres state       an expression rather belonging to sanction than debate   as the members were inelective the commissioners of the burghs alone excepted the prorogation or dissolution of the parliament could not be alternatives of great consequence in england at this period a parliament seldom sat above one session of twenty or thirty days but sometimes three sessions were known the general form of the scottish parliament seems to have been annual and the magistrates who represented the towns being commonly of yearly continuance in office it may be difficult to point out an instance of a prorogation from one year to another though those of two or three months in the same year are not unfrequent a curious instance of the prorogation of a parliament followed by its dissolution occurs in the records in the turbulent last year of the reign of james iii a parliament met in january and was prorogued to may but on the   th february      james issued the following order we do you to wit that our sovereign lord by the advice of his council has for certain reasonable and great causes deserted and dissolved his parliament which was formerly prorogued till the fifth day of may next to come and has ordained a new general parliament to be set and proclaimed to be holden at edinburgh the twelfth day of may next to come with continuation of days and general precepts to pass to all lords prelates barons frecholders and commissaries and with special letters under his signet to all the prelates and great lords of his realm to show and declare to them the cause of the sitting of his said parliament these special letters it is to be presumed james did not direct to his enemies and it is even probable that they were never sent to members in the opposition an omission which might be regarded as a hint that their absence would be more agreeable  after the parliament the privy council attracts the greatest attention by its dignity and importance the nature of this meeting has been already explained in the preceding retrospect where it is observed that it succeeded the aula regis or kings court this court anciently held in a hall of the palace has been by some authors confounded with the nationa council and the vague synonymes and impure latinity of the writers of the middle ages have sometimes blended the terms curia and consilium so as to occasion a doubt whether the latter be a general or privy council and whether the former be a senate or parliament in the classic acceptance or an affected substitute for the curtis or court of the king the explanations of glossarists are also arbitrary and often derived from a single sentence without considering the scope of preceding and succeeding paragraphs or the affected sense in which a particular kaims essay on brit ant p    writer may use a particular expression that the kings court was merely of consultation and of judicature in particular cases like the succeeding privy council there is every reason to infer and if the parliament be styled the royal court in barbaric latinity it is an abuse of terms the kings baroncourts were a kind of inquests consisting of the great officers of the crown and other chief barons to judge on important crimes and causes even they differed much from the courts held by the barons themselves because the monarch however controuled and impoverished by the great barons yet maintained during the feudal ages a sublime and superlative character in the constitution as the fountain of honor the general and chief magistrate of the state but from these courts the parliament or general council was distinguished in many ways   it succeeded the general assemblies of the german tribes mentioned by tacitus who says that on smaller matters or particular cases the nobles met and decided while in larger the whole community assembled to determine on affairs of general interest germ c xi  the former was the kings baroncourt the latter a parliament the former was a meeting of the notables the latter of the states general   the aula regis or kings baroncourt though perhaps the former consisted only of the chief officers of state the latter added the great barons yet whether the same or distinct never possessed any legislative power   the states general often opposed the royal will and the english parliament even deposed richard ii attributes which no fancy can ascribe to the kings own courts which existed only in virtue of his authority   the kings courts met in his palaces while no parliament ever sat in a royal mansion but in convents abbeys guildhalls and other detached places dr gilbert stuart on the public law and constitution of scotland p     0  edit      it is to be regreted that the useful information and solid argument sometimes presented in this work should be distorted by the authors personal animosity against dr robertson a writer of great talents dr stuarts style is also too turgid and declamatory to present clear information on obscure topics and the abominable plan or rather confusion invented by bail who emptied his commonplace book on his dictionary has been unhappily followed by both robertson and stuart in their enquiries on the progress of society etc while the short text and long notes at the end not only present a most unclassical mode of composition but seem merely calculated to dismember and confuse a subject and oppress the patience of the reader  it may be added that the tenure in capite was not a right to sit in parliament it was on the contrary an obligation in order that the national council in which the sovereign appeared in his greatest luster might be numerously attended and not exhibit symptoms of disaffection by the rarity of the members before the feudal tenures prevailed there can be no doubt but that every freeman had a right to appear in the general assembly while the kings court was sacred to the chiefs and supposing a barony allodial or free from tenure that circumstance could not have operated against the right of its possessor to appear in the national council but the small tribes general assemblies and idle life of the ancient germans being followed by wide kingdoms in which no general assembly could be held and by various occupations it became necessary to enforce attendance by tenure and fines means from which the question of right acquired by tenure is extremely remote  in the more ancient periods of scottish history the kings were the chief judges in fact as well as in law and sat at particular times before a gate of the palace to hear and determine causes especially those of the poor this judicature was in more polished times exerted by the monarch in conjunction with his privy council but it was chiefly used in punishing riots and in other special cases which demanded a speedy remedy and could not be deferred till the meeting of a parliament the last court of resort in the last century it was to usurp the odious powers of a star chamber and its fall was matter of national exultation  such numerous minorities occur in the history of the scottish monarchs that the state of the government at those periods deserves much attention and will be found explained in several passages of the historical narration it appears that the privy council retained its chief powers under a council of regency though the officers of state were often the principal members of both  these officers of state themselves claim the next consideration and their original importance in the government and in the national history demands that particular attention should be paid to their distinct duties and privileges  in scotland those of chief consequence at this period were the lieutenant general of the kingdom the steward an office now held by the prince and little exerted the constable the marshall the chancellor the great chamberlain the treasurer the justiciary the admiral the master of the household the privy seal the comptroller the secretary among those of smaller moment may be named the clerk of the register the treasurer depute the kings advocate the justice clerk the kings chamberlain  the first named of these offices though almost unknown to all writers on our constitution was doubtless the second in the kingdom and almost amounted to a regency during a weak reign or a minority the lieutenant general commanded the whole military array and force of the realm being a substitute for the king himself in his high capacity of general of the nation we have seen the ambitious robert duke of albany appear in the synonymous characters of lieutenant general and governor of the kingdom during the reign of robert iii his brother the potent earls of douglas held this office in the minority of the second james and it appears at intervals in the minority and reign of james v  the stewardship upon the accession of the house of stuart merged in the principality as david duke of rothsay was the sole prince of that family who came to majority after the accession of the family the kings held the lands and privileges of the office and james iv in the parliament of    0 was to order that all the freeholders of the stewardlands should appear an answer in the parliaments and court of circuit with their suits and presence in a proper manner till our sovereign lord have a son who shall be immediate betwixt the king and them to answer for them in the said parliaments and courts of justiciary and suitrolls to be made thereupon which shall endure till the prince be born cap    mr wight p    seems to understand that the prince was the natural representative of his tenants in parliament and see his appendix p     for a paper showing that noblemen were understood to represent their lands even so late as      a curious topic too ample for discussion here as leading to great questions whether the nobles were not at first considered as representing their tenants the origin of representatives for shires after a county had ceased to be synonymous with an earldom and others of similar import  a statute requiring the explanation of some legal antiquary  the constable originally as the name implies the officer who had charge of the royal stables arose by degrees to be commander in chief under the sovereign and continued in that high rank in france even in the century now under view his office in scotland appears to have been vague and titular and was confined to the arrangement of the royal camp a duty which seldom occurred to the reception of the members of parliament at the door of their hall and other objects of more luster than utility the noble family of hay have long inherited this office but we have seen it usurped for a season by boyd earl of arran yet he might perhaps appear as a delegate for the aged earl of errol  the marshall was master of the horse as the seneschall styward or steward was of the herds and flocks the chief wealth of early times the marshall ought to have arranged the army in battle and he was the chief judge in the courts of chivalry to determine points of honor and arms he was also considered as a commander in the field and the french marechals long retained the office the hereditary marshalsy of scotland continued for centuries in the family of keith  in the reign of james iii the chancellor arose to a precedence next to the prince of the blood he was president and speaker of parliament examined and passed charters under the great seal was president of the privy council where and in the committees of parliament he exercised great juridical functions in short he had the chief rank in civil affairs as the lieutenant general had in military  the great chamberlain an office originally joined with that of treasurer collected the royal revenues and accounted for the expenditure his jurisdiction as appears from the iter camerarii was very extensive and a great proportion of the revenue arising from the customs and other duties paid by the royal burghs they were committed to his particular charge the management of the magistrates the use made of the property of the towns the complaints and disputes of the burgesses and craftsmen the prices of provisions the rules of barter and sale were among the objects of his authority see the iter camerarii in skene and stuart p     the collection of the royal revenues and his power over the collectors were also sources of great influence but the power of the chamberlain over the burghs was considerably restricted by the court of four burghs consisting of commissioners from these towns who were summoned extraordinarily to hear appeals from the chamberlains circuit courts but their ancient annual meeting was at haddington  to reg f     these four burghs were edinburgh stirling roxburgh and berwick till the two latter falling into the hands of the english it was ordered in the parliament of march      that lanark and linlithgow be substituted reserving the rights of the former when retaken ibid  the meeting of commissioners of the burghs at inverkeithing authorized by james iii to form mercantile regulations seems little to have increased their importance in national scale  latterly the office and power of the chamberlain were shared by the treasurer who received and expended such of the royal revenues as belonged to the private expense of the king and his family this office was introduced in      by james i on his return from england crawf off       the justiciary was originally an officer of great power as appears from the iter justiciarii his jurisdiction was both civil and criminal and he held circuit courts twice in the year treason and the four pleas of the crown were specially reserved for his cognizance but while the justiza of arragon was to control the monarchs the scottish justiciary never attained any preeminence above other officers of state on the contrary his power was divided there being often a justiciary for the counties south of the forth and clyde and another for the north the statutes by their frequent mention of the justices seem to indicate more yet the deputies of the justiciaries may be implied  till the office was assigned hereditarily to the noble family of argyle by james v it had been held by sir robert lauder of bass and other names hardly known in history and when charles i withdrew it from argyle it passed to sir thomas hope and afterward to sir ludovic stuart men of talents but far remote from the character of spanish justizas it is sometimes useful to collate domestic customs with foreign but to form general views of the feudal system and afterward apply them to particular countries without a profound and laborious study of their history is a practice pregnant with errors the feudal system of each european kingdom forms quite a distinct province it is easier indeed to draw materials from the literature of france england and other enlightened countries than to search into obscure chronicles old manuscripts and records for the genuine history of the scottish constitution but an infinite confusion arises from an injudicious mixture of our history and antiquities even with those of england they ought sedulously to be kept apart and the skillful reader may afterward himself compare the topics as treated by the historians lawyers and antiquaries of the sister nations  it is to be regretted that we have so few materials for the history of the next important office that of admiral nor to the notices scattered in the historical narrative can any thing be here added his jurisdiction in maritime affairs in the reign of james iii appears from the reference of the english to his judgment concerning the capture of vassels and compensations on that account in latter times he was justicegeneral upon the seas on fresh waters within floodmark and in all harbors and creeks his authority extended to all maritime causes comprehending questions of charterparties freights salvages bottomries and the like his delegate is the judge of the high court of admiralty and he may appoint inferior deputies for districts but their sentences are subject to the revisal of the high court the admirals jurisdiction is supreme and no question can be transferred even to the session except by suspension or reduction even many mercantile cases are by usage submitted to the admiral erskine principles b i t        the lord privy seal was an officer of considerable confidence who put the royal signet to gifts of movables and other small grants not requiring seizin the secretary wrote the royal letters and managed several private departments of business latterly he came to be an officer of high rank and importance and his frequent access to the royal ear gave him such influence that he almost rivalled the chancellor  the master of the household magister hospitii superintended the royal domestics and the comptroller shared the former offices of the chamberlain and treasurer by regulating the expenses and checking the account and supplying temporary advances of money  the clerk of the register or master of the rolls had the care of the records and charters and was clerk of parliament the treasurerdeputes duty is explained by his appellation royal causes and prosecutions for crimes especially treason were prerogatives of the kings advocate the justiceclerk or clerk of justiciary was an assessor to the justiciary to assist him in points of law and the lord justiceclerk remains an office of importance the kings chamberlain or private chamberlain was an officer of great favor and trust sir william crichton held this place while sir john forester was great chamberlain and the former was more in confidence with james i than the latter  in passing from the constitution and court to the administration of justice the following ordinance of james ii may be added to the intelligence concerning the mairs and serjands our sovereign lord and his three estates ordain and determine that if any of his officiars or sheriffs mairs baillies crowners serjands provosts of burghs and their deputies either in town or country be found faulty or negligent in the execution of their offices and the offense may be legally proved or notoriously known if the said office belong to him in fee or heritage he shall lose his office and the prosit thereof for a year and a day and be punished by the king in his person and effects according to the trespass if his office be not of inheritance he shall entirely abandon it and be punished in his person according to his trespass at the royal pleasure      c      it is a chief object of these retrospects to retrieve from the darkness of antiquity such information as may have escaped former research the duties of the sheriff have been frequently explained but the coroner an officer of high importance in various stages of our history seems unknown to our legal or antiquarian enquiries his function may be illustrated by the following statutes which at the same time throw a strong light on the administration of justice at the period of the last parliament of james iii  it is thought expedient and ordained for the advancement of justice the bringing in of trespassors to law and their punishment that in time to come when the crowner receives his porteous porteous or portas in its original meaning is a breviary or small book of divine offices of such a size as to be easily carried abroad portiforium it is here a list of criminals and traistis if there be any persons disobedient whom he dares not nor is it in his power to arrest in that case the crowner shall pass to the lord and baron of the barony where they dwell and if he dwell not within a barony he shall pass to the sheriff of the shire and show his porteous that he has such persons therein mentioned and enquire if the lord baron or sheriff will be surety and pledge for these persons to produce them at the circuit if they consent he shall deliver to them the names that they may become pledges by writings sealed and subscribed and if they refuse to be sureties he shall require the lord baron or sheriff in the kings name either to pass or send their officers with their followers and servants in sufficient number with the said crowner or assist and aid him in making the arrest or seizing him who will not become surety till he be brought to the sheriff to be retained till the circuit any lord baron or sheriff refusing to forfeit ten pounds to the king the crowner proving the offense      c      it is thought expedient for the punishment of criminals who escape from the crowner that in future he shall bring such to the sheriff who shall keep them prisoners on our sovereign lords expense till the next circuit and then present them to the justiciary the sheriff shall be allowed from the exchequer threepence a day for each on bringing a certificate from the justiciary if the sheriff refuse to receive the criminals brought by the crowner he shall incur the danger and unlaw be liable to punishment and fine of the justiciarycircuit to the fourth court as a surety should do in default of producing the person arrested ibid c  0    it is ordained that because the crowners in times past through erroneous custom and abuse of the law after a criminal was convicted before the justiciary and condemned to death would immediately pass or send to escheat the effects of such criminals though belonging to the king and appropriate a part of the corn cattle and other effects neither in law nor reason appertaining to their office therefore it is decreed that in future no crowner pretend to take any such effects till the sheriff or his deputy shall pass or send examine the effects and allot the crowner his share the remainder to be delivered to the kings treasurer nor shall the sheriff deliver more to the crowner than his legal portion punishment as of robbery ibid  0   another statute ordains that on the last day of the circuit the justiciary shall appoint a jury to examine if the sheriff and coroner have done their duty and another decrees to the latter a young laboring horse if any be among the effects of an executed malefactor ibid  0    from other evidence it appears that the family of the neilsons had in the reign of james v been heritable coroners of bute for two hundred years and in      hugh earl of eglinton was appointed coroner of the county of cunningham on the resignation of cunningham of caprinton

appears to have been succeeded by that of colonel  in      gifts of lieutenancy were issued by james iii to lennox argyle athole huntley of various sheriffdoms in which their estates lay nor were the

session had been instituted by james i in      its members were nominated by the king from the estates of parliament and it was termed the session because its meetings were fixed at certain periods and places james ii ordained particular regulations concerning this court but as its members only served by rotation and without salary it was at once ignorant and negligent and was at length to be exchanged for a daily council appointed by the patriotic parliament of   0  it is to be regreted that james i did not found courts upon the english model but perhaps the penury of the country afforded no funds for salaries perhaps the confined nature of the regal jurisdiction or some other circumstances prevented such an attempt  but the power of the session the justiciaries the sheriff and coroner was greatly restricted by the regalities or lordships palatine their jurisdiction was royal as the name implies in civil affairs it equalled that of the sheriff and in criminal it even comprised the four pleas of the crown murder robbery rape and fireraising rivalling that of the justiciaries over every crime except treason the lord of regality could repledge or reclaim all criminals subject to his jurisdiction even from the courts of the justiciaries erskine principles b i t      these extravagant grants incompatible with the regular administration of justice had been lavished by the royal favor or extorted by the power of several great barons when they had themselves expelled the english from their territories or had rendered some eminent public service in      an attempt was made to prevent any further grants of regality by subjecting them to the consent of parliament acts c     but the practice was as inveterate as it was imprudent the ecclesiastic lords ever desirous of exemption from any authority save that of the pope are supposed to have set the first example of regalities the temporal authority was delegated to a bailiff and often hereditary regalities continued to be granted and confirmed and the charters of hereditary sheriffdom to the peers and chiefs within their lordships were almost tantamount and became so numerous as to extend over all the country when regality lands were forfeited the king appointed stewards over them with similar powers hence the hereditary stewards of strathern menteith annandale kirkudbright while over baronial lands in the crown only bailiffs were nominated as in kyle carric cunningham and even the lastnamed offices were to be held hereditarily by peers happy country thus filled with hereditary wisdom and hereditary justice  nor must the spiritual courts be omitted which before the reformation were to become great grievances they originally sprung from the confidence which piety reposed in the bishops who were entrusted with the care of estates and orphan children hence their claim to judge in testaments and legacies and marriage being a sacrament administered by ecclesiastics since the twelfth century prior to which it was merely a civil contract all questions of divorce breach of vows and the like passed to the ecclesiastic courts from which no appeal lay except to the metropolitan or finally to the pontiff tithes and patronage were natural objects of church decision and notaries were appointed by the pope but scandal and any affairs confirmed by an oath though liable to ecclesiastic jurisdiction might in all ages seem secular questions the bishops were supposed to be occupied in divine duties and delegated their power to officials or commissaries but the court was styled the bishops court or curia christianitatis and also the consistorial court from the consistory or court of appeals held by the roman emperors erskine b i t      for the abuses of the consistorial courts see lindsays play p       0   two statutes of james ii concerning the administration of justice deserve particular attention the three estates have ordained that the justices on the south side of the scottish sea the firth of forth hold their courts of circuit twice in the year and in like manner on the north according to ancient use and custom and so also lords of regality within their regalities and the kings baillies of his regalities and that the king himself till the due course of justice be restored pass to every town where the circuit is held or to its vicinity as his council shall think convenient    0 c     it is ordained and decreed that in all circuits of justice sheriff courts and generally all courts spiritual and temporal all persons freeholders and others shall attend in a sober and quiet manner and that no man bring with him more persons than are in his daily household and family service and when he arrives at his lodging he and they shall lay aside their weapons and armor if any they bring and wear no weapon except a knife and if any be at open enmity and allege fear of his life the sheriff shall require lawburrows or legal surety from both and prohibit them in the royal name to disturb the kings peace on pain of incurring the law which the king shall execute without remission on the infringer if the sheriff be negligent he shall be punished according to the statute ordained for reforming the faults of officers of justice      c     in      the lords and commons in vain engaged not to support any criminal friends or relations at the bar but the offense was to continue common in the succeeding century cap      james iii in      ordered that if the justice sheriff steward bailie or baron provost or baillie of burghs refuse to execute justice the complainant shall repair to the king in council who shall punish the offending magistrate by the penalties there mentioned cap     among the grievances of this reign the abuses of the court of session appear to have been one of the chief the want of regular intermediate civil courts between that of the sheriff and the kings council must have led to much inconvenience and maladministration the power of the privy council having been ever esteemed one of the grand defects of the scottish constitution being an arbitrary star chamber uncontrouled by genuine justice or equity with all its imperfections the court of session consisting of all the members of parliament in rotation must have been an institution far more free and impartial  some regulations appear concerning inquests and juries on criminal causes but the want of juries in civil cases was to continue a disgraceful contrast between english and scottish jurisdiction  among the means of preserving the public peace the letters of lawburrows must not be omitted the term is derived from borgh a pledge or surety which any person in fear of anothers violence had a title to demand that he should not be injured in his person family or estate erskine b iv t       he who refused to grant such security was liable to high penalties when granted the sureties became amenable in the terms of the following statute of      concerning lawburrows it is enacted that if they be infringed on any bishop abbot or prelate of the church earl or lord of parliament with their personal hurt or that of their servants the sureties of the infringer shall pay to our sovereign lord a sine of one hundred pounds if on any knight baron squire or clergyman of large benefice fifty pounds if on a burgess yeoman or priest thirty pounds together with due compensation to the party injured unless the sureties produce the infringer before the king or the sheriff within forty days the king to have the fines of all lawburrows broken that shall fall within the jurisdiction of his own officers either in town or country and the lords of regalities and baronies to have those taken in their lands by them or their officers according to their ancient infeofments and privileges cap     one of the last statutes of james iii is in the following terms the three estates have committed the full power of the whole parliament to the persons underwritten they do not appear to advise confer and report to the next parliament or general council concerning the reduction of the kings laws regiam majestatem acts statutes and other books to be bound in one volume and authorized and the others to be destroyed four persons to be appointed for each of the three estates the prelates to bear the expense of the clerical members the barons of those they shall appoint and the burghs that of their commissaries      c      in like manner james i had appointed a committee of six of each of the estates to examine and amend the books of law that is to say regiam majestatem and quoniam attachiamenta      c     it has been shown by skilful judges that the work quaintly styled regiam majestatem is a transcript of glanvilles production it was probably brought into scotland by david ii who was greatly attached to england and desired to bequeath his scepter to an english heir and by an artful incorporation of some genuine laws of daivd i scotland was prepared to receive it as a code of that illustrious monarch the feeble reigns of robert ii and iii and above all the tumultuous regencies of the dukes of albany had so far obliterated the very memory of the laws that the error had in the reign of the first james taken deep root and was to shoot vigorously see sir d dalrymples examination of some of the arguments for the antiquity of regiam majestatem edin       to and the observations on the regiam majestatem  vo written by john davidson esquire a venerable promoter of the study of scottish history and antiquities who assisted dr robertson in      and continues his laudable researches though now in his seventyseventh year  while sir davids arguments prove that the regiam majestatem could not exist before the reign of david ii he yet inclines to deny that it is so late as that epoch because in the reign of james i it was esteemed an ancient and authentic code but this argument is answered in the text and ignorant ages are such complete strangers to any standard of antiquity that the leges malcolmi a then recent forgery were supposed to be laws of malcom i to our old historians fordun and winton the regiam majestatem is unknown and it is most probable that david ii when attempting to settle the succession of his crown on a son of edward iii endeavored silently to assimilate to scottish laws with the english by its introduction yet failing the book lurked in ms in one or two monasteries when james i equally desirous of benefiting his kingdom by an emulation of english polity revived it but craig a superlative judge testifies that it never was a code of scottish law and that it has not even the least connection with the usages or forensic practice of scotland lib i t      sir davids second argument p    that the regiam majestatem is more ancient than the time of david ii is so singular that it shall be transcribed entire  to this i add another chronological argument which appears to have some weight cardinal wardlaw secretary to david ii died in      his nephew henry wardlaw was promoted by him to the rectory of kilbride and the precentorship of the cathedral of glasgow he was made bishop of st andrews in   0  and was chancellor of scotland during the whole reign of james i it will be admitted that the statute    par   james i           was either drawn up by him or under his direction now as bishop wardlaw was beneficed by his uncle it is probable that he had come to mans estate before      when his uncle died bishop wardlaw educated under the cardinal secretary to david ii must have known whether regiam majestatem was an ancient or a very modern composition this   th statute shows that he considered it as an ancient composition and hence independent of all other arguments there arises a cogent reason for believing that regiam majestatem was not compiled by the command of david ii  this argument is of too delicate too feeble a texture it forgets that the forgery might have happened early in the reign of david that it might be a state secret that the book may not even be older than the reign of james i no more ancient ms or reference being known that this last prince was a rational admirer of english polity and might wish to introduce it by a holy fraud that the chancellor or secretary might in consequence even interpolate or alter the statute a complaint not unknown but why waste discussion what must be the readers surprise when he sees this cogent argument completely overturned only by reminding him that henry wardlaw far from being chancellor during the whole reign of james i never was chancellor at all it was john cameron bishop of glasgow who was chancellor during all that reign crawf off    and the continued favor of james to this able and respectable prelate says more in his favor than is sufficient to confute the fables of boyce  the cromarty ms of the regiam majestatem in the advocates library concerning the antiquity of which sir david hesitates to pronounce is written about    0 as appears from a sacsimile now before me and from the opinion of a skilful inspector    the quoniam attachiamenta or baronial laws seem chiefly of genuine indigenous birth but an edition of our authentic ancient laws with an ample dissertation on the subject is reserved for enlightened times of more acute and suspicious judgment than those of james i or iii the code of infinite importance to philosophy history and antiquities would probably embrace   the genuine laws of david i forming many pages in the regiam majestatem not to be found in glanville   the laws of the burghs apparently ordained by david i   those of the baronial courts   the statuta gildae   the iter camerarii and the iter justiciarii   the forest laws the acts of robert i david ii and the two latter robert admit of easy and certain authentication those of william and alexander ii for none have yet arisen of the third alexander would require more sedulous

   from the family archives   at the time of this erection the house of douglas was in the plenitude of its power and the hamiltons having ever been attached to that great family the source of favor becomes evident nor is it matter of surprise that lord hamilton at first followed douglas against his sovereign after the fall of that house and the marriage with the princess the hamiltons were to become one of the most potent families of scotland and in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that of argyle could alone contest the superiority  to the observations formerly given on tactics little can be added in a parliament of      james ii ordered that all men who have lands or goods be ready horsed and accoutred as their lands and effects will afford for the defense of the realm at the command of the king and that every man whose effects extend to twenty marks be provided at least with a jack with sleeves to the hands or splents and a pricked hat a sword and a buckler a bow and a sheaf of arrows if he can procure them if not an axe and a targe either of leather or firm board with two bands upon the back cap      james iii in      ordained that no merchants should import spears less than six elns in length and that no bowyer in the kingdom should make them of shorter size that every yeoman who cannot use the bow shall have a good axe and a targe of leather to resist the english arrows which will only cost the value of the hyde cap     by both parliaments carts of war are ordered to be provided which bore two patereros or small cannon a machine probably derived

probably led to the institution of the royal guard which appears under his successor and james iii but which james iv was probably to discontinue as on its revival by albany in the minority of the fifth james it was regarded as a novelty concerning the number or pay of the officers and soldiers nothing arises till the last mentioned reign  the scottish guards of france were apparently instituted between the years      and      though they may be as ancient as      when the gendarmerie were restored in the following century the captain was generally a frenchman till      many of the soldiers were scots under louis xiv most were french yet even in the middle of this century when the watch was changed the answer was hamir a corruption of i am here daniel milice francoise amst        vols  to vol ii p        daniels english is hhay hamier   if we except the royal guard and a few occasional garrisons on the frontiers scotland was a stranger to any permanent troops till the restoration france her ally had long set the example of standing forces at first the prop of a government and latterly the ruin the connection between that country and scotland may warrant a brief digression on the origin of an institution which has produced such memorable effects on the political arrangements of europe the original feudal array of france generally served for three months on their own charges the period was afterward restricted to forty days exclusive of the time occupied in joining the army or returning about the year   00 philip augustus had a paid militia each fief furnishing and defraying the expense of an apportioned number of soldiers the defaulter was not only constrained to pay the sum required for the service but a fine and in      charles vi extended the penalty to the forfeiture of the fief the communes communitates or parishes and burghs also furnished and paid their proportions the soldats or soudoyers of froissart had fixed wages and the officers and men sold themselves to any state engaged in war but their disorders becoming excessive charles v terminated them and raised the gendarmerie the soldiery of the sovereign who paid the noble leaders from the royal treasury they providing the men in the weak reign of charles vi the disorders returned charles vii reestablished the gendarmerie about      he maintained fifteen troops of  00 lances each and persuaded the burgesses and yeomanry to defray the expense for their own benefit and protection for the former gendarmerie had been lodged on them each lance had five followers so the whole number was nine thousand but there were also volunteers who served at their own expense in the hope of succeeding on a vacancy so that the troop or company sometimes amounted to   00 horse they were lodged in the towns only twenty or twenty five being allotted to one place and their utility was soon perceived by the prevention of public ravages and disorders and the consequent restoration of agriculture and commerce they were all gentlemen led by the nobles who were ambitious to be captains of the gendarmerie instead of leading their feudal force which henceforth was never raised except when the arriere ban was summoned this institution maintained its purity till the reign of francis i when modern soldiery appeared daniel i         gross eng army i   0 observes that edward iii paid his troops in normandy sixpence to a horseman three pence to an archer at that time the dress of the welsh soldiers was only a tunic and mantle ib ii     nor must it be omitted that charles vii ordered every parish to maintain one archer who had certain immunities daniel i      an example worthy of the imitation of the scottish sovereigns in their anxiety to promote archery as a band of one thousand trained and eminently skilled might have afforded no mean aid in battle and might have kindled universal emulation  from the numbers of the scottish army perhaps the only materials arise from which the population of the country may be vaguely estimated but unhappily the variations are so great that no accuracy can be expected bowar computes the array in      at  00000 half horse half foot including all between the age of sixteen and sixty capable of arms excepting only herds officers and servants of prelates and some excused from necessity or merit cont ford ii  0   supposing the array a sixth of the population the incredible number of two millions four hundred thousand would result other general arrays are computed at one hundred thousand which supposing every eighth person appeared gives the probable number of eight hundred thousand the present population exceeds a million and a half and it has been gradually increasing in this century in the middle ages the most rational computation would be a million yielding an array of eighty thousand effective men but sometimes doubled by a disorderly rabble of unarmed peasants and boys  section iii agriculture useful arts the information on these important topics continues lamentably barren and the acts of parliament present almost the only authentic evidence  the statute of james ii      permitting lands to be let in feu free from military service was a notable introduction to improvement lindsay in his play p     says the custom was derived from france be set in few after the form of france  the same prince had before ordained that a mortgagee of lands should not reduce the rents in order to prolong his possession after his demand had been cleared    0 c     an ordinance of james iii also deserves notice concerning new inventions and selling of lands by charter and seizin and taking again of reversions and the buyer may sell the land again to another person it is now seen expedient in this present parliament and according to law and conscience that the first seller have recourse to the lands sold by him under reversion into whatsoever hands they may come on paying the money and showing the deed of reversion and have the same privilege and freedom against the holder of the lands as against the first purchaser and because such deeds of reversion may chance to be lost our sovereign lord shall order them to be registered in his register on paying the expense half a mark each and the extract shall have the same force as the principal reversion      c      lord kaims supposes that the law of scotland even in that century did not permit the absolute sale of lands or houses except in cases of poverty and where the apparent heir could not purchase hist law tracts p  0       this restraint must greatly have impeded the progress of improvement to which the free and frequent alienation of estates so much contributes a new and monied possessor having many incitements unknown to the indolence and routine of hereditary holders  severe statutes were issued against those forestallers who detained their corn from the market in expectation of a scarcity in august      it was ordered that all the corn in the kingdom should be thrashed out before the last day of may then next and that none should keep more in a granary than was sufficient for their family the measures were regulated in      the firlot containing eighteen pints was to be sixteen inches and a half in the recipient diameter the half firlot and peck to follow in proportion cap         a parliament held in july      ordered every encouragement to foreign merchants importing grain and to scottish merchants bringing it from england cap  0  the act for that purpose in      allows as has already been mentioned that the chief support of the country was by foreign importation the low state and slow progress of agriculture may be further judged of from the statute of james ii      ordering that every man using a plough of eight oxen should sow every year at the least one firlot of wheat half a firlot of pease and forty beans under a penalty of ten shillings to the baron cap     a mere transcript of a statute of james i in       the same parliament of      decreed that no fences should be made of stakes sticks or hewn wood but only of lyand wood a term not absolutely clear cap     ordinances also appear for the destruction of eagles bustards kites hawks and particularly wolves for the latter purpose the sheriff or bailiff of the county where any appear is to collect the people to hunt them and the slayer of the wolf is to receive one penny from every householder in the parish      cap        the burning of heath from march till michaelmas is prohibited under the penalty of five pounds that the standing corn may not be damaged      c     in      the legislature condescended to ordain that a smith who injured a horse in the shoeing should supply another till he were sound or if irremediable should exchange him ib c      the sowing of broom is ordered by a statute of      it is still mashed and given to cattle in a scarcity of other food the same act orders the freeholders when they grant their yearly leases at whitsunday to insist on their tenants planting wood and trees and making hedges cap  0  but these regulations seem to have had little effect and a tenant liable to be turned out every year must have had little spirit to plant or improve had the legislature ordered long leases their skill and patriotism would have been more apparent even now the scottish peasantry object to hedges because forsooth they shelter flocks of birds who injure the grain while the warmth and protection from the wind supply double the store devoured by these intruders so the use of oxen in agriculture is objected to by the servants because they cannot ride them when we perceive what mean interests and prejudices oppose improvements in enlightened ages there is less room to wonder at the slow progress of darker times  an old chronicle has the following articles of intelligence      was the dear summer for the boll of meal was at twenty four shillings and the boll of malt at two marks and the boll of wheat at thirty shillings and many died of famine in      after the kings imprisonment in the castle of edinburgh the corn became more cheap for the boll that was at four pounds was then sold for thirty shillings of white pure silver chron end of winton    d xx the numerals in the last words are not clear and may be xxii not xxx  the learned ruddiman estimates a boll of wheat in      at two shillings of rye barley and pease at one shilling and four pence of oats at six pence an ox six shillings and eight pence a horse thirteen and four pence introd ad andersoni dipl but his authority is the taxation act of james i see appendix and it is probable the articles are not estimated at full price  even in      the boll of meal was at thirteen shillings and four pence the above scarcities must of course have been enormous and show the incredible distress of the country in times of internal commotion the value of the commonest provisions being increased about twenty fold as if the english quarter were to rise from sixty shillings to sixty pounds  concerning the useful arts little information appears special regulations were issued in      concerning works in gold and silver the standard purity of which is to be ascertained by a mark stamped on it by the deacon of the craft cap     in      three marks were ordered one of the artificer one of the deacon the third of the town no dyer of cloth is permitted to exercise the trade of a draper and the measure of cloth is to be computed exclusive of the selvage      c         c         c     till a late epoch flanders was to supply scotland with most of the articles of useful art and manufacture  section iv commerce money navigation the state of commerce in scotland at this period may best be estimated from the following lines of a noted old english poem apparently written in the reign of edward iv it is entitled the bibel of english policy and contains a number of just observations on the political interests of england with some account of the trade of most countries extant in harl ms  0   and published by hakluyt vol i it is quoted by seldom in his mare clausum for the noted lines four things our noble shows to me king ship swerd and powar of the sea   that of scotland is thus described  of the comoditees of scotland and drapyng of her wolle in flandres  also

spayn and fro scotland and fro litell bretaigne we should right sone have pease for all her bostes for they must needs pass by our english costs the main objects discoverable from those rude rimes are that the chief exports of scotland were fells or skins hides and wool that the wool was manufactured at popering and bell or baileul towns on the southern flemish coast between dunkirk and calais that to make fine cloth it was necessary to mingle it with some english wool and that the scottish imports from flanders were mercery but more haberdashery cartwheels and wheelbarrows  further hints concerning commerce may be derived from the statutes salmon formed an important article of export in      it was ordered that each barrel should be capable of containing fourteen gallons and that each burgh dealing in that article should have three iron hoops to measure the cask which is afterward to be marked with a hot iron cattle were not allowed to be sold into england except for ready money      c   0      c     many other regulations concerning merchandise have already been stated in narrating the transactions of the parliaments it is singular that an act of      cap     bearing that merchants must be burgesses worth at least three serplaiths of wool is only enacted by the clergy and barons the interest of the burgesses being esteemed a ground for excluding them from the deliberation  a statute of      considerably illustrates the subject it is ordained that in future no ship be freighted without a charterparty containing the following agreements namely that the master of the ship shall find a sufficient steersman tymmermen and shipmen sit for the service that the master gratuitously furnish the merchants with sire water and salt if there happen any contention or dispute between the master and the merchants they shall abide by the jurisdiction and decree of the town to which the ship is freighted that no merchants goods be torn or spoiled by improper stowage nor anywise injured by the master or his servants on penalty of losing the freight over and above compensation for the damage that the master stow no goods upon the upper deck else they shall bear no freight and no goods under deck that may injure the others in a tempest that every ship exceeding five lasts of goods shall pay to the chaplain of the nation in the foreign port one sack and under five lasts half a sack on the penalty of five pounds to the king no drink money is to be paid to the master or his agents each ship homeward bound shall bring one tun of materials for the churchwork of the town to which it is freighted cap    a lost was about twelve barrels or two sacks of wool sec skene gloff voce serplath   concerning foreign merchants an important regulation was issued by james iii in his last parliament      for the common profit of the whole realm and to excite strangers of other realms to visit this with grain and other merchandise to support the kings subjects it is ordained that in future all strangers be treated honorably with all favor at whatever port they arrive that none of our sovereign lords officers nor other subjects disturb them or arrest their persons ships or goods but they shall have full liberty and freedom to dispose of their goods and sell them to freemen without compulsion or violence nor shall any price be set upon their goods except in fair bargain and sale that no new customs impositions nor exactions be levied on them but solely the ancient duties and when any articles are wanted for the king that his comptroller or receiver after the price has been settled shall have as much of the first and best as is necessary for which immediate payment shall be made that the strangers may not suffer by the delay that in future no person under pretense of purchasing for the king take goods from strangers to sell again under the penalty of exile and escheat of movables and any strangers now in the realm complaining of any goods taken from them or any injury shall have immediate payment and compensation according to justice and in like manner any now absent who may arrive with complaints shall receive compensation and justice against any person in the kingdom so that by the administration of justice and favorable treatment of all strangers they may be excited to return to the great utility of the whole kingdom cap       the same monarch about      grants a passport to some florentine merchants scotst call       commerce was now in a flourishing condition in many countries france the ally of scotland had beheld jaques coeur goldsmith or banker to the king attain enormous wealth by industrious trade in the reign of james ii john dalrymple had the singular title of the kings merchant ibid jan and aug       and perhaps carried on commerce for his sovereigns behoof it has already been stated that james iii had ships his own private property one of which was taken by a vessel belonging to the duke of gloucester nor were the bishops and barons averse to this laudable spirit of adventure  of the annual value of the customs and extent of the trade no evidence remains in      the customs on wool were valued at eight thousand marks yearly  to register f     and any further illustrations of the state of commerce must be reserved till another retrospect after remarking that the collector of the customs is in the statutes termed the customer and that sums arising from them were offen assigned by the monarch as annuities of compensation or reward  the nominal value of the scottish money compared to the english was about one to two till      when it became as one to two and a half and five years after as one to three in      it was about one to three and a half and at last in      as one to four in which state it continued till the reign of mary the gold coin has st andrew on one side and the arms of scotland on the other and from the latter it was termed the lion it also bore the

buss barge or ballinger twelve pence on every fercost and sixpence on large boats anderson dict of commerce i      other circumstances may be found in the text and notes of the narrative  section v ecclesiastic history literature language the few incidents of ecclesiastic history are mostly interwoven in the preceding books deservedly jealous of the papal power our kings continued to guard by repeated statutes the liberties of the scottish church which in some measure corresponded with those of the gallican in      the purchase of any benefice or office at rome was declared treason cap     that avaricious court contriving at this period to draw immense sums from most european kingdoms by the sale of benefices by arbitrary taxations indulgences and other arts but the expense of the bulls of confirmation was to continue a severe tax on the scottish bishops and abbots  the clergy loudly exclaimed against james iii for quashing the freedom of election and assuming into his own hands the nomination to vacant benefices which he sometimes sold to laymen this right was to become a considerable source of influence to the crown when no minority intervened but it was perhaps one cause of the enmity betrayed by mair boyce and other ecclesiastic writers against the royal family and prerogative the avarice of the pope a churchman would have been more tolerable to them than that of their sovereign and the injury of their holy monopoly was an unpardonable oftence james i had in his first parliament ordered that no clergyman should pass or send an agent out of the realm without permission and that no benefices should be purchased cap        but the royal nomination seems rarely to have been exercised till the reign of james iii and the wealth of the church which was at least equivalent to that of all the layinterest became a great object of state intrigue in      it is ordained by the king and his three estates concerning the privilege of the crown used and observed in all times past in the presentation to benefices during a vacancy in the sees of bishops that our sovereign lord and his successors shall in future during the vacation of a see have power to present to benefices till the bishop show his bulls to the kings highness and to the chapter and in case that our sovereign lord of his special grace and favor admit any prelate to his temporalities before he show his bulls such admission shall imply no prejudice nor harm to his highness concerning the said privilege and right of presentation cap      while even the penury of scotland was taxed to pamper papal avarice and luxury the miseries of other kingdoms were extreme on the enquiry into the causes of the poverty of france instituted in the states general held at tours in      though the tiersetat chiefly consisted of clergy and maistres it was agreed that the chief cause was the avarice of the popes alexander and martin which had drained the kingdom of not less than two millions of gold much of the coin had also passed to england and none remained in france except foreign money the bishoprics of france at that time amounting to one hundred and one the abbeys and conventual priories to more than three thousand the effects of papal extortion were very extensive and it is ordered that no legate be be in future admitted to pillage the kingdom jaligny hist de charles viii paris      folio p       0  see in the same work p     a papal dispensation mentioning the days of each month on which anne duchess of bourbon might obtain remission of all sins committed by her or by any ten persons whom she might name no religious system even perverted morality so much as the roman catholic pardon for sins is ever a dangerous tenet a better creed would prevent crimes by denying any celestial pardon   it is not a little remarkable that the papal dominions themselves at a time when all the wealth of europe was pouring into them were almost a desert a striking instance of the absurd and heterogeneous nature of ecclesiastic power in temporal affairs the state of the church lands in scotland remains in obscurity but while the clergy sometimes aspired to commerce they do not appear to have advanced agriculture  ecclesiastic censures and excommunication beginning to be despised in the reign of james ii they were enforced by secular penalties      c        c     in      the power of appointing notaries in civil causes was assumed by the king though the german emperor had before been understood to possess that prerogative yet the regal notaries are to be examined by the bishops and the papal notaries retain their power      c      the eloquence of the pulpit remained in a low condition some judgment of it may be formed from the latin oration of whitlaw to richard iii in which he quotes virgil statius cicero and seneca and among other arguments for peace says christ was born in peace was buried in peace sleeped in peace and rested in peace yet in england at that period dr shaw and friar pinke were celebrated preachers at st pauls cross in the popular idiom to a popular audience and perhaps instituted the execrable example of political sermons by promoting the sanguinary usurpation of richard in delineating the character of bishop kennedy lindsay says he caused all parsons and vicars to remain at their parish churches for instruction and edifying of their flocks and caused them to preach the word of god unto the people and to visit them when they were sick and also the said bishop visited every church within his diocese four times in the year and preached to the parishioners the word of god truly and enquired of them if they were duly instructed in the word of god by their parson and vicar and if their sacraments were duly administered and if the poor were sustained and the youth educated and taught conformably to the order that was taken in the church of god and where he found that order was not followed he made great punishment to the effect that gods glory might shine through all the country within his diocese giving good example to all future archbishops and churchmen in general to cause the patrimony of the church of god be used for the glory of god and the common benefit of the poor p   0 edit       vo that sermons were common in the vulgar tongue before the reformation also appears from the diarium vazstenense p   0 where in      the bishop of lincopen fecit sermonem ad populum in vuigari   the remainder of the character of this venerable prelate may well interest the reader as a picture of ecclesiastic worth drawn in simple and pleasing colors he was a man well learned in the civil laws and of great experience in them and by his genius literature knowledge lengthened practice and years he knew the nature of scotishmen so well that he was the most able of all the lords of scotland spiritual or temporal to give any wise counsel or an answer when the time occurred before the prince or the council and specially in the time of parliament or when the ambassadors of other countries came for their affairs there was none so able as he to give them answer conformably to their petition and the desires of their masters when any commotions occurred in the realm he showed equal wisdom for he gave counsel to king james ii when he was ready to depart out of scotland for fear of the earl of douglas who had gathered against him to the number of forty thousand men ready to give him battle or else to chase him out of the realm lindsay adds that the bishop led the king into his oratory and after prayers produced a sheaf of arrows not to be broken when joined but easily fractured apart from this demonstration of an esopian apologue he showed that the power of the aristocracy must be assailed by degrees ibid lindsay is so fond of this story that he has interpolated it into his translation of boyces reign of james ii p        and repeats it here at full length   the state of the church may also be estimated from the old poem before quoted priests of peebles ubi supra p        one of the questions is why the pious bishops and clergy of former times exercised all good works and performed miracles while no such practice or power appeared among their successors the answer is that anciently the bishops were chosen by the people after invocation of the holy ghost either from among the clergy of that chapter or by selecting from those of all the kingdom the person most proper for that particular see that now they are appointed by the king and introduced by the sole hand of power so that they can work no miracles except by the special assistance of the devil that no man procures a benefice by merit literature or even birth but solely by gold simony being accounted no transgression and the holy ghost having no hand in the election his precious gifts were in consequence not imparted while the regal inspiration could only confer the love of gold a gift of no miraculous nature and the bishops being themselves shorn they practiced the shearing of their flocks with great affiduity and success this being the genuine meaning of the symbolic ecclesiastical tonsure  while the bishops and many abbots were lords as having seats in parliament the inferior clergy were distinguished by the titles of master and sir the former perhaps appropriated to a master

james ii born in    0  and scottish history is indebted to his labor though his deplorable defect of judgment render his work a mere chaos of materials mingled with eccentric digressions and excursive reading yet from these the state of learning in the country may be estimated he quotes upwards of one hundred authors and among them many latin classics but former compilations no doubt supplied him with much of his erudition the common use of paper rapidly increased the number of manuscripts and the invention of printing was still more to serve the cause of science  bowar had unhappily no successor till john mair wrote in      and for the affairs of the fifteenth century we are indebted to the researches of lindsay ferrerius lesley and buchanan who do not indicate their sources of information yet apparently short chronicles were written and preserved in the monasteries till they perished in the violence of the reformation or mouldered amid the neglect of literature in the succeeding century of ecclesiastic dispute and fanaticism in his last chapter bowar says he desists from writing lest he might seem to flatter the living actors and he closes with the following advice it is properly ordered in most countries and as i have heard in england that every monastery of royal foundation should have its appropriated scribe to narrate the more memorable events that occur during each reign in that and the neighboring countries according to strict truth and chronology on the death of a king these chroniclers proceed to the first general council and produce their labors which are referred to the examination of the most sagacious and skillful who from the whole digest one summary chronicle the books are then returned to the libraries of the monasteries as authentic chronicles deserving of faith lest by the lapse of time the memory of events should perish in the kingdom so would i advise our king to order lest if the present work should be lost which heaven forbid the memory of popes kings peers and illustrious men should also perish with the incitements to virtue or the cautions against faults which are afforded by the perusal of their actions p          this advice was unhappily not followed and our monarchs amid their patronage of the arts seem little to have attended to the utility and glory of national history the monastic cellar was better replenished than the library and the jolly inhabitants preferred one terrestrial beauty to all the nine muses in france as has appeared in narrating the events of      there was a chronicler at st denis who inserted narratives upon the oaths of the relators and indeed every historian ought to write as if he had made a solemn asseveration in the presence of god and his country that truth shall be his sole pursuit the judicious fortescue informs us that the chronicler of st albans wrote at the end of every month what had happened in its course and that this work which was called flores

    and see spottiswoode rel houses p     if the remaining chapel be the chief fabric it can hardly be called a collegiate church  a chapel which remains entire is a gem of gothic architecture universally known and admired  james iii was so fond of this art that cochran an architect became his chief favorite besides the great hall in the castle of stirling he founded the royal chapel there an institution of great magnificence for that age lindsay etc  the dean was to be the queens confessor and to have episcopal jurisdiction this dignity was first annexed to the provostry of kirkheugh near st andrews another royal chapel and afterward to the bishopric of galloway there were besides a subdean sacristan chanter treasurer chancellor archdeacon sixteen chaplains and six singing boys with a master of music the endowments consisted of two abbeys numerous churches and lands james iv was to maintain and enlarge the institution and to procure the papal confirmation spottiswoode ib  the architecture and decorations apparently corresponded with the greatness of the revenue annexed and with the royal favor and piety  in the year      bishop kennedy founded st salvators college in st andrews and erected a magnificent tomb for himself in which he was interred in      ibid  this tomb is a favorable specimen of the state of the arts at that period but a turkish custom of a plain stone with a large hole or two to collect rainwater that the birds may find drink breathes more of christian humility and charity  the large golden medal of james iii appended to the shrine of st john at amiens and minutely described by du cange was probably the production of an italian or flemish artist that some eminent foreign painter had also visited scotland about      appears from the celebrated picture at kensington in the form of a folding altar piece painted on both sides or in four compartments the first represents the king kneeling behind him is his son a youth about twelve years of age which ascertains the date and st andrew the patron saint of scotland the royal crown is not arched nor was apparently till the reign of james v when new regalia were ordered but it has high fleurons of great richness the robe is of a lilac hue furred with ermine the vest cloth of gold in the second compartment the queen appears also kneeling in a kirtle of cloth of gold and blue robe her headdress one blaze of gold and jewels the arms depicted with exact heraldry indicate the daughter of denmark and behind her is a personage in platearmour apparently her father in the character of st canute the patron of his kingdom  of the two compartments on the reverse of this grand piece one represents the trinity in the other an ecclesiastic kneels but his heraldry of three buckles and a cheveron can hardly be traced except to the obscure family of bonkil in the merse it may be sir william rogers or some other eminent foreigner  behind is a kind of organ with two angels not of ideal beauty and perhaps portraits of the kings two sisters mary lady hamilton and margaret then unmarried a conjecture supported by the uncommon ornament of a coronet on the head of one of the angels hardly can any kingdom in europe boast of a more noble family picture of this early epoch and it is in itself a convincing specimen of the attention of james iii to the arts the style of painting as usual in such early pieces is that of the miniatures in manuscripts enlarged originally the productions of monks and nuns in that curious work the diarium vazstenense published by benzelius at upsal        0 being a minute chronicle of events happening at wadstena on the wetter lake in a convent of monks and nuns united a privilege peculiar to frigid regions the following

florence              vols  to     in describing the character of that prince ferrerius mentions that he not only loved literature and invited john ireland a celebrated scottish doctor of the sorbonne into his kingdom and rewarded his talents with a rich benefice but extended his patronage to music in particular william roger an excellent english musician having attended the ambassadors of edward iv into scotland in      james was delighted with his performances and persuading him to remain in his court raised him to knighthood under the instruction of this man the most celebrated of his profession numerous eminent musicians arose in the court of scotland and even so late as      many great musicians boasted that they were of his school f       holland in his poem of the houlat or owl apparently a satire on james ii by a partizan of the house of douglas mentions no less than twenty five kinds of musical instruments scottish poems      vol iii p       in proceeding to consider the state of manners the military exercises attract the first notice to promote the practice of archery the games of football and the golf continued under strong prohibition yet the highlanders appear to have been the chief archers in the ancient scottish armies while the lowlanders preferred the spear in describing the army of james iii in      lindsay enumerates no less than ten thousand highlanders with bows under the earls of huntley and athole the author of the present state of scotland      mentions p   bows and arrows as the chief weapons of the highlanders even of that period  repeated statutes were ineffectual to introduce archery in the lowlands one of the most precise is that of james ii in his noted parliament of      it is decreed and ordained that the displays of weapons be held by the lords and barons spiritual and temporal four times in the year and that the football and golf be utterly cried down and not to be used that the bowmarks be made a pair of buts at every parish church and shooting be practiced that every man shoot six shots at the least and that two pence be levied upon the absent for drink to the shooters the practice to last from easter till all saints and all to be ready by next midsummer that there be a bowyer and fletcher in every chief town of a shire the town to furnish them with the necessary materials to serve the country the penalty on football and golf a fine to the baron and if he neglect the kings officers shall levy it if the parish be large there shall be three four or five bowmarks in the most convenient places and that all men exceeding twelve and under fifty years of age practice archery cap      among the great the chief exercise of arms was the solemn tournament which might almost be classed under the head of tactics did that science comprize the preparations for war these grand displays of martial skill were seldom undertaken by any save those who had been solemnly invested with the order of knighthood an institution forming a kind of fraternal society throughout europe and which contributed not a little to divest war of its horrors to abate national animosity and to promote the intercourse and consequent civilization of remote kingdoms  knights were generally created with great solemnity by the king himself sometimes by the general or other aged knights of eminent fame before a battle the ancient oath administered in scotland has been preserved and deserves insertion as a curious relic of the spirit of chivalry    i shall fortify and defend the christian religion to the uttermost of my power    i shall be loyal and true ot my sovereign lord the king to all orders of chivalry and to the noble office of arms    i shall fortify and defend justice at my power and that without favor or

habiliments and shall help and succor those of the same order at my power if they have need    i shall enquire and seek to have the knowledge and understanding of all the articles and points contained

and christs holy evangel presently preached in this realm an addition by the reformers art   the kings majesty   the scottish knights continued to vye with any in europe the celebrated tourney of      has already been briefly mentioned in the historical narrative but a minute account of that noted contest shall here be translated as literally as possible from the memoirs of olivier de la march a contemporary burgundian writer as a picture of manners delineated in plain and simple colors live i c    p          edit gand       to meriadet was a squire of bretagne ib p     jaques de lalain was at length killed by a cannonshot in      p     the church and mansion of lalain were in hainault a noted country of warriors   when messire jaques de lalain saw that there was no further occasion for him there he returned and sound the good duke of burgundy in his city of lille who received him favorably but he soon took leave of the duke and set our for scotland he was accompanied by messire simon de lalain his uncle and herve de meriadet and many other worthy men and so far as i understand messire james douglas brother of the earl of douglas and the said messire jaques de lalain had formerly wished to meet in arms and had sought each other for that purpose at the instance of the said messire james douglas battle was permitted by the king between him and m jaques de lalain but the affair grew and multiplied so that a conflict to outrance was concluded on of three noble scotishmen against m simon and m jaques de lalain and herve de meriadet all to fight at once before the king of scotland and when the day of the conflict came the king most honorably received them in the lists and though i was not myself a spectator yet i must recount the ceremonies for example to future times for three memorable things occur besides the battle which was most fiercely disputed on both sides  the first was that when the three belonging to the court of burgundy were all armed and each his coat of arms on his back ready to enter into battle m jaques de lalain spoke to m simon his uncle and to meriadet and said messieurs and my brothers in the conflict you know that it is my enterprise which has led us into this kingdom and that in consequence the battle has been granted to m james douglas and although each of us may assist his comrade i beg and request you that whatever befall me this day none of you attempt to succor me for it would seem that you had passed the sea and entered into this conflict only to assist me and that you did not hold or know me a man able to sustain the assault and combat of one knight and hence less account will be held of me and my knighthood  after this request sallied from the pavilions the champions in armor furnished with axes lances swords daggers and they had leave either to throw or push their lances as they chose  the two messires james douglas and jaques de lalain were in the middle to encounter each other which they did on the right was m simon de lalain who was to engage a scottish squire and meriadet was to meet a knight of high power and fame but they found themselves transverse so that the knight was opposite to m simon and then meriadet who desired to assail him who was appointed without regard to the strength or fame of his antagonist passed across to place himself before m simon and meet his man but the good knight coldly and firmly turned toward meriadet and said brother let each keep himself to his opponent and i shall do well if it please god so meriadet resumed his rank before his antagonist and this is the second thing which i desired to commemorate  the champions began to advance each against the other and because that the three on the part of burgundy doubted least the place might be too confined for so many lances they all three threw their lances behind them the third cause of my recital and seized their axes and rushed on the scots who came within push of lance but that availed them nothing though all fought at once i shall rehearse the adventures one after the other  the two messires james douglas and de lalain met each other and approached so nigh that of all their weapons there remained none save a dagger which the scottish knight held the said m jaques de lalain seized him by the arm near his hand which held the dagger so closely that the scot could not avail himself of it and he held the other arm below the armpit so that they turned each other round the lists for a long time  m simon de lalain and the scottish knight were strong champions and neither of them skilled in warding blows of the axe like two valiant knights they attacked each other of often that in a short time they had crushed the visors of their basinets and their weapons and armor with mutual blows and the fight seemed equal  on the other side was herve de meriadet whom the scotishman attacked with the push of lance but meriadet turned off the blow with the but end of his axe so that the lance fell from the scots hands and meriadet pursued him so keenly that before the scot could undo his axe he came within his guard and with one blow felled him to the earth meriadet then left the scot to arise who was quick light and of great spirit and arose speedily and ran to meriadet for the second time meriadet who was one of the most redoubted squires of his time for strength lightness coolness and skill in arms and in wrestling received the assault with great composure then returned it and again struck him to the ground with his axe when the scot again attempted to rise but meriadet struck him on the back with his hand and knee and made him fall flat on the sand and notwithstanding the request which messire jaques de lalain had made the said meriadet seeing the struggle of the two knights advanced to assist the said jaques but the king of scots threw down his baton and they were parted now though it be against my plan and though i write of this combat without having seen it i nevertheless report it truly by the report of the scots and of our party  such is this curious contemporary relation other valuable materials concerning the manners of this period may be found in the annals of de coucy another burgundian coeval historian who probably attended mary of gelder to scotland in      as before mentioned on her landing the clergy citizens and people of leith were ready to receive her and she thence proceeded on horseback behind the lord of vere to edinburgh where about ten thousand people advanced to meet her a bishop and the chancellor conducted her to the monastery of the jacobins or gray friars after the kings first visit on thursday the countesses of orkney and march and another attended on her by the royal command when she had sufficiently refreshed herself from the fatigues of the voyage james on the following wednesday sent to appoint the next day for the wedding and presented her with two hackneys worth about thirty french crowns on thursday the wedding day the king came on horseback and was dressed in a gray robe lined with white cloth boots and spurs the queen was clothed with a robe of violet color lined with ermine in a strange fashion says de coucy if compared with those of france and her long hair hanging down the coronation of the queen immediately followed the marriage hist par de coucy in the edition of jean chartier paris      folio p           from some of the preceding circumstances it would rather appear that james ii was austere in manners and expense and reversed his fathers magnificence which was unpopular in a penurious country and was imputed to an english education  at the festival which followed the solemnity the first dish was the figure of a boars head painted and stuck full of hards or coarse bits of flax which was served up in an enormous platter surrounded with thirty two banners bearing the arms of the king and chief nobles the flax was then kindled amid the joy and acclamations of the numerous and brilliant assembly in the hall a ship of silver exquisitely wrought was then introduced probably containing salt and spices in distinct compartments the earl of orkney then entered accompanied by four knights preceding the first service and every service was brought by about thirty or forty persons all bearing dishes at the second table the countess of orkney and other ladies sat with the lord of vere at a third was a patriarch says de coucy perhaps a papal legate or foreign visitant or some scotishman enjoying a titular dignity three bishops an abbot and other churchmen the five dignitaries drinking out of a large hanap or bowl of wood without spilling any the wine and other liquors being as abundant as seawater the dinner continued about five hours there being neither dancing nor supper on the following days there was excellent cheer in their way proceeds this author which was very rude and strange when compared with that of france in five or six days vere set out on his return and the king made some presents the queen weeped at their departure though isabel de lalain and two or three other women and as many men of her country were left to serve her ibid   in the reign of james iii the author of the old poem before quoted represents his three priests as enjoying their collation at peebles consisting of three roasted capons with sauce and many other meats and imputes to their desire of privacy that they had only a boy to serve them a roundel or round table covered with a fair cloth stands before them and neither bread nor liquor are wanting taverns and dice are reprobated and a merchants cupboard of plate is estimated at three thousand scottish pounds or about seven thousand five hundred of modern sterling currency p       0 besides plate mazer cups are mentioned by the scottish poets this substance corresponding with the french madre appears to be china or earthen ware painted like the old vases ridiculously ascribed to raphael   the advances of luxury among the aristocracy and clergy may also be estimated by that of concomitant crimes the two statutes of    0 against domestic and foreign importers of poisons show that profligacy had made more rapid strides than civilization another sort of poison bad wine was interdicted by a statute of      declaring the penalty of death to any importer seller or composer of corrupted or mixed liquor    0 c  0         c      game and hunting were luxuries of the great in      it is ordered that none destroy the nests or eggs or fowls themselves when moulting nor kill hares or rabbits in the season of snow on pain of indictment a penalty of ten pounds is in      imposed on stealers of hounds or hawks trained or untrained or even taking eggs or young hawks out of nests in another persons property that for robbing the nests of partridges or wild ducks is forty shillings the slaughter of does roes or deer in time of snow or their young under a years growth is punished by indictment and a fine of ten pounds and the stealing of deer or roes from enclosures or parks rabbits pigeons or fish in ponds or ditches is made liable to the same punishment as any other act of theft      c         c  0      to diversify the prolixity of a life of idleness and relieve the formalities of ceremony were objects attempted by the maintenance of a regular fool who however had generally sense enough to respect his master he was distinguished by his party colored coat his cap with large ears and bells and his club or bauble ornamented with grotesque allusions to his profession the minstrels and choristers were musicians so termed because in the middle ages church music was the only branch of the art which was regularly cultivated but lindsay mentions that a part of the choristers of the chapelroyal at stirling always attended james iii to make him merry p      and it appears that the ecclesiastic musicians did not disdain strains of recreation in hollands poem the minstrels are solely occupied in singing hymns accompanied with numerous musical instruments scottish poems      iii      the poets composers of songs and romances were generally of the clerical order the term of minstrel was afterward applied to any musician but the only strolling poets were the irish or highland bards whose rude manners are depicted by holland and who are classed in the statutes with common vagabonds while james iii so highly favored minstrels or musicians that he permitted them to equal knights or heralds in their apparel hollands irish bard sings a wild song and fabulous genealogy in his native language and afterward fights with two fools his proper equals and companions ibid   0       the character of rimer or poet was as superior to that of minstrel as the jugler was beneath it in hollands curious production the juglour merely exhibits feats of manual magic a view of hunting is followed by a sea fight the kings cup is suddenly changed a gray goose becomes a gold garland sand becomes silver and the like experiments of common adepts ib     the vague appellations and corrupt latinity of the middle ages confound remote characters as the minstrel and jugler etc   yet the belief in real magic and witchcraft was now prevalent both in england and scotland the duchess of gloucester had been imprisoned as a witch in      and see many writs in rymer de sortilegis capiendis  and about thirty years after we find many witches and magicians condemned to the flames in scotland for conspiring with mar against the kings life this new folly was to vegetate and flourish for near three centuries  the manners of the great may be further illustrated from the tales of the priests of peebles one question is why the peers have so much degenerated from their ancestors in virtue wisdom and valor the answer is that the royal officers of justice diminish the privileges of the lords by indicting and fining their tenants for pretended crimes so that the latter are reduced to poverty and unable to arm themselves properly to attend their masters in war or to pay their rents in peace the peers in consequence become poor themselves and endeavor to replenish their coffers by unworthy marriages with the opulent bastarddaughters of priests or heiresses of merchants or by selling the right of marriage of their sons to rich commoners ut supra p        but this satire rather refers to the artful avarice of james iii and seems to evince that a great cause of the conspiracy of the peers was their impoverishment occasioned by his exactions on pretense of the administration of justice which as appears from the statutes themselves was never in a worse state than under his reign  the dress of this period may best be illustrated from several statutes on the subject the following is of august      cap      concerning the habits of the earls lords of parliament commissioners of burghs and advocates to be used in the parliament or general council it is ordained  that all earls shall use mantles of brown granit or fine cloth open before lined with white furr and trimmed in front with same furring of a hands breadth and down to the belt with little hoods of the same cloth pendent on the shoulders  and the other lords of parliament shall have a mantle of red open in like manner before lined with silk or furred with cristie gray griece or purray some furs inferior to the ermine worn by earls with a hood of the same cloth furred as the lining  and all commissioners of burghs each to have a pair of clokes a cloak of blue cloth furred to the feet open on the right shoulder the fur of proportional value and a hood of the same  whatever earl lord of parliament or commissioner of the burghs shall enter the parliament or general council except dressed as above shall instantly deposit a fine of ten pounds to the king  in every burgh where a parliament or general council is to be held there shall be erected at the bar three tiers of benches each higher than the other for the commissioners of the burghs to sit upon under the penalty of ten pounds to be raised on the town where the parliament or general council shall be held  all men hired as forespeakers or advocates shall wear green habits in the form of a short tunic tunikil the sleeves to be open like those of a tabard any advocate otherwise appearing before the parliament or general council and speaking for a reward shall forfeit five pounds to the king  the curiosity of this statute may excuse a few remarks the brown granit worn by the earls was perhaps a tawny fine cloth a color fashionable in this century till it was supplanted by a brighter tint scarlet a term corresponding to granit and applied by metonymy to the fineness of the cloth or to its color the common people as has been already mentioned were allowed to wear on holidays light blue green or red tartan being as yet little known or confined to the great but the finest cloths appear to have been generally dyed tawny or scarlet while purple and crimson were tints almost confined to velvets and silks and appropriated to princes may it not be inferred from the particular order for seats to the commissioners of the burghs either within or without the bar for the expression is dubious that they were sometimes obliged to stand in the presence of the haughty clergy and aristocracy  in      this act was confirmed with the addition that the king should order patterns of all the dresses to be made cap     the sumptuary law of the same year has already been stated in the first section of this retrospect it permits the dignified or rich clergy to wear gowns of scarlet with costly furs  james iii in      ordered that considering the great penury of the realm and the expense of importing silk none should wear it in doublets gowns or clokes whose revenue was under one hundred pounds scottish money in landed rent excepting knights minstrels and heralds and that women whose husbands came not within the above descriptions should not use silk in linings but only in making the collar and sleeves cap     the dress of this prince and his queen has been already described  the gowns and mantles were sometimes indecently short at this period as appears from a penalty imposed by an english statute of the twentysecond year of edward iv the doublet and hose were long to remain in the same form but shoes more than six inches broad at the toes began to succeed the other extreme of long peaks louis xi of france            appears in those broad shoes see camdens remains art

semely mane of person and knight clepid the duke of roseye and the younger clepid james steward that was bote of years young and mean of stature this duke of roseye perseyved in his reason the greet age of the king his fadir the ympotencye of his lymmes and membirs the febilenese of his person that sore vexed hyme in his age begane unlawefully to tak upon him the royal guvernance thurghe the which presumcion orguyle and pruyde he wexe full of viciousnes in his lyvyng as in dispusellyng and defowlyng of young madyns and in brekyng the ordire of weddelok by his foul ambicious lust of that voluptenus lust of advoutre wherefore the lords and the nobles of the rewme of scotland considering that vicious lyvyng of that said duke               a leaf torn out             these traturs furters and contractes ended by the counsel and consent of both the parties of the kings the king of scotts had leve enlagissid and had saufecondit of his master the king of england for so the king of

cumyng home out of england ynto scotteland whom all with many other of their afinite the said king of scottis let arrest and hem severally in diverse castle full hard prisoned till he had fondon means and wais for to do hem lawfully to death as false traitors because of the false murdure of his brother the duke of rosay whose death the people of the land sore grutched and mowrnid seying that they suppoised and ymagynd that the king did rather that vigorious execucion upon the lords of his kyne for the covetise of their possessions and goods thane for any other rightful cause althofe he fond colourabill wais to serve his intent in the contrary  all those things thus done the said king of scotts noght stanchid of his unsacionable and gredi avarice ordeynd that tallage and other imposicions upon his people gretter and more chargeant then ever were acustumyd before that time so that the comoners of his land secretly clepid him not rightwes bot a tirannous prince what for the outrageus imposicions importables of use on taxes and tallages upon his pour subjectes and people but after the wisdom of some philisophers the comone langage of the peiple often spekith without reason nevertheless many of the lords of that land dredyng sore of the harm that might betide drowghe hem to counsel how they might withstand and resist the kings tyranye sith he hade so litill pite of the death done to hyme of his lords many of hem being so negh of his royal blood and also of the gredi covatise that he oppressid and enpoverisid his comonalte withal the king being present in his said cownesell rose up with a maneli swollon heart a knight clepid sir robert grame a great gentilman and an earls sune a mane of great wit and eloquence wundir futtilye wittyd and expert in the law saying these words opynly to the lords sirs if ye woll firmly stand by that at i shall say to the king in your audience i trust to god that we shall find a good remedy and help to the which sayng the lords cosentid and said that they trustyng holly in his prudent and discret manchode would conform and consent in hie and low to mayntene all that he would tak on hand to say for the general we will of hem and of all that land in that matter by him than mevid  upon this the king let to somond a parliament of the iii astatis of his rewme where this same sir robert grame fully set and asurid and purposid to perform that at he had behight and promysid unto the lords as is before rehersid he rose upe with a great courage with a violent chere and countenance set hands upon the king sayng these words i arrest you in the name of all the three astates of your reume here now assemblid in this present parliament for right as your liege people be bundun and sworn to obey your majeste noble riall in the same wise been ye sworn and ensurid to keep your people to keep and guverne your law so that ye do hem no wrong bot in all right mantene and defend hem and there and then forthwith the said sir robert grame asuryng him fully in the promise made unto him by the said lords said is hit not thus as i say unto the which sayng none of all the astates before rehersid would ne durst speak oone word bot kapid silence the king therewith percevyng all this presumptuous rebellion and wirchyng of the said sir robert grame greatly movyd and stirryd against him as that reason would let do him arrest and commandid to put him in sure and hard prisone  this sir robert grame seeing himself thus desavyd there of the said lords spoke and said in this wise he that serves a common mane he serves by short procese of time after this the king exiled this sir robert grame and all his haritages and goods deemed as forfaturs to the king  upon his exile this sir robert grame took his way ynto the cuntreis of the wild scottis wherthat he conspired and ymagynd how that he might destruye his king and furthwith he renounsed his legeance and by words and by writing he defied hem seying that he had destruyd him his wif and his childerne his haritages and all his other gods by his cruel tyranny wherefore he said he would slay him with his own hands as his mortal enmye if were he might se time and find wais and means thereto the king hugely vexid in his spretes with the traturous and malicious rebellion of the said sir robert grame did make an opyn proclamacion by all the rewme of scotteland that whosoever might slay or tak hyme and bring him to the kings presence should have iii thousand demyes of gold every piece worth half an englissh noble  nocht long after this the king let so ordeyne his parliament in due form at edenbourghe somunde in the year of our lord a thousand four hundredth six and thirtye in the fest of all hallowen to the which parliament the said sir robert grame stired a full cruel vengance ayene the king sent privy messages and letturs to certain men and servantes of the duke of albayne whom the king a litill before hade done rigorusly to death lich as hit is entitild here before opynly that if they consent and faver him he would uttirly take upon him for to slay the king lest through his tirannye and covetise he would destruy this reume of scotteland and the corone of the land shall be yovon to sir robert stuard which is the kyngs cosyn and next of the right of the corone bot if the king had a sune the same roberts fadir then liggyng in hostage to the king of england for the said james king of scotts in the tower of london till that his fynaunce were fully content and paid and the said sir roberts grantesire the earl of athetelles of that treison and counsel as hit was said and by himself secretly desirid and covetid to have the corone for which causes the same sir robert grame was half the better consentid to bring thaire purpos to effect for this sir robert stuard did ever abide in the kings presence full famulier about hyme at all hours and most privey above all other and was a full gentill squire fressh lusty and right amyable whom the king entierly loved as his own sone and for the tendure love that he had to hyme he made hym constable of all his host and at the sege of edenbourgh sic roxburgh   after this the king sodanly avisid made a solemn fest of the cristynmes at perth which is clepid sant johns town which is from edenbourgh on that other side of the scottesh see the which is vulgarly clepid the water of lethe in the myddis of the way their arose a woman of yreland that clepid herself as a suthsayer the which anon as she saw the king she cried with loud voise sayng thus my lord king and ye pase this water ye shall never turn ayane on lyve the king heryng this was astonyed of her wordis for bot a litill to fore he had red in a prophecy that in the self same year the king of scotts should be slain and therwithall the king as he rode clepid to him oone of his knyghtis and gave him in comaundment to torn ayane to speak with that woman and ask of here what sheo would and what thing sheo meant with her loud cryyng and sheo began and told him as ye hafe hard of the king of scotts if he passed that water as now the king askid her how sheo knew that and sheo said that huthart told her so sire quod ho men may calant y tak non head of yond womans words for sheo nys bot a drunkine fule and wot not what sheo says and so with his folk passid the water clepid the scottisshe see toward saint johnnes town bott iiii miles from the cuntreth of the wild scotts where in a close of blakfriars withowt the said town the king held a great fest  where upon a day as the king played at the chesses with oone of his knyghtis whom in playng wise he clepid king of love for he was a lusti man full amorous and much medeled him with loves art and as hit came the king to mind of the prophecy spokyne tofore the king said to this knight sir king of love quod he hit is not long agone fith i redd a prophecy spokyne of tofore that i saw how that his year should a king be slain in this land and ye wot well sir alexander there be no mo kings in this reume bot ye and i and therefore i cownesell you that ye be well ware for i let you wit that i shall ordeyne for my sure keeping sufficiently i trust to god so i am undir your kynghood and in the service of love and thus the king in his solas played with the knight  withyn short time after this the king being in his chambur talkyng and playng with the lords knyghtis and squyers that were abowte hyme spak of many dyvers matters among was there a squire that was right acceptable to the king that speak and said for sothe my lord quod he me dremed varelye to night that sir robert grame should hafe slain you and that heryng the earl of orkeney thoo warnyd the squire that he should hald his peace and tell nane such tales in the kings presence and therewith the king herying this squyers dreme remembered himself how that same night how heo had a sweyvyn slepyng and semyd to him varaly that a cruel serpent and an horribill tode assailid him furiously in his kyngeschambur and how he was sore afright and aferd of him and that he had nothing wherewith he might socoure and defend himself bot oonly a pair of tanges that studyn in the chymneth  and many other tokyns and tails liche to this the which now may well be demyd by varay demonstracions and also pronosticacions to the king of his death and murdur had he or the time of his death fell also oone of kings traitors clepid cristofere chawmebur that was a squire of the dukes house of albayne iii times he drugh him to the kings presence for he would haf plainly opynd and told him of the purpos of all the traitors that were about to murdure hyme because that the king withowt any cause hatid him rightfully this and several other sentences are most obscurely expressed  and thus as hit is said by the old wise fadirs many years or we were borne what thing that destyned to a person be hit late be hit sone at the last ever hit cumyth  thus after this cane fast apporoch the night in the which the said james stward king of scotts should falsely him unwittyng suffure his horribill death by murdure this which is pite that any gentill or good man to thynk upon so both before soper and long aftire ynto quarter of the night in the which the earl of athetelles and robert stward were about the king where they were occupied at the playng of the chesse at the tables in redyng of romans in syngyng and pypyng in harpyng and in other honest solaces of great pleasance and disport therewith came the said woman of yreland that clepid herself a dyvenourese and entered the kings court till that she came streght to the kings chambur door where sheo stood and abode because that hit was shitte and fast sheo knokyd till at the last the ussher opyng the dure marvelyng of that womans being there that time of the night and askyng here what sheo would let me in sire quod sheo for i haf sumwhat to say and to tell unto the king for i am the same woman that noght long agone desirid to haf spokyn with him at the lith when he should pass the scottish see the ussher went in and told him of this woman yea quod the king let her cume to morrow because that he was occupied with such disportes at that time him lit not to entend her as hen the ussher came ayane to the chamber door to the said woman and there he told her that the king was besye in playng and bid her cum so ayane upon the morrow well said the woman hit shall repent you all that ye will not let me speak now with the king thereat the ussher lughe and held her bot a fule chargyng her to go her way and therwithall sheo went thens  withyn an owre the king askid the voidee and drank the travers in the chambure edraw and every man depairtid and went to rist than robert stward that was right famylier with the king and had all his commandementes in the chamber was the laft that departid and he knew well the false purveid theison and was consentid thereto and therefore left the kings chamburs door opyne and had brussed and blundird the lokes of hem in such wise that no man might shute hem and about mydnyght he laid certain plaunches and hurdelles over the diches of the diche that environd the gardyne of the chambure upon which the said traitors entered that is to say the forsaid sir robert grame with other of his covyne ynto the nowmbre of three hundredth persons the king that same time there stondyng in his night gown all unclothid save his shirt his cape his comb his coverchif his furrid pynsons slippers upon the form and the foot sheet so stondyng afor the chymney playng with the qwene and other ladis and gentilwomen with here cast offe his night gown for to have gone to bed  but he harkynd and hard great noise without and great clateryng of harnych and men armyd with great sight of torches than he

and fond hit opyne and they would have shitt hit bot the lokes were so blundrid that they nethir cowth ne might shut hit the king prayed hem to keep the same door as well as they might and he would do all his might to kept him to withstond the false malice of his traitors and enmys he suppoisyng to have brestyn the farrements of the chaumbur wyndos bot they were so sqware and strongli sowdid in the stonys with moltyne led that they might not be brostyne for him withowtyn more and strenger help for which cause he was ugly astonyed and in his mind kouth thynk on none other socoure bot start to the chymney and took the tongues of yren that men rightid the fire with in time of need and undir his fete he myghtily breast up a plaunch of the chaumbur flore and therwithall cuverid him ayane and entered adowne low beneth amongis the ordure of the privay that was all of hard stone and none wyndow ne isshue thereupon save a litill square hole even at the side of the bothum of the pryvay that at the making thereof old time was levid opyne to cleanse and ferme the said privay by the which the king might well escapid bot he maid to let stop hit well iii days before hard with stone because that whane he played there at the pawme the ballis that he played with often ran in at that foul hole for there was ordenyd withowt a fair playng place for the king  and so there for the king nether reschows ne remedy bot there he must abide ellas the while the traitors withowt laid at the chaumbur dors and at the privay door also with wawis with levours and with axes that at the last they brak up all and entered because the durs were not fast shut with swerdes axis glavis bills and other terribill and ferefull wepons among the great prese of the which traitors there was a fair lady sore hurt in the bak and other gentilwemen hurt and sore wondid with the which the ladis and all the women maid a sorrowful skrye and rane away for the hidos fere of tho boistous and merciles men of arms the traitors furiously passed forth ynto the chaumbures and found the qwene so dismayed and abassid of that horribill and ferfull guvernance that she cowth nether speak ne withdraw here and as sho stood there so astonyd as a cryature that had lost here kyndly reason oone of the traitors wowndid here full vilanysly and would have slain here ne had not been oone of sir robert grames sons that thus spek to him and said what woll ye dow for shame of your self to the qwene sheo is bot a womane let us go and sech the king and then not wityng well what sheo did or should do for that ferfull and terribill affray fledd in her kirtill her mantell hangyng about her the other ladies in a corner of the chaumbur cryyng and weeping all distraite made a pitous and lamentable nose with full hevy lokyng and chere  and there the traitors sought the king in all the chaumbur abowte in the withdrawyng chaumburs in the litters undir the presses the fourmes the chares and all other places bot long they besily sought the king bot they couth not find him for they nether knew ne remembered the privay the king heryng of long time no noise ne stiryng of the traitors wend and demyd that they had all begone cried to the women that they should cume with shettes and draw him up out of that uncleyne place of the privay the women at his calling came fast to the pryvay door that was not shutt and so tha opynd hit with labure and as they were abowteward to help upe the king oone of the ladis clepid elizabeth douglas fell ynto the pryvay to the king therewith oone of the said traitors called robert sic chaumbur suppoisid varaly since they couth not find in none of all the said chaumburs the king that he of nessessite had hyd him in the pryvay and therefore he said to his felawes sirs quod he whereto stond we thus idill and lose owre time as for the cause that we be cumne forehid cumith on forth with me and i shall redily tell you where the king is for the same thomas sic chaumbur had been before right familier with the king in all places and therefore knew he well all the pryvay corners of thoo chaumburs and so he went forth streght to the same pryvay where the king was and persavyd well an saw how a plaunch of the flure was brokyn up and lift hit up and with a torch lokyd ynne and saw the king there and a woman with hyme sayng to his felows sirs the spows is foundon wherefore we been cumne and all this night haf carold here therwithall oone of the said tirantes and traitors clepid sir john hall descendid down to the king with a great knyf in his hand and the king dowtyng him sore of his lif kaught him myghtily by the shuldurs and with full great violence cast him under his fete for the king was of his parsone and stature a mane right manly strong and seyyng another of that hallis brethyrne that the king had the betture of him went down ynto the pryvay also for to destroy the king and anon as he was there descendid the king kaught him manly by the nek and cast him above that other and so he defowlid hem both undir hyme that all a long month after men might see how strongly the king had holdyn hem by the throtes and gretely the king strogild with hem for to have berevyd them their knyvys by the which labur his handis were all forkute bot and the king had been in any wise armyd he might well have escapid their malice by the length of his fightyng with thoo ii false traitors for if the king might any while lengar have savyd hymslefe his servantes and much other people of the town by sum fortune should haf had sum knawclege thereof and so haf cumne to his socoure help bot ellas the while hit wol not be fortune was to him adverse as in preserwyng of his life any longer  therwithall that odyus and false traitor sir robert grame seeing the king labord so sore with thoo two false traitors which he had cast undir his fete and that he were faint and weary and that he was weponelese the more pite was descenden down also ynto the pryvey to the king with an horribill and mortal wepone in his hand and then the king cried him mercy thou cruel tirant quod grame to him thou hadest nevyr mercy of lords borne of thy blood ne of non other gentilman that came in thy dawnger therefore no mercy shall thou have here thane said the king i beseech the that for the salvacion of my soul ye woll let me have a confessore quod the said grame thou shall never have other confessore bot this same swerd and therwithall he smote him thorogh the body and therwithall the good king fell down and lamentable with a pitous voice he cried him often mercy and behight to gyf him half his kyngdam and much other good to save his lif and then the said grame seeing his king and soveran lord ynfortuned with so much deseyse angwesh and sorrow would hafe so levyd and done him no more harm the other traitors above perceyvyng that said onto the said sir robert we behote the faithfully bot if thou fle him or thou depart thou shall dye for him on owre handys sone dowtlese and then the said sir robert with the other two that descendid first down fell upon that noble prince and in full horribill and cruel wise they murdrid him ellas for sorrow that so ynmefurably cruelte and vengance should be done to that worthy prince fer hit was reportid by true persons that saw him deed that he had sixtene dedely wounds in his breast withowtyn many and other y dyverse places of his body  and hit is rehersid and remembered in the historiall and true cronicles of scotteland that in the self same place by old time passed there haf been iii kings of scotts slain a fable not one king is commemorated as having been slain at perth   and whene this abominable and horrible homycidie and false treason of this cruel murdur was thus done the said traitors fought the qwene and in their furous crueltye would hafe slain her in the same wise bot god of his grace and goddnes preservyd and keep here out of their handis and upon this the noise arose and sprang out both ynto the court and ynto the town of that horribill doing and faite of that at the faid traitors had done and anon forthwith all the kings servantes that were logid in his said court and all the other people of the same town with oone will and oone assent as the kings true men and his liege subjectes comone with force and arms with many a torch and other lightis and approached the kings court and whene the traitors hard the noise and omore of those comones they with all hat possibill fled bot yet in their withdrawyng or thaye were fully passed the diches of the kings place a worthy knight that was called sir davy dunbarre he allone ascried and pursued hem and with his own hand sloghe oone of hem and another he sore woundid and as he faught with them in thaire fleyng they kut of three of his fyngurs of his oone hand and sore woundid him upon his head and they slogh an other young mane of the kyngys chaumbur that was good grome  and in this wise sir robert grame with all the other traitors escapid and droghe hem to the ontreth of the wild scotts and they said among hemselfe ellas why sloghe we not the qwene also for and we had so done we should have been out of much disease and trobill which we been now lich to have with here we have cause gretely to dread here lest sheo woll pursue and labor for to do vengance upon hus and soth hit was the qwene did such diligence and pursuet ayanst the said felonouce traitors that withyne a month next aftir that so abhomynable murdure they were all takyn and byhedid at edynburghe the qwene did hirselfe great worship for here true acquitable hit has not often been seen so suddenly vengaunce takyn upon so horribill and a cruel ded  for furst was takyn sir robert stuard and cristofere chaumbur and lad ynto strong prisone withyne the castle of edynburgh and after by the sentance of the law they were drawn and hangid and quarterd furst there was ordenyd a cart whereupon was set a crose of great heght that was maid of tree to the which cross the said robert stuward was fast boundon stondyng upright all nakid boundon to the bak of the same nothing upon hem bot their pryvay clothes the hongman there stondyng above with hem havyng in his handis a pair sharp tangis with the which he twitched and all to tare their skin and flessh that the blood in full great quantite ran down from hem that pite was to see for they suffird patiently all the cruel pains of turmentrye that they put hem to and said unto the said hongman dowe whatever ye will for we been gilti and haf well deservyd hit this payneful death and inwyse and much more and thus were they ladd pynched and payned by all the streets and through out edynbugh at the last they lad on hegh before the counecellhows clepid the gildhall there abydyng an our and more that all the people pyght behold and wondir on hem after that they were drawin with horses all the town till they came till a place where was set ane heghe ynstrument of tymbire upon which balastriars and bowyers usyn to hong their harnysshid bows to dry ayanst the sun where the said hongman took a rope and knyt hit fast about their birstes undre thaire harmeholes and drew hem to the heghest place of that ynstrument and they there so hongyng confessid opunly to all the world all the conspiration of the kings death from point to point and from these they were carried ynto the middis of the marketh place there where was ordyned an hie skaffald upon which with an old rusty axe the said hongman smot of their hedes and there quartard hem and in this wise was exsecucion done upon hem both and their heddes set upe of the gates of sent johannes town  soon after this was takyn the earl of athetelles by the earl of angwis and laid ynto the castle of edenburghe to prisone this same earl of athetelles was endited arreyned and dampened bot because of that this was nighe the feste of pascue the cross was takyn adowne and he lad to the polour in the town and there was he fast boundon and a corone of papir put upon his head the which was all abowte depaynetid with jubettes and for the more dispite and shame to him was writyne with these words traitor traitor traitor the busshope of urbinate legate of owre holy fadir the pope then being in scotteland upon his ambassite hard their confessions and then evyn forthwith the said earl of athetelles was heded bot he went alwas to have grace and pardon unto the time that the hangman had him upon the skaffald to be there and then hedid for he confessid and said that he was not in no wise consentyng ne assentyng to the kings death but that he knew thereof long and kept hit counesell because that sir robert stuward that was oone of the grettest traitors was his sons son and therefore he told hit not to the king bot yet nevyre the less when this sir robert wist thereof and told hit to the earl of athetelles of the kings death he blamyd hyme sore and defendid him that in no wise should he be consentyng to none such murdure of his soveran lord weynyng veraly that nether he ne none of all the other the which been rehersid before would never have done that murdure in effect and so the said earl told and confessid at his lyvys end and his head coroned with a corone of yryne stondyng upon a spear shaft in the myddis of edenburghe  after this sir robert grame with many other traitors of his coveene being in captyvyte were ladde to the town of strivellen and there were they tourmented and put to the death the said sir robert grame stondyng there at the where he was tofore enditid of treison before the justice and the law there upon his araynment said plainly that they had no law to do him to death for he said he had not offendit bot slain the king his dedely enmye for by his letturs sealed with his seal of arms long time before he had defied the king and renouncid his legeaunce for causes reasonables as he said and if they would do him law after the statuytes of arms they should delyver him and let him go qwite because the king would have destruyd him if he had might and thus in that he said he did no wrong nor sin bot ooly that he sloughe gods criature his enemy all these reasons nether couth ne might suffice for his excuse the which he perceyvyd well in all wise of their wirchynges this same sir robert grame with manly heart and well avisid as a mane well ynstructe in law and letture said these words standing at the bare afor the juges all the pople there assembled for that cause the self time o ye all so sinful wreched and mercilese scottisshe folk without prudens and full replet of unavisid folly i know well that i shall now dye and ma not escape your venomous judicial hands for by will and not be right ne law ye have dampened my body to the death the which god suffrethe me at this time to resave of you for no desairt of this accusacion that ye condemn me ynne now bot for other offenses and trespass that i in the vain times of my youth have displeasid hyme ynne yet dout y not that ye shall se the day and the time that ye shall pray for my soul for the great good that i have done to you and to all this reaume of scottland that i have thus slain and delyveryd you of so cruel a tirant the grettest enemy the scotts or scottland might have considering his unstaunchable covetise in his youth against all nature his tirannye ynmesurable without pite or mercy to sibbe or to freme to hie or to law to pour or to rich  all these things the said sir robert grame with many other ynconvenyences he rehersid there ayanst the king the which rehersale wole be ynne scotteland many a year here after for he was a mane of great heart and manhood and full discrete and a great legister of law positive and canone and civlle both yet for all that at the last he was dampened there by the juges of the death this was the sentance of the jugesment there should be brought a cart in the mydward of the which there should be set fast a tree uperight longer then a mane and with that same knyf that he sloughe the king withal was his hand all upon heghe nalid fast to that tree and so was he had thorough out the town that edoone the hangmane was commandid with that same knyfe to kut of that hand from the arm after that he was nalid nakynd as he was first borne of his modir drawn thurghe the town withowte coerture of any part of his body as nature brought him forth from his modirs womb and in the same wise ladd thorgh all the streets of that town and the tourmentours on every side him with hookid ynstrumentes of yryne fuyre hot all red glowyng they pynchid and twynched his theghis his legs his arms his sides his bake his shuldurs his neke his womb and over all his body that was full seek and pitous to look upon where they suppoisid most to anoye hyme and greve that hit was to any mans kind to sorofull and pitous sight and to abhomynable to se with the ymportible pain of turment he cried then pitously with dedely voice for the panys and pasions that he so suffird sayng to them that they did that durise to him against the law this that ye done to me is oonly by rigor of ynmesurable tyranny all the world may clepe you scotts tirantes for manekynd may not with the lif suffur ne yndure the paynefull and tiranuous tourmentrye that ye put me unto i doubt me full sore that and ye continue thus your tourmentes upon my wretched person that for the pain ye will constrayne me to renye my creature and if i so do i appell you afor god the hie and chyf juge of all manekynde after there deserts at the unyversal dome that ye been the varay cause of the loss of my saul  thurghe the which speech some of the lords so abidyng upon the execucion of this said sir robert grame moevid of pite let tak him down and as he was all nakyd lappid in a rough scottisshe mantell and caft him ayane with a great violence ynto sore and full hard prisone  in the mean time many of the other traitors were boweld all qwik and afterward were quarterd as well they that receyvid the said sir robert as they that were with him whane the exsecution of the said traison was done and many of tha that were with him at the day of the king confessid whane they were spokyne to go with the said sir robert grame hit was not told unto him of no purpos that was said unto hem that they should go with him to ravisshe a fair lady out of the kings house whame the said sir robert stuward should have weddid the next day following  and after this they ladd aftsounes the said sir robert grame to the place where he should dye and sodeynely they droughe away the mantall to the which all his wounds were hardyned and clave fast with his blood dried thereto forwith the said pain he feel down in a swonyng and so lay along on the ground more than a quarter of an owre and then he revivid and qwykynd ayane seeing that ryvyng away so sodeinly adn rudely of that mantell was to him gretter pain than any other that he had suffird before and after this for the more grefe and sorrow to hyme they boweld his son all quyke and quarterd him afor his eene and drew out his heart of his body the which heart lepe thrice more than a foot of heghte after hit was drawn owte of his body and in semblable wise the hangmane droughe owte all his bowelles and quarterd him and many other moo after hyme  bot the last of all thomas halle was hedid for as hit was knawen and veraly wist by proof he was the pryncipall and the fynell cause of the kings death the said chaumbur had the strengyst heart of all the other for he never repentid him of the kings death the head of him and the right hand stand fast nalid at edenburghe undir the earls head of athetelles  and thus endyn these sorofull and pitous chronicles and all mean say that the unsacionable covetise was the ground and cause of the kings death therefore princes should take heed and draw it to their memory of maistre johanes de moigne counsel thus said in french langage il nest pas sires de son pays quy de son people nest amez the which is thusmuche

iv  no xxiii present state of the scottish records art i cursory view of the state of the records of scotland transmitted to john pinkerton esquire   july      this paper by a william anderson writer or attorney in edinburgh imperfect as it is may give the reader some idea of the subject of the curious and important chamberlains rolls mr a observes independent of their being in much disorder they are covered with dust i might almost say buried in it and after the expensive erection of that splendid edifice the new register office the following remark may surprise it is a great pity that such a valuable collection of records should in a manner be rendered entirely useless to the public by the expense attending the inspection of them by the state in which they are kept and by the want of a small fund to recompense the person who would undertake to examine them with attention the expense indeed is enormous to judge from this attorneys bill which exceeded twelve pounds not scottish money but sterling for a trifling labor which in england would have been held richly recompensed by three or four guineas as the importance of national records is extreme there ought to be in every country a literary inspector of the records independent of the juridical arrangement to attend to the preservation of the more ancient and publish curious extracts    in obedience to mr pinkertons letter of the   th ulto i have consumed the principal part of several days in going over what notes i am possessed of in making enquiries at the different offices and in examining the state of our various records and now transmit to him in the following pages the information which i have obtained  records of parliament the oldest volumes of the parliamentary record are in a state so frail from the waste of time and want of proper care that unless the utmost attention is paid in turning over the folios parts of them are apt to be lost by the operation about five years ago i examined every leaf of the three or four first volumes but since that time the keepers by the desire of the lord clerk register prevent them from being handled and mr william robertson is at present employed in making an accurate copy of them that they may not be entirely lost  the first three books of the parliamentary record are bound up in one volume the two first of these books which contain a part of the regiam majestatem and acts of robert iii james i ii iii are not original but have been copied in      the genuine records of the scots parliament commence with the  d book of this volume in the reign of james iii anno      and go down to the year      from this period to the dissolution of the scots parliament by the union of the kingdoms the record appears to be pretty entire there are in all thirty six books bound up in twenty six volumes all written on good paper and well bound of these however the fourteenth book which must have contained some proceedings of parliament in the minority of james vi is missing  in the general register house there are also preserved several bundles of loose parliamentary records for instance commissions to parliament in last century and debates in disputed elections etc besides the volumes abovementioned there are some decreets of forfeiture in parliament in annis      and    0     there are also several records of the committee of estates during the commonwealth and protectorate but for want of binding their condition is so bad that they cannot be properly looked into  records of secret council of this record there are a considerable number of volumes several of which are deposited in the general register house in the custody of messrs robertsons  others of them are kept in the justiciary office by mr norris the oldest as mr pinkerton observes commences  th june      and ends  d august      many of them however are lost  great seal record the oldest record of charters etc passing the great seal which is now known to exist is a roll of robert i about the      a scoticism for the year       there are as i am informed twelve of these rolls some of which have only about twenty others one hundred and twenty charters they are all written on parchment and the charters they contain are granted by robert i david ii robert ii and iii  the first book of this record is bound in red turkey and contains about three hundred and twenty charters some of them granted by david ii from the   d to the   st year of his reign and others granted by robert ii  the second volume contains charters granted by king james i but the record of very sew of his charters has been preserved it also appears that the greatest part of the charters by james ii and iii have been lost those granted by james iv on the contrary seem to be complete for there are registered charters which have been granted in every year of his long reign which is far from being the case with those of his predecessors a good many also of those granted by james v have perished queen marys seem to be tolerably entire and from the reign of james vi downwards it is thought the whole are extant  privy seal record the privy seal record in the general register house consists of about     volumes it begins in the year      and ends about the middle of last century  this record is a great repertorium of curiosity and from this source the accurate narrator of facts in history might reap superior advantages as almost every transaction within the kingdom worthy of the smallest notice was in those times the object of a royal letter every improvement in science every invention tending to comfort or utility was made the subject of a patent under the privy seal so that by the investigation of this record the introduction of many of the arts into this kingdom such as printing etc might be clearly ascertained  records of session prior to the institution of the college of justice           there were itinerant courts which administered justice in different parts of the kingdom the oldest record of their decreets begins in octr       these are continued down pretty regularly till the court was established in its present form only a few of the acts and decreets of the court of session have been lost but it is supposed they will never merit the investigation of an historian being exceedingly voluminous and relating to nothing but the adjustment of private right  records of justiciary these volumes present much entertainment to the reader who does not seriously reflect on the singular oppression of the criminals particularly the poor witches the first volume commences    november      but the reasons and arguments and narration of facts very seldom appear in the record till toward the conclusion of that century one or two volumes toward the beginning are wanting  exchequer records there are deposited in the register office under the custody of the clerks in exchequer the rolls of the chamberlains accounts from      downwards to the amount of about   0 in a pretty regular series the treasurers and comptrollers accounts probably commence about the year      when james i instituted the former office  there are not any other very old record in their possession but the messrs robertsons have the charge of many documents peculiar to exchequer such as the record of signatures beginning in      proceedings in the court of exchequer anno      rentals of the royal property as far back as      accounts of customs    0 accounts of the army and household expense      etc  chancery besides retours of services preserved in chancery there are therein kept what are called the respondee books which specify the sums due to the crown or prince at the entry of an heir etc etc and collected by the sheriffs of the different counties these commence anno      the retours commence about the year      but there is a great chasm from      to   00 and the record is very irregular as many retours of dates both prior and posterior to      have been and still are recorded in these volumes  by decree of the court of session the record of charters passing the great seal was several years ago removed from this office and placed under the charge of the messrs robertsons  admiralty there exist records of this court from      downwards in good condition which are kept for the greater security in the general register house one or two volumes prior to that date have perished the court as it at present stands was established anno       commissary the records of this court are preserved from the period of its institution at least it was established in its present form by queen marys gift of the  th feby      and the first minute book of the record commences   may       it is imagined that the records of the more ancient consistorial courts were either carried off or destroyed at the reformation  besides these there are records of sasines bonds hornings adjudications baptisms records of the general assembly etc but which it is supposed cannot be very beneficial to the historian  perhaps i might add that a very considerable degree of accurate information might be obtained by perusing the different chartularies of ancient monasteries which are to be found in the lawyers library and elsewhere such as that of aberdeen dryburgh arbroath etc etc but the expense necessarily attending investigations of that nature will i am afraid for ever prevent their being performed  art ii extract from the case of sir james johnstone of westerhall baronet claiming the titles honors and dignities of marquis of annandale etc presented to the house of lords      respecting the present state of the public records of scotland  before stating the evidence concerning the relation of matthew the first of the claimants line to the family of annandale it is proper to observe that although the records of scotland in so far as concerns charters sasines and retours are now very regularly kept yet it was not till the year      that an act passed appointing a public register to be kept for all sasines reversions etc and declaring the same to be ineffectual against third parties unless recorded therein within  0 days  and with respect to the register of retours it was not the practice in more ancient times to lodge them in chancery they remained in the hands of the private parties and the first retour appearing in the records of chancery is dated  st february      but there were many retours expede after that period which do not appear in these records  the records of the great seal in which charters were inserted were more regularly kept but it frequently happened that the parties carried away their charters before they were entered in the record and though they sometimes brought them back afterward to be recorded yet very often they did not and the time of bringing them back was various so that charters are not always recorded in the books according to their dates but those of a prior date are frequently inserted after those of a posterior date  it is material in the present case to observe that the book which has been numbered iv of the records of charters ends with a charter dated the   th june      and the book now numbered v begins with a charter dated the  th august      so that a part of the records has been lost as there is an interval of six years in which no book now exists in which charters are found recorded a few are found in book v which though dated during that interval are inserted among posterior charters but only two of these are dated preceding january      one dated   th october      and another dated  th december that year  it was only by an act   th july      that a regulation was made appointing all charters etc which pass the great and privy seal to be registered in the registers of these seals before the seals be appended to them and such registration to be marked thereon by the writers to the different seals  the privy seal records are not preserved of an older date than       the signet properly speaking has no record it is the place where the original signatures or warrants of charters ought to be deposited but none of these are to be found prior to   0  and these signatures often remained in the private custody of the keeper of the signet and passing to his representatives were generally lost  the record of sasines begins in      in terms of the act of parliament before referred to  the records of parliament are very imperfect and many books are wanting particularly about the period of       the records of the privy council are not preserved further back than      and subsequent to that year many intermediate books are wanting  the record of signatures in exchequer begin in      and although some of an older date are preserved yet they are few in number  this imperfect state of the records is partly to be ascribed to negligence but it is also certain that a

registers which had been carried to england during the usurpation were sent back to scotland by sea after the restoration no less than eighty five hogsheads which in a storm were taken out of the eagle frigate and put into another vessel were all of them lost by the wreck of that vessel  with respect to ancient deeds in the hands of private individuals besides the loss of many in the calamities of war and domestic commotions and by various other causes which prevent the preservation of private papers it became less and object in scotland to preserve old deeds and writings after the act of parliament had passed in the year      by which it was declared that  0 years undisturbed possession upon a charter and sasine should be held as a complete right to lands unless in certain
