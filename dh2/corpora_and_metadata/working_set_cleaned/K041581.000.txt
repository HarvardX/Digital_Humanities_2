the bible and sun in st pauls churchyard mdcclii  to the right honorable the earl of middlesex my lord the critics will undoubtedly expect when they see your name prefixed to this volume that i should address your lordship as the judge of science and the hereditary patron of learned men but i shall take the liberty of disappointing them having as i presume a stronger and more natural claim to your protection from a lucky accident than from any real excellence i can pretend to either as a writer or a scholar  this lucky accident my lord is the honor i had almost said merit of being born within a few miles of your lordship and though i have too much diffidence to ask your patronage as a poet i have assurance enough to demand it as a man of kent  i shall not imitate in this dedication if such an homely epistle may aspire to so polite a name the conduct of most modern authors who are always particularly fulsome at the very time they with the utmost solemnity protest against flattery  what i sincerely believe of you i have said already and you will find it in the introductory ode on goodnature which i beg leave in an especial manner not only to inscribe but to apply to the earl of middlesex  i am my lord with the utmost respect your lordships most obedient and most obliged humble servant christopher smart  list of subscribers names a sir john abdy bart sir jacob ashley bart

look divine and temper even celestial sweetness exquisite of mien of every virtue every praise the queen ii soft gracefulness and blooming youth where grafted on the stem of truth that friendship reigns no interest can divide and great humility looks down on pride iii oh curse on slanders viprous tongue that daily dares thy merit wrong idiots usurp thy title and thy frame without or virtue talent taste or name iv is apathy is heart of steel nor ear to hear nor sense to feel life idly inoffensive such a grace that it should steal thy name and take thy place v no  thou art active  spirit all  swifter than lightning at the call of injured innocence or grieved desert and large with liberalitys thy heart vi thy appetitesin easy tides as reasons luminary guides soft flow  no wind can work them to a storm correctly quick dispassionately warm vii yet if a transport thou can feel it is only for thy neighbors weal great generous acts thy ductile passions move and smilingly thou weepst with joy and love viii mild is thy mind to cover shame averse to envy slow to blame bursting to praise yet still sincere and free from flattrys fawning tongue and bending knee ix extensive as from west to east thy love descends from man to beast naught is excluded little or infirm thou can with greatness stoop to save a worm x come goddess come with all thy charms for oh i love thee to my arms  all all my actions guide my fancy feed so shall existence then be life indeed against ill nature i offspring of folly and of pride to all that is odious all that is  allied nursed up by vice by pravity missed by pedant affectation taught and bred away thou hideous hellborn spright go with thy looks of dark design sullen sour and saturnine fly to some gloomy shade nor blot the goodly light thy planet was remote when i was born twas mercury that ruled my natal morn what time the sun exerts his genial ray and ripens for enjoyment every growing day when to exist is but to love and sing and sprightly aries smiles upon the spring ii there in yon lonesome heath which flora or sylvanus never knew where never vegetable drank the dew or beast or fowl attempts to breathe where natures pencil has no colors laid but all is blank and universal shade contrast to figure motion life and light there may thou vent thy spite for ever cursing and for ever cursed of all the infernal crew the worst the worst in genius measure and degree for envy hatred malice are but parts of thee iii or would thou change the scene and quit thy den behold the heavndeserted fen where spleen by vapors dense begot and bred hardness of heart and heaviness of head have raised their darksome walls and placed their thorny bed there may thou all thy bitterness unload there may thou croak in concert with the toad with thee the hollow howling winds shall join nor shall the bittern her base throat deny the querulous frogs shall mix their dirge with thine the earpiercing hern and plover screaming high while million humming gnats fit oestrum shall supply iv away  away  behold an hideous band an herd of all thy minions are at hand suspicion first with jealous caution stalks and ever looks around her as she walks with bibulous ear imperfect sounds to catch and prompt to listen at her neighbors latch next scandals meagre shade foe to the virgins and the poets fame a withered timedeflowred old maid that never enjoyed loves ever sacred flame hypocrisy succeeds with saintlike look and elevates her hands and plods upon her book next comes illiberal scrambling avarice then vanity and affectation nice  see she salutes her shadow with a bow as in short gallic trips she minces by starting antipathy is in her eye and squeamishly she knits her scornful brow to thee ill nature all the numerous group with lowly reverence stoop  they wait thy call and mourn thy long delay away  thou art infectious  haste away a morning piece or an hymn for the haymakers ode i quinetiam gallum noctem explaudentibus alis auroram clara consuetum voce vocare lucret brisk chaunticleer his mattins had begun and broke the silence of the night and thrice he called aloud the tardy sun and thrice he hailed the dawns ambiguous light back to their graves the fearbegotten phantoms run strong labor got up with his pipe in his mouth and stoutly strode over the dale he lent new perfumes to breath of the south on his back hung his wallet and flail behind him came health from her cottage of thatch where never physician had lifted the latch first of the village colin was awake and thus he sung reclining on his rake now the rural graces three dance beneath yon maple tree first the vestal virtue known by her adamantine zone next to her in rosy pride sweet society the bride last honesty full seemly dressed in her cleanly homespun vest the abbey bells in wakning rounds the warning peal have given and pious gratitude resounds her morning hymn to heaven all nature wakes  the birds unlock their throats and mock the shepherds rustic notes all alive over the lawn full glad of the dawn the little lambkins play sylvia and sol arise  and all is day  come my mates let us work and all hands to the fork while the sun shines our haycocks to make so fine is the day and so fragrant the hay that the meadows as blithe as the wake   our voices let us raise in phoebuss praise inspired by so glorious a theme our musical words shall be joined by the birds and well dance to the tune of the stream a noonpiece or the mowers at dinner ode ii jam pastor umbras cum grege languido rivumque fessus quaerit and horridi dumeta silvani caretque ripa vagis taciturna ventis hor the sun is now too radiant to behold and vehement he sheds his liquid rays of gold no cloud appears through all the wide expanse and short but yet distinct and clear to the wanton whistling air the mimic shadows dance fat mirth and gallantry the gay and romping ecstasy gin play now myriads of young cupids rise and open all their joybright eyes filling with infant prate the grove and lisp in sweetlyfaultring love in the middle of the ring mad with may and wild of wing fireeyd wantonness shall sing by the rivulet on the rushes beneath a canopy of bushes where the everfaithful tray guards the dumplings and the whey colin clout and yorkshire will from the leathern bottle swill their scythes upon the adverse bank glitter amongst the entangled trees where the hazles form a rank and courtsy to the courting breeze ah harriot sovereign mistress of my heart could i thee to these meads decoy new grace to each fair object thou would impart and heighten every scene to perfect joy on a bank of fragrant thyme beneath you stately shadowy pine well with the welldisguised hook cheat the tenants of the brook or where coy daphnes thickest shade drives amorous phoebus from the glade there read sydneys highwrought stories of ladies charms and heroes glories thence fired the sweet narration act and kiss the fiction into fact or satiate with natures random scenes let us to the gardens regulated greens where taste and elegance command art to lend her daedal hand where floras flock by nature wild to discipline are reconciled and laws and order cultivate quite civilized into a state from the sun and from the shower haste we to you boxen bower secluded from the teizing pry of argus curiosity there while phoebus golden mean the gay meridian is seen ere decays the lamp of light and lengthening shades stretch out to night  seize seize the hint  each hour improve this is morality in love lend lend thine hand  o let me view thy parting breasts sweet avenue then  then thy lips the coral cell where all the ambrosial kisses dwell thus well each sultry noon employ in daydreams of exstatic joy a nightpiece or modern philosophy ode iii dicetur merita nox quoque noenia hor twas when bright cynthia with her silver car soft stealing from endymions bed had called forth every glittering star and up the ascent of heaven her brilliant host had led night with all her negro train took possession of the plain in an hearse she rode reclined drawn by screechowls slow and blind close to her with printless feet crept stillness in a winding sheet next to her deaf silence was seen treading on tip toes over the green softly lightly gently she trips still holding her fingers sealed to her lips you could not see a sight you could not hear a sound but what confessed the night and horror deepend round beneath a myrtles melancholy shade sophron the wise was laid and to the answring wood these sounds conveyed while others toil within the town and to fortune smile or frown fond of trifles fond of toys and married to that woman noise sacred wisdom be my care and fairest virtue wisdoms heir his speculations thus the sage begun when lo the neighboring bell in solemn sound struck one  he starts  and recollects  he was engaged to nell then up he sprang nimble and light and rappd at fair elenors door he laid aside virtue that night and next morn pord in plato for more on the sudden death of a clergyman ode iv if like the orphean lyre my song could charm and light to life the ashes in the urn fate of his iron dart i would disarm sudden as thy decease should thou return recalled with mandates of despotic sounds and arbitrary grief that will not hear of bounds but ah such wishes artless muse forbear it is impotence of frantic love the enthusiastic flight of wild despair to hope the thracians magic power to prove alas thy slender vein nor mighty is to move nor forgetive to feign impatient of a rein thou can not in due bounds the struggling measures keep  but thou alas can weep  thou can  and over the melancholy bier can lend the sad solemnity a tear hail to that wretched corse untenanted and cold and hail the peaceful shade loosed from its irksome hold now let me say you are free for sure thou paidst an heavy tax for life while combating for thee nature and mortality maintained a daily strife high on a slender thread thy vital lamp was placed upon the mountains bleakest brow to give a nobler light superior was it raised but more exposed by eminence it blazed for not a whistling wind that blew nor the dropdescending dew nor a bat that idly flew but half extinguished its fair flame  but now see  hear the storms tempestuous sweep  precipitate it falls  it falls  falls lifeless in the deep cease cease ye weeping youth sinceritys soft sighs and all the tears of truth and you his kindred throng forbear marble memorials to prepare and sculptured in your breasts his busto wear twas thus when israels legislator died no fragile mortal honors were supplied but even a grave denied better than what the pencils daub can give better than all that phidias ever wrought is this  that what he taught shall live and what he lived for ever shall be taught on the fifth of december being the birthday of a beautiful young lady ode v i hail eldest of the monthly train sire of the winter drear december in whose iron reign expires the checkered year hush all the blustering blasts that blow and proudly plumed in silver snow smile gladly on this blessed of days the liveryd clouds shall on thee wait and phoebus shine in all his state with more than summer rays ii though jocund june may justly boast long days and happy hours though august be pomonas host and may be crowned with flowers tell june his fire and crimson dies by harriots blush and harriots eyes eclipsed and vanquished fade away tell august thou can let him see a richer riper fruit than he a sweeter flower than may the pretty chambermaid in imitation of ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori etc of horace ode vi i colin oh cease thy friend to blame who entertains a servile flame chide not  believe me it is no more than great achilles did before who nobler prouder far than he is adored his chambermaid briseis ii the thundering ajax venus lays in loves inextricable maze his slave temessa makes him yield now mistress of the

justly bear a criticks noble name be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dullness meet nature to all things fixed the limits fit and wisely curbed proud mans pretending wit as on the land while here the ocean gains in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains thus in the soul while memory prevails the solid power of understanding fails where beams of warm imagination play the memorys soft figures melt away one science only will one genius fit so vast is art so narrow

license answers to the full the intent proposed that license is a rule thus pegasus a nearer way to take may boldly deviate from the common track great wits sometimes may gloriously offend and rise to

some our own despise the ancients only or the moderns prize thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damned beside meanly they seek the blessing to confine and force

of their own but catch the speading notion of the town they reason and conclude by precedent and own stale nonsense which they never invent some judge of authors names not works and then nor praise nor blame the writings but the men of all this servile herd the worst is he who in proud dullness joins with quality a constant critic at the great mans board to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord

purposely go wrong so schismatics the plain believers quit and are but damned for having too much wit some blame at morning what they praise at night but always think the last opinion right a muse by

faith itself has different dresses worn what wonder modes in wit should take their turn often leaving what is natural and fit the current folly proves the ready wit and authors think their reputation safe which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh some valuing those of their own side or mind still make themselves the measure of mankind fondly we think we honor merit then when we but praise ourselves in other men parties in wit attend on those of state and public faction doubles private hate pride malice folly against dryden rose in various shapes of parsons critics beaus but sense

thou the first true merit to befriend his praise is lost who stays till all commend short is the date alas of modern rhymes and it is but just to let them live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchwits survived a thousand years now length of fame our second life is lost and bare threescore is all even that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has designed some bright idea of the masters mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colors soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing years their full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treacherous colors the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away unhappy wit like most mistaken things attones not for the envy which it brings in youth alone its empty praise we boast but soon the shortlived vanity is lost like some fair flower the early spring supplies that gaily blooms but even in blooming dies what is this wit which most our cares employ the owners wife that other men enjoy still most our trouble when the most admired the more we give the more is still required the fame with pains we gain but lose with ease sure some to vex but never all to please it is what the vicious fear the virtuous shun by fools it is hated and by knaves undone if wit so much from ignorance undergo ah let not learning too commence its foe of old those met rewards who could excel and such were praised who but endeavored well though triumphs were to generals only due crowns were reserved to grace the soldier too now they who reach parnassus lofty crown employ their pains to spurn some others down and while selflove each jealous writer rules contending wits become the sport of fools but still the worst with most regret commend for each ill author is as bad a friend to what base end and by what abject ways are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise ah never so dire a thirst of glory boast nor in the critic let the man be lost goodnature and goodsense must ever join to err is human to forgive divine but if in noble minds some dregs remain not yet purged off of spleen and sour disdain discharge that rage on more provoking crimes nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times no pardon vile obscenity should find though wit and art conspire to move your mind but dullness with obscenity must prove as shameful sure as impotence in love in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease sprung the rank weed and thrived with large increase when love was all an easy monarchs care seldom at a council never in a war jilts ruled the state and statesmen farces writ nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit the fair sat panting at a courtiers play and not a mask went unimprovd away the modest fan was lifted up no more and virgins smiled at what they blushed before  the following license of a foreign reign did all the dregs of bold socinus drain then unbelieving priests reformed the nation and taught more pleasant methods of salvation where heavens free subjects might their rights dispute lest god himself should seem too absolute pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare and vice admired to find a flattrer there encouraged thus wits titans braved the skies and the press groaned with licensed blasphemies  these monsters critics with your darts engage here point your thunder and exhaust your rage yet shun their fault who scandalously nice will needs mistake an author

speak though sure with seeming diffidence some positive persisting fops we know that if once wrong will needs be always so but you with pleasure own your errors past and make each day a critic on the last it is not enough your counsel still be true blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do men must be taught as if you taught em not and things unknown proposed as things forgot without

be so civil as to prove unjust fear most the anger of the wise to raise those best can bear reproof who merit praise twere well might critics still this freedom take but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threatening eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry fear most to tax an honorable fool whose right it is uncensurd to be dull such without wit are poets when they please as without learning they can take degrees leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satyrs and flattery to fulsome dedicators whom when they praise the world believes no more than when they promise to give scribbling over it is best sometimes your censure to restrain and charitably let the dull be vain your silence there is better than your spite for who can rail so long as they can write still humming on their drowsy course they keep and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep false steps but help them to renew the race as after stumbling jades will mend their pace what crowds of these impertinently bold in sounds and jingling syllables grown old still run on poets in a raging vein even to the dregs and squeezings of the brain strain out the last dull droppings of their sense and rhyme with all the rage of impotence such shameless bards we have and yet it is true there are as mad abandoned critics too the bookfull blockhead ignorantly read with loads of learned lumber in his head with his own tongue still edifies his ears and always listening to himself appears  all books he reads and all he reads assails from drydens fables down to durfys tales with him most authors steal their works or buy garth did not write his own dispensary name a new play and he is the poets friend nay showed his faults  but when would poets mend no place so sacred from such fops is barred nor is paulschurch more safe than paulschurchyard nay fly to altars there he will talk you dead for fools rush in where angels fear to tread distrustful sense with modest caution speaks it still looks home and short excursions makes but rattling nonsense in full vollies breaks and never shocked and never turned aside bursts out resistless with a thundering tide but where is the man who counsel can bestow still pleased to teach and yet not proud to know unbiasd or by favor or by spite not dully prepossessed or blindly right though learned wellbred and though wellbred sincere modestly bold and humanely severe who to a friend his faults can freely show and gladly praise the merit of a foe blessed with a taste exact and unconfined a knowledge both of books and human kind generous converse a soul exempt from pride and love to praise with reason on his side such once were critics such the happy few athens and rome in better ages knew the mighty stagyrite first left the shore spread all his sails and durst the deep explore he steered securely and discovered far led by the light of the maeonian star poets a race long unconfined and free still fond and proud of savage liberty received his laws and stood convinced twas fit who conquered nature should preside over wit horace still charms with graceful negligence and without method talks us into sense will like a friend familiarly convey the truest notions in the easiest way he who supreme in judgment as in wit might boldly censure as he boldly writ yet judged with coolness though he sung with fire his precepts teach but what his works inspire our critics take a contrary extreme they judge with fury but they write with phlegm nor suffers horace more in wrong translations by wits than critics in as wrong quotations see dionysius dionysius of halicarnassus homers thoughts refine and call new beauties forth from every line fancy and art in gay petronius please the scholars learning with the courtiers ease in grave quintilians copious work we find the justest rules and clearest method joined thus useful arms in magazines we place all ranged in order and disposed with grace nor thus alone the curious eye to please but to be found when need requires with ease thee bold longinus all the nine inspire and bless their critic with a poets fire an ardent judge who zealous in his trust with warmth gives sentence yet is always just whose own example strengthens all his laws and is himself that great sublime he draws thus long succeeding critics justly reigned license repressed and useful laws ordained learning and rome alike in empire grew and arts still followed where her eagles flew from the same foes at last both felt their doom and the same age saw learning fall and rome with tyranny then superstition joined as that the body this enslaved the mind much was believed but little understood and to be dull was construed to be good a second deluge learning thus oerrun and the monks finished what the goths begun at length erasmus that great injured name the glory of the priesthood and the shame stemnd the wild torrent of a barbarous age and drove those holy vandals off the

voice you taught to sing prescribed her heights and pruned her tender wing her guide now lost no more pretends to rise but in low numbers short excursions tries content if hence the unlearned their wants may view the learned reflect on what before they knew careless of censure nor too fond of fame still pleased to praise yet not afraid to blame averse alike to flatter or offend not free from

impatient of this orb of clay and boldly dare to meditate my way where fontinelle first saw the planets roll and all the god tumultuous shakes my soul it is he he comes and through the sunbright skies drives foaming pegasus and thus he cries cease cease dear youth too studiously employed and wing with me the unresisting void it is thine with me round other worlds to soar and visit kingdoms never known before while i succinctly show each various race the manners and the genius of the place i though my mind with lively horror fraught thinks on bellerophon and shudders at the thought mount quick the winged steed he springs he flies shoots through the yielding air and cleaves the liquid skies  first swift cyllenius circling round the sun we reach when thus my friendly guide begun mark well the genius of this fiery place the wild amusements of the brainsick race whose minds the beams of titan too intense affect with frenzy and distract the sense a monarch here gives subject princes law a mighty monarch with a crown of straw there fits a lover sad in pensive air and like the dismal image of despair with charcoal paints his chloe heavenly fair in sadlysoothing strain rude notes he sings and strikes harsh numbers from the jarring strings lo an astrologer with filth besmeared rough and neglected with a length of beard pores round his cell for undiscovered stars and decks the wall with triangles and squares lo  but the radiant car of phoebus nigh glows with red ardour and inflames the sky  oh waft me hide me in some cool retreat i faint i sicken with the fervent heat thence to that milder orb we wing our way where venus governs with an easy sway soft breathes the air fair flora paints the ground and laughing ceres deals her gifts around this blissful tempe no rough blasts molest of blustering boreas or the baleful east but gentle zephyrs over the woodlands stray court the tall trees and round the branches play aetherial gales dispensing as they flow to fan those passions which they teach to glow here the gay youth in measured steps advance while sprightly music animates the dance there the sweet melody of sound admire sigh with the song or languish to the lyre fair nymphs and amorous youths a lovely band blend in the dance lightbounding hand in hand from every grove the buxom zephyrs bring the rich ambrosia of eternal spring care dwells not here their pleasures to destroy but laughter jest and universal joy all all is love for venus reigns confessed the sole sultana of each captive breast cold cynthia here would cupids victim prove or the chaste daughter of imperial jove and catos virtue be the slave of love but now through destined fields of air we fly and leave those mansions not without a sigh thence the dire coast we reach the dreary plains where mars grim god and bloody discord reigns the host in arms embattled sternly stands the sword the dart the dagger in their hands here no fair nymphs to silver sounds advance but buskined heroes form the pyrrhic dance and brazen trumpets terrible from far with martial music fire the soul to war here the lone bride be wails her absent lord the sterile nuptials the deserted board sighs the long nights and frantic with despair beats her bare breast and rends her flowing hair in vain she sighs in vain dissolves in tears  in sleep perhaps the warrior lord appears a fleeting form that glides before her sight a momentary vision of the night mean while regardless of her anxious prayer the hardy husband sternly stalks to war our ears the clang of ringing armor rends and the immortal battle never ends hence through the boundless void we nimbly move and reach the wideextended plains of jove here the stern tyrant sways an iron rod a thousand vassals tremble at his nod how short the period of a tyrants date the poisonous phial speeds the work of fate scarce is the proud imperious tyrant dead but lo a second lords it in his stead here peace as common merchandise is sold heavens first best blessing for pernicious gold war soon succeeds the sturdy squadrons stand wide over the fields a formidable band with numerous fleets they crowd the groaning main and triumph for the victories they feign again in strict alliances unite till discord raise again the phantom of a fight again they sail again the troops prepare their falchions for the mockery of war the son inhuman seeks his fathers life the slave his masters and her lords the wife with vengeance thus their kindling bosoms fire since jove usurped the scepter of his fire thence poisons perjuries and bribes betray nor other passions do their souls obey than thirst of gold and avarice of sway at length we land vast fields of ether crossed on saturns cold uncomfortable coast here in the gloom the pampered sluggards lull the lazy hours lethargically dull in caves they live for who was ever known so wise so sedulous to build a town the same stupidity infects the whole fixed in the breast and centered in the soul these never feel the ambitious fires of jove to industry not mercury can move mars cannot spur to war nor venus woo to love here rove those souls it is said when life departs who never cultivated useful arts but stupifyd with plenty and repose dreamt out long life in one continued dose no feathered songsters with sweetwarbled strains attune to melting melody the plains no flocks widepastring bleat nor oxen low no fountains musically murmuring flow the ungenial waste no tender herbage yields no harvests wave luxuriant in the fields low lie the groves if groves this land can boast chained in the fetters of eternal frost their beauty withered and their verdure lost dull animals inhabit this abode the owl mole dormouse tortoise and the toad dull rivers deep within their channels glide and slow roll on their tributary tide nor aught the unvegetative waters feed but sleepy poppy and the slimy reed whose lazy fogs like lethes cups dispense eternal slumbers of dull indolence aghast i stood the drowsy vapors lull my soul in gloom even pegasus grew dull my guide observed and thrice he urged his speed thrice the loud lash resounded from the steed fired at the strokes he flies with slackened

loquacious slave that laughst without a cause thou shall conceive and bring forth at thy jaws he spoke  stretched in the hall the mimic lies supinely dull thick vapors dim his eyes and as his jaws a horrid chasm disclose it seemed he made a trumpet of his nose though harsh the strain and horrible to hear like german jargon grating on the ear at length was polychasmia brought to light worthy her sire a monster of a sight resembling her great grandmother old night her eyes to open often in vain she tried locked were the lids her mouth distended wide her when prometheus happened to survey rival of jove that made mankind of clay he formed without the aid of heavenly ray to three lethaean cups he learnt to mix deep sighs of virgins with three blasts from styx the bray of asses with the fat of brawn the sleeppreceding groan and hideous yawn thus polychasmia took her wondrous birth a goddess helpful to the sons of earth lo how the rustic multitude from far haste to the town and crowd the clamorous bar the pressed bench groans with many a squire and knight who weight out justice and distribute right severe they seem and formidably big with front important and huge periwig the little villains skulk aloof dismayed and panic terrors seize the pregnant maid but soon friend polychasm who always near herself had mingled with their morning beer steals to the judges brain and centers there then in the court the horrid yawn began and hum profound and solemn went from man to man silent they nod and with prodigious strain stretch out their arms then listless yawn again for all the flowers of rhetoric they can boast amidst their wranglings is to gape the most ambiguous quirks and friendly wrath they vent and give and take the leaden argument ye too fanatics never shall escape the faithful muse for who so greatly gape mounted on high with serious care perplexed the miserable preacher takes his text then into parts minute with wondrous pain divides connects and then divides again and does with grave obscurity explain while from his lips lean periods lingering creep and not one meaning interrupts their sleep the drowsy hearers stretch their weary jaws with lamentable groan and yawning gape applause the quacks of physic next provoke my ire who falsely boast hippocrates their sire goddess thy sons i ken  verbose and loud they puff their windy bubbles on the crowd with look important critical and vain each to his nose applies the gilded cane and as he nods and ponders over the case gravely collects himself into his face explains his medicines  which the rustic buys drinks the dire draught and of the doctor dies no pills no potions can to life restore abracadabra necromantic power can charm and conjure up from death no more but more than aught that is mavelous and rare the studious soph makes polychasm his care explores what secret spring what hidden cause distends with hideous chasm the unwilling jaws what latent ducts the dewy moisture pour with sound tremendous like a thundershowr how subtle matter exquisitely thin pervades the curious network of the skin affects the accordant nerve  all eyes are drowned in drowsy vapors and the yawn goes round when phoebus thus his flying fingers flings across the chords and sweeps the trembling strings if ever a lyre at unison there be it swells with emulating harmony like memnons harp in ancient times renowned breathing untouched sweetmodulated sound but oh ungrateful to thy own true bard oh polychasm is this my just reward thy drowsy dews upon my head distill just at the entrance of the aonian hill listless i gape unactive and supine and at vast distance view the sacred nine wistful i view  the streams increase my thirst in vain  like tantalus with plenty cursed no draughts nectareous to my portion fall these godlike pope exhausts and greatly claims them all thus the lean sizar views with gaze aghast the hungry tutor at his noons repast in vain he grinds his teeth  his grudging eye and visage sharp keen appetite imply often he attempts officious to convey the lessening relics of the meal away  in vain  no morsel escapes the greedy jaw all all is gorged in magisterial maw till at the last observant of his word the lamentable waiter clears the board and inlymurmuring miserably groans to see the empty dish and hear the sounding bones a latin version of miltons lallegro  hom lallegro hence loathed melancholy of cerberus and blackest midnight born in stygian cave forlorn among horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy find out some uncouth cell where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings and the nightraven sings there under ebon shades and lowbrowd rocks as ragged as thy locks in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell but come thou goddess fair and free in heaven yclepd euphrosyne and by men hearteasing mirth whom lovely venus at a birth with two sister graces more to ivycrowned bacchus bore or whether as some sages sing the frolic wind that breathes the spring zephyr with aurora playing as he met her once a maying there on beds of violets blue and fresh blown roses washed in dew filled her with thee a daughter fair so buxom blithe and debonair haste thee nymph and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity quips and cranks and wanton wiles nods and becks and wreathed smiles such as hang on hebes cheek and love to live in dimple sleek sport that wrinkled care derides and laughter holding both his sides come and trip it as you go on the light fantastic toe and in thy right hand lead with thee the mountain nymph sweet liberty and if i give thee honor due mirth admit me of thy crew to live with her and live with thee in unreproved pleasures free to hear the lark begin his flight and singing startle the dull night from his watchtowr in the skies till the dappled dawn does rise then to come in spite of sorrow and at my window bid good morrow through the sweetbriar or the vine or the twisted eglantine while the cock with lively din scatters the rear of darkness thin and to the stack or the barndoor stoutly struts his dames before often listening how the hounds and horn chearly rouse the slumbering morn from the side of some hoar hill through the high wood echoing shrill sometimes walking not unseen by hedgerow elms on hillocks green right against the eastern gate where the great sun begins his state robbed in flames and amber light the clouds in thousand liveries dight while the plowman near at hand whistles over the furrowed land and the milkmaid sings blithe and the mower whets his seythe and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale strait mine eye has caught new pleasures whilst the landscape round it measures russet lawns and fallows gray where the nibbling flocks do stray mountains on whose barren breast the laboring clouds do often rest meadows trim with daizies pide shallow brooks and rivers wide towers and battlements it sees bosomed high in tufted trees where perhaps some beauty lies the cynosure of neighboring eyes hard by a cottage chimney smokes from betwixt two aged oaks where corydon and thyrsis met are at their favory dinner set of herbs and other country messes which the neathanded phillis dresses and then in haste her bower she leaves with thestylis to bind the sheaves or if the earlier season lead to the tanned haycock in the mead sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite when the merry bells ring round and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth and many a maid dancing in the checkered shade and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holy day till the livelong daylight fail then to the spicy nutbrown ale with stories told of many a feat how fairy mab the junkets eat she was pinched and pulled she said and by the friars lanthorn led tells how the drudging goblin sweat to earn his creambowl duly set when in one night ere glimpse of morn his shadowy flail has threshd the corn that ten daylabourers could not end then lies him down the lubbar fiend and stretched out all the chimnys length basks at the fire his hairy strength and cropfull out of doors he flings ere the first cock his mattin sings thus done the tales to bed they creep by whispering winds soon lulled asleep towred cities please us then and the busy humm of men where throngs of knights and barons bold in weeds of peace high triumph hold with store of ladies whose bright eyes rain influence and judge the prize of wit or arms while both contend to win her grace whom all commend there let hymen often appear in saffron robe with taper clear and pomp and feast and revelry with mask and antique pageantry such sights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream then to the welltrod stage anon if johnsons learned sock be on or sweetest shakespeare fancys child warble his native woodnotes wild and ever against eating cares lap me in soft lydian airs married to immortal verse such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out with wanton heed and giddy cunning the melting voice through mazes running untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony that orpheus self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heaped elysian flowers and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto to have quite set free his halfregaind

gilded jonquill but such languid odours how could i approve just warm from the lips of the lad that i love iii she brought me his faith and his truth to display the undying myrtle and evergreen bay but why these to me who have his constancy known and billy has laurels enough of his own iv the next was a gift that i could not contemn for she brought me two roses that grew on a stem of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confessed so i kissed em and pressed em quite close to my breast v she brought me a sunflowr  this fair ones your due for it once was a maiden and lovesick like you oh give it me quick to my shepherd i will run as true to his flame as this flower to the sun the lass with the golden locks ballad ii i no more of my harriot of polly no more nor all the bright beauties that charmed me before my heart for a slave to gay venus i have sold and bartered my freedom for ringlets of gold i will throw down my pipe and neglect all my flocks and will sing to my lass with the golden locks ii though over her white forehead the gilt tresses flow like the rays of the sun on a hillock of snow such painters of old drew the queen of the fair it is the taste of the ancients it is classical hair and though witlings may scoff and though raillery mocks yet i will sing to my lass with the golden locks iii to live and to love to converse and be free is loving my charmer and living with thee away go the hours in kisses and rhyme spite of all the grave lectures of old father time a fig for his dials his watches and clocks he is best spent with the lass of the golden locks iv than the swan in the brook she is more dear to my sight her mien is more stately her breast is more white her sweet lips are rubies all rubies above which are fit for the language or labor of love at the park in the mall at the play in the box my lass bears the bell with her golden locks v her beautiful eyes as they roll or they flow shall be glad for my joy or shall weep for my woe she shall ease my fond heart and shall sooth my soft pain while thousands of rivals are sighing in vain let them rail at the fruit they cannot reach like the fox while i have the lass with the golden locks the decision

language all her looks translate and in her gestures read my fate iii and if in them you chance to find ought that is gentle ought that is kind adieu mean hopes of being great and all the littleness

blooming damsel whose defense is adamantine innocence requires no guardian to attend her steps for modestys her friend though her fair arms are weak to wield the glittering spear and massy shield yet safe from force and fraud combined she is an amazon in mind ii with this artillery she goes not only amongst the harmless beaux but even unhurt and undismayed views the long sword and fierce cockade though all a siren as she talks and all a goddess as she walks yet decency each action guides and wisdom over her tongue presides iii place her in russias showery plains where a perpetual winter reigns the elements may rave and range yet her fixed mind will never change place her ambition in thy towers amongst the more dangerous golden showers even there she would spurn the venal tribe and fold her arms against the bribe iv leave her defenseless and alone a prisoner in the torrid zone the sunshine there might vainly vie with the bright luster of her eye but phoebus self with all his fire could never one unchaste thought inspire but virtues path she would still pursue and still my fair would copy you the distressed damsel ballad vii i of all my experience how vast the amount since

ever blooms ii ye gothic towers by vapors dense obscured into severer state in pastoral magnificence at once so simple and so great iii why all your jealous shades on me ye hoary elders do ye spread fair innocence should still be free naught should be chained but what we dread iv say must these tears for ever flow can i from patience learn content while solitude still nurses woe and leaves me leisure to lament v my guardian see  who wards off peace whose cruelty is his employ who bids the tongue of transport cease and stops each avenue to joy vi freedom of air alone is given to aggravate not sooth my grief to view the immenselydistant heaven my nearest prospect of relief to miss  one of the chichester graces ballad ix written in goodwood gardens september    0 i ye hills that overlook the plains where wealth and gothic greatness reigns where natures hand by art is checked and taste herself is architect ye fallows gray ye forests brown and seas that the vast prospect crown ye freight the soul with fancys store nor can she one idea more ii i said  when dearest of her kind her form the picture of her mind chloris approached  the landscape flew all nature vanished from my view she seemed all nature to comprize her lips her beauteous breasts her eyes that roused and yet abashed desire with liquid languid living fire iii but then  her voice  how framed to endear the

verse should fail  agno from natures works and natures laws we find delight and seek applause the prattling streams and zephyrs bland and fragrant flowers by zephyrs fanned the level lawns and buxom bowers speak nature and her works are ours  melpomene what were all your fragrant bowers splendid days and happy hours springs verdant robe fair floras blush and all the poets of the bush what the paintings of the grove rural music mirth and love life and every joy would pall if phoebus shone not on you all  melinoe we chant to phoebus king of day the morning and the evening lay but pan each satyr nymph and fawn adore as laureat of the lawn from peevish march to joyous june he keeps our restless souls in tune without his oaten reed and song phoebus thy days would seem too long  apollo am i not he who prescious from on high sends a long look through all futurity am i not he to whom alone belong the powers of medicine melody and song diffusely liberal as divinely bright eye of the universe and sire of light  pan over cots and vales and every shepherd swain inpeaceable preeminence i reign with pipe on plain and nymph in secret grove the day is music and the night is love i blessed with these nor envy nor desire thy gaudy chariot or thy golden lyre  clio soon as the dawn dispels the dark illustrious phoebus gins to appear proclaimed by the herald lark and everwakeful chanticleer the persian pays his morning vow and all the turband easterns bow  agno soon as the evening shades advance and the gilt glowworn glitters fair for rustic gambol gibe and dance fawns nymphs and dryads all prepare pan shall his swains from toil relieve and rule the revels of the eve  melpomene in numbers as smooth as callirhoes stream glide the silvertond verse when apollos the theme while on his own mount cyparissus is seen and daphne preserves her immutable green well hail hyperion with transport so long the inventor the patron and subject of song  melinoe while on the calm ocean the halcyon shall breed and syrinx shall sigh with her musical reed while fairies and satyrs and fawns shall approve the music the mirth and the life of the grove so long shall our pan be than thee more divine for he shall be rising when thou shall decline  midas no more  to pan and to his beauteous nymphs i do adjudge the prize as is most due enter two satyrs and crown midas with a pair of asss ears apollo such rural honors all the gods decree to those who sing like pan and judge like thee exeunt omnes finis
