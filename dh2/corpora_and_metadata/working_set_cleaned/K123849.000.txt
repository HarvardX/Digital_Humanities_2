the deserter a new musical drama as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  dublin printed for j potts d chamberlain w sleater and r moncrieffe mdcclxxiii  to the public le deserteur is well known to have been these five years the most favorite musical piece on the french stage so great indeed has been its success that in this short time it has been translated into three languages one of which translations we have lately seen at the kings theater in the haymarket under the title of il desertore  indeed when you once admit the circumstance of henrys consessing himself a deserter nothing can be more truly interesting than some of the incidents but yet they were brought about in a way peculiarly calculated for the french stage the resolution of henry was too sudden too unprepared as well as the circumstance of the mockwedding that precedes it and throughout the piece there were a number of cold inanimating occurrences that had very little if any relation to the main design and add to this it was never intended for an opera for the author himself calls it a comedy interspersed with songs  it was thought therefore that if the unnecessary incidents were expunged and those retained were rendered more probable if by making an uniform partition between the dialogue and the songs it could be brought more to wear the complexion of an opera the deserter might be entitled to a favorable reception on the english stage how far these suggestions were reasonable the public who are the best judges and by whose arbitration i shall always be proud to abide will determine  with regard to the music as i found it a work of great invention i should have kept it in its original state had it been possible but besides the excessive length of the songs the continual breaks into recitative the frequent sudden alterations of the style and above all that sameness which so particularly characterizes the french music i found it much too grave to stand the least chance of success in an afterpiece i therefore selected what i thought the beauties and what i could not effect by having recourse to the original i have endeavored to supply myself  in justice to the french composer i think it absolutely necessary to declare that the songs beginning  one conducts for both love and war  the nymph who in my bosom reigns  mr simkin i would have you to know and  the whims of folks in love are wholly my own and that the first air in the piece and that beginning  my lifes three parts diminished are by philidor a name of no inconsiderable note in the musical world  i have nothing to add but that i take this opportunity of making my acknowledgments to the performers for the support they were of to this piece i would indeed but that i despair of finding words worthy the occasion express my gratitude to the public for their favorable reception of it  c dibdin  dramatis personae men henry mr vernon russet mr banister simkin mr dibdin skirmish mr parsons flint mr wright

the cause of this fuss why there is pipers and fiddlers while robin and harry and clodpole and roger and ten more of us have pulled as much fruit as we are ably to carry margaret why numscull that is nothing her ladyships wine all over the village runs just like a fouutain and i heard the folks say every dish when they dine will be swimming in claret madeira and mountain jenny then for poultry and such like  good lord what a store i saw goodman gander six baskets full cramming then such comforts and jellies why one such feast more would certainly breed in the village a famine chorus what the meaning can be we shall presently see for yonder is old russet who certainly knows but be what it will our wish shall be still joy and health to the duchess wherever she goes  sim what can all this feasting be for   jenny i will give you while i wind up this bottom and another and you shall not find it out   sim why then if you know so well why dont you tell us what it is   jen ah i thought you would none of you guess it this grand seasting at the duchesss is because the kings coming to the camp   marg who told you so   jen i had it from gaffer russet himself   sim does the king come to the

simkin margaret jenny and villagers air ii louisa why must i appear so deceitful i cannot dear father comply ah could i think him so ungrateful with anguish i surely should die what so tender at parting he told me which such joy to my bosom conveyed when next he was doomed to behold me could i think would be this way repaid  rus well well but child    lou indeed father it is impossible i never can consent to such a thing   rus odds heart louisa there is no harm in it neighbors come round here i will tell you the whole affair you know what a dear good lady the duchess is   marg ah she is a dear good lady indeed and we all of us ought to do every thing she orders us   rus i and my family in particular ought for manys the good thing she has given me and my old dame then how kind she was to all my poor children she stood godmother to this and had her christened after her own name   sim louisa   rus well now we come to the point henry you know who was bred up with my girl and intended from his infancy for her husband is a soldier   sim so he is   rus and because she has a value for every thing that belongs to me this good lady about three weeks ago sent to the colonel for his discharge that the young folks may live at home at their ease and be as happy as the day is long   marg that will be charming and comfortable for you neighbor   rus yes but now comes the mischief of it what has occasioned it i dont know i never saw any harm of the lad but there are always busy tongues in this village doing people illoffices and such reports within these few days have reached the duchesss ears that she is determined to see further into this business before she gives louisa the portion she promised her   jen you may thank me for that   lou but he will be here today and so well i know his heart that i am sure he will clear himself to their confusion who could so vilely traduce him   jen perhaps not   rus well child i am sure you cannot wish it more than i do nothing has ever pleased me so much as the thought of your coming together i wish to see you married with all my heart for i shall then have nothing to do but to listen to the prattle of your children and prepare myself to follow poor dorothy  air iii my lifes three parts diminished and when the sum is finished the parishbell may toll gramercy on my soul ding dong swing swong methinks my old companions say that though his hairs are now grown gray old russet once upon a day when all was mirth and jollity when sports went round and bells did ring could briskly dance and blytbe could sing and then upon the green to see his rustic feats  t was who but he i would give this bauble life away without a sigh could i but stay to see a little infant care like henry brave louisa fair could i see this i would yield content a life i hope not badly spent but as i was telling you the duchess hearing of these reports is determined that we shall make a trial of his affections   lou indeed father there is no necessity for it he loves me most sincerely   rus nay nay child i really think your love carries you away too much in this affalr it can do no harm it is only an innocent frolic you are to make believe as if you were a bride and let me see who  oh you shall be the bridegroom   sim shall i icod i am glad of that   rus but above all i must instruct you jenny in your part you are to sit here and tell henry when he comes that louisa and simpkin were married yesterday   jen the very thing i wished   lou i am vexed to death that this trick should be played him i can judge by myself what he will feel if i was told such a thing of him how miserable i should be   rus but he will be so much the happier when he finds out the deceit child   air iv louisa though prudence may press me and duty distress me against inclination o what can they do no longer a rover his follies are over my heart my fond heart says my henry is true the be thus as changing from sweet to sweet raging a rose should be light on never wishes to stray with raptures possessing in one every blessing till torn from her bosom he flies far away  rus well well dontt make yourself uneasy i dare say he loves you as sincerely as you think he does if so he will soon be undeceived and we shall finish the day as happily as we could wish in the mean time let us think of what we have to do we are to pretend we came from the church the fiddles and bagpipes are to go first then the lads and lasses follow after which mind this now we are to go to the duchesss mansion in grand procession and there to be feasted like so many princes and princesses   sim icod that will suit me nicely  but gaffer russet jenny says you told her the feasting was to be for the king   rus for us and the king yes yes the king after he and his courtiers have had an entertainment at the duchesss goes to review the camp where the soldiers are all to appear under arms  ah girls that is what none of you know any thing about when the king goes to the camp then is the time  the drums beat  the fifes play  the colors are flying  and  and  lord  lord what a charming thing war is   sim it must be then when one comes home again and its all over   rus there is no life like the life of a soldier and then for love let the girls take care of their hearts i remember i won my dorothy just after i came from such a review now as there may be today   marg ah indeed the soldiers make sad work with young womens hearts sure enough   rus and how can it be otherwise  air v one conducts for both love and war the points to gain poffession for this we watch the enemys coast till we sleeping catch them on their post then good bye form the sort we storm and by these arts make towns or hearts surrender at discretion in love the only battery which with success we play to conquer hearts is flattery no fortress can its power withstand neither cannons mortars sword in hand can make such way as it is in love so it is in war we make believe mislead deceive pray what serve drums and trumpets for cannons and all our force of arms but with their thundering alarms to tell not cover our designs can these to trenches breaches mines blockades or ambuscades compare no all agree that policy is the true art militaire but come come we must go and prepare ourselves you have not much time to spare and see where he comes hurrying along there

world i am sure i very sincerely pity you   hen i am obliged to you for your concern   jen nay it is not more upon your account than my own that i am uneasy   hen how so   jen why she was not content with making you miserable but she must make me so too the vile wretch she is married to has perjured himself for he has sworn a thousand and a thousand times to marry me   hen what falsehood and treachery   jen if i was you i would not bear it quietly not but she would brazen it all out for i taxed her with it myself and she only laughed in my face and told me that you and i might go and mourn together like two turtles the loss of our mates   hen insulting creature   jen yes and for my part i said to myself says i twould be a good joke to take her at her word but then again i thought that though revenge is sweet yet people have their likings and their dislikings and as for me to be sure i cannot pretend to such a good young man as you   hen not regarding her in famous wretch well might she keep her eyes fixed upon the ground but i will see her upbraid her with her infidelity and leave her to the guilty reproaches of her own ungrateful heart   jen young man    hen returning well what do you say   jen i believe you did not rightly hear what i said   hen oh i have no time for trifling   scene v jenny simkin jen poor soul how he takes it to heart but i must follow him for if i lose this opportunity i may not find it so easy to get another but stay upon second thoughts if i can but make a tool of simkin and by that means alarm louisa i shall every way gain my ends for if she once believes him capable of slighting her i am sure she has too much spirit ever to see him again   sim oh jenny i am glad i have found you what do you think brought me away from louisa and them   jen i neither know nor care   sim why i was afraid you would be jealous   jen i jealous   sim why yes you know because i pretended to be louisas husband   jen no i would have you to know i am not jealous i am only vexed to think i have been such a fool to listen to you so long you base creature you   sim if i did not think there was something the matter by your looking so cross   jen and enough to make one you know i cannot help loving you and this is the way you return my affection   sim why you know twas only in play   jen in play  i could see plain enough how your eyes sparkled upon the bare mention of being the bridegroom   sim now jenny if you would but hear me speak    jen speak get out of my sight you perjured wretch i was fool enough not to credit what i heard of you but i dare say it is all true   sim why what did you hear of me   jen that it was you who invented all these reports about henry   sim me as i am a living christian jenny    jen dont say a word to me you have made me miserable and now you want to insult me   sim indeed i dont you cannot think now how happy i could make you if you would only hear me three words    jen dont talk to me of happiness for i never shall be happy again as long as i live   sim how dearly she loves me what a pity it is she will not let me clear up this affair   jen and then that demure little minx oh i could tear her eyes out i was always afraid of it and now i am convinced that her pretended love for henry was nothing but a contrivance to blind me the easier   sim dear dear    jen but however you have both missed your aim for henry behaves as he ought to do and holds her arts in contempt nay he told me himself he had fixed his affections upon a more worthy object   sim he did   jen yes he did and you may go and tell her so and as for me  air viii mr simkin i would have you to know that for all your fine airs i am not at my last prayers not put to it so that of course i must take up with you for i really sir think that though husbands are few i need not go far off to seek for a better than you any day of the week to be sure i must own i was foolish enough to believe all the tenderness nonsense and stuff which for ever you dinnd in my ears and when for a while you have been out of my sight the day has been comfortless dreary the night and my only companions my tears but now that is all over i hate you despise you will see you no more  scene vi sim why what the deuce has got hold of her for my share i believe all the folks in our village are gone mad  mad icod i will be hanged if any
