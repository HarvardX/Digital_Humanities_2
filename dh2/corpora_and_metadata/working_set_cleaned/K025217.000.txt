ten cases of persons who have taken mrs stephenss medicines for the stone with an abstract of some experiments tending to illustrate these cases  london printed for s harding at the bible and anchor on the pavement in st martins lane and j roberts in warwick lane       ten cases of persons who have taken mrs stephenss medicines for the stone i the case of the right reverend the lord bishop of bath and wells about five years ago he felt a soreness in his left side after having rode four days together and made water which was first coffeecolourd and then bloody these complaints went off in a short time however he became after this subject to make bloody water upon riding he felt once a most violent pain along the region of the right ureter it lasted only for a moment and happened during a fit of cholic occasioned by eating strawberries about two years ago he was obliged to forbear riding and could hardly walk without making bloody water had pain in making water and a forcing to go to stool at the same time but no stoppage he began mrs stephenss medicines in april last they increased the pain in making water for some time his water became turbid at the time of making had ropy fetid matter in it deposited a thick heavy sediment and many small flakes and fragments of stones were voided with it in a soft state in five or six weeks he grew much better and was able to go over the stones in his coach his general health was also much improved in the beginning of july he had a return of the pain in making water with a sudden stoppage now and then upon this he voided several pieces of stone in a soft state with one pretty large piece part of which was soft and white part brown and hard and it gave a little pain in passing after this the pain and stoppage in making water went off entirely in september he went into the country where he often rides a trotting horse without any inconvenience and is free from all complaints excepting that he has now and then some uneasy sensations in the region of the kidneys he has continued the medicines till a little while ago but his water has been in general perfectly clear during the use of them whereas it has twice been turbid upon discontinuing them and deposits a red sediment which dries into a stony substance  feb          j bath and wells  ii the case of mr binford at mr cameray s in tokenhouseyard throgmortonstreet he had a stone taken out of his bladder by the operation when about ten years old has had the symptoms of a stone in the bladder now again for about six years a surgeon at exeter examined him twice by the finger in the anus and found both times in the most evident manner a stone in the bladder which he imagined to be as big as an egg mr binford perceived the motions of this stone during the examinations and made bloody water after one of them he began mrs stephenss medicines about the middle of last august and in a short time after voided many white scales and much brown grit in a soft and rotten state since this he has voided many irregular shells of stone of a considerable size and of such a thickness as to consist of several coats from two to six in number many of these when voided are covered with a whiteness which being rubbed off the shell appears to be brown on the  0th of january he had a suppression of urine mr hawkins passed the catheter then and found a stone in the bladder which he told mr binford he believed to be very small though he would not presume to be certain mr binford has voided many more pieces of stone since this and mrs stephens is in daily expectation of his being perfectly well  feb          tho binford  iii the case of mr bolton at the sun and dolphin in cheapside contained in a letter directed to me sir toward the latter part of my life when in my fiftieth year about    0 i was sore pained with the stone until i voided a large one at several times since about a dozen part came away after a little riding and then i made water like coffee but i imagine one of the largest might stay behind for in      i began to be greatly afflicted could not endure to ride or bear a coach when i have been making water it often stopped on a sudden causing much pain and no person in the country could give relief though i took a many odd things reading the papers i observed some specificks for the stone were advertized one a powder the other a liquid i got em and tried each but was not able to go through with either of em being of a forcing nature increased my pain then was advised to smooth palliating medicines yet pain still continued and excessive made me begin to think of coming up to london to be cut if it might be safely done at my age at that time the news informed us that the bishop of bath and wells and others were cured by taking mrs stephenss medicines i was then more inclinable to come when i set out my thoughts were to undergo the manual operation and had wrote to mr cheselden about it when i arrived in london and consulted with some friends it was thought as i was in my   th year the safest way to take mrs stephenss medicines and accordingly on the   th of july      i began with em taking three powders and three half pints of liquid every day what effect and how they did operate you will see by the following diary which i kept as exactly as i could considering the pain i had by times which yet prompted me to keep strictly to the medicines believing that by so doing i should the sooner be made easy and took the liquid four times a day for some weeks  a diary as i took the medicines       jul    began to take three powders three half pints of a liquid three times a day jul    the same jul  0 the same brought away a slimy mucous matter into the pot much pain jul    continued to bring such stuff away great pain jul    the same i was in great pain all this time jul    the same i was in great pain all this time jul    the same i was in great pain all this time jul    foul water i was

medicine i only took two bottles after this day nov    i walked abroad as far as the customhouse having confined myself for twenty weeks taking the medicines regularly without stirring out of doors postscript sir you may please to observe i have had great pain from the stone and the medicines operation but now being entirely free from any may be compared to a woman in travail is forgotten and do believe myself now to be cured of the stone having no symptoms of that kind thanks to friends for advice and laus deo  dec         i am sir your most obliged humble servant fran bolton from newcastle super tinam    iv the case of the honorable mr carteret postmaster general having been very much afflicted with the stone and gravel and having by the best means i could endeavored to get relief at length in the utmost of my extremity i was recommended to mrs stephens and soon after taking her medicines i began to bring away in my urine a whitish powder which when dry appeared to be what came from a stone this continued for some time and in about two or three months i found myself freed from a pain i had felt at times for several years on the right side of the bladder and i am well assured it was a stone or calculous matter which stuck to the bladder besides this i had a loose stone in the bladder which for several months after gave me extreme pain by its forcing when i made water which at length came away in pieces almost every time i made water for about nine weeks following until at last it came all away as appeared by my being freed from all manner of pain the kernel of the stone itself having come away i thought myself then entirely well though afterward upon a journey to london some stones fell from my kidneys which came away to the number of seven at one time which made me presume too far in discontinuing the medicines in great part having little or no pain when a stone which had stuck in the ureters came down and stopped the passage of the urine which occasioned a suppression of it and out of fear of its not passing i had the assistance of mr cheselden and i thank god i am now free of any pain and have been so ever since  ed carteret  v the case of mr daubuz in throgmortonstreet he has been subject to void gravel for a long time and had the following complaints for about ten months pain along the urethra and at the neck of the bladder especially upon walking much or going in a coach violent pain and difficulty in making water a sudden stoppage very often forcing to go to stool bloody water upon much motion he began mrs stephenss medicines the first week of last august upon this his water became turbid at the time of making and he voided a good deal of red gravel he was much better in a month free from all complaints in six weeks and his water ceased to be turbid at the time of making though he still continued the use of the medicines he left them off in october having voided three small stones two flat and one round a little before this and has been perfectly well ever since  feb          step daubuz  vi the case of mr holland warder of the tower has had pains in the region of the kidneys with the voiding of small stones ever since the year      in august      had a very bad fit but voided no stone after it in the october following found that he could neither bear a coach ride nor walk without a great deal of pain and often making bloody water had frequent provocations to make water and made very little at a time he began mrs stephenss medicines on the third of last october upon this his water became white and had small white gravel in it like scrapings of chalk he was in great pain for the first month after he began the medicines november the fourth he was examined by the catheter and a stone was found in the bladder since this he has voided several scales like eggshells white on one side and brown on the other with many white rotten bits of stone he is at present very easy can walk very well and continues the use of the medicines  witness my hand to the truth of this  feb          thomas holland  vii the case of mr neau in comptonstreet near st ann s church has had the symptoms of a stone in the bladder for about six years was examined soon after the appearance of these symptoms by the catheter and a stone found in the bladder had great pain and difficulty in making water a sudden stoppage often forcings to go to stool and made bloody water upon motion he began mrs stephenss medicines upon the fifteenth of last september he was examined by the catheter on the twentyseventh of october and a stone was found in the bladder upon taking the medicines his water became turbid at the time of making and he has voided several white shells in so soft a state as to crumble easily with one large irregular stone he voided a large stone and several shells before he took the medicines but they were all brown and very hard he has now very few complaints is able to go over the stones in a coach without inconvenience and continues the use of the medicines  feb          henry neau  viii the case of mr snape in pantonstreet near the haymarket about three years ago he began to have a pain in making water made little at a time and had a provocation to it every quarter of an hour had violent forceings to go to stool at the same time made bloody water upon much motion in the end of the year      after having taken some lenitive electuary he voided many small stones in a hard state but received no relief thereby in april      he began mrs stephenss medicines upon the use of these he grew much easier his water became turbid at the time of making and he voided a great number of small stones in a soft state which by their corners seemed to have been pieces of larger he took the medicines for about a year and has been perfectly well ever since he left them off  feb          john snape  ix the case of the rev dr sykes in great marlboroughstreet he has been subject to pains in his back with vomitings and the voiding of small stones for many years about four or five years ago after a jolt in a coach he had a pain in making water which continued about three weeks in november      after another jolt he had a return of the same sort of pain in making water this became very violent after some time was often attended with a sudden stoppage and he had great provocation to make water especially upon motion made bloody water after much motion in the chariot had an uneasy sensation in the region of the bladder upon turning in bed as if something moved within him these disorders continued about fourteen months at the end of which viz in february last he began to take mrs stephenss medicines they increased his pain in making water very much for some days his water deposited a white heavy sediment and he voided many flakes of stone in a soft state and some fragments in a hard one he grew easy and free from all complaints in about two months excepting that he had now and then some small pains in the region of the ureters however he continued the use of the medicines till the end of august his water depositing a white heavy sediment till the last ten days or fortnight of taking he has continued perfectly well ever since and can ride a trotting horse or go over the stones in a coach without any inconvenience  feb         arthurashley sykes  x the case of mr thomas he had the usual symptoms of a stone in the bladder and began mrs stephenss medicines in september last being about    years old october the eighth mr hawkins examined him and found a stone in the bladder which he told mr thomas he believed to be a large one upon first taking the medicines mr thomass water deposited much heavy sediment which dried into a stony substance some time after he voided soft white scales in great quantities with grit and slime which i saw his pains were great at this time they continued he lost his appetite grew feverish and died jan  0 his body was opened and a stone taken out of the bladder this stone dr shaw and mr hawkins saw jan  0 i saw dr shaw that evening and took down from his mouth the following words relating to the appearance of the stone  the stone was light white on the outside a great part of it covered with a cretaceous coat which broke off in flakes with great ease perfectly like to those before voided as appeared by comparing them the stone would to any indifferent person plainly appear as if acted upon by a solvent so as to have greatly diminished its bulk the inner part of the stone was reddish and harder than the external when tried by a knife there were two bulgings which rose pretty high above the stone and which appeared to be less acted upon by the solvent than the other parts the stone was not covered equably with the same coat but what covered one part appeared to have been taken off in others the next day i saw mr hawkins and took down from his mouth the following words relating to the appearance of the stone he saw a stone weighing nearly two ounces as mrs thomas said the surface was of a whitish color and in part covered with a matter that had all the appearance of the soft shells that had before come away in mr thomass water this matter was very soft and ready to fall off and crumble upon the least touch by these appearances he says that he should imagine that the stone had been larger and that this soft matter seemed to he ready to fall off in a little time the part of the stone not covered with this scaly matter appeared when scraped with a knife of a rusty iron color and considerably hard  any person who is disposed to inquire more particularly into the effects of these medicines may have a list of those that take them at mr winter s in richbellcourt redlyonstreet from whence they are given out however i hope these ten cases will be sufficient to engage the attention of all wellwishers to mankind and i have been determined in my choice of them rather by the eminence of the persons by their living in town or by the strong presumption of at least a partial dissolution of a stone than by the greatness of the benefit received some of these are indeed complete cures as far as one can judge but there are several others as complete among persons of less note or who live at a distance from london and that with all the probable circumstances of the gradual wasting and crumbling of stones there are also a great number of unfinished cases which add much light and evidence to these ten neither are these medicines prejudicial to the body but on the contrary have plainly improved the general health of many that have taken them i still go on with my inquiries in the most impartial manner i can and should be extremely sorry not only to deceive myself but to be any occasion of imposing upon others  an abstract of some experiments tending to illustrate the foregoing cases i since i have taken mrs stephenss medicines my urine has been of a more urinous smell than usual turbid at the time of making and alkaline that is it turns syrup of violets green and ferments with the following acid liquors oil of vitriol spirit of vitriol oil of sulphur spirit of nitre spirit of sea salt vinegar and lemonjuice and as far as i can judge the case is the same with all who take these medicines this i thought very remarkable when i first observed it and began to hope that urine which was so different from common urine might have different effects upon stones in the kidneys and bladder and i have lately been informed that even common urine when it putrifies that is turns alkaline by being kept will dissolve and take up the calculous incrustations upon the sides and bottoms of chamberpots  ii in order to satisfy myself the better in this affair i thought it not amiss to try what effects my urine thus rendered alkaline by the medicines would have upon stones taken from a human body by digesting them in it with a gentle heat for this purpose i took the stones a and b and sawed each of them into four pieces of nearly the same shape and size a was a white hard stone of an uniform substance throughout it consisted of coats indeed but these were all as far as one could judge perfectly alike b was a brown stone it is shell was hard and knotted but the internal parts were much softer i called the several pieces a   b   a   b   a   b   a   b   in order to denote thereby the several liquors in which each was digested   standing for new river water   for a mixture of mrs stephenss powder and new river water   for common urine and   for my own alkaline urine i then digested all these pieces of stone for a week in their respective liquors with a gentle heat this heat was intended to have been the same as that of urine in the bladder but my contrivances not being good it was at different times both considerably greater and considerably less i examined them pretty often and recruited the liquors as they wasted with others of the same kind two or three days after they were put into digestion i observed that a   had some white scales lying upon its surface in several parts which fell off upon being pressed with my nail after a weeks digestion i took them out and rubbed them all with a cloth they were then laid in a window till they became perfectly dry and the following table shows the effects which the several liquors had upon them  weights when put in weights when dry loss proportional loss a   grains  0   0    00   a             00 0 a         0 gain   000  a              0 0  b              00   b            0 00   b           gain   000  b         0    0 0   iii by this table it appears that the pieces a   b   in my alkaline urine had lost more than any of the others a   b   in new river water more than a   b   in the mixture of mrs stephenss powder and new river water and that a   b   in common urine had received a small addition that my alkaline urine should occasion the greatest loss is a presumption in favor of mrs stephenss medicines that the new river water should have a greater effect than the mixture of mrs stephenss powder and new river water was owing i believe to the powders adhering closely to the stones in several parts which both kept the water from coming freely in contact with the stones and also added to their weight and the increase of weight in a   b   is an appearance of the same kind with the growth of stones in the body and upon examining a   accurately i perceived that it had got an exceeding thin coat in several parts which separated easily and which i supposed to be an accretion from the stony particles of the common urine in which it had been digested  iv after this i washed the several pieces of the stone a and rubbed them well with a brush so as to take off all loose parts i took out the soft internal parts of the pieces of b reserving proper portions of each of the hard shells i sawed the stones c d and e into four pieces each of nearly the same shape and size and f into two i took two pieces of the white shell g two of the brown nucleus h and gave them all names as in the following table in which   denotes new river water as before   mrs stephenss liquid   common urine as before and   my own alkaline urine as before these pieces were digested for a week in the manner abovementioned excepting that the liquors were now changed every morning and all the pieces rubbed at the same time with a wet sponge they were rubbed also when taken out as clean as could be without violence and then laid in a window till they were perfectly dry and the following table shows the effects which the several liquors had upon them  weights when put in weights when dry loss proportional loss a   grains  0         00   a              0    a             00   a     0

had lost much more in general by this weeks digestion than by the former which without doubt was owing in great measure to my having rubbed them every morning with a wet sponge and it was also upon this account i suppose that some of the pieces in common urine had lost a little however the great difference of loss in the several pieces of the same stone could not arise from this cause and the rubbing them gave me an opportunity of observing the manner in which the several liquors acted upon the stones this was in general giving a whiteness to the surface of the stones which when it was rubbed off left the stone of its former color but in those which were most affected soft white scales fell off upon being rubbed and some of them were corroded and honeycombed thus the pieces in new river water had a whiteness upon their surface and the water itself became milky a   a   c   c   f   and h   had all lost white scales b   e   and e   were all pretty much corroded d   a little corroded b   was corroded within and at the same time its knotted external surface rendered smooth d   had its brown surface turned white but g   seemed not to have been affected at all  vi in order to satisfy myself still farther i took all the foregoing stones h   and h   excepted which were lost by reason of their smallness and digested them again in their respective liquors having now got a contrivance by which they were kept in a heat not differing materially from that of urine in the bladder i got also two small round stones from the reverend dr hales which were both taken out of the bladder of the same person and which the doctor judged to be very hard ones and called them i   and i   i   weighed twentyfive grains and an half and was put into common urine i   weighed twentyone grains and an half and was put into my own alkaline urine i began the digestion july    the liquors were changed every day during the whole digestion and the stones all rubbed with a wet sponge every day for the first ten days then once in three or four days till sept   but after that not at all and the following table shows the day on which each stone was either so far wasted as not to be found or reduced to such a size as to be in danger of being confounded with the small pieces which fell from the rest  e   aug    d      b    0 d   sept   b     b     d      f      g      c   sept    e

this time the several pieces in common urine continued entire and even had incrustations upon them i took them out nov   and having weighed them nov    when they were perfectly dry found that they had all received an increase of weight as in the following table  grains a   had gained    b      c      d     e     f     g     i      viii the manner in which the other pieces wasted was in general the same as that which is described above in the  th paragraph excepting that those in new river water became after some time as much honeycombed as the rest and wasted as fast that d   and g   remained unaltered to appearance for a long time and then grew quite rotten in a few days and that i   the small hard stone given me by dr hales had several cracks in it after about a months digestion  ix besides these i made several other experiments the result of which it may not be improper just to mention  x i digested different pieces of the same stones in my own alkaline urine with different heats the one that of urine in the bladder the other so great that i could not bear my hand at rest in it and i found that the less heat had the greater effect  xi i boiled different pieces of the same stones in common water my own alkaline urine and common urine for five hours each those in water and my urine wasted considerably and the surface of the last was turned white and soft but those in common urine had little effect produced upon them  xii i digested different pieces of the same stones in common water the distilled water of waterpepper the juice and the decoction of it and found that common water had a greater effect than any of these the heat in this and all the following experiments did not differ materially from that of urine in the bladder  xiii i digested pieces of stones taken from the human bladder from the bladders of dogs and the stomachs of horses in thames water and in pump water and found that both the waters dissolved all the human stones entirely and wasted the others very much but the thames water had the quickest effect the waters were changed every morning at which time i observed that the pump water poured on the day before had always some bubbles upon it some of the human stones were cracked during the dissolution  xiv i digested pieces of the same dogs and horses stones in common urine and my own alkaline urine but did not observe any effect except that one of the dogs stones seemed a little softened by my urine  xv i digested a large kidneystone two pieces that had been boiled in my alkaline urine and a round hard stone in common urine which was a mixture of different urines the kidneystone and the two pieces lost something of their weight the round hard stone grew black at first but whether it was wasted or not i cannot determine from its appearance and i had not weighed it the surface of the kidneystone was rendered so brittle that large scales broke off with very little force but they were neither white nor soft  xvi i digested a large kidneystone of the same shape size and texture with the foregoing and taken out of the other kidney of the same person with twelve different stones or pieces of stones in the alkaline urine of a gentleman who took mrs stephenss medicines they all wasted very fast excepting one piece which received a small addition it was ironcoloured and exceedingly hard as i found by sawing it it appeared to me that this gentlemans urine had in general a quicker effect than my own the stones mentioned in this the  0th   th   th and   th paragraphs were none of them rubbed  xvii there are some appearances mentioned in this abstract which i cannot account for but if the experiments were repeated with more accuracy and other new ones tried it is probable that many useful discoveries would arise and thus much i think one may venture to conclude even from these experiments that the dissolutions by the several sorts of common water prove against the absolute necessity of an acrimonious liquid for this purpose and that those by the two alkaline urines are strong presumptions in favor of mrs stephenss medicines especially when compared with the foregoing cases i shall be much obliged to any gentleman who will furnish me with stones for the farther prosecution of this matter  finis postscript since the date of mr binford s case no   he has voided a few more pieces of stone and is become free from all complaints having been able to go over the stones in a coach without any inconvenience for a week past  march         tho binford
