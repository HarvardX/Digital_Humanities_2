an answer to the first part of the age of reason  printed in       by thomas tailor v d m  see thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him sol ne suitor ultra crepidum hor manchester printed at g nicholson and cos office   palacestreet       an answer etc mr paines political writings have made a considerable stir in the nation and have appeared of such consequence that the legislative powers have thought proper to take them into serious consideration and have interdicted their being sold and also outlawed the author the merit or demerit of those productions is a circumstance i pretend to be no competent judge of being no politician the bent of my studies and labors lying in a different channel yet i rather marvel if those writings are so bad that no one has stepped forward and fairly confuted them that would have been the most effectual way of preventing their doing harm and of rendering them of none effect  but let that matter be as it may if mr ps political pamphlets be as pernicious as that which he calls the age of reason it would have been happy for the world if he had been laid in the dust three seven years ago it is really calculated to do much harm amongst a large number of mankind not that there is any thing new advanced they are the old threadbare arguments which he has vamped up again dressed in a sort of ridiculous and buffoon style calculated to please the halfthinking witlings of the age and furnish them matter of foolish laughter over their cups stifling all serious reflection and confirming them in infidelity and profanity in the mean time there is a kind of sophistry and the appearance of philosophy which is vain yet calculated to puzzle such as are weak but simplehearted and wellmeaning and may throw them into a kind of perplexity which may prove their everlasting ruin it is for the sake of such that i undertake to answer this piece of barefaced blasphemy  i have made enquiry after a suitable answer to this profane piece of drollery but i have not seen any in these parts which is likely to be a proper antidote against the poison which it contains i have seen several remarks but the writers have not taken sufficient notice of the evil it is likely to do they see into the futility of it but do not consider the many thousands who are likely to be ensnared who are not capable of seeing as they do and hence it is that they have passed it over too slightly there is one pamphlet the author of which styles himself a churchman which takes notice of some parts of the book in question somewhat seriously but even this does but touch upon here and there a passage and upon these is too diffusive and declamatory till it fatigues the reader besides he is too tenacious of a party which occasions him to launch out into things quite foreign to the matter in hand mr ps book is not written against any denomination of christians in particular national or congregational but against christianity in general the whole of revelation so that it is a pity any wellmeaning writer should enlarge so much upon that which is nothing to the purpose in answering him he makes a jest of revelation prophecies or miracles of course the incarnation of our blessed immanuel his resurrection his atonement and coming to judgment are mere idle tales in his esteem  as there is no method or order in mr ps performance none can be observed in answering it he rambles from one thing to another as his fancy leads him and therefore i must ramble after him so must any one who intends to answer him to any good purpose it will unavoidably swell my answer in that i shall be under the necessity of quoting pretty large paragraphs from his book to make my answers intelligible to such as have not his book by them and i should be sorry that the poor should give eighteenpence for his    pages seeing i am sure they will receive no good from them but likely to receive much harm  what he says page   of compulsive systems of religion and compulsive articles i heartily agree to i believe they have a tendency to destroy morality sincerity and truth but then they have nothing to do with christianity neither christ nor his apostles made any such systems or articles they are antichristian have no part or lot in the matter at all most of what is said page   may pass only his own mind being his own church is a loose vague saying and rather shows an unprincipled mind a true theology will produce a true morality i sincerely believe that compulsive creeds have a tendency to make men subscribe to articles which they do not believe but still those compulsive creeds are out of the question all that mr p says concerning the making religion a political matter is too true only he must know that religion will teach us to live peaceably under the government which our maker has placed us and to obey our governors except they require us to disobey our maker i can tell mr p in a few words what real christianity is and that is to love the lord my god with all my heart and my neighbor as myself this is religion and if mr p can obtain this religion any other way than as the christians do let him the christian obtains this religion by believing in the son of god and in believing he finds life in his name  page   he is open and frank in telling us that he neither believes moses nor jesus christ nor mahomet but has he not substituted something as bad as any of them ibid he is partly right in his notion of revelation and partly wrong revelation when applied to religion means something communicated immediately from god it is so but not to every individual person nor is there any necessity it should for when it has been sufficiently authenticated that a leading truth has been communicated or revealed to one or more persons and that truth is faithfully recorded there is no need that god should be revealing it to every individual we all believe there were such men as alexander the great julius caesar charles the fifth and that they gained those victories which are ascribed to them though we never saw the men nor their armies nor the battles they fought but why do we believe there were such identical men and that they performed those military achievements because their histories were written in detail by such as were eyewitnesses and the aggregate has been compiled by faithful historians from sufficient documents and has been handed down to the present age in like manner we believe there were such cities as babylon ninevah carthage or palmyra but we never saw those famous cities we must believe upon similar evidence and thus i apprehend there is nothing unreasonable in believing the great truths recorded in the bible and the authenticity of those things therein  page   when moses told the children of israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hand of god they were not obliged to believe him because they had no other authority for it but his telling them so how does mr p prove that can he bring us no better evidence than his bold contradiction to say nothing that gods own handwriting would be no small evidence as we may suppose it would greatly differ from that of moses and might carry its own evidence to the children of israel i say passing that by were those dreadful flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the voice of god almighty himself exodus xix       no evidence of his intercourse with the deity did not moses appeal to themselves as witnesses of the almighty speaking with them face to face deuteronomy v   had they not seen those signs in egypt and the wonders wrought for their deliverance were not these sufficient vouchers for the mission of moses had they seen a sea dried up before them and their enraged enemies destroyed that god fed them with manna and brought them water from a rock did he go before them in a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night and could several millions of people be deceived in all this does he not rehearse the whole to them in the book of deuteronomy and appeal to themselves not to their children but to themselves and would it not have been the greatest wonder of all if they had remained infidels still  ibid he allows the commands have some good moral precepts but in a note objects to god visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children as this declaration is often objected to it may not be amiss to spend a few words upon it god is sometimes said to do a thing when he permits it to be done thus he is said to have hardened the heart of pharaoh that is he permitted it to be hardened as he is said to have put a lying spirit into the mouths of ahabs false prophets that is he permitted a wicked spirit who offered his service to go and influence all those wretches to prophecy as they did to bring destruction upon the longprovoking ahab   kings xxii    thus it is in god visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children the children feel the effects of their parents sins thus an extravagant parent squanders away his substance in riot and intemperance and reduces his children to want and beggary is not that want the effect of the fathers sins another by his debaucheries and lewdness contaminates his frame corrupts his whole mass of blood and communicates this disease or the effects of it to his offspring which perhaps may descend to future generations i think in such cases and various others the sins of the parents are awfully visited upon the children and i apprehend this is the sense in which we are to understand the words in exodus  ibid he tries to be witty upon the birth of our blessed lord not to say profane it is however not difficult to account for the credit that was given to the story of jesus christ being the son of god he was born when heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in the world and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief of such a story almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods from hence we are informed that the christian church sprung out of the tail of heathen mythology page   that is that christianity was the offspring of the heathen mythology if that was the case the heathen treated their offspring very cruelly let any one read the acts of the apostles or st pauls epistles to the corinthians thessalonians and to timothy if mr p will not credit these let him get some one to translate tacitus or pliny as he will most likely believe them sooner than the scriptures which he says he detests and he will see that the heathen had no very great liking to the christians nor had the christians or their teachers any very great temptations to ape the heathen in their mythology mr p wants to make the world believe that christianity is a fraud an imposture dressed up to deceive mankind but what were the christians to gain by it the design of all cheats and impostors is that of profit or honor but which of these could the first christians have in view will mr p believe what one of the primitive christians writes even to the present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dewlling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things i have some cause to doubt if even mr p would endure half of the above even for the rights of man or his invention of the age of reason our author professes to believe that our savior was a virtuous and amiable man page   hence we may suppose that he believes there was such a man but then this virtuous and amiable man declares himself to be more than a man i and my father said he are one then the jews took up stones to stone him for a blasphemer and what would they have stoned him for that being a man he made himself god now mr p professes too much candor to stone a person on such account but then he would put a fools coat upon him and set him up as a laughing stock that is he would not treat our lord as a blasphemer but like herod and his men of war set him at naught and mock him as a poor innocent idiot or he will do him the honor to rank him with one of jupiters bastards for in such wise he treats the miraculous conception of our adorable immanuel ibid jesus christ wrote no account of himself of his birth his parentage or any thing else well what of that mr p would not have believed him if he had but is the testimony of any one the less valid because it comes not from the person himself but from others let any of our courts of judicature testify do they not call in the evidences of others and not the persons themselves the fact is some times our lord did speak for himself but more generally he either appealed to his works or to such as heard him speak as he said to pilate why ask thou me ask them that heard me  as touching the preexistent state of our lords human soul and consequently his miraculous conception which our author ridicules let a few of his own sayings be attended to for we may suppose he will believe him seeing he avows that he preached and practiced the most benevolent morality such as is not excelled by confucius nor the greek philosophers no nor even by the quakers i came down from heaven says the savior not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me john vi    say you of him whom the father has sent and sanctified thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god chap x    and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was chap xvii   such are the sayings of him whom mr p allows preached and practiced a pure morality and yet attempts to make his miraculous conception both indelicate and ridiculous and puts it upon a level with all the vile and impure legends we find among the heathen i wish to give this author credit for what he says namely that he believes jesus christ was a good man and that he lived and taught the purest morality let me just quote a few sayings more from this divine teacher for the bread of god is he which comes down from heaven that is himself and gives his life for the world i am the bread of life he that comes unto me shall never hunger and he that believes on me shall never thirst i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread which i give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and i in him john vi        yet further this divine teacher says the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many matt xx    he that has seen me has seen the father also john xiv all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them john chap xvii  0 i should not have quoted these scriptures had not mr p declared that he believes our lord taught and lived the most pure morality now if any one lives and teaches pure morality his morality must be true yea and whatever doctrine he teaches must be true otherwise he is a false teacher and therefore no good moralist in the above few scriptures are contained our blessed lords divinity his miraculous conception and his blessed atonement for our offenses it remains then if our savior is a true teacher mr p is a ridiculous drolling daring blasphemer of jehovah and his ever blessed christ  as our author has been very jocular upon our saviors conception he affects to be still more so upon his resurrection page   the miraculous conception was not a thing which admitted of publicity and therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage that though they might not be credited they could not be detected but the resurrection of a dead person from the grave and his ascension through the air is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of to the invisible conception of a child in the womb the resurrection and ascension supposing them to have taken place admitted of public and ocular demonstration like that of the ascension of a balloon or the sun at noonday to all jerusalem at least instead of this a small number of persons not more than eight or nine are introduced as proxies for the whole world to say they saw it and all the rest of the world are called to believe it  mr p it seems believes that eight or nine persons did declare his resurrection and are not eight or nine sponsible witnesses sufficient does the law require more than three nay will not two witnesses be sufficient even in criminal matters why then should eight or nine in this case have been thought too few but if numbers will avail we are told that he appeared to five hundred yea and the writer declared the greater part of them were alive at the time of his writing it seems mr p believes that our lord was really crucified as well as the jews and i never met with one that doubted it and as he had told them he would rise again the third dry they remembered it and took care to secure the sepulcher by rolling a great stone and setting a watch yea a watch of their own choosing ye have a watch said pilate go and make it secure this we may suppose they did now if our lord did not rise why did they not expose his body why did they not carry it in triumph through the city and expose it in the most public manner that would have knocked the matter on the head at once but instead of that a senseless tale is invented which even mr p seems to pay little attention to his disciples came and stole him away while the guard fell asleep was it likely the whole guard should fall asleep that was death by the roman military law or if they were asleep could they be sure that the disciples or any person else stole him from the sepulcher were the resurrection founded on no better evidence it would be deservedly exploded  the next thing which our author makes himself very merry with is the rebellion of satan and his angels and here he has found something that matches it to a tittle in his heathen mythology page   especially in the war with the giants and jupiter and the angry god taking one of them and placing him under mount etna now his application  thus the christian mythologists tell us their satan made war against the almighty who defeated him and confined him afterward not under a mountain but in a pit  the christian mythologists tell us no such thing they inform us he will be shut up that he should deceive the nations no more but at present they inform us that he is going about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour but mr p seems conscious of his having made a trip and therefore adds what we call a lie to mend the matter  page   the christian mythologists after having confined satan in the pit were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of their fable  the christians deny both one and the other let mr p show us in what part of either the old or new testament either one or the other is found and if he cannot find these romances let him acknowledge that he is a forger of lies yea sporting himself with his own deceivings ibid he is wonderfully pleased with his own conceit of the snake eve and the apple we have it repeatedly told and to let us know that he has learned a bit of french he tells us that the snake and eve entered into a tete a tete the issue of which was the snake persuaded her to eat an apple which damns all mankind what a thing it is to be learned but who told our author that it was an apple which eve eat or that in eating this apple she damned all mankind is not this another of our authors waking dreams  ibid he tells us a secret namely that church mythologists cannot do without satan and that they are so fond of his company they bribe him to stay with them they promised him all the jews all the turks and by anticipation ninetenths of the world beside and mahomet into the bargain after this who can doubt the bountifulness of the christian mythology  but i ask again in what part of the bible is this profane drollery written this author professes to believe our lords morality if so let him hear what he says every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment and if every idle word shall be called to an account what shall we say for a man that sits down and writes deliberate lies on purpose to ridicule the word of god and endeavors to make it of none effect  what he says of satans omnipresence page   is of apiece with the rest after his fall according to their account that is the christians he became omnipresent he exists every where at the same time he occupies the whole immensity of space now where is this written in what book or chapter or verse of the bible is this horrible lie written the christian has great cause to believe that satan and his hellish associates are so numerous as to tempt mankind in whatever quarter of the globe they may inhabit  ibid not content with the deification of satan they represent him as defeating by stratagem in the shape of an animal of the creation all the power and wisdom of the almighty this is another falsehood they do no such thing in what part of the bible is this falsehood written satan is called by an horrible sublime title the god of this world because he is obeyed by the men of this world but that is not making him superior to the almighty ibid there are also many who bave heen so enthusiastically enraptured by what they conceived to be the infinite love of god to man that it has deterred them from examining into the absurdity and profaneness of the story  part of this is a glorious truth there have been many and i hope there will be more who have been sweetly enraptured with the love of god to men yea to themselves feeling his love shed abroad in their hearts but it has not deterred them from examining into the nature and ground of this love and they could see neither absurdity nor profaneness in the glorious mystery mr p is a stranger to this love and therefore is a very incompetent judge in the matter he speaks highly of the great sir isaac newton i will venture to relate an anecdote concerning him being in company with a brother philosopher one of mr ps creed for he has a creed and the gentleman was treating revelation as mr p does the christian philosopher took the gentleman up short dr h said he when you speak of astronomy i love to hear you because i know you understand it but as to christianity i know what that is and i am certain that you know nothing of the matter christianity has had much sharper sighted enemies to contend with than even mr p who have thought it worth their while to treat the subject seriously mr p has added nothing to their discoveries except his profane levity the real christian is so far from being deterred from examining into the nature and grounds of christianity that he does it daily yea and into his own experience also and he finds neither profaneness nor absurdity therein he now comes to what he calls his examination of the authenticity of the books which compose the old and new testament  page    the church mythologists as he calls them decided by vote which of the books out of the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not they rejected several they voted others to be doubtful such as the books called the apocrypha and those books which had the majority of votes were voted to be the word of god  is this reasoning is this buffoonery to pass for proof here we have nothing but our masters ipse dixit indeed he tells us a few lines further that he has been forging a story without book for he says who the people were that did all this that is that thus voted we know nothing of they called themselves by the name of the church and this is all we know of the matter now let mr p bring such an evidence as this into a court of justice first barefacedly to aver a thing and then in the very next sentence declare that he knows nothing of the matter let him go into the american congress or into the conventions at paris and bring such an evidence and would not the former honor him with the tail of a cart and flog him through the streets and would not the latter make a quicker dispatch at the guillottine he next endeavors in his way to pun upon the word revelation intimating that we need no revelation to tell us that sampson ran away with the gates or visited dalilah or caught his foxes such things have no need of revelation who says they have we ought to feel shame in calling such paltry stories the word of god  the matter in the case of sampson is simply this the almighty raised him up and gave him power sufficient to have delivered his countrymen from the oppression of the philistines he through giving way to his passions failed in a great degree was unfaithful to what was committed unto him that we might know this we are made acquainted with several private transactions in his life and in the narration the circumstances of his taking the gates of gaza the foxes etc are brought in and might be delivered by a credible witness and what is there in the whole which is so paltry various other things of a similar nature occur in the history of the bible which in themselves are of no very great moment and yet in narration may be necessary all which this author objects to the historical part of the bible may be objected to the most approved history that was ever written yea and every history may be represented in a most ridiculous light by a disingenuous witling taking detached fragments from it and holding them up as an object of scorn and ridicule but is such a conduct honest nay i say again it is like herod and his men of war arraying our lord in mock royalty and making a derision of him  our author next tries his talent of ridicule upon the mosaic account of the creation page    it begins abruptly it is nobody that speaks it is nobody that hears it is addressed to nobody however if it is nobody that speaks it is somebody that writes and many persons read even mr p himself it seems and it is addressed to the whole world perhaps one might say the author did wisely in concealing his name or mr p would have thrown a squib at him but have not some of the most celebrated authors begun full as abruptly does not homer begin his iliad and virgil his eneid abruptly does not caesar begin his commentaries abruptly did any one ever find fault with them for it the first chapter in genesis is a noble sublime yet concise history of the creation and has been justly admired by many of the literati of the first magnitude and will be read with veneration and esteem when mr p and his buffoonery are quite forgotten he doubts very much or rather seems confident that the books ascribed to moses were none of his but as he offers no other proof than that moses not being an israelite and the jews honored him in ascribing them to him he did not choose to contradict the tradition page    but who told mr p that moses was not an israelite we have his pedigree up to jacob or israel exodus vi        nor can we suppose that moses thought it such a vile obscene legend as our author represents it if he was only willing to pass for its author for such he represents the historical part of the bible  whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize men and for my own part i sincerely detest it as i detest every thing that is cruel that mr p detests the bible there is no doubt but it may be no worse for that as for the obscene stories voluptuous debaucheries and cruel and torturous executions etc that is what we find in all histories even in that of england an historian must give a true narrative such is the case with the sacred historians they are impartial not concealing the faults of their own nation nor even their own faults had the history of the bible been otherwise we should have great cause to doubt its authenticity as to his drollery concerning the israelites being worldmakers etc it is a gross misrepresentation moses does not set up for a worldmaker but he tells who made the world and how he made it god spoke and it was done he said let there be light and there was light this is the plain matter of fact and what absurdity is there in it in short bible history is a true history it corresponds with its doctrines and both are confirmed by woeful experience  whoever writes the revolution in france must he not exhibit a dreadful scene of murder and cruelty if he writes what was before the revolution must he not describe many very many voluptuous debaucheries and cruel and torturous executions far more than are found in the bible history but must the historian be to blame for that our authors doctrine is well calculated to promote voluptuous debaucheries and what men of that stamp will heartily receive and what will suit this age of voluptuous debaucheries which our wise author has found out to be the age of reason  page    our author allows the book of job has a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power and benignity of the almighty it would have been well if he had imitated it but it seems that book stands on no higher rank than many other compositions on similar subjects as well before as since that time magister decit again but can he tell us what compositions were written before the book of job has this bold assertor seen any if he has why does he not tell us the names of the authors if he cannot what sort of credit is to be given to him  we are now entertained with a long dissertation upon prophesying and are told the jewish prophets were a sort of itinerant preachers and if i understand his meaning a sort of balladsingers and mixed poetry anecdote and devotion together and after a good deal of burlesque in the same strain we are told the word prophet means the art of making poetry and as he must be jack of all trades has given us a specimen of his own skill in prophesying and is bold enough to tell us there is not a word in all the bible that describes to us what we call a poet and yet the jewish prophets were nothing else but poets the man that can make such jargon hang together has my full consent but mr p is mistaken there are words in the book which we call the bible which signify poets and poetry the word    samuel xxiii   signifies a poet and the word  signifies song poem or poetry and so the word  has the same meaning nor do any of these words signify a prophet or prophecy to confirm his assertion he tells us that deborah and barak are called prophets they are not deborah is called  judges iv   a woman prophetess but barak is no where either styled prophet or prophetess  page    but it seems abraham isaac and jacob are not called prophets why because they could not sing or play music or make poetry but mr p can make poetry of course he is a greater man than abraham isaac or jacob yea and he can write lies too for abraham is called  genesis xx    the word and the only word as far as i can remember that is ever rendered prophet and if mr p will learn a little hebrew he will find jacob to have been no bad poet if he will read xlixth of genesis jonas is called a prophet but his message to the ninevites is not delivered in poetry elijah and elisha are called prophets and we read of no singing or poetry performed by them nay it is most likely the latter could not play for we read that he called for a minstrel and when the minstrel played the hand of the lord was upon him   kings iii     i think our lord intimates luke xiii    as if abraham isaac and jacob were all prophets the matter is the word prophet is used in a general sense in our language for praising god or preaching but the word  always means foretelling future events and if its original meaning has been mistaken it has been so by such commentators as mr p his drollery concerning the greater and lesser prophets scarcely deserves a serious answer their being called greater or less is simply on account of the length and shortness of their prophecies it may not be amiss to look back to his note page    there is a misrepresentation both in his text and note in his text he says  an evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied hence he would make us believe that readiness prophesying was in consequence of an evil spirit from god coming upon him whereas it is not in that place said that an evil spirit from god came upon him but rather a good spirit came upon him he came to that place with an intention to kill david and perhaps all who were with him but when the spirit from god came upon him he was for the present changed and joined in the solemn worship of god   samuel xix       in his note he says as these men who call themselves divines and commentators are very fond of puzzling one another i leave them to contest the meaning of the first part of the phrase that of an evil spirit of god i keep to my text i think you do not i think there is a difference between an evil spirit from god and an evil spirit of god the former is found but not in the connection in which you put it but i believe you will be hard set to find the latter viz an evil spirit of god in all the bible the places where it is said an evil spirit from god came upon saul are   samuel xvi       and chap xviii  0 if we understand the words  rendered evil spirit to signify an evil agent it only signifies that evil spirits are ever ready to execute gods righteous judgments upon obstinate sinners or sometimes permits them to try his saints job   first chap   cor xii     kings xxii       luke xxii     in short though the english word prophet sometimes signifies to preach or praise god yet the word  is the proper word for prophet and the word  is the proper word for prophesying and i believe their strict and proper sense is predicting future events and if any one will be at the pains of reading bishop newton on the prophecies he will see how exactly the prophecies and their accomplishment tally and thereby is the truth of prophecy confirmed in spite of all that this profane railler or any of his sort can say and had he read his bible with reverence and care he would have found something in it besides a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales he would have found the noblest thoughts delivered in the most sublime language such as neither voltaire nor his pupil the author of the age of reason will ever be masters of he would have found the best philosophy and soundest morality even the words of eternal life having made the old testament as ridiculous as herod made our savior he goes on to try his talent in lampooning the new  thus much for the bible i go on now to the book called the new testament the new testament that is the new will as if there could be two wills of the creator page    it is called the new testament because it has been given since the old and because the dispensation or outward mode in many things is changed the types are fulfilled and therefore cease he of whom moses and the prophets did testify is come and put away sin by the sacrifice of himself all this is no new will or change in the deity but a blessed fulfillment of his own gracious designs to the ruined children of men hence there is no new religion religion is invariably the same from the beginning on that account our blessed savior had no need to write or procure to be written any thing for he was the grand fulfiller of types and prophecies seeing it was to him that all the prophets gave witness  page    the four first books called matthew mark luke and john do not give the history of the life of jesus christ they give as much as is necessary and much more than mr p believes it appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months well and what of that then he did much in a little time however it appears from these books that from the time of his baptism the time he began his public ministry to the time of his death was three years  page    mr p is still acting the herod moses was a foundling jesus christ was born in a stable and mahomet was a muledriver well and how then must his great condescension be turned into ridicule is it not prophesied of him that he should be despised and rejected of men and is not mr p making it good the whole of this page is a scurrilous attempt to degrade the lord of life and glory  ibid the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die and did not christ himself tell us so and mr pain says he taught the purest morality did he not say the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life for many the manner of his death is an objection in our wise authors way page    would it not have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the smallpox of old age or any thing else  a fever would have done as well as the cross if there were any occasion for either nay it would not because it was foretold that he should die the death of the cross psalm xxii       zech xii  0 our lord himself frequently told his disciples what manner of death he should die had our blessed lord died of a fever smallpox or old age our author would have been witty indeed but every circumstance in his death even to minuteness is so exactly marked that our witling must needs seek for something else to act the droll upon  page    st paul is a quibbler why so because he makes two adams nay not he so far from making two adams he never made one in his life he indeed speaks of two adams one whose sin brought death into the world and all our woe and of another whom by an accommodation as a public head he calls adam and by whom life and immortality are brought to light the quibble in the same page upon the word death or die is not worth a serious answer  page    revelation is out of the question with respect to those books not only because of the disagreement of the writers but because revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the persons who saw them done if the persons saw them done then were they real facts and that is sufficient to our purpose and such things as they relate the life and miracles of christ his death and resurrection and ascension are far from being paltry and contemptible tales as for the disagreement of the writers it is so small and the things in which they differ so trivial that it affects not the merits of the cause at all if it did we should have heard of it in the age of reason the difference is little more than relating the same things in different words several persons have written the life of the late king of prussia and have said the same things in different words and some have added circumstances which others have omitted it is indeed a lamentable truth that what is called christianity has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imitation of a person whose life was humility and poverty but then the book which mr p vilifies with such boldness has nothing to do in the matter at all nor has it any thing to do with the old stories which he speaks of the author of true christianity says learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart he that will be greatest among you let him become least of all and servant of all and that quibbler st paul as our author calls him says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  as to the invention of purgatory releasing souls from thence by prayers selling of pardons dispensations and indulgences etc the true christian thinks as meanly of them as our author can but denies their origin to be from the crucifixion or as our author words it the paroxysms of the crucifixion therefore all the cant expressions of manufacturing fabricating etc have no existence except in the authors manufacturing and fabricating brain st paul says there is one god and one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus a glorious truth which will stand when mr p and his age of reason are totally forgotten it is an eternal truth that god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son that whosoever believes in him might not perish but have eternal life a truth as full of wisdom as mr ps book is of folly it is perfectly consistent with the wisdom the justice and sovereignty of god and what worm of the earth has any right to say to infinite wisdom what do thou christ freely laid down his life he freely laid it down and he freely resumed it again and must this glorious instance of love which astonishes heaven confounds hell and gives life to the ruined sinner be the subject of low wit idle drollery and a subject for a set of poor drunkards to swear and laugh over at an alehouse if our author would set up for a wise man would he not wait till he understands a subject before he attempts to play the buffoon over it that christ died for my sins and that he ever lives to make intercession for me constitutes the ground of all my hope and i am sure if properly received will produce the purest morality in the universe it will produce pure love to god and man it will teach men to do justly love mercy and to walk humbly with god he the christian does not go cringing to intermediate beings no he comes boldly to the throne of grace that he may obtain mercy and find grace to help him in time of need nor does he despise reason though he does not think it the choicest gift of god the gift of christ is the choicest gift but still the christian believes every thing pertaining to the essential worship of the deity to be reasonable it is reasonable that i should allow my creator to be wiser than myself and that his providence far excels my capacity and that he is not obliged to account to any of his creatures for his proceedings although they should be above their comprehension it is reasonable that i should love him and abstain from those things which i know are displeasing to him as i am a poor weak and ignorant sinner it is reasonable that i should ask of him wisdom pardon and strength seeing he gives liberally to all and upbraideth none nor is this directing the almighty page    he finds great fault with a poor creature making his application thus to the divine creator he that is man takes on himself to direct the almighty what to do even in the government of the universe how so when it is sunshine he prays for rain and when it is rain he prays for sunshine what is the amount of all his prayers but to make the almighty change his mind and act otherwise than he does how vile is all this what a vile burlesque upon every part of positive worship does this gentleman believe there is any such being as the almighty it is true he says he does but we have only his own word for it he owns our lord taught the purest morality and one part of his teaching was how we should pray and has been pleased to give us a divine platform of prayer yea has taught us by a striking parable to pray and not to faint luke xviii   in a time of great drought may we not ask the blessing of rain in the time of long rain may we not ask the blessing of sunshine that the almighty may give us the appointed weeks of harvest we do not live in an age in which men are righteous over much or are over eager of prayer  page    he must have another attack upon revelation the word of god is the creation we behold not so that is the work of god and the believer sees as much of the wisdom and goodness of the deity in the creation as mr p or any other infidel as to his paltry criticism of jesus christ being sent to publish gladtidings from one end of the earth to the other and the earth be round and has no end it is not worth a serious answer certain modes of speech are ever allowed which are not strictly philosophical when eyes and hands are attributed to the deity we know it is not strictly philosophical but would any but a snarling cynic take any advantage from thence so that our critic might have saved his genteel flourish of the worlds savior believing the world to be flat like a trencher etc the phrase from one end of the earth to the other is a common idiom of speech to signify the greatest distance so the rising and setting sun is a common phrase though we know as well as mr p can tell us that the sun neither rises nor sets yet it is said to rise at such an hour and set at such an hour even in our almanacks why does not mr p witicise upon them  ibid but how was jesus christ to make any thing known to all nations he could but speak one language which was hebrew how do you prove that we poor idiots believe that he knew the very thoughts of mens hearts and if so he knew and still knows their words when they speak let the language be what it will all that mr p or any body else can speak of creation as the work of god we firmly believe we see and admire his power and providence in the same but although our author avers jesus christ taught the purest morality yet he ventures to contradict him our lord says search the scriptures  page    do we want to know what god is search not the book called the scriptures but the scriptures called the creation is not this daring but where is creation called scripture  ibid the only idea man can affix to the name of god is that of a first cause the cause of all things the idea that a christian affixes to the name jehovah the incommunicable name of the deity is he that was and is and shall be for ever that he is gracious merciful longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth moreover we have an idea that he is holy and just and will reward every man according to his works  page    how is it that those people pretend to reject reason what people not the real christian as has been proved above he is the only person that lives agreeable to reason mr ps disciples are not living agreeable to reason many of these are spending the lords day in drinking what should support their families and pay their debts and laughing the poor christian to scorn who is answering the end of his creation  our author can recollect only some chapters in job and the   th psalm which convey to us any idea of god in the book called the bible and how can we help that he should read better i am glad he is so pleased with the   th psalm and with mr addisons version of that beautiful psalm i assure him i highly admire them both and as mr p has read mr addisons poetical works has he never read his evidences of christianity if he has not is he excusable and if he has ought he not to have answered some of his arguments moreover in the above psalm there are some other things besides the works of creation spoken of in the highest terms of respect and veneration i read with delight what follows the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey or the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward such is the charming account which the psalmist gives of that blessed book which our author treats with such unparalleled contempt  page    i cannot recollect a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men called apostles that conveys any idea of what god is can you not more shame to you it seems you have read them very poorly then give me leave to help you god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwells not in temples made with hands he gives to all life and breath and all things and has made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitations for what end has he thus done that men should seek the lord if happily they may feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us acts xvii        does this passage convey no idea of what god is i think it does as far as language is capable of conveying i will point our candid author to another passage for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead romans i  0 does this passage give us no idea of what god is yes i think as much as our authors eighteenpenny book does ibid the christian system of faith appears to me as a species of atheism that is a plain proof to me that you have it not or it would appear to you the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen  the christian religion is no opaque body no irreligious eclipse no it is light in the lord and confirms and gives honor to every divine attribute nor is it an enemy to any of gods works or the study of them for the works of god are great and sought out by such as have pleasure in him  page    it is the fraud of the christian system to call the sciences human inventions where does the christian system call the sciences human inventions the apostle speaks of vain philosophy and science falsely so called but in all the sacred writings there is not one word against true science  page    we may give mr p credit for all he says respecting his knowledge of the triangle the lever and its weights tangents secants etc seeing they are nothing to the purpose only our author has a mind to flourish a little  page    as the christian system has made a revolution in theology so also has it made a revolution in the state of learning where is the proof of this bold assertion one fault this writer has is that he generally speaks without book  nor is he very consistent in his remarks upon learning languages he tell us ibid almost all the scientific learning that now exists came to us from the greeks or the people who spoke the greek language and yet he tells us the languages are become useless and the time of teaching them is wasted let them make sense of this who can nor do i see what it has to do with christianity but our author soon turns from this grave subject of languages etc to his merry conceit of eve the snake and the apple page    which diverts him wonderfully and so does the amphibious idea of a mangod etc we have in england a set of practitioners whom we call mountebanks each of these is furnished with an agent whom we indifferently term the fool merryandrew pickledherring and the like this genius cuts a grotesque figure suited to the part he is to act his business is to make the crowd laugh partly by making wry faces odd postures and abundance of loggerly wit turning every thing he takes in hand into buffoonery and ridicule this is exactly the case with mr p and one would almost imagine the infidels in paris had engaged him for some such purpose as the english quack engages his merryandrew his talent seems to be of that kind and is well calculated to set the halfthinking rabble a laughing very loudly his devil in the pit and eve snake and the apple are admirable strokes of eloquence and will unexceptionably supply the place of a fiddler in the smokey alehouse now what subject is there that a man of this cast may not turn into sneer and contempt such jargon passes for reasoning with such readers as will be diverted with our comic author but would it not be well for him to spare his creator and let religion alone till he has learned to know what it is let the potsherds strive with the potsherds but let not an ignorant worm of the earth turn witling upon his maker but we must trace him a little further  page    the setterup therefore and the advocates of the christian system of faith could not but foresee that the continual progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of science of the power and wisdom of god manifested in the structure of the universe and in all the works of creation would militate against and call in question the truth of their system of faith and therefore it became necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project might not one from hence conclude that all the advocates for christianity were a set of illiterate idiots did such men as bacon milton newton boil lock and multitudes besides cut down science to a less size were not all these advocates for the christian system of faith who then were the advocates for the christian system who were for cutting down science till our author has produced his proofs must he not stand on record as an infamous slanderer  his earth and flat trencher are diverting inventions too page    and he must hang these upon christianity as the merryandrew puts on his patched coat but can he produce one christian author that ever asserted that the earth was like a flat trencher did not the above named authors know the structure of the world as well as mr p could tell them nay if mr p has any knowledge of the matter did he not gain it from some of those advocates for the christian system  page    latter times have laid all the blame upon the goths and vandals but however unwilling the partisans of the christian system may be to believe or acknowledge it it is nevertheless true that the age of ignorance commenced with the christian system this gentleman continually forgets one thing that dogmatical assertions are no proofs let him prove that the age of ignorance commenced with the christian system or if he cannot prove it let him stand confessed a vile slanderer  it is well known that the augustan age was remarkable for its learning and that was the time in which our savior appeared learning flourished for several centuries and several of the christian fathers as origin tertullian chrysostum etc were men of considerable learning learning continued to flourish till the empire was broken to pieces and then true christianity sunk into superstition from which it is not yet fully recovered  mr ps pedigree of gods in his note page    has nothing to do with either revealed or practical christianity if revealed religion has been made a handle for that purpose it only shows that any good thing is capable of abuse if some have been so stupid as to adore the sun and moon the fault was not in those luminaries but in the blind and depraved minds of those idolators very likely they might be originally of mr ps creed would admit of no other revelation than that of creation and so become vain in their imaginations and thereby mistook the copy for the original the native tendency of our authors sentiments and will lead its devotees to positive idolatry or to materialism this shows the necessity of a revelation well authenticated that poor blind mortals may not mistake the effect for the cause it appears a doubt with me notwithstanding the contempt which our author affects to cast on the first chapter of genesis whether he would not have stuck fast in the creation if he had never read that chapter it does not appear that he would have had sagacity enough to have found out the creator at present he seems far from being very clear if there is any deity which he adores it is himself and his fancied reason  page    it is an inconsistency scarcely possible to be credited that any thing should exist under the name of a religion that held it irreligious to study and contemplate the structure of the universe that god had made very true but who are they that did so not the prophets not jesus christ mr p himself being judge page    not the apostles not even excepting that quibbling paul our author speaks of as he may see acts xvii romans i not any christian philosopher or divine the persecutors of galileo and vigilius were no more christians than mr p himself is i have already mentioned several excellent christian philosophers who studied and wrote in defense of christianity yet studied the structure of the universe as much and to as good purpose as ever our author did christianity is in no respect hostile to the works of creation we do not make void the handiwork of god in the creation through faith no we establish it  page    we are obliged to mr p for the history which he gives us of himself it may be all true for any thing i know only it has little connection with the subject in hand save the story of the sermon which he heard when he was about seven or eight years of age upon redemption by the death of the son of god and his reflections thereon in the garden it seems he then thought as a child he reasoned as a child and now when he is become a man yea an old man and should have put away childish things he speaks and writes as a child still must mr p pick up a few trite threadbare expressions and so string them together in order that he may make religion look ridiculous and frightful to us no it is only imitating the rude soldiers who spit in the lovely face of our ever adorable redeemer  page    any system of religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system why do not you prove it punishment for crimes either in this or another world may shock a child nevertheless is true  ibid the christian mythology has five deities there is god the father god the son god the holy ghost the god providence and the goddess nature in what part of the scriptures is this blasphemy written if it is the christian mythology it must be found in the new testament but where is mr p acting the fool or the knave here how far his system quadrates with that of the quakers i cannot tell there are sensible men among them who can answer for themselves  page  0 our author was informing us upon a full stretch concerning his progress in philosophy but the merry conceit of the snake eve and the apple has such an attraction that like an overpowering vortex its force is irresistible but why should that lively story directly lead him to banter upon the death of the son of god does he take delight in crucifying him afresh and again put him to open shame  all he says for several pages respecting the form of the earth its magnitude the sun the planets and stars etc has nothing new in it nor inconsitstent with the redemption of the world by our lord jesus christ  page    from whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the almighty who had millions of worlds equally dependent upon his protection should quit the care of all the rest and come to die in our world because they say one man and one woman had eaten an apple but who have raised that solitary and strange conceit of the almighty quitting the care of all other worlds etc it is not in any part of the bible the doctrine of the bible runs thus the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i fly from thy presence if i ascend up to heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there are mr paines boasted notions of the deity sunk so low as to shrivel him into a mere local existence that while he is taking care of one place he must abandon another is such a notion to the honor or consistent with the attribute of omnipresence how different is the doctrine of him who mr p says taught the purest morality who says where two or three are met in my name i am in the midst of them  ibid here again we have the merry tale of the snake eve and the apple perhaps one might ask without offense who informed mr p that it was an apple which eve ate  as to the state of other worlds we have nothing to do with them we believe the almighty is the moral governor of all his rational creatures in all worlds before we aspire to know what is doing in other worlds we should learn more of the state of this in which we live yea i might say the smallest and most ostensible part of it i could ask even mr p with all his boast of science more questions concerning a fly a mite yea a grain of sand than he will be capable of answering me as long as he lives it is and has been by losing sight of christianity that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith and of religion have been fabrited and set up and thereby many have turned scepcs deists materialists and infidels  page    it is with a pious fraud as with a bad acon it begets a calamitous necessity of going on very inventor of fraud or imposture has some hope of rofit or honor before him now which of these ould either christ or his apostles propose to themselves or any of the primitive christians during the hree first centuries it was when the church was llen from christianity that it became a persecutor f either the sciences or such as were pious  ibid our author has found out three principal means which have been employed to impose upon all mankind in all ages and perhaps in all countries mystery miracle and prophecy the first of these he answers himself every thing we behold is a mystery to us our own existence is a mystery the whole vegetable world is a mystery to us very well and will not this apply to religion most certainly  page    the fact however as distinct from the operating cause is not a mystery because we see it the very same is the case in religion it is the operating cause that is the mystery real christianity is as visible as the stately oak or the corn that grows i may say that vegetation is as great a mystery to a greenlander who has never been out of his ice and snow as christianity is to mr p all the lovely verdure and fragrance in the vernal creation is incredible to the former so is the spirit and life of real religion to the latter must i deny the beauties of pring because a poor greenlander or wild laplander takes it into his head to laugh them to scorn mr p will say no and must i call in question the word of god because mr p cannot see into the truth of it and because he has taken it into his head to ridicule it suppose mr p had engaged a poor ignorant indian who had never heard tell of either reading or writing supposing he writes a letter and sends this savage ten or twenty miles with it and he finds this letter has given mr ps correspondent all due information respecting its contents must not the whole of this writing be very mysterious to poor lury and as mr p has signified that the devil has imps page    might not the poor fellow be tempted to think his master had wrapped up one of the imps in the paper which he carried which could give such accurate information all  perfect mystery to him thus the whole of what  mysterious is such to us because we are ignorant of the wisdom and power of the divine operations tell a inhabitant of the torrid zone who has never heard te of frost that in our country the surface of the water  sometimes so hard that people can walk over river yea that horses and carriages can go over and that the surface of the water is as hard as a rock and wha would he think let him have a little of mr p mercury in his head and he will treat you as mr p does christianity and as he does the circumstance  the fish swallowing jonas therefore all his flourishe of fog lingo legerdemain his ghosts and specter a paris his trite phrases of fabricating manufacturing his merry conceits of the snake eve and the apple h wonderful inversion of the story of jonah swallowin the whale and his more daring mockery of the redemption of the world by the death and passion of ou ever adorable immanuel all proceed from one source however unwilling our author may be to think so tha is his own ignorance  but he really says and unsays page    what is t be understood by a miracle in the same sense that every thing is said to be a mystery so also it may be sai to be a miracle the elephant though larger is not greater miracle than a mite nor a mountain a greate miracle than an atom to an almighty power it is n more difficult to make one than the other and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than one it is miracle when compared to our power and comprehension it is not a miracle when compared to the power that performs it recte domine and why does not th satisfy mr p why must he in drollery unsay all th again a miracle is therefore something beyond ou comprehension and that such things have been done i firmly believe if i saw mr p cure an invetera disease by a touch or a word i should call it a miracl if i should see him feed and satisfy ten or fifteen thousand people with as much provision as a lad cou carry i should call it a miracle if i should see hi call a dead man out of his grave i should call it a miracle pretended miracles are no objections against real ones any more than counterfeit coin is to that which is sterling our saviors miracles were miracles of mercy and were performed in the presence of multitudes the times places and circumstances are all so clearly marked out that if they had been mere jugglements or false reports they would have been detected and long since exposed to derision and scorn  page    as to the case of jonah the miracle does not consist in the fish swallowing him for that was no miracle at all the miracle was in his being preserved alive in the belly of the fish nor was there any necessity for the fish to carry jonah to nineveh as our author wildly speaks the people repented through the preaching of jonah without such a miracle and whether our author will believe that christ repeated the circumstance of jonah or no it is of no consequence to mankind seeing the truth does not depend upon his faith in that matter it will be believed when mr p and his drollery will be forgotten but he must bring in a very witty parenthesis the most extraordinary of all things related in the new testament is that of the devil flying with jesus christ and showing him all the kingdoms of the world how happened it that he did not show him america where is it written in the new testament that the devil did fly away with him and how know you that he did not show him america  ibid mr p thinks miracles unnecessary the almighty thinks otherwise yea and mr p thinks so too at times as we have seen above and so he repeats it again with his long bow of a thousand years  page    it has been shown in a former part of this work that the original meaning of the word prophet and prophesying has been changed and that a prophet in the sense the word is now used is a creature of a modern invention and it has been shown in a former part of this answer that that is a mistake a wrong representation and a creature of mr ps imagination nor is it of a very modern date seeing abraham is called  a prophet though mr p informs us he could neither play nor make verses  ibid every thing unintelligible was prophetical and every thing insignificant was typical should not this bold assertion have had some proof after so much said against superstition and credulity one would have thought that mr p should have marked all his way with undeniable evidence instead of that he has metamorphosed himself into a pope and boldly contradicts both god and man giving out his own dogmas for infallible demonstrations and confidently asserts concerning ages that are past that a blunder would have served them for a prophecy and a dishclout for a type smartly said is not this elegant hark how his disciples in the alehouse roar out the loggerdly laugh is this the man that ventures to contradict revelation and make into mere idiots some of the greatest ornaments for literature that this or any other age ever produced all must bow down to what mr p has got the confidence to affirm  page    if there were such men that is prophets it is consistent to believe that the event so communicated would be told in terms that could be understood and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to be out of the comprehension of those that heard it and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterward  yet all things called prophecies in the book called the bible come under this description  in what manner must our casuist have read the bible was he awake or were his eyes open to say nothing of the difference of language that is of translating one language into another and the impropriety of plainly saying what related to princes and states while existing and the eastern manner of speaking much in the parabolical way i say considering these things it is astonishing to me how clear and express many of the prophecies are to enumerate these would swell this pamphlet beyond all due bounds nor is there any necessity it is done read rollin prideaux newton and various others on that subject and they will see how exactly the prophecies and their accomplishment correspond insomuch that some cavillers have asserted that those prophecies were made after the events happened they fitted so exactly however i will point out two or three just to give the reader a taste wishing him to read the above authors who have written expressly upon the subject i will not touch upon those prophecies which relate to our savior but only such as relate to the downfall of nations how clearly is the return of the israelites spoken of from the babylonish captivity and their very deliverer expressed by name compare isaiah xlv       verses with ezra i and jer xxxii    chap li        can language be plainer now the prophet isaiah lived near two hundred years before his prediction was fulfilled and jeremiah was dead a considerable time before the event happened to instance in the case of the destruction of babylon take the following description babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch his tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces isa xiii        i think words cannot well be plainer and that they are true our late travelers testify nor is there any thing equivocal in them they are not applicable to any other circumstance not even to the destruction of jerusalem  let us next see what the prophets say concerning tyrus at that time the pride of nations see her wealth and grandeur described ezekiel chapters xxvii and xxviii and what is the result of all this pomp of riches mark she had been a scoffer at gods people like mr p therefore thus says the lord god behold i am against thee o tyrus and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causes his waves to come up and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her her soil that made her elegant gardens and make her like the top of a rock it shall be a place for spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it says the lord god and it shall become a spoil to nations ezekiel xxiv      is not this language express and clear can any thing be more so and is it not verified do not travelers testify the same nebuchadnezzar made the first attack upon it and although it in some degree recovered yet alexander accomplished the prophecy in its full extent now here are two express testimonies point blank against mr ps daring assertions see likewise daniels vision of the image and his own interpretation dan ii        his vision also of the ram and the goat chapter viii need any thing be plainer  if we step forward to the new testament we shall find things as clear as an impartial reader can wish for attend to our blessed lords prophecy over jerusalem and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong to thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and shall not leave thee one stone upon another because thou knew not the time of thy visitation luke xix        thus speaks that blessed savior of sinners whom mr p has treated with such sneering contempt and as for the fulfillment i refer my reader to josephus who has so minutely delineated the accomplishment in his history of the jewish wars and as he lived and died a jew there is little reason to think that he had any league with the christians there is another prophecy or two in the new testament which i shall take the liberty to cite and the more so because mr p himself has completely fulfilled them that quibbler paul as our modest author styles him is taking his leave of the elders of the church at ephesus and observes for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock let mr p understand also of yourselves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith i think these are terms that may be understood nor does it need any very extraordinary sagacity to see that they are very applicable in the present case there is another prophecy not hard to be understood there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation  i have now taken notice of all that is material in mr ps performance and have drawn out this pamphlet to a much greater length than i intended but i wish to make an observation or two more  the first is that mr p and all the deistical writers which i have read lie under one capital mistake which is the source of all their blunders they do not understand what christianity is they take the name for the thing and it must be confessed that too many who are called christians have led them into this fatal mistake the pomp of revenue the invention of purgatory the releasing of souls from thence by prayers of the church with money the selling of pardons dispensations and indulgences with a hundred things more which mr p might mention are all beside the mark such are selfish human inventions the shameful abuses which have crept in and are no more to be ascribed to christianity than the knavery of counterfeit coin is to be imputed to that which is sterling or the nocturnal debaucheries of the sensualist are to be imputed to the shining sun  religion or christianity is this thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself it is doing justly loving mercy and walking humbly with god our divine lawgiver says whatsoever ye would that men should do to you that do ye also for that is the sum of what is contained in the law and the prophets it is a wisdom which comes from above and is pure and peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy it is the abhorrence of that which is evil and the cleaving to that which is good it therefore no more consists in a name a sect a party or an opinion than it consists in a string of beads it has no more to do with the intrigues of worldly states or the cabals of politicians than it has with the inhabitants of saturn its blessed author declared his kingdom was not of this world and when he engaged his disciples was it with magnificent offers of either worldly wealth or honor far from it hear what he says if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me ye shall be put out of their synagogues yea the time will come when he that kills you will think that he does god service now what pomp or revenue was there in all this what temptation was there here to induce men to quibble or to manufacture quibbles or carry on fraud and imposture did not the servants of this faithful lord find every thing true i expect some of my readers will believe the testimony which they have left behind them then hear what one of them says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh   cor iv       see what the same writer says   cor       to the end see the acts of the apostles now what temptation had these men to manufacture quibbles or invent frauds and impostures i doubt if mr p must endure such a life of martyrdom for being a deist whether he would not turn christian or if he should be so treated for being a patriot whether he would not turn loyalist thus we see there is a difference between christianity and those that make profession of it and true christianity cannot with justice be charged with the faults of such as make a profession of it as to national christianity i for one think as little of it as mr p can do let popery or mahometanism or judaism be set up for national religion and it will be sure to have a large majority let any one read our english history from the year      to    0 and he will find the national religion changed four times and the whole nation a few excepted changed with it and the thousands who are now bawling for church and king would turn into the opposite strain if there were neither church nor king  the second observation i wish to make and that is the different effects that deism and real christianity have upon the lives and habits of mankind show me one instance of a poor profligate sinner being truly reformed by embracing deism the man that was under the power of drunkenness uncleanness envy malice revenge who was a bad husband parent child neighour etc and i hope mr p will not plead for such a conduct now show me one of these who has been thoroughly reformed so as to become a good husband parent son or neighbor by the principles of deism show me one sinner who has been truly changed now all thanks to a despised savior i can produce thousands who have been savingly turned from the error of their way by hearing and believing the gospel who have been brought out of darkness into gods mavelous light and multitudes have endured to their last gasp blessing god for a precious christ and for his gospel tell me where did the deist live or die who was put to death for his principles whose life was blameless and who rejoiced in his torments i have not read of one but history abounds with instances of pious christians who took joyfully the spoiling of their goods and finished their lives at a gibbet or in the flames cannot mr p find something in the torments of our dying champions to act the droll upon i can this day show mr p a considerable number of men whose talents might have raised them to eminence in the world had they turned them to secular matters and yet are devoting themselves and their time and abilities to seek after lost sinners who are enduring the cross and dispising the shame who are often very poorly accommodated even with the necessaries of life but if they are faithful to the end will have many saved souls for a crown of rejoicing in the day of the lord  the third thing i shall notice and that is there are no new arguments in mr ps age of reason only they are a kind of farrago warmed up and a little seasoning put in suitable to the folly of the age and with a little sophistry and much burlesque have tickled the fancy of many half thinkers nor has he taken any notice of the able answers which have been given to what herbert chubb wooleston hobbs hume voltaire and others of that tribe have written these have been sufficiently confuted by dr leland mr west dr campbell and various others who have produced solid arguments and not buffoonery in mr p we have nothing but misrepresentations positive assertions bare faced untruths yet delivered with all the confidence of the infallible chair the other deistical writers treat our savior and his apostles somewhat like the jewish sanhedrim but mr p treats the fountain of wisdom as herod and his men when they dressed him up as an idiot my advice to mr p is that before he tries his talent of scurrility against christianity again that he will obtain a better acquaintance with its nature and importance lest its abused author deal with him according to his folly  before i close these remarks i beg leave to notice that i avow myself no adept in politics yet if i can form any judgment of mr ps political writings they seem calculated to fill this nation with such a scene of confusion anarchy distresses and calamities as never were known since it was called britain i will not say i am right but such are my thoughts nor can i see any other tendency they have many who have espoused his political tenets are no credit to either their oracle themselves or their country several to my knowledge have got all the property they could into their hands and under a pretense of being dissatisfied with the government have decamped and left their creditors to consult their own reflections  perhaps some may say mr p could not help that very true but i know not how far such a conduct may be connected with the doctrine of the rights of man interest is a powerful motive and will catch at every shadow to draw inferences in its own favor however such are my thoughts respecting mr ps political works but as politics are not my province i should never have put pen to paper concerning mr p had he let religion alone a subject i am sure he is a stranger to and i really suspect he is no mighty adept in science though he has catched a few terms and writes with great confidence be that as it may religion is out of the question and hence the motto in the title which may be rendered let not the cobbler go beyond his last is an admonition to men not to meddle with any thing above their capacity as i think mr p a mere plagiarist in matters of science so even in his favorite scheme of deism he is only like one that keeps a ragshop he has only secondhand goods he has advanced nothing new except his profane tinsel wit or idle scurrility i apprehend every thing he has advanced in what may be called argument is prior to himself and much was advanced in the last century and beginning of this by hobbs chubb toland morgan woollaston shaftsbury bolingbroke etc and have been sufficiently answered by dr leland mr west and various others and which our author either has not read or had not good sense enough to understand or take notice of for certainly in all reason those answers should either have been refuted or submitted to and not the very doctrines which they confute brought forward again but this gentleman dashes forward affecting to treat every thing with disdain that stands in his way such is the conduct of the pope and the grand signior  as to the pomp of revenue and the terror of national establishments they are matters which i have nothing to do with i am in no danger of either one or the other nor do they affect either christianity or the new testament the purest ages of christ knew nothing of them and it would have been happy for christianity if they never had been known real christians are subject to him whose kingdom neither was nor is of this world and the less his servants have to do with the pomp of revenue and terror of human establishments the better  it is no small proof to me that the bible is the word of god in that it has had bad men for its enemies of every description who have labored with all their might to destroy it yet it never could be destroyed in the times of heathen persecution especially that of trajan both the old and new testament were eagerly sought after that they might be destroyed and if i mistake not the christians were called upon to deliver up those books at the peril of their lives and some were so intimidated that they did deliver them up but they were branded by a term of reproach traditores i e traitors  and excommunicated the turks also have exerted all their force to destroy the bible so that no one durst be known to have that hated book in their dominions likewise the papists have made every effort that cruelty and craft could devise to banish that detested book and not being able they have found out a way of setting it aside by substituting the legends of their church the decrees of their councils instead of the word of god thus we find heathens turks and papists however they disagree in other respects they can agree in this to become a triple alliance in attempting to make the word of god of none effect the deist in this respect joins them the heathen have their fables the turks their koran and the papists their infallible decrees and the deists spike up their inch of reason as one expresses it upon the point of philosophic wit called argument and the whole tribe wrangle themselves into infidels  wellread persons will never be hurt by any thing that mr p has written or is capable of writing they know all and much more than he is capable of telling them and i am inclined to think no sensible wellread deist will thank him for his labor he has not added one idea to their creed only mere stale repetitions hence i compare him to the shopkeeper in ragfair he only deals in old cast articles his admirers are only of the small craft the little witlings of the day it is not the man of reason but the buffoon that is admired not the doctor nor his medicines but the merryandrew and the danger lies in the simple and unwary being hurt who have not time nor perhaps abilities to investigate the futility or see through the empty drollery and profane ridicule which make up the principal part of those vain pamphlets and had i been sure they would not have fallen into the hands of such i should not have troubled myself about them but i have met with several who seemed half staggered some who had just escaped the pollution that is in the world who were beginning to live like rationals who desire to do justly love mercy and walk humbly with god and for their sakes i have attempted to put this antidote into their hands not being willing that a stumbling block should be put before the blind or the lame turned out of the way i wish such honest sincere souls to keep near the god of their salvation and all the folly of men called wit can never hurt them through the preaching of the despised cross of christ many very many are become new creatures old things are passed away and all things are become new they find to their unspeakable comfort that godliness is profitable to all things their families also feel the comfort of this blessed change by enjoying the fruit of their honest labor by which they have the comfortable necessaries of life which before they had not did deism ever make such a change in men where are they show us the men i agree with mr p that our savior taught the purest morality and i think sound philosophy and he says the tree is known by its fruits i see the fruits of deism are scorn ridicule infidelity dishonesty revelling drunkenness chambering wantonness on the other hand i see the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace gentleness goodness meekness fidelity and sincerity and truth  perhaps some will object that there are many called christians who bear no such marks very true but such do not make the bible their rule therefore the bible is not in the fault nay there the misfortune lies they treat the bible in the same manner mr p does they either neglect it or misunderstand it they do not walk by that sacred rule they walk after the flesh and only pursue the same it is matter of lamentation that it is so and mr ps very injudicious writings are calculated to lull them asleep in the state they are in  but let the followers of jesus look to their blessed example so shall they go from faith to faith and from conquering to conquer till at last they sing aloud nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us  finis just as i had finished this pamphlet i saw three sermons published by j auchincloss d d which so entirely meet my sentiments for the most part that he has actually forestalled some things which i had written upon the very same text his marginal remarks upon pain are pertinent and so coincident with my own thoughts that we have almost hit upon the same words i have not the pleasure of knowing dr auchincloss not hearing of his name before but i wish him success in every attack against infidelity  published by t tailor the history of the waldenses and albigenses price two shillings and sixpence sewed  and shortly will be published an answer to the second part of mr paines age of reason price sixpence
