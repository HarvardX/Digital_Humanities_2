the athenaid a poem  vol iii  the athenaid a poem  by the author of leonidas  vol iii  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxvii  the athenaid book the twentyfirst sevn days were past when lamachus appeared before mardonius mighty chief he said i hasted to themistocles and spoke thy friendly words his answer first implied no more than cold acceptance of the terms for mindarus at length two hundred prime of all his numerous captives he released his minister sicinus in the ship which landed me detains them near the port till haliartus and the promised gold are lodged on board themistocles himself was bound to athens with his menial train his wife and race we parted on the shore to me repeating in a whispered tone thy proffers large he scornful thus replied the spoils of asia will exceed her gifts then loud thy brave defiance i pronounced he with redoubled arrogance thus brief rouse thy new master else the plains of thebes i may attain before him fired with rage mardonious here if athens do not send by alexanders mouth submission low she shall become the spoil of asian flames themistocles spectator of the blaze be swift yon greek for mindarus exchange two hundred talents promised shall be paid these ransomed warriors i appoint my guard brave mindarus their captain stern he ends in open fight the athenian to confront magnanimous he burns his heated soul yields to delusion of that subtle chief wise like the serpent gliding through a brake when his empoisond jaws in silence steal on some incautious woodman who on toil intent exerts his brawny strength nor deems a foe is nigh nor hears him nor perceives till sore the deathinflicting wound he feels a summons swift for embarkation flies to haliartus with regret he leaves dear friends but dearer his acanthes love more prevalent his constant zeal for greece combine to sooth his pain they wing his speed to good sicinus who the ransomed train discharging toward euboea steers the keel with persian treasure fraught the evening closed when by a hasty mandate to the son of gobryas lamachus was called the chief in perturbation of indignant wrath was striding over the carpet which bespread his rich pavilions floor his words were these the macedonian king is just arrived from athens i have seen him do thou know that supercilious populace has spurned my condescension menaced even a prince their host for proffring kindness in my name such my reward to all the ionian greeks the seed of athens i when victor left their democratic rule and laws unchanged but i will cut all freedom by the roots from mans ungrateful race the wily greek insinuating framed this brief reply perhaps the name of xerxes may offend the athenian tribes might europe once behold the son of gobryas throned then ha proceed mardonius answered lamachus again does not all egypt does not libyas clime with asia vast afford redundant sway to gratify one monarch first of men why may not thrace with macedonias realm thessalia greece whatever thy mighty arm shall rend by conquest from the western world become thy prize they willing might accept a sovereign like mardonius try their choice away  mardonius spoke and frowning bade the greek retire now left alone he mused thus questioning his heart aspiring thoughts do ye awaken at the cozning touch of this vile tempter honor while my ear detests the adviser fortify my breast against the advice  enough  more swiftly drive dull night thy sooty wheels come active morn then to the field mardonius conquer now deliberate hereafter on the spoil but thou may perish  perish and the gifts of fortune change to everlasting fame a sudden trumpet strikes his ear he sees masistius nigh so breaks the polar star through nights unravling canopy of clouds on some bewildered sailor to correct his erring course amidst a warm embrace began mardonius o in season come thou more than half myself my strength decays my talents languish even my honor sleeps when thou art far masistius calm replies i have composed pallenes late revolt through all the district potidaeas walls alone resisted from whose small domain oerflowd by tides the army i withdrew i come mardonius not to hear a tale of languid talents or of strength decayed much less of honor sleeping in thy breast when i am absent honor on a rock immovable is fixed its solid base the billowy passions beat in vain nor gusts of fortune shake support from none it wants firm in itself some augury or dream inexplicably dark oerclouds thy mind resume thy native manliness o chief whose loyal faith the mightiest king entrusts with all his power and splendor save the crown prepare to pass thermopylae and bring our labors to decision gobryas son compares the language of his spotless friend with his own devious thoughts and turns aside in blushing silence but recovered sends his mandate forth to march by rising dawn not with a less commotion in his soul from different cares emathias prince resorts to amarantha on her beauteous neck in conjugal affection yet in grief unutterable long he hangs alas my lord she said though early i presaged thy embassy abortive has it proved disastrous yes her agonizing spouse returned what more disastrous than reproach among the old hereditary friends of my forefathers amarantha lend attention amply shall my tongue relate events impressed too deeply on my heart i went to athens aristides called her various tribes the image of a god was he presiding innocent at least intentionally guiltless i began good will to athens prompted every word impowrd by xerxes thus mardonius greets you men of athens repossess your soil enlarged dominion from the royal hand ask and obtain be governed by your laws the son of gobryas will rebuild your fanes accept the kings alliance and be free with added strength and splendor me receive illustrious people offspring of the soil which you inhabit not a guest unknown in athens i your macedonian host of warm unchanged affection to your state salvation bring prosperity and peace reflect what numbers of subjected greeks some ancient foes to athens others friends but now constrained with xerxes are allied the small remainder unsubdud consult their own defense are spartans in the field your produce indefatigable race your newbuilt mansions to a second waste of flames your wives your progeny they leave to want and rapine singly can you face half greece all asia leagued against your weal oh amarantha frowns on every brow indignant lowrd around me present there was aemnestus from laconias state he who unawed by xerxes on his throne strange retribution claimed and sternly chose mardonius self the victim to appease leonidas the athenians he addressed invading sardis to enlarge your sway athenians you are authors of a war which now extends to all of grecian blood ill would it then become you to desert the general cause to servitude resigned by you a double shame the greeks would cast on athens known of old and often proved by arms and counsel to redeem and guard the liberty of nations i condemn like you my tardy countrymen will bleed not less for you than sparta soon i trust she will arrange her phalanx on the field else to your vengeance i devote my head meantime your wives and offspring every state in love will cherish attic ears be shut to this deceiver his condition calls on him to plead for tyranny himself wields a despotic scepter petty lord of feeble macedon and persias slave severe and awful aristides rose his manners still urbanity adorned ambassador of sparta he began us thou have charged as authors of the war yet do extol our vigor in redress of injured states the ionians were enslaved our own descendants sardis we assailed to set them free nor less our present zeal for all of grecian blood by common ties of language manners customs rites and laws to us allied can sparta doubt our faith what disingenuous unbeseeming thought in her late witness of our liberal proof of constancy when every clime on earth was equal to athenians where to choose their habitation true to greece they stayed in sight of athens burning to attempt the dangerous fight which spartans would have shunned now from the ruins of paternal tombs of altars fallen and violated fanes loud vengeance calls a voice our courage hears enlarged to pious fury spartan know if yet unknowing of the attic race not one to treat with xerxes will survive our wives and offspring shall encumber none all we require of sparta is to march that ere the expected foe invades our bounds the greeks united on boeotian plains may give him battle  alexander view that glorious power which rolls above our heads he first his wonted orbit shall forsake ere we our virtue never more appear before the presence of cecropian tribes with embassies like this nor blind by zeal however sincere to athens urge again what is beneath her majesty to bear i should be grieved her anger should disgrace a prince distinguished as her host and friend meantime i pity thy dependent state loud acclamations hurried from the sight of that assembly thy dejected spouse in his own thoughts dishonored what a lot is mine if xerxes triumph i become a slave in purple should the greeks prevail should that euboean conqueror the son of neocles be sent the athenian scourge hear and take comfort interposed the queen to thee i come for counsel sighed her lord i will repose me on thy breast will hear thy voice hereafter ever will obey thy love thy charms can sooth my present cares thy wisdom ward the future she proceeds that greece will triumph rest assured no force of these untaught barbarians can resist her policy and arms awhile dear lord we must submit to wear the galling mask necessity imposes new events are daily scattered by the restless palm of fortune some will prove propitious wise to all men gracious aristides served by us in season will befriend our state this said her starlike beauty gilds his gloom while round them heaven his midnight curtain drops by rising dawn the oetaean rocks and caves ring with ten thousand trumps and clarions loud with all his host the son of gobryas leaves his emptied camp so rushes from his den the strong and thickfurrd animal who boasts calistos lineage bound in drowsy sloth bleak winter he exhausts when tepid spring his limbs releases from benumbing cold he reinstates his vigor and asserts among sarmatian woods his wonted sway the bands entire of persians and of medes the rest selected from unnumberd climes compose the army forty myriads sweep thy pass renowned thermopylae to rush on grecian cities scattered in their view so by the deep borystenes in floods of frothy rage by mightier danubes wave nor less by countless congregated streams the euxine swollen through hellespontine straits impels his rapid current thence extends among the aegean isles a turbid maze three days the multitude required to pass the rough defile masistius in the van his sumptuous arms and allsurpassing form discovers tiridates leads the rear closed by the troops of macedon whose king sat on a car beside his radiant queen amid the center on a milkwhite steed mardonius rode in armor plated gold thick set with gems before him marched a guard of giant size from each barbarian tribe for huge dimension and terrific mien preferred their captain from his stature named briareus born on rhodope displayed that hundredhanded titan on his shield he swung around an ironstudded mace in length ten cubits to his shoulders broad the hairy spoils of hunted bears supplied a shaggy mantle his uncovered head was bald except where nigh the brawny neck short bushy locks their crisped terrors knit so his own mountain through surrounding woods lifts to the clouds a summit bare and smooth in frost which glistens by no season thawed not such is gentle mindarus behind in argent mail unceasing on his shield intent cleora newly painted there a living beauty but anothers prize he views while hopeless passion wastes the hue of his fair cheek and elegance of form not less the unrivaled amaranthas eyes had pierced the son of gobryas instant sparks on her appearance from nicaea first had kindled warm desire which absence cooled while she in distant macedon abode when winter melted at the breath of spring her sight again amid the assembling host revived the fervor of an eastern breast by nature prone by wanton license used to amorous pleasures public duty still employed his hours still smothered was the flame nor on his wishes had occasion smiled even in the absence of aemathias prince at athens friendships unremitted care still in sandauces chamber held the queen sequestered inaccessibly immured beside masistius rode a youthful page of eastern lineage he in tenderest years stolen by perfidious traffickers in slaves by medon purchased to melissa given by her was named statirus and retained among her holy servitors this youth on her benign protector she bestowed masistius prized her token of esteem beyond himself and daily bounty showrd on young statirus near the locrian vale advancing now the satrap thus began o early trained by sage melissas hand gift of her friendship and in merit dear nine months are fled statirus since i bowed in docile reverence not unlike thy own to her instruction all her words divine in precept or narration from this breast no time can blot i now perceive a lake which holds an island she has often described where tombs are mouldering under cypress shades there she has told me great oileus rests o father of melissa should my power to savage license of invasion leave thy dust exposed my progress were but small in virtues track masistius would disgrace thy daughters guidance  fly statirus post these my attendant vassals to protect that sacred turf let each battalion pass ere ye rejoin me uttering this he hears the trumpets evening signal to encamp the sun is low not entering yet the vale mardonius halts and summons to his tent thessalias chieftain faithless greek approved the persians friend with him the unwilling prince of macedon to whom the general thus to march by dawn your squadrons both prepare thou larissaean thorax in these tracts my trusted guide with swift excursion reach the isthmus watch the spartan motions there thou alexander sweep the furthest bounds of locris doris phocis all their youth in arms collect ere thirty days elapse i shall expect them on the plains of thebes he said the king and thorax both retire the morning shines they execute their charge the host proceeds once happy was the vale where medons father and his faithful swain now to illustrious haliartus changed abode in peace no longer is retained the verdant smoothness ridgd by grating wheels of libyan cars uptorn by ponderous hoofs of trooping steeds and camels not this day is festive such as spartas king enjoyed when liberal hospitality received his guardian standard on the oilean turf no jocund swain now modulates his pipe to notes of welcome not a maiden decks her hair in flowers mute philomel whose throat once tuned her warble to laconian flutes amid barbarian dissonance repines now in rude march the innumerable host approach the fountain whose translucent rills in murmur lull the passengers repose on beds of moss in that refreshing cell to rural peace constructed by the friend of man oileus thither to evade the noontide heat the son of gobryas turns briareus captain of his giant guard accosts him entering image of the king a listening ear to me thy servant lend thou go to thebes far different is the track to delphi shall that receptacle proud of grecian treasure heaped from earliest times yet rest unspoild an earthquake not the arms of feeble delphians foiled the first attempt not twice parnassus will disjoint his frame let me the precious enterprise resume who neither dread the mountain nor the god though not assenting yet without reproof mardonius looks postponing his reply hence soon the rumor of a new attempt against the pythian oracle the seat of amaranthas birth alarms her soul massistius born to virtue and refined by frequent converse with melissa pure the queen consults her instant he conveys before his friend to deprecate an act of sacrilege so fatal once the cell she enters like anchises when his flock on idas mount was folded at the sight of venus breaking on his midnight hut in all the radiance of celestial charms mardonius stands and fixes on the queen an eye transported at a sign his friend withdrew but waited nigh to her the chief what fortune brings the fairest of her sex to her adoring servant she replies false sure the rumor which pervades thy camp a second time to violate the shrine of phoebus once provoked and sorely felt thou can not mean the eager persian then admit the intent thy interceding voice protects apollo not on my request avoid an impious action firm she spoke weigh thy own danger in offending heaven by piety and mercy win its grace no all the merit shall be thine he cried the favor due from heaven be all thy own i ask no more than amaranthas smile for my reward as phoebus is thy god thou art my goddess let me worship thus  he stopped and seized her hand with amorous lips to stain those lilied beauties which surpassed junonian whiteness virtue from her eyes flashed and with crimson indignation died her cheeks retire forget not who i am stern she rebuked him he accustomed long to yielding beauty in the wanton east that torrid clime of love a stranger he to elegance of coyness in the sex much more to chaste repulse when every bar but honor warm occasion has removed these words austerely uttered am i changed no more mardonius is my dazzling sun of power and splendor suddenly obscured in state degraded for a peasants garb have i exchanged my purple is my prime my form in all the impurities of age by some malignant talisman disguised at once grown loathsome who and what i am thou prodigy of coldness and disdain remind me who and what thou art she said i will remind thee to confound thee more no characters of magic have the power to change a noble and ingenuous mind thou have thyself degraded thou have rent the wreaths which circle thy commanding brow and all their splendor wantonly defaced thy rank and power exalted do thou hold from partial heaven to violate the laws of men and gods true pattern to the world of persian virtues now to all thy pomp thy steeds thy chariots and emblazing gems the gorgeous pageants of tyrannic state i leave thee son of luxury and vice she said and darted like a meteor swift away whose aspect red presages woe to superstitions herd the persians pride is wounded tapers to the cell he calls by them a tablet unobserved before attracts his gloomy eye the words were these the spartan king a visitant was here who by a tyrants multitude oerpowrd died for his country be accursed the man the man impure who violates these walls which by oileus hospitably raised received the great leonidas a guest oilean medon this inscription traced another hangs beneath it in this strain laconian aemnestus rested here from asias camp returned his faulchions point to deities and mortals thus proclaims his arm to vengeance on mardonius pledged the king of spartas manes to appease brave was the son of gobryas like the god of war in battle yet a dream an act of froward chance would often depress his mind he recollects with pain the challenge bold from that severe laconian in the tent of xerxes this to amaranthas scorn succeeding throws new darkness over his gloom masistius entering hasty thus began what have thou done mardonius when i led this princess back indignant she complained of wrong from thee thy countenance is grieved confused mardonius pointed to the scrolls masistius read he took the word again now in the name of horomazes chief art thou discouraged by a grecian vaunt or by that empty oracle which claimed atonement for leonidas despise mysterious words and omens like a man but if thou bear the conscience of a deed unworthy just thy sorrow like a man feel due contrition and the fault repair i have meant wrong not acted said the chief greece once produced a helen who forsook a throne and husband what these later dames call honor which without an eunuch guard protects their charms in asia is unknown resentful galled at first i now admire this lofty woman who like helen bright rejected me a lover who surpass the son of priam thou art gentler far than i discreet masistius sooth by morn with lenient words and costly gifts her ire call mindarus together let us feast he too is gentle i am rough and hot whom thou can guide masistius thou alone soon mindarus appears in aspect sad soon is the royal equipage produced which xerxes gave mardonius to sustain his delegated state ye rustic powers ye dryads oreads of the oilean seat ye naiads white of lucid brooks and founts had you existence other than in tales of fancy how had your astonished eyes at piles of gold enriched by orient gems been dimmed with luster genius of the cell simplicity had framed to rural peace how had thou started at a persian board fair female minstrels charm the sight and ear effeminating measures on their lutes dissolve the soul in languor which admits no thought but love their voices chance directs to sing of daphne by apollo chased of him inflamed at beauties in her flight disclosed him reaching with a vain embrace those virgin beauties into laurel changed on flowrybankd orontes syrian stream mardonius sighs at disappointed love tears down the cheeks of mindarus descend recalling dear cleora not as dead recalled but living in anothers arms not so the firmness of masistius yields the soft lascivious theme his thoughts reject by pure affections governed yet the charm of harmony prevailing serves to raise composed remembrance of melissas lyre which often in stillness of a moonlight hour amid her nymphs in symphony hightond to moderation equity and faith to deeds heroic and humane she struck with force divine reproving lawless will intemprate paffions turpitude of mind and savage manners in her ethic lay the banquet ends and all depart to rest end of the twentyfirst book the athenaid book the twentysecond by morn returned masistius hear he said the event unpleasing from thy passion sprung mardonius thy temerity has chased from persias camp the macedonian queen i found her tent abandoned but her course conjecture cannot trace what other style than of barbarians can the greeks afford to us of asia lo a youthful king our best ally and my distinguished friend exerts a distant effort in our cause meantime the honor of his queen by all adored inviolate till now our chief insults by station her protector sole when i am absent not thyself alone thou have disgraced but me her guardian pledged by sacred oaths to macedonias lord these words evincing natures purest gifts deserving that society sublime with grecian muses where melissa poured her moral strain in perturbation plunge the hearer when importunate abrupt appears briareus and renews the suit to pillage delphi no in wrath replied the clouded son of gobryas bring my steed march all to thebes then humble as a child who to parental castigation owns his fault in tears masistius he addressed how blessed the mind by horomazes framed like thine serene masistius to resist unruly passions never warm desires pride or ambition vex thy equal thoughts which from their level no dejection lowrs yet none surpasses thee in rank and power among the satraps uncorrupted man o in thyself superior to thy state me who so often sink below my own befriend in this dark moment i foresee i feel disaster in this harsh event masistius here reflect thou mighty chief at either gate of life the first and last yet more through all their intermediate space vicissitude and hazard lurk unseen supplanting wary steps to mortal power those dreadful ministers of jealous heaven the elements are hostile and to lower the great with changing fortune often conspire her cruel sport mardonius need we tempt with our own follies in thy arduous post thy hand sustains a balance where the lives of nations where an empires fate is poised from hour to hour against the common ills of chance and nature which so often foil the wifest do not superadd the weight of thy own passions to the adverse scale i who am ever to thy virtues just will not be slow though grieving at thy faults to furnish present help farewell i mount my swiftest courser to overtake the queen whose indignation i can best compose mardonius then adventure is a chase thy virtue no idolatress of fame enjoys thy prompters are the love of right care for a friend or zeal for persias state which render hazardous attempts thy bliss sublime masistius thou have weight to awe mardonius who thy enterprising hand laments but never to control assumes yet feels and most regrets his own defects whenever they cause thy absence here they end discourse of cavalry a numerous power trained by himself masistius heads and leaves the army filing toward boeotian fields he bends his course to delphi he attains permessus round the heliconian heights in argent mazes whispering as he flows to passengers along the winding way which skirts the mountain and oerlooks the stream back from the ford the satraps courser starts affrighted lo to crimson as of blood in sudden change the late crystalline wave melodious solace of the sacred nine rolls horrible to view anon with helms with spears and bucklers grating over the bed of loosened stone with limbs and trunks of men the turbid current chafes masistius spurs through all obstruction in his forced career the clank of armor crash of spears and shouts of battle strike his ear the vocal rocks augment the animating sound he sees a flying soldier by his target known a macedonian guard who stops and thus hail satrap hail thou timely sent by heaven haste and protect the macedonian queen a host of robbers by the lawless times combined have vanquished our inferior force part of our mangled number choke that flood part on the ground lie bleeding at these words masistius rushes with his ponderous lance in rest emathias beauteous queen in flight before pursuing ruffians he perceives on her fleet courser thunderbolt of strength he hurls to earth their leader giantsizd a profligate deserter from the guard mardonian next a phocian born expelled his native residence for crimes he flew the active staff is broken in the chest of an arcadian branded by his state with infamy the victor then unsheaths his sabre opening through the savage rout a passage wide for death his faithful train surround them irresistible he sweeps the traitors headlong to the flood below which foams like simois by pelides swollen with trojan dead and struggling to discharge the unwonted load in neptunes briny waste the conqueror dismounts before the queen his gracious form presenting in the arms of his sustaining friends he sudden sinks oppressed by wounds unheeded even unfelt amid the warmth of action then her veil she rends asunder and lamenting beats her grateful breast the notes of sorrow loud through all the concourse dissipate his trance serene these words he utters honors track is perilous though lovely there to walk not fearing death nor coveting his stroke though to receive it ever well prepared has been my choice and study but fair queen be not discouraged at my present state wounds are to me familiar and their cures to delphi lead me or whatever place thy wish prefers masistius comes thy guard so will continue and ere long restored has much for thy instruction to impart while these to delphi on his march to thebes advanced the son of gobryas soon the steps innumerous of men and coursers bruise on green cephissian meads the growth of may copaeaes lake perfumed with orange groves which rude unsated violence deforms the multitudes envelop thence along the sedgy borders of ismenus reach cadmean walls when now the golden sun sevn times had filled his orbit thebes admits the persian general in these words addressed by leontiades thrice welcome lord we thy allies our counsel to disclose have waited long not hazarding a fight thou have the means to ascertain success here seated tranquil from exhaustless stores distribute gold among the grecian states corrupt the powerful open factions mouth divide nor doubt to overcome that strength which linked in union will surmount the force of all mankind the ardent persian here to court the athenians with a lavish hand have i not stooped already but disdained that haughty race to destiny i leave have i not bid defiance to their boast themistocles him forfeiting his word pledged to confront me on boeotian plains i haste to summon at his native gates what are the greeks if athens be reduced where are the vaunted spartans locked in fear behind their isthmian wall by heaven in fear of thorax ranging with a slender band of his thessalian horse thou rule in thebes brave mindarus till i from athens tamed return with fetters for the rest of greece he seeks his couch and after short repose by twilight bursts like thunder from a cloud which on olympus hovering black contains the livid store of joves collected wrath against offending mortals over a land deserted silent to the empty roofs of athens was the march mardonius climbed aegaleos thence on salamis descried that muchenduring people who again for liberty forsook their native homes on his approach his generous pride relents he wishes such a nation were a friend his wishes waken in his breast an awe at such a foe murichides was nigh a hellespontine grecian of his train nor in his favor low to him he spoke look on that haughty but that gallant race perhaps at me by myriads thus begirt their very children lift their little hands in menaces and cursing lisp the names of xerxes and mardonius mount a bark pass with a herald to that crowded isle the senators accost the people shun in pride beyond nobility repeat the words aemathian alexander used ye men of athens repossess your homes enlarged dominion from the royal hand ask and obtain be governed by your laws the son of gobryas will rebuild your fanes accept the kings alliance and be free with added strength and splendor further say they little know what confidence is due to him who sends thee asian greeks subdued by me retain their democratic rights on salamis the hellespontine lands before the athenian senate he displays the persian proffer all indignant hear but lycides who thus exhorting spoke from athens twice expelled deserted twice by lacedaemon who her toil employs still on her isthmian fence who lifts no shield to guard our wives and progeny to save from desolation our defenseless fields or from our homes repel the hostile blaze what can we better injured and betrayed than listen to mardonius be referred his terms of friendship to the assembling tribes the universal senate rose in scorn of such submission by the people known his counsel roused enthusiastic rage nor aristides can the tumult cool they stone the timid senator to death the women catch the spirit fierce as fair laodice collects the infuriate sex they hand in hand a dreadful circle form around his mansion and his wife and race doom to perdition that his coward blood may never survive in greece enormous thought perhaps not less than such excess of zeal excess of peril in that season claimed to save a land which fostered every muse that eloquence philosophy and arts might shine in attic purity of light to latest ages but a sudden fleet in wide array extending on the shore suspends the deed before each wondering eye timothea lands sicinus at her side when thus the matron to the impatient throng his native friends themistocles salutes euboean plenty in your present need he sends returning i this crowded isle will disencumber and to safety bear your wives and infants open to their wants eudora holds her amarynthian seat elephenor tisander to the shrines of jove invite them and to friendly roofs euboeas towns as often aurora sheds serenity around her when the gates of light first open to her fragrant step hushed at her feet lies boreas who had rent the dusky pall of night and jove restrains the thunders roar and torrents of the skies such was timotheas presence so the storm by furies late excited at her voice was tame she learns the melancholy fate of lycides to her protection takes his helpless orphans and disastrous wife now of its plenteous stores while eager hands the numerous fleet unlade and attic dames prepare with good timothea to embark just aristides first of men conducts that first of matrons to his joyful tent where she began o righteous like the gods now hear my whole commission and believe themistocles my husband feels thy worth when at his summons on euboeas coast i landed first thrice welcome he exclaimed from athens hither to a safe abode a second emigration i presage to her afflicted race from port to port around euboeas populous extent with him conveyed i saw her wealthy towns to his control subordinate their powers he now is gathering some achievement new he meditates which secresy conceals like fates dark roll inscrutable to all from thee an early notice he requests soon as the greeks united in one camp the sole attention of mardonius draw the intelligence to bring i leave behind that faithful man sicinus virtuous dame wise is thy husband aristides spoke from him no other than achievements high however my conjecture they surpass i still expect themistocles apprise that i am bound for sparta to upbraid pausanias proud and summon to the field that selfish breed so martial yet so cold to public welfare let me next prefer to thy benignity a fervent suit he straight withdrew and reappearing led two little damsels humble in attire behold my daughters he resumed admit these to thy care now motherless they want protection even euphemia they have lost my venerable parent have the gods released but newly from the growing scene of trouble athens must a parent prove to these hereafter fated to receive no portion from a father who delights in poverty his arms are all the wealth of aristides with a tender hand she takes the children o of men she said most rich whose wealth is virtue in the name of household gods this office i accept o aristides these shall mix with mine these shall contribute to cement the work i long have wrought the amity begun betwixt themistocles and thee in tears depart the infant maidens from a sire of gentlest nature and in manners bland not less than just meanwhile to athens steers murichides unharmd the rising dawn sees with her precious charge timothea sail lo from the city clouds of smoke ascend voluminous with interlacing flames such as vesuvius vomits from his gulf sulphurous when unquenchable the heat within his concave melts the surging ore to floods of fire murichides had told his fruitless embassy mardonius wild with ire to instant conflagration doomed the abode of such inexorable foes they on the margin opposite beheld their ancient residence a second time destroyed nor uttered more than just complaint of tardy sparta when briareus dire with his gigantic savages oerturnd the recent tomb which held the glorious slain at salamis when scattered in the wind they saw that dust revered in solemn rage devoid of sound illiberal or loud each his right hand with sanctity of oaths pledged to his neighbor and to vengeance full his blood devoted aristides looked as some incensed divinity and spoke persist ye sons of folly crush that tomb the last repose of yon heroic slain disturb therein exhibiting your doom from mortals and immortals thus your pride by heaven and grecian valor shall be crushed your impious host be scattered like that dust which your barbarity profanes now friends by your appointment i to sparta sail you under watchful discipline remain composed and firm such patience will surmount all obstacle athenians will restore in brighter glories your paternal seats this said the isle he leaves selecting none but cimon for associate in the bark him aristides placidly bespake son of miltiades the great in arms thy early youth was dissolute thy look ingenuous still and frank thy tongue revealed internal virtue friendship on my part succeeded thence a study to reclaim thy human frailties i rejoice in hope thou will hereafter prove an attic star in council wise triumphant in the field humane to strangers to thy country just friend to her laws to all her muses kind who may record thy actions cimon here if i have virtues they proceed from thee if i attain to glory i shall owe to thee my luster to deserve thy praise what have i yet accomplished i have fought at salamis what more performing there than each athenian aristides then true all were brave my judgment does not rest on one exploit thy modesty oerlooks the signs of worth and talents whence my hopes have ranked thee first of grecians to acquire to keep that station cimon be thy choice thou have the means but this impression hold who would excel must be a moral man thus they exhaust their voyage of a day when at troezene they arrive and find renowned cleander training for the field his native bands to sparta thence they sail the ephori assemble when they hear of aristides who an audience claims he comes before them and austerely thus cecropias race exterminated twice demand of sparta whether sloth or fear or persian gold her buckler has unbracd mardonius proffered more than equal terms not friendship singly but enlarged domain to athens who to eleutherian jove to greece was faithful and the liberal gift disdained your own ambassador pronounced your phalanx ready for its speedy march his head he pledged mardonius takes the field he lays the athenian territory waste where are the spartans adding work to work for their own separate safety at their wall inglorious isthmian wall while half the greeks become your foes and athens is betrayed pausanias present proudly thus replied have thou not heard the hyacinthian rites employ the spartans shall the heads of greece be questioned be directed when to act by you athenians your inferior state may wait our leisure aristides here talk thou to me of hyacinthian games while rude barbarians riot in our fields while athens burns while sacrilege invades our temples while our ancestors we see torn from the grave pausanias thou disgrace to thy forefather hercules whose arm to friends a bulwark was a scourge to foes what have thou said but guardian to the son of that renowned leonidas who fought beyond the isthmus and for greece expired if thou retainst no reverence for his blood if thou do scorn lycurgus and his laws if holding liberty an empty name art now in

rose brave as they are our friends of tegea seem to have forgot the marathonian field the salaminian trophies else this strife had never alarmed the congregated host of states so various and remote as brief callicrates subjoins not less our friends of tegea seem forgetful that their claim within the isthmus is confined the gift of part not binding universal greece athenian moderation had before won every spartan loud they sound the name of athens athens whose pretension just the general confirms restoring peace so in a chorus full the manly bass directs the power of harmony to float on equal pinions and attune the air now spartas wide encampment on the right was formed sedate and silent was the toil as is the concourse of industrious ants in mute attention to their public cares extending thence successive states erect their standards on the left their numerous tents the athenians pitch in labor not unlike the buzzing tenants of sonorous hives loquacious they and lively cheer the field yet regularly heed each signal given by staid commanders underneath a fringe of wood projecting from cithaerons side ascends the chief pavilion seated there is aristides at a frugal board an aged menial his attendant sole but from the tribes selected round him watch an hundred youths whose captain is the son of famed miltiades the neighboring bed of pure asopus from cithaerons founts refreshment inexhaustible contained his arms the athenian patriot in his tent was now exploring when he hears the step of aemnestus entering who began most wise of men and righteous whom all greece not athens singly as her glory claims grant me an hour laconian laws thou know subordination to excess enjoin i am obedient to the man who holds supreme command by office rank and birth while thee my heart confesses and admits my sole adviser haughty and morose over uncommunicated thoughts will brood our dark pausanias i may often want thy counsel now instruct me is it meet we cross the asopus to assail the foe or wait his coming let him come replies the attic sage let bold invaders court a battle not the invaded who must watch occasions favor present in thy mind retain that greece is centered in this host which if we hazard lightly were a crime the offended gods with fetters would chastise our attic flame to sudden onset points by me discouraged aemnestus then know that with me callicrates unites farewell thy wisdom shall direct us both the sun was set the unnumberd eyes of heaven thin clouds envelopd dusky was the veil of night not sable placid was the air the lowtond current of asopus held no other motion than his native flow alluring aristides in a walk contemplative to pace the stable verge attired in moss the hostile camp he views which by masistian vigilance and art with walls of wood and turrets was secured for this the groves of jupiter supreme on hypatus were spoiled teumessian brows mesabius parnes were uncovered all square was the enclosure every face emblazd with ordered lights each elevated tent of princely satraps and surmounting all mardonius thine from coronets of lamps shot luster softening on the distant edge of wide plataean fields a din confused proclaimed barbarians silent was the camp of greece these thoughts the spectacle excites in aristides slender is thy bound asopus long to separate such hosts or keep thy silver wave from blood unstained lord of olympus did thou want the power or boundless power possessing want the will thy own created system to secure from such destruction wherefore on this plain is europe thus and adverse asia met for human carnage natural this search yet but a waste of reason let me shun unprofitable wandrings over the land obscure of trackless mystery to see the path of virtue open is enough whatever the cause of evil he who knows himself not partner in that cause attains enough of knowledge all the rest is dream of falselystyld philosophy my task is to destroy the enemies of greece be active there my faculties and lose nor time nor thought revisiting his tent sicinus called apart he thus instructs return discreet and faithful to the son of neocles thy own observing eye will prompt thy tongue this notice sole i send we will not hurry to a general fight bless in my name timothea bless her sons her daughters nor good man oerlook my own six monthly periods of the solar course were now complete intense the summer glowed the patient greeks for eight successive days endure the insults of barbarian horse behind their lines when eager to his friend the persian general best beloved of men impart thy counsel lo this vaunted race lurk in their trenches and avoid the plain to him masistius i have marked a post accessible and feeble in their line to me thy choicest cavalry commit i at the hazard of my life will gall perhaps may force that quarter ah my friend mardonius answered shall thy precious life be hazarded let others take the charge briareus midias tiridates brave or mindarus a thousand leaders bold this host affords masistius in the gloom of midnight from my pillow i discerned thy gracious figure on a steed of fire who bore thee up to heaven where sudden folds of radiant vapor wrapped thee from my view at once throughout the innumerable tents their hue was changed to black boeotias hills and caves with ejulation from the camp rebellowd round the camels horses mules dissolved in tears let mithras angry beam pierce this right arm annihilate my strength and melt my courage i will rest content to purchase thus the safety of my friend masistius answered son of gobryas learn that he who makes familiar to his mind the certainty of death and nobly dares in virtues clear pursuit may look serene on boding dreams and auguries averse no sign but honor he requires he wants no monitor but duty an attempt my observation has maturely weighed belongs to me to others less informed i will not leave the danger quick replies disturbed mardonius while at friendships warmth ambition melts and honor fills his breast o worthier far than frail mardonius take over all the host of xerxes chief command me from temptation him from danger guard again masistius son of gobryas peace my ear is wounded ever do thou sink below the level of thy worth with me with others soarst too high what means the word temptation what this danger to the king o satrap listed by his grace so high thou have overwhelmed masistius may the god of truth and justice strengthen in thy soul the light ingenuous which so much reveals that sense of duty may suppress a thought i dare not clothe in language still in mind the parting words of artemisia bear which in its blameless moments often thy tongue repeats with admiration look she said look only where no mystery can lurk on every manly duty nothing dark oershades the track of virtue plain her path but superstition chosen for a guide misleads the best and wisest let me add worse is the guide ambition which misleads to more than error to atrocious acts i shall despair masistius if thou fallst rejoins mardonius must masistius then consort with women shut from noble deeds subjoins the virtuous persian can thy hand thy friendly hand now rivetted in mine of my degree and dignity of birth deprive me or obliterate the name with all its luster which my fathers left me to uphold or would thou if impowrd taint my firm spirit with an eunuchs fear among their feeble train my rank confine my strength unnerve my fortitude debase while these subsist with titles wealth and state while as i pass the crouding myriads shout here comes masistius what is less required from him than deeds to manifest a soul which merits such distinction we again this day will meet mardonius  but as none of human texture can the flight foresee of that inevitable dart which soon or late will strike i leave these words behind if blinded still by superstitions cloud thou will believe me in this hour the mark of fate retain them as my dying words ambition curb let virtue be thy pride they separated sad mardonius still foreboding evil to his noble friend he at the frailty of mardonius grieved masistius soon collecting round his tent the prime of persian cavalry bespake their captains thus your steeds and arms prepare string well your bows your quivers store with shafts with numerous javelins each his courser load i am this day your general i rely on your known prowess and i trust the hand of horomazes will conduct you back victorious but remember that the brave in life or death accomplishing their part are happy all rejoicing in a chief beloved his orders sedulous fulfill in arms more splendid than for peleus son the immortal artist forged masistius cased his limbs of beauteous frame and manly grace to match that hero whom scamander saw with dardan blood imbrued in hue of snow his horse of all nisaeas breed the choice caparisond in rubies champs the gold which rules his mouth his animated mane floats over the bridle formed of golden braid his page was nigh that youth of eastern race whom for his merit pure melissa gave to this benignant satrap to ascend his gorgeous seat preparing thus the chief if i return a conqueror this day to that excelling dame who made thee mine who has enlarged whatever of wise and great of just and temperate i to nature owe refined my manners and my purest thoughts exalted i my friendship will prolong in gratitude and reverence blessing heaven which thus prefers masistius to extend benevolence to virtue if i fall resume with her the happiest lot my care can recommend statirus though no greek her pupil say in offices humane has not been tardy by her light inspired he went more perfect to a noble grave end of the twentythird book the athenaid book the twentyfourth while thus mafistius for the field prepared at sacrifice amidst the different chiefs pausanias stood the entrails to consult for heavens direction like a god revered among the spartans was an augur famed tisamenus the pythian had declared him first of prophets he the rites performs the victim opened he inspects and thus in solemn tone hear grecians and obey the will of jove to pass the asopian flood forbear with persian fetters in her hand ill fortune seated on that bank i see on this the laureled figure of success the augur ceased when suddenly in view the asopian current overswelling foams with eastern squadrons wading through the fords bounds in the van masistius on a steed whose glistning hue the brightest of the four which drew the irradiate axle of the morn might scarce outshine erect the hero sat firm as the son of danae by jove when his strong pinioned pegasus he wheeled through ethiopian air from death to guard andromeda his love in rapid haste a herald greets pausanias from the men of megara i come a post advanced the most obnoxious in the grecian line to harassing assaults their daily toil with unabating firmness long has held unwonted numbers of barbarian horse now sweep the field a reinforcement send her standard else will megara withdraw pausanias then alike to try the greeks and save his spartans answered chiefs you hear who will be foremost to sustain our friends through fear the dangerous service is declined by many indignation to behold no spartans offered but the arduous task imposed on others held cleander mute when aristides herald swift return athenian aid might else prevent thy speed the patriot spoke and left the greeks amazed well knowing athens with abhorrence looked on megara her envious rancrous foe of ancient date whom now she flies to aid meantime that feeblest station of the camp the impetuous asian cavalry surround as clouds impregnated with hail discharge their stormy burden on a champaign rich in ripened grain and lay the crackling rows of ceres prostrate under sheets of darts with arrows barbd and javelins thus whole ranks of megara by wounds or death overthrown gasp on the ground alcathous expires the blood of nisus megatensian prince in times remote and fabled to have held his fate dependent on a purple hair amidst his hoary locks that vital thread his impious daughter severed blind with love for minos cretan king her fathers foe masistius pierced him javelins from his arm incessant flew on heaps of nameless dead he laid evenus lysicles the youth of cyparissus and cratanders age distinguished each by office wealth or birth or martial actions beasts of chase and prey the wolf and boar the lion and the stag within close toils imprisoned thus become the hunters mark the signal of retreat is now uplifted by the hopeless chiefs when as a friendly gale with stiffning wings repels a vessel driving by the force of boisterous currents in a fatal track to bulge on rocks a voluntary band of men at arms and bowmen attic all restrain the flight of megara expert their shafts they level at the persian steeds not at the riders soon around the plain the ungoverned animals disperse enraged by galling wounds olympiodorus chief among the light auxiliars on the lists of pisa just hellanodics had crowned the first of greeks in archery he stands like telamonian teucer on the mound of atreus son where fates unerring hand had strung the bow which heaped with phrygian dead the empurpled fosse while ajax swung abroad the sevnfold shield to guard a brothers skill still in the field masistius who observed the active archer from his lofty seat against him whirls a javelin cimon near receives the blunted weapon on the boss of his huge buckler his vindictive bow olympiodorus bends the rapid shaft full in the forehead of the generous steed he lodges deep the high nisaean blood boils in its channels through tormenting pain erect the courser paws in air and hurls in writhing agitation from his back the illustrious rider on the plain supine against him rush the athenians on his feet they find him brandishing his sabre keen with his firm shield a bulwark to his breast like one of those earthsprung in radiant arms whom the cadmean dragons fruitful jaws or colchian serpents teeth produced assailed on every side his fortitude augments with danger down to plutos realm he sends iphicrates and eurytus who drank callirrhoes fountain amynander born on smooth ilissus and three gallant youths of marathon his cuirass strong withstands repeated blows unwounded but overcome by unremitted labor on his knees like some proud structure half overthrown by time he sinks at last brave cimon hastes to save a foe so noble in his deeds in port beyond a mortal when a vulgar sword that moment through the vizor of his helm transfixed the brain so exquisitely formed the seat of purest sentiment and thought his frame in ruin beauteous still and great the fatal stroke laid low an earthquake thus shook from his base that wonder of the world the colossean deity of rhodes of danger all unheeding by his lord statirus kneeled and over his bosom spread his palms in anguish timely to protect the gentle youth ingenuous cimon came while thus the gasping satrap breathed his last farewell thou faithful  bid mardonius think how brief are lifes enjoyments  virtue lives through all eternity  by virtue earned praise too is long  melissa  grant me thine in death resembling sweetest sleep his eyes serenely drop their curtains and the soul flies to the eternal mansions of the just within the trenches cimon straight commands to lodge the corse when lo another cloud of eastern squadrons mindarus their chief who over the stream detached with numbers new not finding great masistius roused afresh the storm of onset dreadful was the shock of these attempting to redeem of those who held the body but the attic spears break in the chests of fiery steeds which press with violence unyielding and the ranks in front disarm the archers have discharged their quivers now had mindarus acquired undying glory and the greeks resigned the longcontested prize when threatening shouts of different grecians pouring from the camp alarm the eastern chief cleander here with all troezene arimnestus there diomedons bold successor in arms with his plataeans and the thespian brave alcimedon assail the persian flanks so two hoarse torrents opposite descend from hills where recent thunderstorms have burst in the midvale the dashing waters meet to overwhelm the peasants hopes and toil myronides and aeschylus in sight each with his formidable phalanx moves the encampment whole is arming from the fight his mangled cavalry the persian calls in eager quest of refuge in their lines beyond asopus through surrounding foes the coursers vault like swimmers who forsake a foundring vessel and with buoyant strength bound through the surge for safety on the beach triumphant in their camp the greeks replace their standards thither cimons generous care transports masistius eager to behold a prize so noble curious throngs on throngs press in disorder each his station leaves confusion reigns the general host to arms pausanias sternly vigilant commands and next provides a chariot to display throughout the extensive lines the illustrious dead in magnitude and beauty late the pride of natures studied workmanship his limbs the hand of cimon tenderly composed as would a brother to a brothers corse masistius filled the chariot on his knees statirus held and watered with his tears the face majestic not by death deformed pale but with features mild which still retained attractive sweetness to endear the sight first on the right through lacedaemons range the spectacle is carried silence there prevails the spartan citizen no sign of triumph shows subordinate to law which disciplined his passions toward the left through exultation loud of other greeks the awful car at length to attic ranks brings their own prize by aristides met there silence too in reverence of their chief is universal he prepares to speak but first the mighty relics he surveys he feels like jove contemplating the pure the generous brave sarpedon as he lay in deaths cold arms when swift the almighty sire decreed that morpheus gentlest of the gods should waft to lycias realm the royal clay from pious friends and subjects to obtain the rites of splendid sepulture complete was now the solemn pause to listening ears thus aristides vents his godlike soul here close your triumph grecians nor provoke the jealous powers who mark for chosen wrath oerweening pride though auguring success from this great satraps fall revere his clay such reverence all of mortal mold will need all soon or late if comeliness and strength if gracious manners and a mind humane if worth and wisdom could avoid the grave you had not seen this tower of asia fall yet there is left attainable by man what may survive the grave it is the fame of generous actions this do you attain i in psittalias isle this persian knew brave medons prize his captive hands we freed to him our hospitable faith we pledged through whom phoebean timon was redeemed with haliartus on euboeas fields to signalize their swords on oetas hill in him the daughter of oileus found a spotless guardian let his corse and arms thy acquisition cimon be resigned to piety a herald shall attend thy steps remove him to his native friends let xerxes hear let fierce mardonius see how much barbarians differ from the greeks minervas tribes approving hear the words of clemency and pity cimon mounts the funeral car attentive and composed like maias son commissioned from the skies by his eternal sire the warrior hears the full instructions of his patron chief the asopian stream he fords to asias tents whence issue wailing multitudes who rend the air with ejulation while the wheels before mardonius stop their solemn roll he rives his mantle and defiles with dust his splendid head not more the destined king of judah mourned the virtuous heir of saul mowed down in battle by philistian strength on gilboas heights nor melted more in grief over absaloms fair locks too much endeared to blind parental fondness from the car descending cimon spoke lo persian chief the just athenian aristides sends these relics which he honors to partake of sepulture as eastern rites ordain then art thou fallen too confident exclaims mardonius too unmindful of my love and anxious warnings mithra veil thy face in clouds in tears of blood thou sky dissolve earth groan and general nature join in woe the tallest cedar of the orient groves lies prostrate  destiny malign i brave thy further malice  blasted to the root is all my joy here sorrow closed his lips as frozen dead by wintry gusts he stood devoid of motion mindarus was nigh whose interposing prudence thus was heard o chief of nations numberless who stand spectators round and watch thy lightest look confine thy anguish in their sight revere thyself regard this messenger benign from aristides and thy native sense of obligation rouse mardonius then as from a trance i hear thee and approve my gentle kinsman this returning car with purest gold and costly vesture pild shall bear the copious tribute of my thanks to aristides whom extolled to heaven by excellent masistius often my soul has heard the righteous by the righteous praised now cimon interposed that man extolled thou do not persian liberal as thou art mean to offend thy presents then withold in poverty more glorious than in wealth the wealthiest aristides frowns at gold no costly vestures decorate his frame itself divine the very arms he wears the sole possession of that spotless man all ornament reject he only boasts the sharpest sword the weightiest spear and shield ha must i pass unthankful in the sight of one masistius loved the chief replied no answered quick the athenian from his cross take down leonidas a steadfast look mardonius fixed on cimon that request o greek is big with danger to my head which i will hazard since the only price set on the precious relics thou restorst this said he orders to his tent the corse there on the claycold bosom of his friend thus plaintive hangs fallen pillar of my hopes what is mardonius wanting thy support thou arm of strength for ever are unbracd thy nerves enlightened mind where prudence dwelt heart purified by honor you have left mardonius helpless left him to himself to his own passions which thy counsel tamed the dangerous paths of error i shall tread without thy guidance shame defeat and death frown in thy wounds illboding  yet thy look not fate itself of gentleness deprives by heaven a world shall mourn thee  loud he calls which mindarus obeys to him the chief thou too did love masistius  fly proclaim a general lamentation through the camp let all boeotia sound masistius lost o verified too clearly boding dream of mine by him so fatally despised see every head dismantled of its hair the soldiers women eunuchs of his mane see every steed the mule and camel shorn o that the echo of our grief might pass the hellespont to asia that her loss through all her cities through her vales and streams beyond the banks of ganges might be told as mindarus departs the theban chief approaches leontiades who spoke if there be one o general can replace masistius wise that prodigy is found elean hegesistratus of seers the most renowned his penetrating mind can from the victim slain or mystic flight of birds foresee the dark events of time invetrate foe to sparta sore with wrongs he comes thy servant opportune he comes replies mardonius in the rites of greece ten hecatombs before the sun descends shall to masistius bleed an offering high i will engage this augur at a price beyond his wishes let his skill decide when to give battle and avenge my friend collect your grecian artists instant build a cenotaph in your dircaean grove where that pure fountain trills a mournful note there shall masistius in his name survive among the greeks his last remains embalmed among his fathers shall in susa rest the theban goes statirus next appears the afflicted hero greets the weeping youth ah poor statirus thou have lost thy lord i lost my friend her bulwark asia lost the sacred clay to artamanes bear left in trachiniae chief his pious love who did not love masistius will convey to distant sestos his embalmed remains thence over the narrow hellespont to reach his native asia and his fathers tomb how did he fall statirus did he send to me no counsel from his dying lips these in a sigh the faithful page began were his last accents let mardonius think how brief are lifes enjoyments virtue lives through all eternity by virtue earned praise too is long  melissa grant me thine commend me to melissa starting spoke the son of gobryas from the shameful cross bid artamanes in her presence free leonidas the spartan now perform another act of duty to thy lord despoil my head of all its curling pride slight sacrifice to grief  but every limb lopt from this body and its mangled flesh shall in the dust be scattered ere i quit my chase of great revenge concluding here he strides impetuous like a stately ram lord of the flock newshorn his giant guard enclose him round the innumerable host attend him all divested of their hair in howling anguish to an altar huge by hasty hands constructed deep the earth around is hollowed deep is drenched with blood ten hundred sable victims heap the ground now general silence reigns as over the main in winter when halcyone laments her ceyx lost and aeolus her sire by pity softened all the air is calm while she sits brooding on her watery nest amidst a cloud of frankincense the priest of elis hegesistratus performs the rites of divination awful thus at length unfolds the mysteries of time hear all ye nations great mardonius hear the asopian channel is the line of fate the host which passes falls success will crown the assailed the assailant is to slaughter doomed the multitude discouraged by the death of their beloved masistius hear in joy not so mardonius at revenge delayed inaction aggravates his pain his tent receives him solitary there like night within her cavern thus he feeds his grief ambition curb let virtue be thy pride so spoke masistius when we parted last to meet no more  i feel ambition cold benumbed by sorrow  let mardonius think how brief are lifes enjoyments so thy fate dear friend evinces  life itself is short its joys are shorter yet the scanty span adversity can lengthen till we loathe if on the brilliant throne of xerxes placed i held the orient and hesperian worlds my vassals could the millions in my host compel the adamantine gate of death to render back my friend o tortured heart which burnst with friendship of thy generous flame the inestimable object is no more what then is greatness what the imperial robe the diadem and scepter could you fill the void his endless absence has produced in my sad bosom were ye mine how vain the acquisition which my grief would loathe and waked by grief let honor timely shun lest from his grave masistius should arise to shake my pillow with his nightly curse not hecatombs on hecatombs of bulls heaped on his manes not the votive hair nor funeral moan of nations could avail to moderate his ire nor all the power of empires joined to empires guard my sleep at length he sinks in slumber not composed but wanders restless through the wild of dreams end of the twentyfourth book the athenaid book the twentyfifth ere thus each augur in the different camps unmannd the soldier by religious dread euboeas coast sicinus had regained that peopled islands force of ships and arms

mine who has enlarged whatever of wise and great of just and temperate i to nature owe refined my manners and my purest thoughts exalted i my friendship will prolong in gratitude and reverence blessing heaven which thus prefers masistius to extend benevolence to virtue if i fall resume with her the happiest lot my care can recommend statirus though no greek her pupil say in offices humane has not been tardy by her light inspired he went more perfect to a noble grave cast from his wounded courser he oerpowrd by numbers died the body was restored by aristides of unrivaled fame among the just and generous over the dead mardonius rent his vesture and his hair then thus ordained this precious clay embalmed to artamanes bear whose pious zeal a friends remains to sestus will convey thence over the narrow hellespont to reach his native asia and his fathers tomb i then repeated what my virtuous lord expiring uttered let mardonius think how brief are lifes enjoyments virtue lives through all eternity by virtue earned praise too is long  melissa grant me thine commend me to melissa starting spoke the son of gobryas from the shameful cross bid artamanes in her presence free leonidas the spartan all my charge is now accomplished faithfully to all not far was artamanes from the train of persians strode a giant stern in look who thus addressed the satrap prince behold briareus hither by mardonius sent guard of this noble body i appear a witness too of thy disgrace i see these greeks thy victors is the athenian chief among the band themistocles advanced to whom briareus art thou he who dared my lord to battle on the plains of thebes where have thy fears confined thee till this hour that i reproach thee with thy promise pledged but this inglorious enterprise on herds on flocks and helpless peasants was more safe than to abide mardonius in the field i now return what tidings shall i bear from thee great conqueror of beeves and sheep say i am safe themistocles replies in calm derision and the funeral rites thus at my leisure to laconias king perform while your mardonius sleeps in thebes the spirit of leonidas in me reviving shall from oetas distant top shake your pavilions on asopian banks yet in return for his recovered bones i undisputed master of the main will waft masistius to a persian grave thou may depart in safety as thou came the savage hears and sullenly retreats while pious medon thus accosts the dead thou son of honor to thy promise just melissas brother venerates the clay of her avowed protector let my care preserve these relics where no greedy

melissas roof statirus aids the priestess there apart bespake her brother thus my tenderest tears from public notice painfully concealed shall in thy presence have a liberal flow thou gavst me this protector honor truth humanity and wisdom like thy own were his appendage virtue is the same in strangers kindred enemies and friends he won my friendship  might in earlier days have kindled passion  o since fate decreed thee from asopus never to return if by melissas precepts thou inspired did go more perfect to a noble grave i bless the hours and memory shall hold each moment dear when listening to my voice thou satst delighted in the moral strain leonidas and thou may pass the floods of styx together in your happy groves think of melissa welcomed were ye both by her on earth her tongue shall never cease her lyre be never wanting to resound thee pride of asia him the first of greeks in blended eulogy of grateful song she over the dead through half the solemn night a copious web of eloquence unwinds explaining how masistius had consumed nine lunar cycles in assiduous zeal to guard her fane her vassals to befriend how they adored his presence how he won her from the temple to sandauces cure at amaranthas suit within his tent how clemency and justice still abode to awe barbarians how departing sad his last farewell at oetas shrine he gave in words like these unrivaled dame we march against thy country  thou should wish our fall if we prevail be confident in me thy safeguard still  but heaven perhaps ordains that thou shall never want masistius more she pauses now her mental powers sublime collected all this invocation frame o eleutherian sire this virtuous light by thee extinguished proves thy care of greece who of the tribes barbarian now survives to draw thy favor gratitude requires this pure libation of my tears to lave him once my guardian but a guardian new thy gift in medon elevates at last my gratitude to thee serene she closed embraced her brother and retired to rest from oetas heights fresh rose the morning breeze a wellapparelld galley lay unmoord in readiness to sail sandauce drops a parting tear on kind melissas breast by whom dismissed statirus on the corse of great masistius waits the grecian chiefs ead artamanes to the friendly deck in olive wreaths pacific sign attired whence he the fervor of his bosom pours o may this gale with gentleness of breath replace me joyous in my seat of birth as i sincere on horomazes call to send the dove of peace whose placid wing the oriental and hesperian world may feel composing enmity and thirst of mutual havoc that my grateful roof may then admit themistocles and all those noble grecians who sustained my head their captive thrice but ah what founts of blood will fate still open to overflow the earth yet may your homes inviolate remain imparting long the fullness of those joys which by your bounty i shall soon possess he ceased the struggle of sandauces heart suppressed her voice and now the naval pipe collects the rowers at the signal shrill they cleave with equal strokes the malian floods meantime a vessel underneath the lee of locris coasting plies the rapid oar in sight she veers and lodging in her sails the wind transverse across the haven skims till on sperchean sands she rests her keel themistocles was musing on the turns of human fortune and the jealous eye of stern republics vigilantly bent against successful greatness yet serene prepared for every possible reverse in his own fortune he the present thought of persians changed from foes to friends enjoyed when lo sicinus landed swift his lord in words like these the faithful man approached from aristides hail asopus flows still undisturbed by war between the hosts inactive each the other to assail inflexibly their augurs have forbid the camp which ceres shall the best supply will gain the palm mardonius then must fight to our advantage both of time and place themistocles replies and

of oeta witness to his glorious fate but fifty vessels deep with laden stores i first detach that general greece may share in our superfluous plenty want shall waste mardonian numbers while profusion flows round aristides to protect my friends the important freight three thousand warlike spears must be embarked you leaders now decide who shall with me thermopylae maintain who join the grecian camp first medon rose from thy successful banner to depart believe my feet reluctant from his cross when i delivered lacedaemons king my life a boon his friendship once bestowed i then devoted in the face of heaven to vindicate his manes what my joy if i survive if perish what my praise to imitate his virtue greece demands in his behalf a sacrifice like this from me who dying only shall discharge the debt i owe him where so well discharge as at asopus in the general shock of greece and asia but the hundred spears which have so long accompanied my steps through all their wandrings are the only force my wants require the rest of locrian arms shall with leonteus thy control obey poised on his shield and cased in carian steel whence issued luster like phoebean rays thus haliartus me in peasantweeds leonidas respected though my heart then by unshaken gratitude was bound my humble state could only feel not act a soldier now my efforts i must join with godlike medons to avenge the wrongs of spartas king but first the soldiers skill my recent acquisition let my arm forever lose if once my heart forget the generous chief whose service tried my arm who made acanthe mine my present zeal his manly justice will forbear to chide the priest of delphi next athenian friend i have a daughter on cadmean plains my amarantha from no other care than to be nearer that excelling child would

augur here the nearest but most awful is a cave oracular lebadias ancient boast where jupiter trophonius is adored not far beyond copaeaes neighboring lake which thou must pass with costly presents

none but he shall with your god confer transactions past to hegesistratus he now details his heart unfolding nor conceals the event in asias camp when aemnestus bold the spartan legate prompted as by heaven him singled out the victim to atone the death of spartas king their changing course of navigation now suspends their words against the influx of cephissus down lebadian vales in limpid flow

attractive elegance of art looks from the summit and invites the feet of wondering strangers to ascend the prince by his conductor is instructed thus observe yon dome thou first must enter there alone there fervent in devotion bow before two statues one of genius good of fortune fair the other at the word mardonius enters chance directs his eye to that expressive form of genius good whose gracious lineaments sedately sweet recall masistius to the gloomy chief o melancholy who can give thee praise not sure the gentle them thy weight oerwhelms but thou art wholesome to intemprate minds in vain by

heaven relenting will to me assign a genius good he bears no other name than of masistius oh thou spirit blessed for sure thy virtue dwells with endless peace can thou her seat relinquishing awhile unseen or visible protect thy friend in this momentous crisis of his fate or will thou if permitted ah no more think of mardonius fierce ambitious proud but as corrected by thy precepts mild who would forego his warmest hopes of fame of power and splendor gladly to expire if so the myriads trusted to his charge he might preserve nor leave whole nations fallen a prey to vultures on these hostile plains come and be witness to the tears which flow sure tokens of sincerity in me not used to weep who humbled at thy loss melt like a maiden of her love bereaved by unrelenting death my demon kind do

presented by his former guide a second priest receives conductor new through nightresembling shadows which obscure the sleepy stream unmoving to the sight or moving mute a fountain they approach one of hercynas sources from the pores of spongy rock an artificial vase of jetty marble in its round collects the slowdistilling moisture hence the priest a brimming chalice to mardonius bears whom in these words he solemnly accosts this fount is named of lethe who consults our subterranean deity must quaff oblivion here of all preceding thoughts sensations and affections reach the draught if such oblivious sweets this cup contains i gladly grasp it cries the chief and drinks ascending thence a mazy walk they tread where all the seasons florid children show their gorgeous raiment and their

indeed a goddess i revere now to mardonius if some dream or sign prognosticate success and thou imprint the admonitions of unerring heaven in his retentive mind this arm this sword shall win thy further favor to record his name and glory on the rolls of time this said with lighter steps he quits the fane the mercuries conduct him to a bath fed from hercynas fairer second source in shade sequestered close while there his limbs are disarrayd of armor to assume a civil garment soon as spotless streams have purified his frame the priest who stands without in ecstacy of joy remarks the rich mardonian offerings on their way by servitors transported to enlarge the holy treasure instant he prepares for sacrifice a sable ram is slain fresh from ablution lo mardonius comes in linen vesture fine and white as down of paphian doves a sash of tincture bright which rivalld floras brilliancy of dye engirds his loins majestical his brows a wreath sustain lebadian sandals ease his steps exchanging thus his martial guise like some immortal of a gentler mold than mars he moves so phoebus when he sets lavd by the nymphs of tethys in their grot of coral after his diurnal toil repairs his splendours and his rosy track of morn resumes with partial eyes the priest explores the victims entrails and reports each sign auspicious with a willing tongue then to mardonius thee boeotias friend magnificently pious to her gods thee i pronounce a votary approved by this boeotian deity now seek in confidence the cavern but the rites demand that first an image thou approach which none but those

white in circular dimension this upholds the weight of polished obelisks by zones of brass connected ornamental fence a wicket opens to the advancing prince steps moveable the attentive priest supplies by whom instructed to the awful chasm below profound but narrow where the god his inspiration breathes the intrepid son of gobryas firm descends his nether limbs up to the loins he plunges downward drawn as by a whirlpool of some rapid flood at once the body is from sight concealed entranced he lies in subterranean gloom less dark than superstition she who caused his bold adventure with her wonted fumes of perturbation from his torpid state awakes him rather in a dream suggests that he is waking on a naked bank he seems to stand before him sleeps a pool edged round by desert mountains in their height obscuring heaven without impulsive oars without a sail spontaneous flies a bark above the stagnant surface which untouched maintains its silence on the margin rests the skiff presenting to the heros view an aged fire of penetrating ken his weight inclining on an ebon staff with serpents wreathed who beckning thus began if feed of gobryas thou would know thy fate embark

here dwell the fatal sisters at their toil the destinies thou see the thread newdrawn is thine mardonius instantly a voice which shakes the grot and all the concave round sounds aemnestus swift the direful shears the line dissever and mardonius whirled back from trophonian gloom is found supine within the marble parapet which fenced the caverns mouth the watchful priest conducts the agitated satrap mute and sad back to mnemosynes abode his eyes are sternly fixed now prince the seer began divulge whatever thou have heard and seen before this goddess priest he said suspend thy function now importunate remove the seer withdrawn the persian thus alone then be it so to luxury and power magnificence and pleasure i must bid farewell leonidas let greece extol me too shall persia goddess to thy charge a name so dearly purchased i consign this said in haste his armor he resumes not as leonidas composed yet brave amid the gloom of trouble he prefers death to dishonor over the holy ground he pensive treads a parallel to saul returned from endors necromantic cell in sadness still magnanimously firm never to survive his dignity but face predicted ruin and in battle slain preserve his fame mardonius finds the gates his friends rejoins glides down cephissian floods copaeaes lake repasses and is lodged in his own tent by midnight sullen there he sits disturbed he shuns repose access forbids to all but lamachus intrudes nefarious counselor in fell device surpassing fellest tyrants now has night upcalld her clouds black signal for the winds to burst their dungeons cataracts of rain mix with blue fires the ethereal concave groans stern looks mardonius on the daring greek who in his wiles confiding thus began supreme over nations numberless in arms sole hope of asia thy return i greet with joy thy absence has employed my soul to meditate the means the certain means for thee to prosper lo the active son of neocles who keeps the oetaean pass lo aristides in the camp of greece remain thy only obstacles her power of them deprived would moulder and disperse devoid of counsel with an edgless sword uncommon danger stimulates the wise to search for safety through uncommon paths much more when power when empire and renown hang on a crisis if a serpents guile behind the pillows of such foes might lurk if darting thence his unsuspected sting might pierce their bosoms if the ambient air could by mysterious alchymy be changed to viewless poison and their cups infect with death such help would policy disdain have thou not hardy and devoted slaves try their fidelity and zeal no life can be secure against a daring hand two grecian deaths confirm thee lord of greece he ceased expecting praise but honor burns fierce in the satraps elevated soul dare thou suggest such baseness to the son of gobryas furious he exalts his voice guards seize and strangle this pernicious wolf time but to wonder at his sudden fate the ready guards afford him and the wretch fit retribution for his crimes receives this act of eastern equity expels the satraps gloom now grecian gods he cries smile on my justice from the assassins point i guard your heroes by yourselves i swear my preservation or success assured by such unmanly turpitude i spurn his mind is cheered a tender warmth succeeds predominant in amorous eastern hearts a balm to grief and victor mild of rage the

thy worth i felt a growing flame but never again could win thy favor in the harams round disconsolate neglected i have walked have seen my gay companions to thy arms preferred professing passion far unlike to mine mardonius now despair suggests to give thee proof of undissembled truth which no neglect has cooled to thy success thy glory my virginity is vowed in this bright raiment with collected powers of beauty i at aristides feet will throw me prostrate to the alluring face of my progenitrix a victim fell the assyrian captain holofernes proud so shall thy foe of athens fall by mine the meritorious and heroic deed soon will erase the transitory stain o if successful let bethulia hope for thy reviving love mardonius starts in dubious trouble whether to chastise so fierce a spirit or its zeal admire he hesitates compassion for the sex at length prevails suggesting this reply fell magnanimity enormous proof of such intemprate passion i forgive while i reject thy proffered crime

or is this my crime no thou art just my conscious spirit feels thy approbation of mardonius now but from his breast the dire event expels all soft and amorous cares his vast command his long inaction and the dread of shame recur he quits the chamber to his own repairing summons mindarus and firm in aspect speaks the morning soon will dawn draw down our slingers archers and the skilled in flying darts to line the asopian brink thence gall the grecians whose diurnal wants that flood relieves then mindarus o chief this instant sure intelligence is brought that from the isthmus to supply their camp a convoy rich in plenty is descried advancing toward cithaerons neighboring pass mardonius quick no moment shall be lost bid tiridates with five thousand horse possess that pass and pouring on the plain secure the precious store this said he seeks a short repose and mindarus withdraws in arms anon to paragon the morn the morn newrising whose vermillion hand draws from the brightning front of heaven serene the humid curtains of tempestuous night mardonius mounts his courser on his bank the godlike figure soon asopus views end of the twentyseventh book the athenaid book the twentyeighth while lamentation for masistius dead depressed the persians undisturbed the greeks to all their camp refreshment had derived from clear asopus to the accustomed edge of his abounding flood they now

extinguishes the embers cherished long by selftormenting memory and warmth of fruitless passion present too his chief his friend and kinsman from a fiery steed mardonius rules and stimulates the fight like boreas riding on a stormy cloud whence issue darts of lightning mixed with hail in rattling showers the enemies dispersed embolden mindarus to ford the stream in guidance swift of cavalry expert with unresisted squadrons he careers along the field inviolate the flood he guards each hostile quarter he insults now gobryas son unfettered from the bonds of superstitious terrors joyful sees in

anxious all exhaust a night disturbed the bravest grieve the most lest through severe necessity they quit inglorious their position morning shines when frequent signals from the external guards near and remote successive rise to arms all rush along the spacious public way from megara obscuring dust ascends the sound of trampling hoofs and laden wheels with shouts of multitude is heard behold forth from the cloud a messenger of joy sicinus breaks of bold auxiliar bands forerunner swift and unexpected aid in copious stores at megaras wide port newlanded from thermopylae the camp admits and

dear to all o brave and generous medon from their tents the chiefs assemble when sicinus spoke pausanius general of united greece accept these ample succors from the hand of provident themistocles possessed of oetas passes he the persian host now with impenetrable toils besets like beasts of prey entangled by the skill of some experienced hunter thou receive just aristides from timotheas love a suit of armor new in chalcis framed without luxuriant ornament or gold the shield an emblem of thy soul displays truth equity and wisdom hand in hand this for her children and thy own consigned to her euboean roof and pious care she bids thee lift and conquer thou restore the little exiles in their native homes to dwell in peace her gift she adds derives its only value from the wearers worth in smiles like saturn at the tribute pure of fruits and flowers in singleness of heart paid by religion of the golden age timotheas gift the righteous man receives not righteous more than practiced to endure heroic labors soon by matchless deeds to justify the giver he began confederated warriors who withstand a tyrants power unanimous confess your debt to great themistocles the lord of alladmird timothea he and i evince the fruits of concord ancient foes through her united cheerful we sustain our public charge from general union greece expects her safety him success has crowned in arms and counsel whether on the main his naval flag he spread or shook the land with his triumphant step o heroborn pausanias glowing with herculean blood now under thee let aristides hope to share success nor tarnish with disgrace his armor new behold yon river gleams with hostile arms those standards on the left wellknown to attic eyes are proudly borne by native medes and persians treacherous thebes lifts her cadmean banner on the right a second time mardonius forms his host to proffer battle he perhaps may ford asopus which tisamenus the learned in divination has forbid our steps to pass thy former numbers swift arrange new from a march let these auxiliars guard the camp to him pausanias thus apart athenian hear your citizens are versed in this barbarian warfare yet unknown to us let spartans and athenians change their station you an adversary tried at marathon and foiled will best oppose to vanquish grecians we accustomed long will yon boeotians and thessalians face such is my will concise the attic sage thou have commanded what my willing thoughts themselves devised but waited first to hear well can thou fight pausanias i will strive to imitate thy deeds and thy renown on whose increase our liberty and laws depend this said they part behind the rear soon from the left the athenians from the right the spartans file their stations they exchange not by mardonius unperceived he moves his medes and persians to the post of thebes whence still the spartan phalanx they confront the thebans still the athenian this observed pausanias swift to aristides sends strict charge his old position to resume now indignation high through all the tribes of athens rages noble pride and sense of just desert in exclamation fierce break from the exalted populace who claim their soil for parent gods from wing to wing must we like servile mercenary bands like helots slaves to lacedaemon born be hurried thus obsequious to control from an imperious spartan tegea first contested our prerogative the pride of sparta next removes us from the post assigned by public judgment we comply must we at her contemptuous nod resume the station we forsook defending greece ourselves meanwhile deserted and betrayed twice have we lost our city what is left of our abandoned residence but dust let greece defend herself let us remove for the last time our standards hoist our sails our floating empire fix on distant shores our household gods our progeny and name on some new soil establish sure to find none so ingrate as this the athenians thus swell with ingenuous ire as ocean boils disturbed by eurus and the rude career of boreas threatening furious to surmount all circumscription but as often a cloud distilling gentle moisture as it glides dissolves the rigor of their boisterous wings till over the main serenity returns so from the mouth of aristides fall composing words insensibly he sooths their justlyirritated minds and calms their just resentment righteousness and truth how prevalent your efforts when applied by placid wisdom in these strains he spoke ye men of athens at laconias call to meet the flower of asias host in fight do ye repine a station which implies preeminence of attic worth a task of all most glorious which the martial race of sparta shuns and you should covet most ye marathonian victors in the fight of greece who trembles at a median garb you are preferred for valor arms the same the same embroidered vestment on their limbs effeminate the same unmanly souls debased by vices and monarchal rule the medes retain as when their vanquished ranks fled heretofore with weapons often tried with confidence by victories increased not now for liberty and greece alone you march to battle but to keep unspoild your trophies won already and the name which marathon and salamis have raised preserve unstained that men may ever say not through your leaders not by fortune there you triumphed but by fortitude innate and liberal vigor of athenian blood he said and marched all follow mute through love of aristides inexpressive love which melts each bosom solemn they proceed though lionlike in courage at his call meek and obedient as the fleecy breed to wonted notes of pans conducting pipe arrived disbanded in their separate tents cecropias tribes exhaust a tedious night unvisited by sleep the morning breaks instead of joy to gratulate her light the tone of sadness from dejected hearts combining sighs and groans in murmur deep alarms the leader aristides show thy countenance amongst us hasty spoke the warriorpoet entering all thy camp enthusiastic sorrow has overwhelmed and every heart unbracd by earliest dawn each left his restless couch their first discourse was calm and filled with narratives distinct of thy accomplishments and worth at length a soldier thus in agitation spoke yet o most excellent of gods o jove this is the man we banished in thy sight the most excelling man whose sole offense was alltranscending merit from his home our impious votes expelled by envys spite seduced we drove him fugitive through greece where still he held ungrateful athens dear for whose redemption from her sloth he roused all greece to arms the soldier closed in floods of anguish instant through the concourse ran contagious grief as if the fiend despair from his black chariot wheeling over their heads in clouds of darkness dropped his poisonous dews of melancholy down to chill the blood unnerve the limbs and fortitude dissolve speed aristides by the immortal powers the feeblest troop of persians in this hour might overcome the tame desponding force of thy dear country mistress long confessed of eloquence and arts of virtue now through thy unerring guidance here the sage withold thy praise good aeschylus  be swift arrange my fellow citizens in arms beneath each ensign of the several tribes i will appear a comforter a friend their public servant aeschylus withdraws soon aristides in his armor new timotheas gift advances from his tent should from his throne the omnipotent descend in visitation of the human race while dreading his displeasure as to earth all heads would bend in reverential awe contrite and conscious of their own misdeeds so look the athenians though in all the pomp of mars arrayed and terrible to half the world in battle down their corslets bright tears trickle tears of penitence and shame to see their injured patriot chief assume in goodness heavens whole semblance as he moves observant by and through the weeping ranks from man to man his liberal hand extends consoling no resentment he could show who none had felt ascending now on high he thus addressed the penitential throng rate not too high my merit nor too low your own depreciate error is the lot of man but lovely in the eye of heaven is sense of error better will you fight as better men from these auspicious tears which evidence your worth and please the gods with strength and valor equity of mind uniting doubles fortitude your wives your progeny and parents laws and rites were never so well secured the warlike bard rose next requested by the several tribes in their behalf i promise to thy rule all acquiescence bid them fight retreat maintain or yield a station bid them face innumerable foes surmount a fosse deep as the sea or bulwarks high as rocks subordination vigilance contempt of toil and death thy dictates shall command the oilean hero timon and the seed of lygdamis are present who encamped among the athenians they admire the chief nor less the people while the term of morn was passing thus a summons to his tent calls aristides aemnestus there salutes him attic friend a new event in spartas quarter is to thee unknown from me accept the intelligence the sun was newly risen when over the asopian flood an eastern herald passed behind him towrd a giantsizd barbarian he approached our camp before pausanias brought he spoke i am briareus of mardonian guards commander through my delegated mouth thus says the son of gobryas i have heard among the greeks your prowess vaunted high ye men of sparta that in martial ranks you either kill or perish but i find fame is a liar i expected long you would defy me on the field of war have i not seen you shift from wing to wing the task imposing on the athenians twice to face the medes and persians while yourselves sought with our servants to contend in arms ye brave in name alone since you decline to challenge us we prime of eastern blood with equal numbers challenge you to prove that you possess what rumor has proclaimed the boldest hearts in greece acknowledge else your boasted valor buried in the grave with your leonidas overthrown and slain pausanias gave no answer not through fear but humor torpid and morose which wrapped in clouds of scorn his brow consulting none with silent pride the giant he dismissed the challenger in triumph turning back repassed the river aemnestus paused a second messenger appeared behold in blooming vigor flushed by rapid haste young menalippus from the reverend seer megistias sprung athenian chief he said bring down thy active missileweapond troops on their immediate help pausanias calls a cloud of hostile cavalry invests laconias quarter javelins arrows darts in sheets discharged have choked our last resource gargaphias fountain and our heavy bands perplex and harrass aristides hears and issues swift his orders while the youth continues thus thou knewst of old my sire who at thermopylae expired the just consort together aristides thus ingenuous youth for greece thy father bled a spotless victim but for ever lives companion with leonidas in fame by heaven protected thou shall live to see their death atoned the period is not far come on my force is ready medon arms with haliartus once the shepherdswain in oetas pass to menalippus known whom both embrace with gratulation kind all march but reach not spartas distant wing before the persians sated with success filled back to join mardonius secret he was communing with mirzes most renowned among the magi thus the satrap closed through each occurrence undisguisd o sage my circumstantial narrative has run from where i entered first trophonian ground till my descent and vision in the cave speak frankly mirzes  nor believe thy words whatever black presages they contain subjoined to all trophonius has foretold can change my firm resolves or blunt my sword solicitude for persia to excess misled thee satrap to that graven god rejoins the magus where if ought besides the craft of grecian mercenary priests it was the demon arimanius ruled he long has prompted that elean seer who blunts thy sword by divination false what thou do vision call was empty dream imagination heated and disturbed a texture wild and various intermixed with illmatchd images of things which last oppressed thy mind thy own distemper framed the unreal grot where destinies of air in apparition cut thy vital thread their act was thine the oracle thy own all vague creation of thy erring sleep briareus enters at his tidings glad which ostentation sounded thus exults mardonius say thou lacedaemons chief was mute when my defiance shook his ear hence to the winds ye auguries and signs ye dreams and mysteries of greece avaunt thou horomazes not in marble fanes nor woods oracular and caves do dwell it is the power of evil there misguides insensate mortals and misguided me o artemisia now shall gobryas son look only where no mystery can lurk on every manly duty nothing dark the tracks of honor shades to chiefs select greek and barbarian summoned he reveals his fixed resolves in council they disperse to execute his will among the rest young alexander macedonias lord speeds to his quarters in the solemn bower of dirce there mardonius had decreed a cenotaph of marble newlyraisd to his deplored masistius there the queen of macedon phoebean timons child bright amarantha like an evening bird whose trill delights a melancholy grove often with harmonious skill in delphian strains the ingenuous practice of her maiden days sung of her father and masistius good that friend that known protector she her lute was now in cadence with dircaean rills attuning vocal melody she breathed which at another season might have won her lord from sadness sighing he her song thus interrupts ah consort dear as fair i come from persias council where the son of gobryas urged by fear of sudden want through his wide host nor animated less by spartan silence at the challenge proud his herald bore determines to reject the augurs warnings over the stream he means to lead the embattled nations and surprise ere dawn at least assail the camp of greece in every station if she quits her lines then will his numerous cavalry surround her heavy phalanx on the level space o that my ancestor had never left his grecian home in argos nor acquired emathias crown i never then compelled had borne reluctant arms against a race by friendship linked affinity and blood with me and mine what horror cries the queen while fear surmises that my husbands sword may blindly cut my fathers vital thread but not alone such parricide to shun should wake thy efforts alexander no thou must do more our mutual words recall when thou to athens by mardonius sent did from thy fruitless ambassy rejoin me in trachiniae whence the barbarous chief renewed his march to lay cecropian domes in fresh destruction what a lot is mine thou said if xerxes triumph i become a slave in purple should the greeks prevail should that euboean conqueror the son of neocles be sent the athenian scourge i interrupted thus awhile dear lord we must submit to wear the galling mask necessity imposes new events are daily scattered by the restless palm of fortune some will prove propitious wise to all benignant aristides served by us in season will befriend our state behold that season come let grecian blood which warms thy veins inspire thy prudent tongue this night the athenian hero to apprise of all these tidings thus secure the greeks against surprisal timely thus oblige the first of men and magnify thy name in greece for ages here the youthful king though by oppressive xerxes forced to war shall i abuse the confidence reposed by great mardonius qualified to win regard at first which intercourse augments i will do all by honors rules allowed will act a neutral part withdraw my troops even at the hazard of my crown and life if such my queens injunction ah forbear to frown what means this flushing of thy cheek must i betray mardonius to his foes she spoke abrupt he started at her look if forced obedience to a tyrant binds if more than i mardonius holds thy heart who has thy dearest confidence abused thou will discredit my accusing tongue could from this empty monument the shade of just masistius rise his awful voice would verify a story till this hour from thee concealed my virgin hand in blood of one barbarian miscreant once i stained not to pollute my hymeneal state nor lay mardonius gasping at my feet like mithridates in the streets of thebes this hateful camp for delphi i forsook fled from a lawless and presumptuous flame insulting me thy queen who boast descent from holy timon while for his behoof collecting greeks against their countrys cause thyself was absent and mardonius left my only guardian scorning every tie his daring importunity of love assailed thy consorts ear what hope what trust in such barbarians all their faith expired with good masistius should the greeks be foiled how long will macedon thy realm how long will amarantha be securely held against a satrap whose ungoverned will may covet both of this o prince be sure her part of shame will amarantha bear but brief shall be its date the poniard still which once preserved my honor i possess to cut my period of dishonor short the prince impatient yet attentive heard her words when thus the measure of his wrath from his full bosom rapidly oerflowd o impious breach of hospitable ties o violation base of rights and laws exacting swift revenge from heaven and man from me the first unparalled in form o like the sister of thy delphian god immaculate did sacrilegious hands this pure abode of chastity assail with profanation less a friend to greece than foe to false mardonius now i go he said and ordered forth his swiftest steed by moonlight twinkling on a shaded track he urged his secret way beyond the springs asopian whence an outlet short and close through mount cithaeron to the adjacent line of aristides led meantime the sound of steps advancing amarantha heard she heard and saw mardonius he his pace stopped short inclining with obeisance low his stately frame through terror and amaze to earth she rigid grew of power to fly deprived he distant spoke imperial dame that he offended once mardonius makes a penitent confession o that fault to no innate discourtesy impute but eastern manners not as grecian pure the ignorance which erred by thee is changed to veneration from my presence here which never before intruded on this seat of thy retirement do not too severe a new offense interpret rest assured a solemn cause impels he silent waits nor moves till gliding silently away like dian fair and chaste but less severe the queen withdrew and toward a gallant chief perhaps by her devices near his fall thus far relented for the private wrong the frank atonement raised a generous sigh against the public enemy of greece unquenchable she burned now left alone before the cenotaph he kneeled and spoke tomorrow o tomorrow let my helm blaze in thy beams auspicious spirit bright whose name adorns this honorary tomb the weight of asias mighty weal the weight of fifty myriads on thy friend augments from hour to hour yet purged of gloomy thoughts clear of ambition save to win the palm of victory for xerxes i approach thy suppliant thou an intercessor pure for me deceived by grecian seers and gods before the throne of horomazes stand that he may bless my standards if alone to guard so many worshippers and spread by their success his celebrated name through each hesperian clime now grant a sign masistius ere thy faithful friend depart fixed as he is to vanquish or to fall he ceased quick rapture dims his cheated eyes he sees in thought a canopy of light descending over the tomb in joy he speeds to preparation for the destined march end of the twentyeighth book the athenaid book the twentyninth among the greeks their first nocturnal watch was near its period from laconias wing returned the athenian leader thus bespake sicinus worthy of my trust give ear within six hours the army will decamp to choose a friendlier station so the chiefs in general council as gargaphia choked withholds her wonted succor have resolved at junos fane yet undespoild though near plataeas ruins every band is charged to reassemble suddenly appears a sentinel who speaks a stranger near the trenches waits thee us in peaceful words saluting he importunate requires thy instant presence aristides hastes to whom the stranger bulwark of this camp hear credit weigh the tidings which i bear mardonius pressed by fear of threatening want at nights fourth watch the fatal stream will pass inflexibly determined though forbid by each diviner to assail your host with all his numbers i against surprise am come to warn you thee alone i trust my name revealing i o man divine i who thus hazard both my realm and life am alexander macedonian friend of athens kindly on a future day remember me he said and spurred his steed back through the opening of cithaerons hill by aristides instantly detached sicinus calls each leader to attend pausanias atticas great captain joins the council full his tidings he relates concluding thus with exhortation sage we destitute of water had resolved to change our station now without a pause we must anticipate the appointed hour for this retreat nor lingering tempt the force of squadrons swift to intercept our march all move your standards let mardonius bring a host discouraged by their augurs voice who are forbid to pass the fatal stream but are compelled by famine and despair to inauspicious battle we to heaven obedient heavens assistance shall obtain a situation safeguard to our flanks against superior and surrounding horse in sight of burnt plataea of her fanes defaced and violated gods i know there will assure you conquest all assent at once the different grecians who compose the center lift their ensigns over the plain first swiftly toward plataean junos dome speeds adimantus in array more slow the rest advance cleander guards the rear brave youth whom chance malicious will bereave of half the laurels to his temples due the athenians arm delibrate in whose train illustrious medon ranks a faithful troop his hundred locrians haliartus there there timons few but generous delphians stand by aristides all enjoined to watch laconias host that sternlytutord race to passion cold he knew in action slow in consultation torpid anxious long he waits and fears the eyelids of the morn too soon unclosing may too much reveal sicinus hastening to laconias camp finds all confused subordination lost in altercation wondrous in that breed of discipline and manners nor less strange than if the laws of nature in the sky dissolved should turn the moon and planets loose from their accustomed orbits to obey the sun no longer when his first command pausanias issued for the march nor thought of disobedience to disturb his pride one leader amompharetus whose band of pitane revered him as the first among the brave refusal stern opposed protesting firm he never would retreat before barbarians aemnestus swift callicrates and others long approved in arms entreat the spartan to submit nor disconcert the salutary plan of general council sullen he replies not of that council i will never disgrace the spartan name but all the greeks withdrawn expect our junction at saturnias dome callicrates and aemnestus plead would thou expose thy countrymen to face unaided yonder multitude of medes untried by us in combat yes rejoins the pertinacious man ere yield to flight his troop applauded now contention harsh resounded high exhausting precious hours the spartan march retarding when arrived sicinus witness to the wild debate at length pausanias knit his haughty brow at amompharetus and spoke weak man thou art insane the chastisement thy due our time allows not instant march or stay behind and perish in his twofold grasp the restive spartan lifting from the ground a ponderous stone before the genrals feet placed it and thus against dishonest flight from strangers vile i rest my suffrage there nor will forsake it to sicinus turned pausanias tell the athenians what thou see i by cithaerons side to junos fane am hastening charge their phalanx to proceed sicinus back to aristides flies his ready phalanx from the lines he draws winged with his horse and bowmen yet his course suspends at spartas camp there sullen fixed like some old oaks deeprooted knotted trunk which has endured the tempestbreathing months of thrice a hundred winters yet remains unshaken there amidst his silent troop sat amompharetus to him the sage unwise though brave transgressing all the laws of discipline though spartan born and trained arise overtake thy general and rejoin thy countrys mercy by some rare exploit win to forgive thy capital default excess of courage where pausanias armed with power unlimited in war where all the spartan captains in persuasion failed required not less than jove himself or jove in aristides to prevail uprose the warrior late inflexible yet slow in strictest regularity of march led his wellordered files correcting thus the erring spartan aristides swept across the plain to fill the general host not yet the twilight harbinger of morn had overcome the stars the persian scouts who ranged abroad observing that no sound was heard no watchword through the grecian lines adventured nigh and found an empty space swift they apprisd mardonius who had formed his whole array encircled by his chiefs greek and barbarian first he gave command that every hand provide a blazing torch to magnify his terrors and with light facilitate pursuit then gladsome thus addressed his friends of thessaly and thebes now larissaean thorax and the rest of aleuadian race now theban lords judge of the spartans justly vaunted high for unexampled prowess them you saw first change their place imposing on the sons of athens twice the formidable task to face my chosen persians next they gave to my defiance no reply and last are fled before me can your augurs show a better omen than a foe dismayed but kind allies to you my friendly care shall now be proved these thunderbolts of war as you esteem them will mardonius choose for his opponents level your attack entire against the athenians none i dread yet by the sun less terrible to me is that pausanias head of spartas race than aristides him masistius loved if you oerthrow preserve him in the name of your own gods i charge you mithra shine on me no longer if in grateful warmth confessing every benefit received i do not clasp that guardian of my friend now persians mount your bold nisaean steeds alert your targets grasp your lances poise the word is cyrus royal spirit look on me derived from thy illustrious blood yet not in me illustrious if this day my hand or courage faint look down on these sons of thy matchless veterans the fire which at thy breath overspread the vanquished east light in their offspring that the loud report of their achievements on asopian banks far as the floods of ganges may proclaim the western world a vassal to thy throne he said and spurred his courser through the ford he dashes followed by the impetuous speed of tall equestrian bands in armor scaled with gold on trappings of embroidered gloss superbly seated persians next and medes advance an infantry select whose mail brightgilt or silvered over augments the light of sparkling brands innumerably waved by nations plunging through the turbid flood in tumult rude emblazing as they pass the skies the waters and with direst howl distracting both like savage wolves they rush as with ferocious fangs to rend the greeks to gnaw their flesh and satiate in their blood the greedy thirst of massacre in chief here mindarus commands by midias joined and tiridates powerless all to curb much more to marshal such barbarian throngs which like a tumbling tide on level strands when new the moon impels it soon overwhelmed the asopian mead or like the mightier surge when ireful neptune strikes the oceans bed profound upheavd the bottom lifts and rolls a ridge of liquid mountains over the abodes of some offending nation while the heavens with coruscation red his brother jove inflames and rocks with thunders roar the poles the auxiliar greeks compact and silent march in strength five myriads in arrangement just the foot by leontiades the wings of horse by thorax and emathias king were led now long before the unwieldy mass of his disordered multitude advanced mardonius rushing through the vacant lines of lacedaemon toward cithaeron bent his swift career faint rays began to streak the third clear morning of that fruitful month the last in summers train immortal day which all the muses consecrate to fame o thou exalted over the laurelld train high as the sweet calliope is throned above her sisters on the tuneful mount o father hear great homer let one ray from thy celestial light an humble son of thine illuminate lest freedom mourn her chosen race dishonored in these strains thou too my eldest brother who enjoyst the paradise thy genius has portrayd propitious smile lend vigor to a muse who in her love of freedom equals thine but to sustain her labors from thy store must borrow language sentiment and verse cithaerons ridge from where asopus rose stretched to plataea with a southern fence confining one broad level which the floods from their hesperian head in eastward flow meandring parted over the mountains foot his course pausanias destined where the soil abrupt and stony might the dread career of persias cavalry impede his ranks accompanied by tegeas faithful breed had measured now ten furlongs of their march half over the plain to reach the friendly ground then halted near an eleusinian dome of ceres thence they moved but timely first were joined by amompharetus at length the chosen track was gained pausanias cast his eyes below first northward and surveyed between the river and his empty camp a blaze involving all the plain the yell of mouths barbarian of unnumberd feet the impetuous tread which crushed the groaning turf the neigh of horses and their echoing hoofs the insulting clash of shields and sabres shook the theater of mountains hollowvoicd their cavities rebellowd and enlarged the hideous sound his eyes the orient dawn attracted next saturnias roof he viewed but distant still around whose sacred walls the firstdeparted grecians stood in arms beneath widefloating banners wished more nigh there was the genius of plataea seen by fancys ken a hovering mourner seen over his renowned but desolated seat one mass of ruins mountainous he marked the athenians traversing the meads below in full battalia resolute sedate without one shield in disarray they moved to join the general host beyond the stream in prospect rose the battlements of thebes whose sons perfidious but in battle firm with phalanges of other hostile greeks spread on the bank and menace to surmount the shallow current for some dire attempt to aemnestus marching by his side pausanias turns the army he commands to halt while mastring all unmanly fear his haughty phlegm serenely thus fulfils a leaders function spartan we in vain precipitate our junction with allies at junos distant fane the hour is past the pitanean mutineer the cause see thou yon persian squadrons they precede the whole barbarian multitude the storm is gathering nigh we separate must abide the heavy weight of this unequal shock unless the athenians still in sight impart a present aid a herald swift he sends to aristides with this weighty charge all greece is now in danger and the blood of hercules in me athenian help is wanted here their missileweapond force last he addressed tisamenus provide the sacrifice for battle  warriors form slain is the victim but the inspecting seer reveals no sign propitious now full nigh the foremost persian horse discharge around their javelins darts and arrows spartas chief in calm respect of inauspicious heaven directs each soldier at his foot to rest the passive shield submissive to endure the assault and watch a signal from the gods a second time unfavorable prove the victims entrails unremitted showers of pointed arms distribute wounds and death oh discipline of sparta patient stands the wounded soldier sees a comrade fall yet waits permission from his chief to shield his own or brothers head among the rest callicrates is pierced a mortal stroke his throat receives him celebrate o muse him in historic rolls delivered down to admiration of remotest climes through latest ages these expiring words beyond olympian chaplets him exalt beyond his palms in battle not to die for greece but dying ere my sword is drawn without one action worthy of my name i grieve he said and fainting on the breast of aemnestus breathed in spouting blood his last departing thy attendant meet leonidas in regions of the blessed a second victim bleeds the gathering foes to multitude are grown the showers of death increase then melted into flowing grief pausanian pride he toward the fane remote of juno lifting his afflicted eyes thus suppliant spoke o goddess let my hopes be not defeated whether to obtain a victory so glorious or expire without dishonor to herculean blood amidst the prayer tegean chileus free from stern control of lacedaemons laws no longer waits inactive but his band leads forth and firmly checks the insulting foe the sacrifice is prosperous and the word for general onset by pausanias given then as a lion from his native range confined a captive long if once his chain he breaks with mane erect and eyes of fire asserts his freedom rushing in his strength resistless forth so spartas phalanx turns a face tremendous on recoiling swarms of squadrond persians who to ceres fane are driven but there mardonius like the god of thunders ranging over the ethereal vault thick clouds on clouds impregnated with storms his chosen troops embattles bows and darts rejecting gallantly to combat close they urge undaunted efforts and to death their ground maintain in courage or in might not to the greeks inferior but in arms in discipline and conduct parties small or single warriors here with vigor wield the battleax and sabre others rush among the spears to wrench away or break by strength of hands the weapons of their foes but fiercest was the contest where sublime the son of gobryas from a snowwhite steed shot terror there selected warriors charged a thousand vetrans by their fathers trained who shared renown with cyrus on the right close to his genrals side briareus grasped a studded mace pangaeus on the left named from a thracian hill the bristly front of spartas phalanx with intrepid looks mardonius faced and thundered out these words come twicedefyd pausanias if thou hearst thy spartan prowess on mardonius try pausanias heard but shunned retorting words in saturnine disdain laconic thus his men addressing yours the soldiers part the generals mine advance not but receive these loose barbarians on your steady points not one of persias breed though early trained so strong a javelin as mardonius lancd or in its aim so true three brothers graced the foremost line of sparta natives all of sweet amyclae all in age and arms mature their splendid lineage from the stock of tyndarus deriving them on earth three javelins whirled successive laid supine an effort of mardonius three in rank behind partake the same resistless doom three bold companions in the hardy chase of boars on green taygetus supplied with weapons new the phalanx still to gore he perseveres unwearied not unlike some irritated porcupine of size portentous darting his envenomed quills through each assailant in laconias front so many warriors and their weapons fallen leave in her triple tire of pointed steel a void for swift impression of her foes in rush briareus and pangaeus huge whose maces send fresh numbers to the shades the opening widens on his vaulting steed mardonius follows like ensanguind mars by his auxiliars grim dismay and rage preceded rivalling the lightnings beams the heros sabre bright and rapid wheels aloft in air a comet thus inflames the cheek of night pale mortals view in dread the unwonted luster transient though it be among the lights of heaven pausanias roused advancing at briareus points his lance meantime six spartans of the younger class assail mardonius one his bridle grasped the persian sabre at the shoulder close lopped off the audacious arm another stooped to seize the chieftains foot and drag him down poised on his stirrup he in sunder smote the spartans waist another yet approached who at a blow was cloven to the chin two more the generous horse uprearing dashed maimed and disabled to the ground the last his teeth disfigured and his weight oppressed as some tallmasted ship on every side assailed by pinnaces and skiffs whose strength is number drives her welldirected prow through all their feeble clusters while her chief elate contemplates from her lofty deck the hostile keels upturnd and floating dead wherever she steers victorious so the steed nisaean tramples on laconian slain triumphant so mardonius from his seat looks down but fate amidst his triumph shows briareus yielding to a forceful blow of stern pausanias and pangaeus pierced by amompharetus their giant bulks thrown prostrate crash three longprotended rows of spartan spears widebranching thus huge oaks by age decayed or twisted from the roots by rending whirlwinds in their ponderous fall lay desolate the under shrubs and trees of young unstable growth more awful still another object strikes the satraps eye with nodding plumes and formidable stride lo aemnestus asias general feels emotions now which trouble not degrade his generous spirit not as priams son on sight of dire achilles thoughts of flight possess mardonius but to wait the foe and if to die with honor die if live enjoy a life of fame his giant guard around him close one levels at the casque of aemnestus but the weighty mace slides over the spartans slanting shield and spends its rage in dust the stooping giant leaves his flank unguarded and admits a stroke which penetrates the entrails down he sinks another tower of asias battle strewn in hideous ruin soon a second bleeds a third a fourth the fifth in posture stands to crush the victor with a blow wellaimd him menalippus at the brawny pit of his uplifted arm transpiercing deep disables aemnestus struggles long to grapple with his victim and invokes leonidas aloud the active son of gobryas plants throughout the spartan shield a wood of javelins his nisaean horse careering vaulting with his fangs and hoofs protects his lord the guards who still furvivd with faithful zeal their whole united strength exert unwearied for a liberal chief some paces backward aemnestus forced impels his heel against a loosning stone broad craggy scarce inferior to the weight discharged by hector on the massy bars of agamemnons camp the spartan quick from his left arm removes the heavy shield with javelins thick transfixed from earth he lifts the casual weapon and with caution marks the fatal time and distance over the heads of thy surrounding guard the fragment hurled descends mardonius on thy manly chest and lays thee over thy coursers back supine without sensation o illustrious man whose dazzling virtues through thy frailties beamed magnanimous heroic generous pure in friendship warm in gratitude this doom at once dissolves all interval of pain to mind or body not a moment more have thou ingenuous satrap to repine or grieve go hero thy masistius greet where no ambition agitates the breast no gloomy veil of superstition blinds no friend can die no battle can be lost this fall to greece decisive as to heaven enceladus overthrown when thunderpiercd he under aetnas torrid mass was chained discomfits asias hopes in fresh array meantime the phalanx by pausanias formed proceeds entire facility of skill directs their weapons pace by pace they move true to the cadence of accustomed notes from gentle flutes which trill the doric lays of alcman and terpander slow they gain the ground which persia quits till chileus bold with his tegaeans gores the hostile flanks confusion then and general rout prevail the fugitives proclaim mardonius slain the whole barbarian multitude disperse in blind dismay cool mindarus in vain attempts to check their flight all seek the camp and now the spartan flutes combined with shouts of loud tegaeans stimulate his speed across the ford his trenches he regains and there to midias tiridates brave and chosen satraps gathering at his call thus spoke the flower of asia in the dust reclines his glories feel your loss like me not overcome by sorrow or surprise at changes natural to man the sport of his own passions and uncertain chance vicissitudes of fortune i have proved one day been foiled a conqueror the next in arduous actions though experienced minds have much to fear not less of hope remains to animate the brave amid this storm the throne of cyrus your exalted sires your own nobility recall deserve the rank you hold occasion now presents for such a trial to uphold my king my countrys name and piously revenge my kindred blood newspilt my sword my arm my life i destine multitude is left surpassing twenty myriads even despair befriends us famine threatening and the dread of merciless resentment in our foes may force these rallied numbers to obtain from their own swords relief behold your camp strongfencd and bulwarkd by masistian care a present refuge see the auxiliar greeks entire advancing on the inferior bands of athens still may xerxes over the west extend his empire and regret no part of this disaster but mardonius slain assume your posts for stern defense provide end of the twentyninth book the athenaid book the thirtieth o god of light and wisdom thee the muse once more addresses thou did late behold the salaminian brine with asian blood discolored climbing now the steep ascent to thy meridian for a stage of war more horrible and vast thy beaming eye prepare thou over wide plataeas field changed to a crimson lake shall drive thy car nor see a pause to havoc till the west in his dark chamb rs shuts thy radiant face now had the herald to cecropias chief sent by pausanias in his name required immediate aid no doubt suspends the haste of aristides who arrays his ranks with cordial purpose to sustain that strength of greece laconias phalanx lo in sight new clouds of battle hovering he discerns the array of leontiades with wings of macedonic and thessalian horse then calls sicinus friend he said observe robust and bold to perfidy inured not less than arms yon thebans cross our march i trust the justice of our cause will foil them thrice our number but events like this are not in mans disposal if i fall not rashly good sicinus rest assured themistocles survives the gate of greece he guards euboea and thessalia holds those granaries of plenty eastern shores with all his force perhaps victorious now xanthippus will relinquish and maintain the sea auxiliar to thy prudent lord thus all be well though aristides bleeds this to themistocles report but go fly to cleander him and all the greeks rouse from the fane of juno to the field both spartans and athenians want their aid thy tribe undaunted cimon place behind olympiodorus if his active bands repel thessalias horse avoid pursuit wheel on the flank of thebes here delphis priest behold emathias standards front thy right with haliartus and oileus son let me be stationd there i trust the spouse of amarantha at her fathers sight will sheath a sword unvoluntary drawn nor ties of hospitality and blood profane to serve barbarians i accept the generous offer sage and gallant seer spoke aristides in that wing thy friend the learned and manly aesehylus presides but to thy god appealing i enjoin thy reverend head to cover in retreat its unpolluted hairs should fire of youth or yet more strong necessity impel thy son to battle here the enraptured priest the inspiration of my god i feel a glorious day to athens i presage i see her laurels fresh apollo joins his sister pallas to preserve a race which all the muses love his awful power will chain the monster parricide and rouse the grecian worth in alexanders heart these animated accents fire the line within the measure of an arrows flight each army now ranked opposite a thought of piety and prudence from his place moved aristides single he advanced between the hosts offensive arms he left behind him even his plumed helm resigned gave to his placid looks their liberal flow before him hung his ample shield alone timotheas gift whose sculptured face displayed truth equity and wisdom hand in hand as in his breast exalting high in tone his gracious voice he thus adjurd his foes ye men derived from cadmus who in greece established letters fruitful mother since of arts and knowledge to barbarian spoil this hour exposed ye sons of locris hear thessalians phocians dorians all compelled by savage force to arm against your friends of language rites and manners with your own congenial aristides in the name of all the grecian deities invokes your own sensations to disarm your hands of impious weapons which retard the help we bear to those now struggling in defense of grecian freedom sepulchers and fanes he said was heard like enoch like the man who walked with god when eminently wise among the obscene the violent and false of justice and religion truth and peace he spoke exploded and from menaced death to god withdrew the fell boeotians rend the sky with threatening clamor and their spears shake in defiance while the word to charge perfidious leontiades conveys retreating backward aristides clothes his face in terror so messiah changed his countenance serene when full of wrath bent on satanic enemies who shook heavens peaceful champaign with rebellious arms he grasped ten thousand thunders and infixd plagues in their souls while darts of piercing fire through their immortal substances by sin susceptible of pain his glaring wheels shot forth pernicious aristides leads his phalanx on now greeks to greeks oppose their steely structures of tremendous war with equal spears and shields their torrent fronts they clash together like the justling rocks symplegades cyanean at the mouth of thracias foaming bosphorus were feigned infrangible opponents to sustain a mutual shock which tempested the frith dividing europe from the orient world meanwhile phoebean timons glowing zeal replete with patriot and religious warmth thus in the wing which aeschylus had formed bespake the encircling chieftains over the space between asopus and the main array of thebes i see the macedonian horse but half advanced their tardy pace denotes reluctance lo i meditate an act to prove my zeal for universal greece her violated altars and the tombs robbed of their precious dust my slender band so long companions in adventures high with your choice locrians haliartus join to medons banner aeschylus observe my progress if my piety succeeds thou as a soldier take advantage full so saying over the plain in solemn pace his reverend form he moves by snowy bands pontifical around his plumed helm distinguished thus from salems holy gate melchisedek the priest of him most high went forth to meet and benedictions pour on terahs son in shavehs royal vale the macedonian squadrons at the sight fall back in reverence their dismounting prince so wills the father and the son embrace oh amaranthas husband joyful sighs the parent oh my amaranthas sire in equal joy the husband timon then a greek in blood to delphis priest allied the god of delphis blessing now secure abandon these barbarians to the fate which in the name of phoebus i denounce for his insulted temple and the rape of amarantha from minervas shrine yet to unsheath an unsuspected sword against them neither i nor heaven require less thy own honor but repass the stream amid this blind uproar unnoticd seek thermopylae again and reach thy realm over all that clime themistocles prevails my friend his present amity obtain cecropias future love nor hazard more thy fame and welfare aristides knows my truth replies the monarch now to thee obedience prompt a second proof shall yield ascend a steed to amaranthas arms i will conduct thee first the auspicious flight of both a father shall assist and bless they speed away in ecstasy the sire to clasp his darling child in dirces grove this passed in medons eye who watchful stood with haliartus and a troop advanced in care for timon when apparent now the macedonian squadrons quit the field of strife the heavycuirassd of his wing with serryd shields by aeschylus is led in evolution wheeling on the flanks of that strong massd battalia which composed the hostile center first in phalanx stood unwilling locrians medon lifts his voice and to each eye abashed his awful shape like some reproving deity presents they hear they see oileus in his son as risen a mourning witness of their shame from his sepulchral bed the banners drop before him down their spears and bucklers fall they break disperse and fly with childrens fear when by authoritys firm look surprised in some attempt forbidden or unmeet boeotian files are next with sudden wheel they form a front and dauntless wait the assault still in the van robust and martial thebes unbroken stems the agility and skill of her opponent athens long unspent the tide of wellconducted battle flows without decision strong at length by fate is leontiades impelled to meet cecropias chief where thebes began to feel his mighty pressure whether justice strung his nerves with force beyond a guilty hand or of his manly limbs the vigor matched his fortitude of mind his falchion clove down to the neck that faithless greek of greece the most malignant foe the treacherous deed which laid fair thespia with plataean towers in dust he thus atoned a bolt from heaven thus rives an oak whose top divided hangs on either side obliquely from the trunk murichides the hellespontin bleeds too zealous friend of asia in whose cause this day he armed by great mardonius charged late messenger of friendship he in peace on salaminian shores had touched the hand which now amid the tumult pierced his heart not willingly if known then lynceus fell from oedipean polynices sprung the last remains of that illfated house mironides and clinias near the side of aristides fought his strong support yet undismayed and firm three hundred chiefs or sons of proudest families in thebes dispute the victory till death meantime olympiodorus from the left had galled thessalias squadrons like a sleety storm checking their speed athenian horse though few mixed with their bowmen well maintained their ground his own truelevelld shaft transfixed the throat of larissean thorax who in dust buries at length his aleuadian pride remembring all his charge bold cimon rears his mighty spear impetuous through a band of yielding phocians he on theban ranks falls like a rapid falcon when his weight precipitates to strike the helpless prey him slaughter follows slaughter from the right on aeschylus attends and mightier waits on aristides justice in his breast awhile was blind to mercy undeserved even unimplord by persevering foes invetrate now on this empurpled stage of vengeance due to perfidy and crimes twice their own number had the athenians heaped of massacred boeotians but as heaven not to destruction punishing restrains its anger just and often the hardened spares that time may soften or that sufferings past not measured full may turn the dread of more to reformation aristides thus relenting bade retreat be sounded loud then by the obedient host surrounded spoke serene enough of grecian blood is spilt ye men of athens low in dust are laid the heads of those who planned the fall of greece the populace obtuse resembling you enlightened people as the sluggish beast a generous courser let your pity save in gratitude to jove creating yours unlike boeotias breed  now form again thus equity and mercy he combined like that archangel authorized by heaven chief over celestial armies when the fallen from purity and faith in edens bowers not to perdition nor despair he left abandoned aristides still proceeds new victories invite you sparta long has wanted succor men of athens march lo menalippus greets in rapid haste this more than hero i am come he said to bring thee tidings of mardonius slain in open fight pausanias still demands thy instant presence in pursuit he reached the stream not now that passage is forbid tisamenus exclaimed the general passed in vain to force the welldefended camp repulsed in every part he dubious stands with disappointment fore on attic skill to mount entrenchments and a rampart storm laconians and tegaeans both depend to crown the day the athenian heard and cool in four divisions separates the host four thousand warriors light and heavyarmd each part compose whose ensigns over the flood in order just are carried he attains the adjacent field and joins pausanias there whose ravelld brow and countenance of gloom present a lions grimness who some fold or stall attempting thence by vollied stones of trooping shepherds and of herdsmen chased has sullenly retreated though oppressed by famine dire to aristides spoke with haughtiness redoubled spartas chief did thou forget athenian who commands the grecian armies thou have loiterd long since my two mandates with majestic warmth the righteous man pausanias now receive from aristides language new but just thine is the pride of satraps not the light ingenuous vanity of greeks from sense of freedom sense of cultivated minds above the rest of mortals no a black barbaric humor festers at thy heart portending usurpation know proud man thou have been weighed and long deficient found by aristides thy superior far then most superior when for public good compliant most thou soon o spartan born yet in thy countrys decency untaught will like a persian cast a loathing eye on freedom on lycurgus and his laws which gall a mind despotic i presage thee dangerous pausanias where the seeds of dark ambition i suspect my eye becomes a jealous sentinel beware nor force my active vigilance to proof now or in future when united greece no more defensive may retaliate war successful war which prompts aspiring thoughts rest now a safe spectator from defeat of real warriors of our fellow greeks not persians lightly armed in loose array the loiterers of athens shall with ease surmount that fence impregnable to thee to wait an answer he disdained but marched while arrogance in secret gnashd the teeth of this darkminded spartan doomed to prove the boding words of aristides true the sun no longer vertical began his slant hesperian progress at the head of his own host cecropias chief began enthusiastic flame without whose aid the soldier patriot and the bard is faint at this great crisis thus inspires the man of human race the most correct in mind ye shades of all who tyrants have expelled ye who repose at marathon entombed ye glorious victims who exalt the name of salamis and manes of the brave leonidas arise our banners fan with your elysian breath thou god supreme jove elutherian send thy child beloved with her gorgonian aegis to defend a people struggling not for spoil or power not to extend dominion but maintain the right of nature thy peculiar gift to dignify mankind i lift this prayer my citizens in reverence not in doubt of your success ye vanquishers of greeks beneath your spears yon servile herd will fall as corn before the sickle with a look of circumspection he remarked a swell of ground not fifty paces from the camp olympiodorus and his bowmen there he posted first now aeschylus he said construct of solid shields a brazen roof in contact close to yonder fence of wood form like the tortoise in his massy shell the archers each like phoebus skilled remove with showers of death the thick defendants soon clear from the rampart which in height surpassed two cubits aeschylus not slow performs his task a rank of sixty warriors placed erect with covering bucklers over their heads a brazen platform to the wall unites the next in order stoop behind the last kneel firm on earth over implicated shields a stable passage thus when cimon sees he mounts and fearless eyes the asian camp between the ramparts basis and the foe an empty space observing on the ground his spear he fixes and amidst a storm of clattring javelins arrows darts and stones swings down so shooting from the sulfurous lap of some darkvested cloud a globe of fire through winds and rain precipitates a blaze terrific down the raven pall of night his whole division follows with his band myronides and aeschylus released from his first care successively they range the very fence by persian toil upraisd now from the persian multitude secures the athenian near no obstacle remains to aristides who compleats his plan olympiodorus and his active train with axes keen and cleaving spades approach hewn down uptorn in that surmounted part the fallen defenses and the levelled ground soon leave an opening wide his strong reserve eight thousand light two thousand heavyarmd with haliartus and oileus son cecropias chief leads forward to sustain his first bold warriors chileus enters next with his tegaeans aemnestus brave pausanias amompharetus the youth of menalippus all the spartan host seven grecian myriads through the breach invade a ground with swarms of tents and men oppressed dire thus the irruption of germanic seas through strong batavian mounds the inflated brine stupendous piles of longresisting weight bears down and baffling strength and art combined foams over a country in its seat profound below the surface of the endangring main a country where frugality and toil no spot leave waste no meadow but in herds redundant where the numerous dwellings show simplicity but plenty now immersed with all their thronged inhabitants beneath the unsparing deluge aristides swift as if by general choice the chief supreme commandment issues that to either side the host extend that skirted by the fence with wheeling flanks in front the line assume a crescents figure thus the fisher skilled with his capacious seines slowdraggd and pressed close on each bank a rivers whole expanse with all his natives glossyfinnd involves yet mindarus with mede and persian ranks a large remainder from the morning fight resists which soon are slaughtered he retreats among the tents whose multitude impedes the grecians aristides straight commands that from the heavy lines disjointed length a hundred bands expatiate in the chase of foes benumbed by fear who neither fight nor fly of means deprived the carnage grows in every quarter fountains seem unclosd whence rivulets of blood overflow the ground over satraps potentates and princes fallen strode aristides first of men of heaven the imitator in his civil deeds now some faint semblance far as mortal may of that almighty victor on the field ethereal when over helms and helmed heads of prostrate seraphim and powers overthrown he rode still mindarus by courage winged from nation flies to nation still persists exhorting though in hopeless thought he sees great hyperanthes from the shades ascend and seems to hear the godlike phantom sigh in mournful words like these ah fruitless toil as once was mine to rescue from despair the panic fears of asia dead in mind her host already soon dead clay must lie like me on oetas rock yet midias brave with tiridates roused their efforts join against them warlike medon and the seed of lygdamis chance brings they side by side as heretofore thermopylae beheld young dithyrambus and diomedon had all the day their unresisted wedge of locrian shields and delphian led to deeds accumulating trophies midias falls by haliartus from the slain his lance recovring toward his patron dear he turns him conquror too of tiridates views in joy joy soon to sorrow changed fate guides a casual weapon from a distant hand such as at ramoth from the syrian bow drawn at a venture smote between the joints of harness strong the israelitish king who from the fight bade wheel his chariot stained with his own crimson ponderous and broad the hostile lance inflicts a mortal wound in medons generous bosom not a sigh he breathes in look still placid and sedate while deaths cold moisture stagnates on his limbs by all their powers forsaken bear he said to haliartus bear me from the camp nor yet extract the weapon life i feel would follow swift and medon has a charge yet to deliver some pathetic muse in tenderest measures give these numbers flow let thine who plaintive on the pontic verge in servitude sarmatian through her page of sorrows weeps thy banishment from rome or thine euripides whose moral strains melt sympathy in tears at human woes thy varied tragic themes or both unite your inspiration to describe a heart where gratitude over all affections dear predominantly swayed the faithful heart of haliartus at this sudden stroke of direful chance to death is medon snatched from glory snatched amid victorious friends the carians bosom instant feels combined achilles anguish at patroclus dead the pang of priam at the fall of troy even womans grief andromaches distress for her slain hector and his mothers pain to see his mangled and dishonored corse great artemisias name the illustrious blood from lygdamis derived his own exploits of recent fame are all erasd from thought in haliartus now who sinks again to meliboeus on the wounded chief as on his lord his patron still he looks with all the affection of a menial bred in the same home and cherished in that home with liberal kindness to his humbler state he clasps the fainting hero on the shields of weeping friends deposits and conveys swift through a portal from its hinges forced three hours remained to phoebus in his course close by the entrenchment under beachen shade of ancient growth a fountain bursts in rills transparent thither on the down of moss was medon borne and laid unloose he said my helm and fill from that refreshing stream obeyed he drank a part then pouring down the remnant spoke by this libation clear be testified my thanks to all the gods that i have lived to see my country saved on this victorious day my fate requires no lamentation haliartus dear oh more than kindred dear commend me first to aristides medons parting breath him victor hails to delphis virtuous priest to my leonteus to the glorious son of neocles my salutation bear to kind cleander my troezenian host to hyacinthus of euboeas race the flower of all her chieftains they have proved in me some zeal their island to redeem transport my ashes to melissas care them near the relics of laconias king repose be mine the neighbor of his urn here with an utmost effort of his voice with arms extended and elysian look leonidas the life thy friendship saved an offering to thy manes now i close mature in age to glory not unknown above the wish as destitute of hope to find a fairer time or better cause than sends me now a messenger to greet thee with glad tidings of this land preserved with his own hand the javelin from his breast he draws serene life issues through the wound new shouts new trumpets waken from a trance of grief the son of lygdamis he sees cleander who the asopian banks had passed called by sicinus from saturnias dome lo epidaurian clitophon the ranks of phlius with menander sicyons chief automedon the hermionean spears with lycus follow cephallenes sons the acarnanian all the epirot bands leprean conon with mycenaes youth polydamas by arimnestus led the brave plataeans with his thespian files alcimedon nearcus with his force of chalcis potidaean tydeus next eretrian cleon lampon and the troop of little styra corinths banners last by adimantus and alcmaeon ranged too late you come for glory them bespake the carian sad lo half the foes destroyed by aristides fugitives the rest lo there the only loss which greece sustains to him cleander with devout regret over medon honored paranymph and guest his head inclining not too late we come for sacrifice of persians to the ghost of this dead hero ah what floods of tears will fall in troezen  but let grief prevail hereafter son of lygdamis renounce despondency acanthe still survives to fire thy breast as ariphilia mine i hear her prompting my vindictive arm from thy experience of this glorious day lead thy troezenian host where best to point his strenuous efforts let thy guiding zeal for me long cursing my inactive post yet find one track to fame these gallant words of cordial frankness from dejection lift the carian brave not less than phoebus cheered the languid son of priam on the bank of xanthus when a stony mass of weight to stay a keel on hellespontine sands by ajax hurled benumbed the trojans frame thus haliartus through that open gate new forced the shortest safest passage lies but to acquire some luster i can show another track for prowess yet to shine he leads all follow save corinthian bands with adimantus hastening through the gate soon as to him the intelligence is brought who entering sees a carnage which confounds a timid spirit by alcmaeon urged close by the fence he marches none he meets but fly before him adimantus lifts his spear and satiates cowardice with blood of unresisting men by cheap success betrayed a distant quarter he attains where mindarus confronts him from his steed the unyielding satrap whirls a rapid lance which nails the base corinthian to the ground alcmaeon next is wounded more had bled but aristides over that part devoid of tents his dreadful crescent in array is forming new the persian starts he flies to one last angle of the spacious camp sole spot unforced half circled now in front the attic spartan and tegaean ranks in motion slow yet moving on augment progressively their terrors like a range of clouds which thicken on the brow of night a final wreck portending to a fleet already shattered by the morning storm round mindarus the remnant of his host collected still is numerous them he sees often look behind a sight that ill accords with warriors but as now in columns deep its glittering horns that direful crescent shows within the limits of a javelins cast all turn intent on flight at large they break their own enclosure down whose late defense is present bane and intercepts escape lo haliartus all whose grief is changed to fire heroic flame three myriads fresh he pours that crowded angle he invests preventing flight cleander looks around like some tornado menacing a bark which soon unseamd and parted sinks ingulphd he finds a breach and with him enters death the longenduring satrap whose mild soul calamity has worn resembles now the poor desponding sailor who is left last of the foundring vessel on a plank alone no coast appears the greedy swell he sees around expecting every wave will terminate his being and forgoes all hope of succor his afflicted soul thus with an effort equal to his rank the prince explores what mindarus remains for thee deserted in anothers home cleora dwells masistius is no more slain is mardonius asias glory fallen thou have too long been fugitive this day like teribazus close a term of woe like him in death be honored he dismounts he grasps a spear such dignity of shame to ilian hector from his flight recalled great homers muse imparted while the prince is meditating thus a man sublime towers from the athenians who suspend their march unlike the son of peleus in his ire implacable he represents a god in aspect god of mercy not of arms know chieftain he began to me the greeks one persian life have granted it is thine in this days trial i have noted well thy constancy and manhood i who prize the gems of virtue in whatever clime o persian whether in a friend or foe their neverchanging luster they display i aristides my protecting arm extend time presses yield thee ere too late captivity no burden shall thou find till safe without a ransom thou regain thy native seat the persian melts like snow in all its rigor at the noontide sun this unforeseen humane demeanor calms his mind and hushes every desperate thought he thus replies on all my actions past has fortune frowned perhaps a captive state with aristides whom masistius loved mardonius praised and all mankind reveres forebodes a change of fortune to my gain thy condescending wisdom o supreme in justice knowledge and benignant deeds may lift a man of sorrows from despair he yields the athenian leads him through the press secure himself a spectacle avoids which others covet lo on every side keen swords of massacre are waved to maids deflowrd dishonored wives and gods profaned to athens thespia and plataea burnt the greeks complete their sacrifice the sun wont on those fields of glistning green to smile and trace asopus through his crystal maze now setting glances over lakes of blood while fate with persian carnage chafes the stream no longer smooth and limpid but oerswoln and foaming purple with increasing heaps of carcases and arms night drops her shade on thirty myriads slaughtered thus thy death leonidas of sparta was avenged greece thus by attic virtue was preserved finis
