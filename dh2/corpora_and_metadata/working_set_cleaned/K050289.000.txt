an essay upon buying and selling of speeches in a letter to a worshipful justice of the peace being also a member of a certain worshipful society of speechmakers  london printed for j baker and t warner in paternoster row      price sixpence  an essay upon buying and selling of speeches andt please your worship being to write of matters of state and particularly of some steps lately taken by the masters in state policy i could not pass over your worship who of late has so distinguished your self as well by writings and speeches as other ways in matters of the greatest moment and therefore i have directed this essay to your worship beseeching your protection on to an author who has thus ventured to reprove a little the pride of the men of great talents like your self a practice which you have made l udable by your great example when your worship was pleased to jest with the world a little and gave your self the trouble of telling other men their faults and taking no care of your own  i shall not presume so much upon your worship as to make your own character illustrate the work i am upon however aptly it might suit with the design there are so many other flagrant examples before me that i am under no necessity of running the risque of your displeasure perhaps your worship may see your own picture in the history as plain as you may desire and have some reason to express your satisfaction that it is no plainer  your worship knows that in the case of true satyrs it is application makes the ass and when men see their crimes touched so sensibly as that it masters their temper we say it discovers that they are the men and that the coat fits them but i doubt not your worship can bear the brief reflections made here upon a scandalous practice without appropriating any part of it to your self  that i may therefore with the more life represent the crime of buying and selling speeches i shall give you the history of a once famous person who knowing how successful the ancients practiced that gainful trade with what secure measures they persued their game and how boldly they made their market of their interest in parliament how effectually they bantered their sovereign when they found it for their advantage and how sure they were to be bought off as soon as they thought fit to open against the court resolved some few years ago for the raising his declining fortune for the satisfying his unsatiable ambition and for supplying the most unmannaging profuse inclination to try the experiment upon his prince you will see with what detestable ingratitude he set out with what insolence and assurance he proceeded and with what just reproach he miscarried  this history andt please your worship or whether it be a history or no will doubtless sufficiently answer the design for it will fully lay open the base measures taken by such politicians to get into employment it will also lay before your worship the narrow selfish ends which many if not most of those who have formerly made popular speeches in the councils and assemblies of great men pusht at how they aimed at their private advantages all the while they made pretenses of pleading the cause of justice and the peoples liberty how when they railed at the mismanagments of men in place the design was not so much the detecting the frauds of others in great posts in order to have justice done to the nation as for the sake of getting themselves put in their room  it will also show by the royal example of a wise and truly great prince how every government ought to treat such creatures as these with what just contempt they should disappoint their expectations and how they should always be above the fear either of their malice or their treachery  i doubt not but when your worship shall have read this story you will join in recommending the scandalous practice of buying and selling of speeches to every honest mans detestation  the gentleman i speak of was an irishman by nation a man of a liberal education well read especially in that excellent schoolaccomplishment called classick learning he had also a competent stock of natural wit and by keeping good company and running some changes of fortune had gone through so much variety as to know the world pretty well and the town very well all which had very much fitted him for conversation his thoughts were clear and he had some happy turns in expression which gave some beauty to his discourse especially if he did not happen to talk too much which however he was a little inclined to  with these accomplishments he set out in the world and it was observed that for some years before he made himself popular he was mightily addicted to make speeches for which he once got a friendly reproof and was told that if he had not a great care of his modesty he would get the general character of a talking fellow the thing which of all worldly reproaches a wise man is most affaid of and most studious to avoid his answer was remarkable it seems to the gentleman that was so kind as to give him the caution viz i have courage enough to carry me over all that the gentleman only replied cousin cousin you should not call it courage call it  however for all his  or courage call it as you will he had another more insuperable obstruction to his rising in the world for having neither virtue or principles and which was still worse no money to put him forward in the world he found it very difficult to force his way through or as i may say over the belly of the misfortunes which generally attend a narrow circumstance and though he had made himself agreeable amongst some men of good sense and had even got acquaintance with some above himself yet all this could not effectually assist him to surmount the fate of his family or to master that great difficulty viz of seperating between wit and poverty  with all his acquirements he had some vices which i must touch at that i may make his history complete but i shall be brief in that ungrateful part of history with his wit   he had and alas who is without it an unbridled passion for his own dear praiee impatient to the last degree of the least reproach nay though it were just and yet this exorbitance did not at all restrain him from laying himself open every day to the most just satyr and exposing himself a thousand ways by the most ungarded conduct in the world but believing it in his power to establish his character upon the foot of his extraordinary merit he thought he had a right to stop the enquiries of curious malice into those parts of his fame which were less shining and that it was a saucy unmannerly thing for any man to say an ill word of him however just or how much truth soever there might be in the fact  to carry on this haughty humor his first care was to let the world believe he was a person of birth as well as merit and he carried himself most ridiculously high upon that head indeed this was the weakest step he could ever have taken because there were some things in his family which his fathers being called a gentleman could by no means balance and besides that as the poverty of his fathers circumstances exposed his children to be bred up by the charity of others so it happened that those relations of his which showed that charity seemed to have acquired the capasity by some scandalous methods  now though poverty is rather the misfortune than the crime of a gentleman yet all men know that when there are circumstances of those kinds in the rear of a mans family it is not thought the wisest step that man can take to place them in the front of his own history because it gives envy a handle to speak detractingly it was this vanity of his which caused an illnatured poet of those times among other bitter things to publish this distich upon him occasioned by his unseasonable boasting of being a gentleman born a gentleman born and charity bred much brass in his face more than brains in his head   but we pass over his pride as a thing too common to men of wit anext to this he had the most unhappy spirit of profusion in his way of living that a wise man could be guilty of and it was the more scandalous to him because he had no suitable fund to justify or support it this humor was come to such an extravagant hight in him that even good fortune it self could not supply it and this faild not to make him necessitous even in spite of the bounty of princes this poverty was accompanied with its constant yoakfellow debt which however was grown so natural a grievance to him that like a riveted gout which when it is grown familiar to us we take no physic for nor are alarmed at so to be dund or arrested was no breach of his tranquillity nor did he ever load himself with the unnecessary care of getting out of it thinking that those people he owed money to had more need to be uneasy and thoughtful about that main point how they should get him out of their books than he whose much greater care was to find ways and means to get farther in  but being by these thing reduced all most to his primitive state viz living upon charity at length a friend let him into the secret viz that railing at princes making satyrs upon great men and long speeches against the vices of the public management was the best way that could be thought of for a man of his capacity to get a start into the world  that nothing was wanting to a man of his capacity but to be known that for an author to be popular was to be formidable to great men whose conduct would very seldom bare a history or their virtues a character and that therefore if he once could establish his fame in this town as a satyr he would find very quickly that he might sell silence at a good price or get enough by one good speech to make it worth while to hold his tongue all his life after  upon this prospect he set out he railed in print upon several occasions very magnificently but unhappily sunk under two circumstances   he was afraid to own what he writ and that kept him too much jncog in the world and   he struck too low and fell upon men not able to buy him off  but he soon found his mistake and in one flaming half sheet he made amends for that modesty and fell upon the greatest men in the kingdom in short he damned all the whitestaffs in the nation as rogues by employment and threatened what devilish things he would discover of them in the process of his studies  he had no sooner done this but it was every mans business to enquire who this talking fellow was there is seldom much difficulty in seeking those people that desire to be found the author was of easy access and being found tasted the first fruits of the good advice given him and was let know that one of the greatest staffs in the nation had a mind to serve him immediately we received a full and true account that a great man with a whitestaff might be very honest that there was a whitestaff in the world who eminently merited to be esteemed and whose character it was to be frugal of the public money and prodigal of his own  this was the first attempt he made according to the advice given him and having met with success he was encouraged afterward to go on in a more public manner in a course of time he received some civilities from another person bearing a staff and in hopes of more was heard to say that he had entertained indeed some hard thoughts of that gentleman but that he found he was possessed of a genius born to conquer universal prejudice and that he was afterward resolved to number himself among his friends  but finding every man not alike apprehensive of the power of a sharp pen and that he knew not how to make himself feared there as he expected his good opinion abated in a little time  in the mean time the sovereign at that time reigning influenced by the first person mentioned had heaped accumulated royal favors upon this irish creature but after the possession of them a reasonable time the vallue of them seemed to abate in his thought though the revenue of them abated nothing in his pocket for favors to some men appear with a different aspect and sink always in their magnitude after they have been long enjoyed  it was not for want of application or of assurance to crave that the mortal wight crept no higher but that age had its share of penetration in some things as it had of mistakes in others and he was perhaps sooner than he thought was decent observed to distinguish his dear self from his attachment to any interest or party and therefore he thought fit very early to show himself to be what it seems he thought it was best to be in all governments viz a malecontent  we must not say for we must do him justice that his passion for the character of a malecontent was derived from his ill nature for we give that tribute to his immorality that he was never cinical or morose in his temper but that his politics brought him into those measures founded upon the mistaken notion of his own merit which he always had prudence enough to keep up an opinion of though not modesty enough to confine it  upon this foundation it was that he was not easily brought to acknowledge himself obliged all ways pretending to have it in his power not only to make himself useful but necessary to the public so that their employing and supplying him was all ways to be esteemed as a testimony not of the sovereigns good will so much as good sense and of their being able to judge who or who not it was their interest to be bountiful to  but the consequences of this showed more plainly the truth of what is here asserted for no sooner did he find that the sovereign once dared to run the risque of his displeasure but he made no difficulty to show it and that in the most disobliging way imaginable insulting the crown he served and carrying it in such a manner as evidently showed he doubted not by appearing against them to be bought off at a good price  but the sovereign not being in need of his service or afraid of his power ventured his indignation and forbore to purchase what it was well known could not be retained any longer than the royal bounty should flow in a manner equal to his unbounded profusion  during this dilemma of his affairs there happened a great revolution in the government where he lived the crown being transposed by that providence in whom the original right of disposing all things remains from one head to another and that transposition giving a round turn to the administration even from one extreme almost to another it gave him also a new rise and put him into a posture to show himself again he was politician enough to act his part in the first appearance of things and to look like other men he had been taught to cloth himself with such shapes as best might serve his grand design and to this purpose failed not to make all the disobliging steps which he had taken in the preceding reign pass for merit in the next and happening to have the good fortune to fall now into the hands of a prince of immense beneficence that knew how to engage ingenious spirits beyond their power of return and rewarded in proportion to his own bounty rather than the subjects character he failed not to meet with an acceptance as much beyond his expectations as those expectations were above his merit  this set him at the first dash above all his rivals and would have established his fame if it had not to his great misfortune set him also above himself  but as nothing is more rare than for one born in a low station to know how to move in just proportion to a more extended orb so the velocity of his motion in his new sphere was so unequal to himself and to what he ought to have been that it cast him immediately back into the same disorder that he was in before i have hinted just now that the sovereigns greatness of spirit caused him to measure his bounty by his own magnificence rather than by the bare desert of the object and this was in him a test of an extensive goodness but our irish man run into the contrary extreme and measuring his own merit by his princes bounty he fell into the most gross and most offensive absurdity in nature for as it filled him with unsufferable arrogance by which he became intolerable to his friends so it pusht him upon that most scandalous folly of clashing with himself fixing a stated contradiction between the days of his humiliation and those of his exhaltation  being come this length there wanted nothing to complete the ruin of his character and make him perfectly contemptible but that he should think as formerly he thought viz that all rewards which were not equal to his extravagance were extravagantly short of his merit and so bring him to treat his new benefactor as he had done his former i mean with ingratitude  fate that had determined this mushroom the due punishment of upstarts failed not to bring this to pass also by the following circumstances with which i shall conclude his history  by the favor and bounty of his prince of which mention is made he was so far recommended to the subject or which if fame lies not was part of the case made capable to recommend himself that upon an election of a parliament he was chosen to sit in the house of commons for there were new parliaments frequently called in those days as well as in these he was no sooner entered into the house but even the first day as authors relate he began to make speeches and flattring panegyricks persuing thus the dictates of his first instructor most exactly for it seems he was told that in that place was the best market for good speeches and that he might take it for granted that to make a long speech against the public mannagement was the only way to get a share in it according to mr and marvill that parliament men should rail at the court and get a preferment immediately for it   upon this principle the unhappy politician took his measures he had been treated as i have said so far above his capasity of deserving that had not most people known his character and that he would soon let his sovereign see his bounty was ill bestowed he would almost have arrived to the dignity of being envied but that unbounded spirit of profusion which was however a judgment upon his ambition soon made way through all that his princes bounty had bestowed and he grew necessitous in the midst of a sufficency for a lord three times the godlike goodness of his prince bore with the infirmity believing it might be the remains of former misfortunes and with no less than five hundred pounds at a time if history does not mistake recruited the wity extravagant but it was all in vain it was a stream not a bucket an ocean not a stream that must be sufficient to supply the outlet of his vanity and that wisdom which was as inseparable from his sovereigns just character as his bounty dictated that in charity to the lunacy of this mans temper he must shut up his expectation within the bounds of what he had in possession and that it was the kindest thing that could be done for him to let him know it was in vain for him to ask who had already surfeited  his sovereign had almost as good have declared him a traitor as told him that his account of merit was balanced by past favors for his merit being exhausted as well as the money it follows of course that ways and means were to be found out to supply the last whether the first were concerned or no  the devil who they say is the cunningest fellow at his trade in the world finding the mans nature wicked and his circumstances favorable failed not to take hold of the advantage and presented him with an opportunity as he fraudulently told him to raise his fortunes nor did he long stick at the motion though at the expense of his virtue  in a word the advice satan administered was upon the old foot oppose the court and make your self necessary then they will buy you though the face of this man was as casehardnd as the very metal it self which we call so yet it is related in his favor that he started at the first proposal and told the devil it was damned ungrateful that he was a gentleman born and he could not do any thing so base he did not add get thee behind me satan because there was more business between them to treat of but he gave him a very handsome repulse it must be confessed  but satan is not used to be said nay the devil knew his inside better perhaps than he did himself and banterd him upon his nicety a pox of your modesty says old beelzebub is it any more than you have done by all the benefactors ever you had in your life and besides says the old prevaricator have you not the best plea in the world for it viz necessity prithee dick says he try the other experiment can you starve you must do one or the other that you know therefore consider of it  i do not find that history has recorded the whole dialogue between them nor how the devil they made the bargain but this is recorded as a certain truth that he came into the proposal  now to cut short the story for the best part of it is behind the generous prince defeated both the devil and the traitor for as soon as he saw his goodness abused he was so far from stooping to gratify the wicked design and to draw him back by more gifts as he expected that he contemned the impotence of his malice withdrew his favors and condemned the wretch to rail on  he continued a while according to sentence till he was hissed at and p  d upon by all wise men his friends ashamed of him and his enemies above him and that he laid himself below the dignity of lampoon  in this condition heaven in mercy to him cleared up his understanding and he became a mighty penitent but as it is not in man to answer for sincerity and no man cared to venture upon one that had been always otherwise till then the compassionate prince pardoned him gave him a pension for bread and laid him up as an invalid  this history andt please your worship i was willing to lay before you that i might have your worships opinion whether it is not worth while to bring it upon the stage in terrorem to deter incendaries from making speeches against their masters and against their principles with a design to get up higher in their favor though they have already been rewarded in a manner which it was never in their power to deserve  i doubt not but if your worship casts your eye back upon the histories of those times for it is many years since those things were done you will find i have not wronged the memory of the person and that you will be satisfied great part of the account is true in fact  now i most humbly beseech your worship to give your aid and assistance in crying down this unchristian practice in all its parts and let the world know from your authentic hand how justly the vice of speechmaking is abhorred by all honest men but observe if you please that i do not condemn speechmaking in general as such for that may be very useful in its place but making speeches against principles and against benefactors on purpose to appear considerable and to be drawn off again by a frail argument which i am ashamed to name  i know your worship abhors these things and though fame lays it to your charge that you spoke somewhat after this sort lately upon the subject of showing mercy etc yet as common fame is a false jilt and has long since lost her reputation i assure your worship i shall give no credit to her words in that case  besides sir i cannot entertain a thought that you who understands what belongs to humane mercy so much having wanted it so often in civil affairs though not in criminal could open your mouth unless paid for it beyond the ordinary price for the showing mercy to those who are no ways the proper objects of mercy either of god or man  i need not tell you sir what i hear you very nobly insisted upon viz how kings should imitate the king of kings in that superior attribute of showing mercy and how glorious it was for princes to come up to that sublime pattern but as our jacobites have enlarged upon that point to an extreme hight higher to be sure than your worship ever intended it i know your judgment must join with the kings in this that it may be his majestys duty to imitate the merciful god of heaven in forgiveness but that we no where find that any king ought to go beyond that sacred pattern for example our religion teaches us that if we confess and forsake we shall find mercy our rubric says spare thou them o god which confess their faults but neither does god himself pardon any but the penitent neither can any man but on the highest presumption so much as pray for pardon for himself or any one else but on the supposition of repentance and reformation  now andt please your worship we have not yet heard of one of these prisoners or condemned people that confess their fault for your worship knows there is a vast difference between confessing the fact and confessing the fault and those who would have the king show mercy to the first without the last are for having the king go farther your worship knows than ever god almighty himself went yet  it is most certain therefore that your worship was for having the king be merciful to those who by a penitent acknowledgment of their crime as well as of the fact rendered themself objects worthy of compassion for otherwise it is most certain your worship was for having the king pardon those who we are sure god himself will not pardon  all these things i thought for your worships service to communicate to you that you may make such use thereof for the conviction of our mercenary speechmakers of this age as to your worship in your great wisdom shall seem meet  i am your worships most humble and obedient servant a d  adenda it has often been complained of as a grievance that our court have formerly by bribery pensions preferment with other arts formed their interest among their people but the present complaint is the reverse of that practice viz the subjects by a new fashioned method of chagrin raillery and discontent forcing their interest in the public  nothing is more certain than that for fifty years past this has been the growing practice of the times it was at first indeed a state secret and esteemed to be a secret of great value few understood it and therefore when we found the politicians clamorous and loud one week and as silent as mutes the next we used to be surpised at it till old colonel birch in the days of king charles ii broke into it and discovered the trick the case was thus  an eminent member had for some years made himself known by his leading interest in the house he was a man of sense a patron of liberty warm against favorites had made himself very popular in parliament by his zeal against the popish plot constantly opposed giving money without redress of grievances a mighty habeaus corpusman an enemy to french whores french counselors etc and this warmth continued till the time that famous attempt was made in the house called the bill of exclusion  but his friends were strangely surpised when after so long experience of his forwardness they found on a sudden he had not one word to say no not in that popular cause of the excluding a popish successor neither did he meet at the clubs as usual where those things were ordinarily concerted it happened once that upon a committee where they were altogether upon that famous debate an old member who sat next him pressed him to give his opinion but he declined it and the old member still urging him let him alone says col birch he has received hushmoney  the jest took the word became proverbial and it grew very public but for all that the court who found their account in it continued the practice king charles ii who loved a good turn of wit made that word his common place for the occasion and if they found a troublesome man begin to lead a party and make warm speeches etc it was the word presently at court he must have some hushmoney  but as this was a practice scandalous enough upon the court and made use of in a way most particularly mischievous to the nation so when once it became public the country gentlemen turned the tables upon the ministry and made it a bite upon the court for as soon as they found that the court to cover their designs and keep the people easy were very willing to stop the mouth of every complainer with hushmoney and that to be a malecontent of note was a certain step to advance a mans interest this hushmoney became a plague upon the court they turned all malcontents on purpose to be bought off yet such was the conduct of that court so much were they afraid to let their practices be exposed and so little were they able to bear a plaindealer that though they knew they were imposed upon to the last degree yet they were obliged to wink and let it go on having no other way to stop the clamours of the people but to buy off the complainer and this grew a dreadful rentcharge upon them at last especially if it be true as some have said that it cost king charles ii four hundred thousand pounds a year in hushmoney to stop the mouths of parliament men  but if this was a satyr upon the court whose business it was to stand still and see their pockets picked that they might at the same time by the help of those mercenary creatures get an opportunity to pick the nations pocket of three times as much yet it was much more scandalous upon the people concerned who by selling themselves to the government divested themselves of the power of serving their country and like a soldier who in the heat of action quits his post making a breach in the line of battle at which the enemy breaks in and destroys the whole body so these men made a monstrous breach in the constitution at which tyrany arbitrary government persecution of protestants and at last a popish successor broke in to the endangering the liberties and religion of great britain  it cannot but be remembered very well by many how merry king charles ii used to make himself with those hushmoneymen ds fish says the king one day upon seeing the account for secret service i believe they will go halves with me at last at another time when an eminent member had made a flameing speech against giving more money and it was proposed to get him off vijs et modis as before well said the king i have heard of buying and selling of places but i never heard of buying and selling of speeches before but the king fell out with em at last for after all they had got of the king and after all the king had got of the nation by them at last the king would give no more to them and then they would give no more to him upon which they were sent home cursed and exposed as they deserved of whom the famous a marvel has these two lines but thanks to the wh  who made the k  dogged for giving no more the rogues were prorogued   but let us now bring this down to the present time that the folly and absurdity of this speechmaking may appear and this indeed is the reason of reciting the scandalous history of the days past what can those gentlemen promise to themselves or what do they propose is there a king now reigning that wants such mercenaries that fears their tongues or can stoop to entertain them in his pay sure they cannot have such scandalous notions in their minds of a government of which themselves have said so many fine things before  let us examine a little the circumstances of their new phenomenon which have appeared so lately in a certain place and whence the original of their motion may be drawn it is evident they are not tories they are not so either simply or by composition neither naturally or politically the air they have put upon their conduct has so little of art in it that even the torys themselves say it has not disguise enough in it to do their cause any service or the whigg cause any harm so that it is perfectly impotent and serves for no other end but to expose the people that put it on and give the hissing part of the bystanders an opportunity to divert themselves  but are they whiggs then is it possible that whiggs can be found making speeches for mercy to rebels who never yet were penitent enough to acknowledge their rising in arms against king george was a rebellion who strove to obtain their pardon by a party spirit and make a faction for mercy against prudence can this be done by a friend to king george and as such it is impossible but if it be true and the speakers are whiggs they must either have renounced the name of whigg and be what as whiggs they always esteemed scandalous nay infamous i mean jacobits and friends to jacobites or it must be from some private spirit some parl  t policy such as selling of speeches was in former days getting hushmoney and the like  again upon what principle can any thing that calls it self a whigg or is attached to the interest of king george oppose at such a time as this the passing of a bill which is the only step to put an entire end to the spirit of rebellion among us the only thing that can entirely extinguish the hopes and expectations of the jacobites by removing that one and only difficulty upon which alone the expectation of reviving the interest of rebellion did depend whether this be the affair of trienneal parliaments or any other thing  nay though there should be some niceties of privilege or any thing else which at another time it would be very rational and commendable to insist upon yet is it absolutely necessay for a person to dispense with some laws which are justly esteemed the bulwark of our liberties and shall we not dispense with circumstances shall we stand upon niceties and punctilios to the hazard of the whole nation shall we pass over the great and not abate the small how strangely nice must these men be and how contrary to common prudence do they act do not men blow up houses when the street is on fire to save the remainder of the town is the damage to a few a sufficient argument to prevent it was ever any man afraid it should be made a precedent to blow up other peoples houses when there is not the same necessity or when there was no fire at all  if a tory had made use of such arguments against the habeas corpus bill or the trienneal etc we should not have thought it strange but for whiggs to act thus it must be upon some meaner lower principle than those who deserve the name of whiggs always acted from and although these sheets shall not undertake to charge any modern gentleman with speaking upon the foot of mercenary expectations either within the house or without it yet as buying and selling of speeches receiving of hushmoney etc has been practices recent in our memory and by which the sovereign has been abused and the nation betrayed it is hard to avoid the injection of such things to our thoughts when we are at a loss to find any other probable reason for the extraordinary measures of some people whose actions and speeches we could always till now account for  what shall we say then to these speechmakers shall we speak to them as whiggs why even in that predicament they appear most ridiculous let us refer them back to some of their own speeches when they were in their senses and let them be judges for themselves after all they have said of king george of his standing by his friends doing justice to his enemies and fearing no body let us ask now whether they can ever believe that his majesty can be capable of any apprehension from the present grimace they put upon their conduct and that their speeches in opposition to his just measures can have any other effect upon the king than to give his majesty a needful knowledge of the men and a just contempt of their designs  besides their own former speeches let them read sir richard steels letter to the pope and see there the just character which he gives not of the kings person only but of his administration let them look over mr l  mers speech upon the impeachments where he is pleased to say that the wisdom and steddiness of his majestys government have retrieved the honor and reputation of his kingdom let these things speak the absurdity and folly of those who being at the bottom embarkt solidly by principle and inclination for the kings interest can yet be so mercenary as to put on the countenance of malecontent upon the base notions of making themselves necessary and this in a reign too where they ought to know better than to think it can be made to answer so mean a design  let those people look into the conduct of the present administration and see whether there is any thing done or doing that it is in their power to expose or that the ministers are at all in their reach let them remember his majesty gives no hushmoney there are no court pensions to complain of but what are known and the court has chosen to let the world know that some men have been rewarded beyond their merit rather than to have them think they have had more rewards than are known  to what end than do men who have shared so much of the royal bounty turn their backs upon their principles and open their mouths at their benefactors is it that they think by this method to get more when they are even ashamed to ask upon any other foundation it cannot be nothing can be so base it must certainly be that they are sensible they have been too well used and can no longer in conscience deceive a prince of so much benignity but like murderers who are hurried by their own terrors to discover themselves they find themselves necessitated to tell the king he has been mistaken in them that they are of the number of those who no bounty can bind nor favor oblige to be faithful unless they have a continual flux of supplies sufficient to gratify the necessary avarice of an unbounded expense occasioned by the practice of all manner of scandalous vices that they are servants who will never be paid and would be always receiving that their services are small and few and that it would be very necessary to let the nation see they can go on without such men as these that the market for long speeches is over and that having now exposed themselves sufficiently they are grown perfectly useless either to one side or other and are at last arrived to that meanest condition a public man can ever come to viz to be neither valued or feared  finis
