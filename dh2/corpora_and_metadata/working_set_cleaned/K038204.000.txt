servants messrs ledger gaudry and lions mr euston mr parsons lady euston mrs bulkley lady harriet cyprus mrs bates bloom mrs riley a young lady miss farren epilogue written by george colman esquire spoken by miss farren male critics applaud to the skies the male scribblers  when a woman attempts they turn carpers and nibblers but a true patriot female there is nothing so vexes as this haughty preeminence claimdtwixt the sexes the free spirit revolts at each hard proposition and meets the whole system with loud opposition men it is true in their noddles huge treasures may hoard but the heart of a woman with passions is stored with passions not copied from latin or greek which the language of nature in plain english speak girls who grieve or rejoice from true feeling as i do never dream of calypso or helen or dido to the end of our life from the hour we begin it womans fate all depends on the critical minute a minute unknown to the dull pedant tribe and which never feeling they never describe it is no work of science or sparkle of wit but a point which mere nature must teach us to hit and which in the changes and turns of my story a weak womans pen has tonight laid before ye and say ye grave prudes gay coquettes too ah say what a critical minute was mine in the play here poverty famine and shame and reproach there plenty and ease and a lord and a coach but perhaps our bard held mrs euston too mean and conceived her disgrace would but lower the scene let us then better pleased to acquit than convict her on the ground of high life sketch the very same picture imagine some fair plunged in modish distress her wants not less than mine nor her agony less at hazard suppose an unfortunate cast has swept her last guinea nay more than her last her diamonds all mortgaged her equipage sold her husband undone genteel friends looking cold at her feet his sweet person lord foppington throws the most handsome of nobles the richest of beaux at once too his love and his bounty dispenses sooths with thousands her grief lulls with flattery her senses alas what a minute ah what can be done all means must be tried and our drama shows one let papa in that minute that so frowns upon her redeem the vile debts that encumber her honor let papa in that minute that teems with undoing step in like my father and mar a lords wooing let her know as i have known all the horror that is in it and feel the true force of the critical minute thus wishes our bard as she bids me declare and such is my wish by my honor i swear  i will tell you what act i scene i a room at sir george eustons enter mr euston followed by sir george sir george but my dear uncle why in such a passion    mr euston i cannot help it  i am out of all patience  did not i leave you one of the happiest men in the world    sir george well and so you find me sir   mr euston it is false  you are not happy  you cannot be happy  it is false  and you shall not be happy   sir george if you are resolved to make me otherwise sir    mr euston no i am not resolved  it is yourself that is resolved  did not i leave you one of the happiest of men  married to one of the most beautiful women in the world  did not i give you my blessing and a large fortune and did i not stay and see you father of a fine boy  then only just stepped over to visit my estate in st kitts and now i am come back here i find you married to another woman  and your first wife still living  and egad she is married to another man   sir george dear uncle i should certainly have asked your opinion and my uncle anthonys on the subject but your absence put it out of my power and it was universally believed the ship in which you sailed was lost   mr euston well you will hear what my brother will say to it   sir george i trust sir when i have explained every thing you will not only think me worthy of your pardon but even of being pleaded for to my uncle   mr euston not i indeed  nay were it in my power to do you any good i would not  i shall not forgive you myself  much less ask him  but you are right in fixing on me for a mediator my brother pays much regard to me truly  i have been of infinite service to be sure in reconciling him to his own poor boy nay did he not even for my brother anthony would always be master although he was the youngest when i went to him to persuade him to forgive poor charles his son did he not even instead of my gaining him over and getting something for the poor boy did he not even draw me into a promise never to do any thing for him myself  my brother does what he pleases with me  but nobody else shall  no what i want in resolution to him i will make up in obstinacy to other people   sir george sir if you will but hear the just pleas i have to offer    mr euston i will hear no pleas  what do you think my brother will say why you inconsiderate boy he had designed you for his heir   sir george i should be as sorry sir to excite his displeasure as i am at incurring yours yet give me leave to add i should derive very little enjoyment from the possession of a fortune which his son my poor cousin but for a single act of imprudence had a right to expect and be assured sir that if this seeming indiscretion of mine when compared with that of his sons should be regarded so unfavorably as to make his offense appear lighter to my uncle and move him to forgiveness  i will contentedly support the burden of his resentment   mr euston why now that is well spoken  you silly young rogue i am not angry with you for getting rid of your wife  for that i dare say is what every sensible man in the world would do if he could i am only angry with you for getting another  could not you know when you were well off you blockhead   sir george dear uncle as you are a bachelor and can only speak of wives from theory suppose we drop the subject  is my uncle anthony come to his house he knows nothing of the alteration that has taken place in my family you tell me  should i wait on him or do you think he will favor me with a visit first   mr euston now what a deal of ceremony  it is a fine thing to look like a man of consequence my brother anthony has had more privilege from his looks than i ever had from being eldest son  even you whom i love so well and have given half my fortune to and it is not long you know that you have expected a six pence from anthony yet you never meet him without a low bow how do you do sir  i hope you are well uncle  i am glad to see you  and you stumble over me with so uncle how is it how is it uncle  and when you invite us both uncle anthony i hope i shall have the honor of your company  while you give me a nod uncle i shall see you   sir george dear sir    mr euston nay with every other person it is the same thing  if we are stuffed into a coach with a little chattering pert miss oh dear mr anthony euston you must not ride backwards here is room for you on this seat  and mr euston i know will like one seat as well as another  ad then am i put with my back to the horses though my head is whirling all the time like one of the coach wheels then if any thing be lost or wanted when no servant is by mr anthony euston must not stir for the world  but mr euston they know will be so kind as to go for it  and this is all because i am good natured egad if this is my reward no wonder there are so few in the world of my temper   sir george but dear sir no jesting  does my uncle intend to call on me or not   mr euston yes i dare say he did intend it and if he does not hear of what you have been doing before he gets to your house he will   sir george why then my dear uncle will you step home and give orders that none of the servants mention any thing to him this morning   mr euston there now   i step home and give orders there it is again  would you ask my brother to step home and give orders no i fancy not  but i  poor i  will be so good as to do it you think  but for once i will not  besides anthony never asks questions of servants we enquired of our housekeeper indeed how you did last night she told us both you and your lady were well and so we thought all safe anthony will ask no more questions therefore you may have the pleasure of explaining matters to him yourself as you have to me   sir george i should be sorry if any imperfect account should reach him for so sincere is my respect for him i would not even suffer for a moment in his esteem i will be with him in half an hour but i am afraid    mr euston no no he will not be out nor have had any company in that time  for my brother is no sailor and he will be too fond of the exchange of a bed for a hammock to be stirring so soon however i think i will step home and give a caution to the servants that they dont mention your divorce to him  as for myself i will keep out of his way  i will not go near him  for i will say this for my brother although it was never in my power to persuade him to forgive an injury or an indiscretion in my life yet i never said to him brother anthony dont forgive a thing that he did not take my advice   sir george come uncle walk into the parlor before you go  let me introduce you to lady euston  do step in and take your chocolate with her   mr euston and by the time i have taken a turn in the park and eaten a mouthful of dinner you will perhaps have a new lady euston to introduce me to and i may drink tea with her   sir george well uncle whether you stay or go i must bid you a good morning for i am obliged to attend a friend who has a lawsuit depending and i fear i shall be waited for  my presence will not be required long and i will be with my uncle anthony within half an hour   mr euston very well going but you had better take an hour  let me advise you to take an hour anthony is devilish sharp  he is not to be imposed upon take an hour or an hour and half before you see him  anthony is a deep man he is not to be deceived  for i dare say in his time he has been as idle as yourself  and i will go on your errand   exeunt mr euston and sir george separately scene ii a room at major cypruss lady harriet cyprus and bloom waiting lady harriet married   bloom yes my lady as sure as death   lady harriet amazing it cannot be   bloom o yes my lady i have known of it these three months but as they kept out of town till within this fortnight and your ladyship has been abroad most of that time i thought i would not tell your ladyship till we returned to london when your ladyship was sure to hear of it why they live but just by madam and my master i know has been several times in company where they have been visiting   lady harriet ay she was your masters intended   bloom o yes my lady i know that   lady harriet insignificant girl  i triumphed when i snatched him from her and now i suppose she thinks to triumph equally   bloom no doubt madam  but if i was you i would let her see i cared nothing about him   lady harriet and do you imagine i do care no indeed bloom my exchange is for the better i am certain and sighing entirely to my satisfaction   bloom indeed i think so madam you certainly have changed for the better  and bless me i think of all the husbands i ever saw my present master is sure the fondest   lady harriet as for that  no one could be fonder than sir george at first   bloom ay my lady but major cyprus is not so flighty as sir george   lady harriet not so slighty   sighs i have been envied sir georges gaiety a thousand times   bloom yes my lady when your ladyship married first i suppose but you know in a few months sir george altered so much and seemed so miserable i protest every single rap that came at the door made my blood run cold for i took it for the report of a pistol   lady harriet you need not have feared him bloom  he is too fond of the pleasures of this life dear pleasures which he wanted to retrench me in   bloom more shame for him madam  now my present master is a soldier and what is more i dare say will soon be called on to go abroad   lady harriet hah   bloom nay i beg your ladyships pardon  i thought perhaps your ladyship wished to see the major show himself a courageous gentleman in the field and that that was the reason of your presering him to sir george   lady harriet i prefer did not my brother from sir georges humiliating suspicions and cruel treatment of me compel us to a divorce and then as a defense for my weakness forced me into the arms of the major being i suppose convinced that nothing less than a soldier should undertake the guard of a ladys honor   bloom very true madam  and i heard the major say this morning as your ladyship left the room that your ladyships honor would reqnire the guard of a file of musketeers   lady harriet ungenerous man  even worse to me than sir george  for poor sir george from my indiscreet partiality to this ingrate had some pretense for his unkind apprehensions but mr cyprus who knows what proofs of affection i have given him even in preference to the man i had sworn to love    bloom nay i fancy that is what frightens my master for i believe he is a little fearful lest your ladyship should chance to be forsworn again   lady harriet insolent supposition  he knows the delicacy of my sentiments  my honor to sir george  knows that although his unwearied artifices conquered my too susceptible heart and hurried me to indiscretions i merited not that severe contumely i have endured   bloom bless my soul  well now i assure you you surprise me  and so my lady there was nothing at all in it when sir george found my master in the closet   lady harriet what did you suppose   bloom oh my lady nothing  i hope i did not distress your ladyship by the mention of sir georges second marriage   lady harriet ridiculous   bloom nay indeed i always thought as your ladyship would not live with him yourself your ladyship did not wish to prevent them that would   lady harriet dont mention that insignificant woman   bloom if i was your ladyship i am sure i would not care  especially as i got married before him   lady harriet leave me   bloom  aside she will have another husband within half a year  and so have three all alive at once  well i will say it is very hard that because i am poor i never can have above one at a time    exit bloom lady harriet and so sir george has been married these three months to another and entirely forgot me  to be so soon forgotten  i shall never now forget him i am certain he has behaved like a man of resolution and spirit in casting me from his heart and i feel the irreparable loss why were we divorced i should have disliked him still had be been my husband and yet how tender how patient to my failings to what mr cyprus is  his cruel and unjust suspicions of me are not to be borne  how provokingly did he treat me last night  i was too tame  but the next time he insults me with his jealousy i will endeavor to augment rather than pacify it  i will try a reverse of conduct  though indeed i am tolerably provoking in all our wrangles  yes thank heaven i can say as cool spiteful things as any woman in the world    exit scene iii another apartment in major cypruss house enter colonel downright followed by the major colonel downright i assure you major this is the first visit i have made since i set my foot in london  nay and faith no great compliment to you neither for as i parted with my fellow passengers at portsmouth i dont know that i have a friend or acquaintance in the whole town but yourself   major cyprus i am happy in your want of friends colonel if it gives you occasion to consider me as one   colonel downright as for that i dont want friends neither i believe only they are not here at present i have plenty of friends on the other side the atlantic  zounds i think it would be hard for a man who has been so long in the army and borne a post like mine in it not to have a regiment of friends at least   major cyprus which is a great consolation to you no doubt colonel   colonel downright the greatest in the world major but what  you have changed your house since i was last in england  this is not the same i think though near the same spot   major cyprus yes  i have changed my house  and what is more changed my state too colonel   colonel downright why you are not married   major cyprus what surprises you    colonel downright nay i am not surprised at your marrying only at your appearing so easy about it   major cyprus and why not colonel a valuable woman    colonel downright very true  very true  and so i wish you joy with all my heart  shaking hands but who is the lady pray do i know her or any of her family   major cyprus did you know sir george euston    colonel downright i have heard of him   major cyprus she was his lady   colonel downright a widow   major cyprus no  she was no widow   colonel downright did not you say she was sir george eustons wife   major cyprus very true  but sir george is still living   colonel downright what the devil is the man living and you married to his wife   major cyprus it was a divorce colonel   colonel downright a divorce  whu  now i understand you  why that is marriage en militaire  you might well appear so easy   major cyprus fie colonel  i assure you lady harriet cyprus and i are a most happy couple  and my having snatched her from a dull doting husband gives superior pleasure and triumph to our bliss   colonel downright the husband is much obliged to you both   major cyprus why poor fellow that is the worst  in spite of the congratulations i receive from my friends and my natural desire of fame and propensity to conquest i do feel and cannot help it a most deep sorrow and compassion for the thorns i have planted in his bosom   colonel downright but i suppose he used his lady very ill before he provoked her to the divorce and certainly preferred some other   major cyprus oh no by no means  he doated on her even to the day of their separation notwithstanding it was he who sued for the divorce   colonel downright he who sued for the divorce  oh that was it i understood you that you had planted thorns  but you said horns i suppose   major cyprus  smiles ha ha   colonel downright oh i wish you much joy    major cyprus why ironically colonel depend upon it i am the envy of all the men in town  lady harriet cyprus is a perfect beauty   colonel downright i am glad she is perfect in some respect   major cyprus oh  with some inquietude ridiculous colonel  divorces happen now every day  and the favored lover is the most admired and envied of mortals while the poor husband becomes an object of general pity   colonel downright ay the husband   major cyprus yes the husband   colonel downright ay and you are the husband now   major cyprus pshaw the forsaken husband   colonel downright you pity him   major downright certainly   colonel downright and if he is a tender hearted man i suppose he pities you   major cyprus ha ha ha  let me describe a scene to you where poor sir georges situation must affect the most obdurate heart lady harriet euston now lady harriet cyprus was when i first became acquainted with her a very loving wife we are friends colonel and i will venture to recount a few anecdotes to you a very loving wife indeed and but for my insinuations  artful insinuations i may call them  had continued her conjugal regard  she had been to this hour an example to wives if i had not tempted her to stray   colonel downright ay you  or somebody else   major cyprus  disturbed hear me out colonel  she was long an example to wives  she was i assure you  but to describe to you sir georges pitiable situation and what was chiefly the cause of the divorce  one evening we had prolonged the teteatete rather beyond the usual time when unexpectedly sir george and a party of beaux and belles were rushing up stairs  dear major cried my wife    colonel downright your wife  sir georges you mean   major cyrpus yes sir georges then  but my wife now   colonel downright ay ay and i most sincerely give you joy   ironically major cyprus pshaw you put me out  dear major cried my wife or sir georges if you will have it so  what will become of us for sir george had given us some little proofs of his jealousy what will become of us exclaimed the then lady harriet euston  put me into your thimble into the eye of your needle madam said i  instead of which crammed i was into that closet   colonel downright that closet   major cyprus that very identical closet which you see there  for sir george never loved the house after and so settled it on her ladyship  screwed up in that closet i believe i remained ten minuets when old lady downfall who was of the party called for drops the door was opened  and out dropped your humble servant   colonel downright zounds it was enough to make you wish yourself    major cyprus nay it was sir georges place to wish every beau in the room was round me in a moment and in a whisper give you joy major  the happiest man in the world  an alexander  a conqueror every where  even old sir samson shrivel shook his head and wished to be in my place   colonel downright zounds i would have thrust him into the closet and kept him there for a month but what did the husband say all this time   major cyprus that is what i was going to tell you  what did he say why he said nothing you may depend upon it he heard and saw all the half stifled laughs and was wise enough to know to whom they were directed  so poor fellow he turned pale  bit his lips  looked at her ladyship  looked at me  looked at his sword  and then cried heigh ho   colonel downright heigh ho  and what the deuce did you say   major what do you think i said egad i was a little confused   colonel downright confused   major cyprus and do you know i said  faith it was an odd speech and has been laughed at since in a thousand sashionable circles  the conclusion of it has been particularly marked dear sir george said i  he was standing where you may be here a little more this way and i just where i am at present  dear sir george said i half stifling a laugh for by my soul i could not help it though i pitied the poor devil too dear sir george said i i will tell you what  you will find nobody to blame in this affair  i protest my being in that closet was entirely owing to i will tell you what  in short to an  an undescribable something  there i made a full stop   colonel downright an undescribable something   major cyprus it is true upon my soul those were the very words   colonel downright owing to an undescribable something and i will tell you what that i got into this closet and so i suppose the next day sir george left both his wife and the closet and you have ever since held possession   major cyprus after some other explanations and regular proceedings i became the happy husband he was never formed to be   colonel downright but i hope you keep the key of the closet   major cyprus you will have your joke colonel  sir george out of despair is just married again  and lady harriets affection for me is such  yet faith i must confess to you too colonel that noth with standing i am so very happy in my marriage  my wife so very beautiful and so affectionate  yet i am a sad wicked fellow i have not forgot my old ways  no i am going tomorrow evening to meet a lady of untarnished reputation  a married lady  faith it is wrong  i know it is  but i cannot withstand the temptation  no i cannot forget my old ways   yawning colonel downright and do you suppose her ladyship can forget her old ways either   yawning major cyprus for shame colonel  but you are so fond of a joke  egad i have a great mind to make you laugh most heartily at the business i have now on my hands  you would say it was the most impudent thing of me  i will tell you another time on puporse to make you laugh no other design whatever  a bell rings that is her ladyships bell  come i will introduce you to her directly and i flatter myself you will admire my choice   colonel downright it does ideed excite my admiration most prodigiously    exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i a room at sir george eustons enter mr anthony euston and a servant servant i will let my master know immediately sir    exit mr anthony sir george has changed all his servants i think as well as his house for i have not seen one that i know and not one of them seems to know their old friend anthony euston   enter servant servant i beg your pardon sir i thought my master had been at home but he is not   mr anthony is not he   servant no sir he has been gone out this half hour   mr anthony he is gone to my house then i dare say  is your lady at home   servant yes sir   mr anthony be so kind as to let her know i should be glad to see her   servant what name pray sir   mr anthony only say a relation she will be glad to see  exit servant sir george may not be gone to my house neither for perhaps my brother has not yet called on him and he may be ignorant of our arrival  this house is a handsome one  yet i wonder sir george should leave his other  for i remember my neice was remarkably fond of its situation  poor girl  if she knew it was anthony anthony euston i believe she would not be so long in coming  goes to the side of the scene and calls come come my dear it is an old friend that wants to see you   he walks to the opposite side and when he hears lady euston entering he returns and calls come come  sure you have kept me long enough   enter lady euston  as mr anthony is going with great eagerness to saluteber he stops short and she courtesies mr anthony i beg your pardon madam i thought i had been speaking to my niece   lady euston your niece sir   mr anthony the lady of the house madam   lady euston i have the honor to be mistress of this house sir   mr anthony madam   lady euston my name is euston sir   mr anthony good heaven is then my niece that beautiful young woman dead   lady euston the lady that was lady harriet ogle sir    mr anthony yes    lady euston no sir she is still living and very well  i saw her the other morning   mr anthony madam you rejoice me   lady euston you are only mistaken in the house sir that is all   mr anthony madam you make me happier than i can express  but how could the mistake happen  they told me my nephew lived here  indeed i named no names at the door but only asked the man if his master was within and your name being euston madam i suppose first cased the mistake   lady euston very likely sir   mr anthony i beg pardon for the trouble i have given you   lady euston no apologies sir  permit me to let one of my servants show you to lady harriets   mr anthony no i am much obliged to you  if it is the same house that sir george euston lived in about two years ago i know it very well   lady euston it is sir   mr anthony madam i thank you  and once more beg pardon for the trouble i have given you through a mistake   lady euston dear sir no apology  petmit the servant to show you to lady harriets   mr anthony no madam i thank you i have been often there and know the house very well  madam good morning to you  i beg your pardon  good morning madam    exit mr anthony lady euston good morning to you sir  this is certainly an uncle of lady harriets who is unacquainted with her divorce  and i could not inform him of it twould have led to such disagreeable explanations and such a long roundabout story it must have caused  sir i am second wise to your present nieces first husband  lud lud how ashamed i should have been  lady harriet had better explain it by far    exit lady euston scene ii a room at major cypruss enter colonel downright and sir harry harmless sir harry now the major is gone colonel  notwithstanding all he has been talking of love and his vast happiness  you will hardly believe it perhaps  but he is not so very happy   colonel downright no   sir harry no poor man  you will hardly think it  but he is jealous   colonel downright what already and for heaven sake of whom   sir harry nay i assure you he has no cause  nor is he jealous of one alone  he is so of every body  and will be so of you  therefore i tell you that you may be on your guard  i am constantly with his lady and him and because the poor woman once shut him up in her closet he now suspects a lover concealed in every part of the house  and i have known him when the mad fit has been upon him search for a supposed rival even in her drawers and bandboxes   colonel downright pray sir do you live in the house   sir harry i have been on a visit here these six weeks   colonel downright and during that time    sir harry i have seen such things enough to terrify me from marrying  for wives are sometimes so provoking i am sure i could not keep my temper  now here is lady harriet cyprus  you cannot think how provoking she is  she sometimes says such terrible things to her husband that i am sure if she was my wife    colonel downright why you would not beat her would you or lock her up   sir harry no  but perhaps i might kick her lap dog or do some outrage to her dress   colonel downright you would make an admirable soldier sir harry   sir harry i must own colonel i should have no objection to a commission where the regimentals were becoming   colonel downright really    sir harry and indeed colonel i am positive you would be obliged to press commissioned officers if it were not for the becomingness of some of their dresses   colonel downright give me your hand sir harry  i like you much  and could i see you master of a firelock or a wife    sir harry no  while my neighbors marry i never shall   colonel downright why so sir harry   sir harry their wives will do for me   colonel downright i am amazed sir harry that the major jealous as you describe him should suffer you to remain in his house   sir harry i have often been surprised at it myself   colonel downright you have   sir harry but he never was jealous of me zounds it piques me sometimes  the ladies are fond of me and yet the gentlemen are not jealous of me  but indeed my amors have all been managed so secretly that none of them have ever yet come to light   colonel downright but who has been to blame there sir harry   sir harry i have paid regard to the reputation of the ladies and none to my own i expect an assignation tomorrow evening  and i question whether i shall men ion it to above three or four of my acquaintance notwithstanding the lady is reputed a woman of honor and is besides a married lady   colonel downright and would you divulge the appointment sooner on that account   sir harry certainly had i a wish to build a reputation   colonel downright who have we here    looking out sir harry the major and her ladyship he has been following her into the park and is now conducting her home i assure you their company at present will not be very desirable so step this way dear colonel and i will indulge you with a few more particulars  egad i can surprise you    exeunt colonel downright and sir harry enter lady harriet cyprus followed by major cyprus major cyprus so madam i have followed you home and now should be glad to know what unusual whim brought you into the park so early   lady harriet how can you be so teazing as to ask questions especially when you see i am too fatigued to answer   major cyprus fatigued madam  how is it possible    lady harriet dont speak so loud  i am thinking of something else   major cyprus zounds madam i say    lady harriet how can you major  sir george euston with all his faults never asked me such impertinent questions   major cyprus sir george madam  how dare you mention his name to me madam  how dare you mention to me that contemptible    lady harriet dear major do not be severe  consider you are  a married man yourself now   major cyprus heavens madam do not imagine    lady harriet and you know every gentleman is liable to    major cyprus what madam   lady harriet be married  there is nothing certain in this world   major cyprus very well madam  very well  i believe i understand your infinuation and i deserve it  i justly deserve it for venturing my happiness with a woman whose principles i knew   lady harriet how dare you major cyprus upbraid me or think because my unhappy partiality for you once betrayed me into indiscretions i am not now an altered woman  i am sure i have most heartily repented of all my faults and wished a thousand times i had never seven you   major cyprus exceedingly well indeed madam  exceedingly well  repent you ever saw me what am i to expect after such a declaration  and why repent you ever saw me  what you will not speak  i believe you are

closet  egad twill make him laugh   major cyprus  aside to the colonel fie fie  he is a relation of my wifes   colonel downright  aside he would not like a good story the worse for that  would you mr

as ever was told tell it major i would but i cannot look it as you do  egad you look it to the life   mr anthony well gentlemen i should be very happy to hear this story but i am obliged to defer it

  mr anthony only sir george sir   major cyprus what sir george pray sir   mr anthony sir george euston sir   major cyprus sir george euston sir  did you expect to meet sir george euston here   mr anthony certainly i did sir   colonel downright that is all for want of hearing the story  do my good friend come back and hear the story of the undescribable something  and of the closet  that little closet  and i will tell you what   major cyprus colonel permit me to speak seriously to the gentleman  sir  to mr anthony you will never see sir george euston in this house i am certain   mr anthony how so pray sir   major cyprus i am now master of this house and    mr anthony you are master of this house   major cyprus yes sir   colonel downright he took possession of the closet some time ago   mr anthony but pray sir does not lady harriet euston then live here   major cyprus that lady is no longer lady harriet euston sir but cyprus  she is my wife   colonel downright you have spoiled the whole story by beginning at the wrong end   mr anthony you astonish me  i beg your pardon  i came but last night from the west indies where i have been for some time and where not the smailest intelligence from england has ever reached me therefore you will excuse my ignorance  but i think her ladyship knowing how great a stranger i was ought to have dealt a little more openly with me    major cyprus i dare say sir her ladyship    mr anthony yes i suppose her ladyship was unwilling to be the first to acquaint me with the death of sir george   major cyprus the death of sir george sir   mr anthony yes sir  for while i give you joy on your marriage give me leave to say that mine is all damped by the loss of him  and my grief is doubly poignant because till this moment i was not only unacquainted with lady harriets second marriage but till this moment i did not even know sir george was dead   major cyprus sir george is not dead sir   mr anthony what do you mean  did you not tell me you were married to his wife   major cyprus very true sir  but you know that is no reason nowadays why the ladys first husband should be dead   colonel downright why my brother messmate you are just like me  i had forgot that a man in england might marry his neighbors wife and his neighbor living in the next street  and it is not the wives of their neighbors only these generous gentlement assail but more especially the wives of their friends   mr anthony shame on such friendship shame on such neighborhood  let every tender husband and virtuous wife desert it   to the major sir i wish you joy and though i know not who are the parties to be censured in this business i wish her ladyship joy  but more in particular i wish myself joy with the sincerest congratulation that amidst the depravity of the times i have followed a beloved wife to her peaceful grave mournful as the day was without seeing her wrested from my arms by the insinuations of a villain or being myself that villain to force her to seek a refuge from my perjuries in the protection of another    major cyprus dear sir let me assure you that however lady harriets conduct may meet censure from the unfeeling prude the woman of sensibility and taste must applaud her spirit which could no longer submit to the tyranny of sir george   mr anthony did her ladyship then sue for the divorce   major cyprus no  sir george on some frivolous suspicion was pleased to sue for it   mr anthony is sir george married again   major cyprus yes sir he is married  he has won the lady  and he has won her fortune  but for her affection  there i believe we must excuse sir george  that is a stake now playing for by many noblemen of fashion   mr anthony i suspect sir george is the dupe of a fashionable gallantry  i know his virtues  and am sorry to find a man of merit so betrayed   major cyprus dear sir think on lady harriet your relation   mr anthony thank heaven all ties between lady harriet and me were dissolved when she was divorced from sir george  and so they should sir had she been my own daughter and sir george with the principles i know he possesses an utter stranger to me   colonel downright why then i believe my friend you are not at a relations house   mr anthony colonel you will call on me shortly  sir mr cyprus i think you call yourself i assure you sir as a particular friend of my nephews and of the family in general  i am sir your most obedient servant  your humble servant sir   with contempt  exit mr anthony major cyprus for heavens sake who is this man i took him to be lady harriets uncle explain to me who the brute is   colonel downright he came passenger from the west indies in the same ship with me and that was the first of our acquaintance  as he was no more reserved than i we soon became intimate and i learnt from him that his fortune a pretty good one was designed for a nephew whom i now recollect though the deuce take me if i thought of it before to be this very sir george euston  and a son an only child by that wife he speaks so tenderly of he disinherits   major cyprus this is the very savage i heard lady harriet say the other day was drowned  what has his son been guilty of the criminality of a divorce   colonel downright no  his guilt is in being married  married to some poor girl  without friends or fortune  thank heaven i have neither child nor wife to offend me but if i had i dont know which i would make the most obedient   major cyprus and were you never a lover colonel never in the service of the ladies   colonel downright o yes  i have been in a closet before now  and under a bed too  but then i was never pulled out by a husband and on a discovery i could always describe the something that brought me there   major cyprus by heaven you are so taken with that joke i cannot reserve that which i before hinted at from you any longer  rat me if i have not an appointment for tomorrow evening with eustons other wife  is it not the most impudent thing of me    colonel downright i will be shot if i dont think so    major cyprus the poor fellow thinks her as chaste as diana and so she is at present as far as i know  i was happy in her favor a few years ago  but marriage not being then convenient my passion was postponed  on her becoming eustons wife i renewed my addresses and she has kindly allotted tomorrow evening for our first teteatete   colonel downright zounds have a care or you will be obliged to marry her too   major cyprus no no  we shall be very circumspect in our conduct  but laugh  why the devil dont you laugh   golonel downright no i was thinking    major cyprus on what    colonel downright come i must be gone or i shall be too late for my business   major cyprus i will attend you immediately  but what were you thinking on   colonel downright i was thinking on the happiness  of a married man    exeunt colonel downright and major cyprus end of the second act act iii scene i a room at sir george eustons enter mr euston and sir george mr euston bless my soul  bless my soul why what did my brother anthony say  was not he in a dreadful passion  only think of his being made such a fool of  it would not have signified had it been me it had been a good joke if the mistake had happened to me then you would have had something to have laughed at   sir george dear sir let us think no more about it  my uncle has listened to reason and approves my conduct in every circumstance   mr euston ay it is very well george  it is all very well  but i know had you been his son he would not have forgiven you  he loved that boy so well he would never forgive him the smallest fault   sir george a very cruel proof of his affection   mr euston it is true notwithstanding  you know it is  poor charles  george you must do something for him  you know your uncle will not  and i am tied from it by a solemn promise many a letter and petition came from his wife to my brother and me before we went abroad but all in vain for i had but just then given anthony my word and would not equivocate by causing the poor boy or his family to be relieved in any shape through my means and therefore i forebore to mention their distress to you  however now though i have not forgot my promise i will not be so particular about it  and when the deviation from my word disturbs my conscience i will hush it to rest with having relieved a destitute family   sir george say no more sir  i understand you  and to find out my cousin and his family shall immediately be my care   mr euston  shaking hands with sir george that is right george  poor charles is a lieutenant in the east indies  his wife must be the first object of your bounty  just before i left england she wrote me a letter from a village near york  where he left her with two children and she styles them in her letter the offspring of want and wretchedness i was a hard hearted fellow not to listen to her complaint  but i think since i have been at sea i have been more compassionate  i never knew before what it was to be cold or hungry   sir george can you tell me the name of the village sir where i am to seek her   mr euston write to her at the post office selby  if she should have left the place they may still know where to send her letters i wish some friend that had not made a promise would speak to my brother anthony about them at present perhaps going to sea has changed his heart too   sir george no sir i touched on that subject when i was with him this morning   mr euston did you  did you  and what did he say    sir george asked if i meant to make him forbid me his sight  and on my apologizing commanded me never to mention my poor cousin in his hearing again   mr euston ay that is what i must never do  well so much the better  for now george neither you nor i can tell tales one of another   sir george you are right sir  had my uncle anthony an estate to bestow on each of his family he could not exact more obedience to his will than he does at present   mr euston it is very true george but what keeps him so long away  i expected he would have been with your lady before this time acknowledging her for his niece though they have had one meeting it seems   sir george my uncle cannot be introduced to lady euston till tomorrow sir lord layton for whom he settled some business when he was abroad called on him just as i came away and as his lordship is going to italy in a day or two he entreated my uncle to accompany him immediately to his country house about ten miles from town in order to look over some papers he has there   mr euston here comes your lady so i will leave you   enter lady euston lady euston dear mr euston i hope i do not frighten you away  sir george will be offended with me if i do   mr euston no madam  i am sure no man could be offended at being left in such charming company    exit mr euston sir george my uncle is grown a man of gallantry   lady euston yes i inspire all the men   lady euston yes i insire all the men   sir george i believe you do   lady euston could i only inspire you with reason to listen to my arguments    sir george it is in vain  the major shall now feel my resentment  did he imagine because i was indifferent to the conduct of an undesserving woman that i am not to be roused at such an injury as this  an attempt on the principles of a woman of virtue  it is done on purpose to try me and by heaven he shall find  that wretch too sir harry    lady euston oh pray have pity on poor sir harry   sir george no madam  i only defer my resentment till i have had some conversation with my uncle anthony   lady euston do my dear sir george suffer me to revenge my own cause this once  and ever after    sir george i positively must   lady euston nay sir george in a year or two i may perhaps have no objection to your sighting a duel  but only three months married  i do wish to keep you a little longer   sir george depend upon it lady euston death had never half the terrors i have beheld it with since i called you mine  but that life you have endeared to me    lady euston you would throw away immediately in my service  no no sir george a fond wife will never suffer her husband to revenge her wrongs at so great a risk besides the exertion of a little thought and fancy will more powerfully vindicate innocence than that brilliant piece of steel i assure you   sir george perhaps you are right   lady euston certainly i am  now suppose a gentleman makes love to me  i divulge the affront to you you call my insulter to an account  your ball misses he fires into the air and to the same of having dared to wound your honor he gains that of presenting you with your life    sir george but why must these circumstances take place   lady euston well then we will suppose he kills you how do you like that   sir george  smiling hem   lady euston or we will suppose you kill him  even how do you like that   sir george well i confess that if a severe punishment could be thought of for such insolence    lady euston there is as severe a punnishment to men of gallantry as they call themselves as sword or pistol laugh at them  that is a ball which cannot miss and yet kills only their vanity   sir george you are right   lady euston let me see  we have been now only three months married and in that short time i have had no less than five or six men of fashion to turn into ridicule  the first who ventured to declare his passion was lord william bloomly  his rank joined to his uncommon beauty had insured him success and wherever i went i was certain to hear his distress whispered in my ear  at every opportunity he fell even upon his knees and as a tender earnest of my pity for him begged with all the eloquence of love for a single lock of my hair which he would value more than any other womans person the wealth of worlds or he is a great patriot you know even the welfare of his country   sir george i am out of patience   lady euston you will be more so  for i promised him this single lock   sir george you did not   lady euston but i did  and added with a blush that i must insist on a few hairs from one of his eyebrows in return  which he absolutely refused  and on my urging it was obliged to confess he valued that little brown arch more than the lock he had been begging for consequently more than any womans person the wealth of worlds or even the welfare of his country  i immediately circulated this anecdote and exhibited the gentleman both as a gallant and a patriot and now his lordships eyebrow which was once the admiration is become the ridicule of every drawing room   sir george your ladyship then would not menace your lover    lady euston certainly not  you are the most beautiful woman i ever saw said lord bandy and your lordship is positively the most lovely of mankind  what eyes cried he what hair cried i what lips continued he what teeth added i what a hand and arm said he and what a leg and foot said i  your ladyship is jesting was his lordships last reply and he has never since even paid me one compliment prudes censure my conduct  i am too free  while their favorite lady strenuous in another corner of the ballroom cries to her admirer  desist my lord or my dear sir charles shall know that you dare thus to wound my ears with your licentious passion  if you ever presume to breath in again i will acquaint him with it  depend upon it i will  sighs and languishes oh you have destroyed my peace of mind for ever   sir george there are too many such ladies but no such would i hazard my life for  that i have proved   lady euston and upon my word sir george even the virtuous wife who would not have some regard to her husbands life as well as his honor if i were a gentleman i should not feel myself under many obligations to   sir george you would protect both    lady euston and the guilty not escape  now with your consent what must be the confusion shame and disappointment of my two masked lovers tomorrow evening  the brutal audacity of one and isignificance of the other both beneath your resentment yet deserving objects of mine and indeed sir george it is my fixed opinion that the man who would endeavor to wrong a virtuous wife should be held too despicable for the resentment of the husband and only worthy the debasement inflicted by our sex i have already sent a letter to sir harry with the appointment at the masquerade and the major has my promise of a meeting at the same time  come come sir george it is the first petition i ever presented do not refuse me    sir george give me till the morning to consider of it   lady euston with all my heart  and in the mean time reflect on this  that in regard to your terrible sex whether as licentious lovers or valiant champions  women of real honor are not in danger from the one and therefore like me ought to forego the assistance of the other    exeunt lady euston and sir george scene ii a room at colonel downrights enter colonel downright and mr anthony euston colonel downright my good friend i was just going to bed  but i am glad of your company though i did not expect it   mr anthony colonel my errand at this time was merely to ask a favor of you   colonel downright command it and you will make me proud   mr anthony why then colonel with lord layton today at whose house i dined a circumstance happened on which account i expect his lordship will call on me tomorrow for a fashionable satisfaction and though depend upon it i wish for no such rash means of ending a dispute yet if his lordship should call upon me it is fit i be prepared with a second and i thank you for the friendly assurance you have now given me of your service   colonel downright you are as welcome to it  i was going to say as my king  but zounds if i should be killed in a pitiful quarrel at home i should blush even in my grave  for when i die i hope to have my knell rung by the groans of a score or two of our countrys treacherous foes   mr anthony the service i shall put you to colonel will not prevent that hope   colonel downright but what for heavens sake has brought you into a quarrel   mr anthony the cause of our quarrel was  you will call it a very trivial one i dare say  a woman   colonel downright why my old friend you have not been quarrelling about a woman  oh if i should be killed for a woman i should cut a noble figure indeed    mr anthony hear me colonel hear me  and as you may question my prudence let me tell you the whole adventure    colonel downright nay nay i did not mean to question your prudence nor to speak against the women either i like them as well as you do    mr anthony i own i have a respect for their sex which unites me to them as their father their friend and admirer  and i beg you will give me your sentiments upon the character of one whose behavior this day has surprised me beyond measure  i will describe it to you and you will then tell me whether you believe me imposed upon or whether you think she really clims that extraordinary attention i have some how been compelled to give her    colonel downright well let me hear   mr anthony lord layton and i had no sooner placed ourselves in his lordships coach than he exclaimed he had just seen the most beautiful girl his eyes ever beheld to whom he had given a look of solicitation and that she was returning her answer by making up to the coach  he begged a thousand pardons but with my permission as he expected no other company at his country house he would take her down to dine with us  i knowing his lordship well and the girl being now arrived at the coach door reluctantly assented and she was immediately handed in   colonel downright zounds he should have taken a companion for you too   mr anthony dont interrupt me  when she had been seated about a minute i cast my eyes upon her    colonel downright sdeath i should not have staid half so long   mr anthony i was struck with her beauty    colonel downright and wished his lordship out of the way i suppose    mr anthony no  no  there was a senfibility in her countenance that amazed me  blushes on her cheeks  tears in her eyes  when his lordship spoke to her she answered him with a forced smile and a tremor on her voice  she avoided all conversation and when we alighted i handed her out of the coach   colonel downright ay ay i thought how it was   mr anthony you misunderstand me  i perceived her hand tremble    colonel downright and so i suppose did yours   mr anthony if you interrupt me sir you shall hear no more   colonel downright and i believe it will be for your credit if i dont    mr anthony let me tell you all that passed   colonel downright with all my heart  if you dont blush at it i shall not   mr anthony i believe her to be a woman of virtue    colonel downright then what the devil were my lord and you    mr anthony i have rescued her from him   colonel downright why then the deuce take me if you are not more in love than i thought you were   mr anthony oh had you seen her countenance so expressive of anguish  the hope with which she lifted up her eyes to me for deliverance  the horror painted in her face when i left the room heard her piercing cries that called me back to her protection the despair and earnest supplication that hung upon her tongue while she entreated him to view her not as an object of love but charity  the grief the pathetic tenoerness with which she declared herself a virtuous though forsaken wife  a poor indigent forlorn mother perishing with her children  for whose sake she had been tempted by the first lure that offered prompted by more than common grief to add the sense of guilt to all her other miseries    colonel downright sdeath    mr anthony could i ought i to have gone and left her   colonel downright left her no but what did you do   mr anthony returned to the chamber and insisted on his lordships resigning her to me    colonel downright and did he    mr anthony she hung upon me and in spite of his menaces i led her to my coach which was then come for me and brought her safe away    colonel downright i hope she got safe home too    mr anthony perfectly so  as her tears interrupted her whenever she attempted to tell me where she lived or explain any circumstance of her life to me i asked no questions but took her to my own house  desired my housekeeper to show her an apartment and treat her with attention  and promising to see and speak with her in the morning left her to the repose which she must greatly want    colonel downright and now you think his lordship will send you to repose for all this   mr anthony he may attempt it for which i wish to be prepared    colonel downright well then here is my hand  and though i must acknowledge that you have had too little of the man of the world about you in the business yet as i said before command me    mr anthony come then colonel my coach is waiting for me at the door will you go with me to the next coffeehouse  i have to meet a gentleman there on a little business and afterward we will enjoy half an hours conversation together    colonel downright with all my heart    exeunt mr antbony and colonel end of the third act act iv scene i a room at mr anthony eustons enter mr euston mr euston wonders will never cease who would have thought it  why surely it cannot be  my brother anthony to bring home a girl  what would he have said to me if i had done such a thing  for my part i never durst think of such a thing  perhaps it is some neighbors child  but if she is  the servant tells me she is very handsome and anthony would not bring her home without some meaning  what would my nephew george say to this  why he would not believe it  he would a great deal sooner believe it of me  and yet i  i  lord bless me  how people may be mistaken  here he comes   enter mr anthony mr anthony brother good morning to you  have you seen george this morning   mr euston no brother   mr anthony are you going there   mr euston i believe i shall be presently brother   mr euston  sitting down perhaps he may brother    mr anthony appears thoughtful and leans on the table mr euston after a long pause and with significant looks it was a fine moonshining night last night   mr anthony yes a fine night   mr euston after another pause and it is a very fine day today   mr anthony yes  it is   mr euston we have very fine weather indeed   mr anthony we have  you have breakfasted i suppose   mr euston yes  and so i suppose have you   mr anthony yes some time    he begins writing mr euston i interrupt you brother  but i am going    rises mr anthony no you do not  but tell sir george if you should see him that i cannot call on him this morning because i shall be busy   mr euston you shall be busy   mr anthony yes i have got a little business to settle   mr euston to be sure business must be minded   mr anthony but be particular in delivering my apology for i would not have his lady affronted   mr euston one would not affront a lady to be sure  no  no  no   mr anthony i would not have her think i slight her   mr euston no  i am sure you would not slight a lady   he coughs  good morning brother   mr anthony good morning   mr euston we shall see you perhaps when your business is done  good morning brother     exit mr euston cougking mr anthony pulls a letter out of his pocket mr anthony yes  here is the challenge and truly something noble in it  he applauds my taking away the lady but says my manner was too rough  i must retract some words  my lord that cannot be   puts up the letter and now for a few bequests to my relations in case his lordship should prove victorious  it is well my will is already made  for he has scarcely given me time to   he writes then throws down the pen  what paternal weakness  rises how strange it is that although i have resisted and can with manly firmness resist every innare pleading for that ungrateful boy i once called my son that careless prodigal of a fathers peace and his own welfare  yet  when i consider myself as shortly to be an inhabitant of another world and without the power to assist him  i wish  i wish  what  why that heaven may then raise him up a friend to deal more gently with him than i have done  a friend whose temper whose place in better may become to forgive his faults than an offended father   he takes the paper in vain are the strugglings of nature  justice  example  and my word irrevocably past silence its pretenses   he seals the paper directs it and looks at his watch the time is almost expired and i must pay a short visit to my new lodger and be gone  john   enter servant mr anthony is not this the time that the lady gave me permission to wait n her   servant the

wretched sufferer   mr anthony madam you have imposed on me a task too hard  it is true you have won my pity but it is fit you should secure it too  and while explanations are reserved doubt that hardener of the human heart must be your enemy   lady alas  rises   mr anthony come  i wish not to enact too much  but i am a man madam and with every frailty incident to the species suspicion has its place   lady i know i am an object of suspicion  but you are deceived in me  indeed you are  guilt never harbored in my heart  maternal tenderness for two helpless infants hurried me in a moment to do i know not what rather than lose them  a deed the horror of which although by the mercy of eternal providence i have escaped its direst consequences must ever cover me with blushes and should indulgent heaven reserve me for a meeting with my husband must with remorse damp every joy the fond fond interview would give   mr anthony be comforted  leading her to her scat i mean not to increase

friendless  compassion caused his love for me  gratitude mine for him  forlorn and destitute no kind relation no tender benefactor taught my heart affection  unused to all the little offices of kindness could they but endear the object who bestowed them  sense of obligation never before excited pressed on my thoughts and soon was changed to love  he scorned to violate the heart that was his own and we were married   mr anthony i find no room for accusation here  go on  go on madam  what has alienated your husband from you and left you thus destitute at present  if you can resolve me that  if you still have acted with equal propriety i am your friend  i have no censure for you   lady but you will condemn my husband  even i must own he was to blame born of wealthy parents the heir to large possessions and i to none when he married all were given up and he changed his state for mine  we had no friend but in each other  yet happy was that state to me till poverty surprised us and the fond hope which once he cherished of paternal forgiveness vanished from my husband  then all our days were bitter as they had before been happy  tears were my only food and sighs were his  even reproach i have endured from him for making him the friendless wretch he called himslef  yet  yet at our parting oh then he cancelled all  for when the regiment in which he served was ordered from the kingdom he hung upon me clasped his poor children begged our forgiveness for the thousand outrages distress at our misfortunes had caused him to commit  swore that affection for us was the source of his impatience  prayed heaven to bless us whatever might be his fate  nay prayed that death might speedily be his doom so that it turned his fathers heart to us   mr anthony and have you never applied

blame him  i pardon him from my soul  and as my husband spite of his disobedience loved him tenderly i will ever give a tear in tribute to his memory   mr anthony without hesitation  without the smallest reserve tell me your husbands name is it euston   lady it is   mr anthony his father is not dead  he lives and pardons him this moment   embracing her mrs euston you are his father  i know it

for you all day  what meant the few words in your letter  why is my meeting with his lordship deferred   colonel downright i am just come from lord layton  a friend of his lordships knowing i was acquainted with you called and took me there  and to tell you the truth i think this business between you and his lordship might be amicably and honorably settled  however if you dont fight with him you must fight with a mad headed fellow i have left below  so which do you choose   mr anthony what do you mean   colonel downright nay you will have a worse chance than you would have had with his lordship for this man is a soldier one who has been fighting for these four or five years past  besides he is desperate  half mad and has sworn he will either kill or be killed by you instantly   mr anthony let him come  who and what is he  what has he to demand of me   angrily colonel downright nay dont be too violent neither  he is a poor unfortunate lad i fancy  and notwithstanding all his blustering  henow and then looks so heartwounded i cannot help pitying him   mr anthony but what is his business what is his quarrel with me   colonel downright lord layton is the innocent cause of it  he told the young man who came to his lordships somewhat sooner than i did in search of the lady whom you took away that the lady had confessed herself poor  and even perishing for subsistence  and that consequently she was willing to resign herself to the most liberal  which you proving in spite of his lordships generosity you carried off the prize  and egad i owned it was what i had suspected notwithstanding your grave countenance last night   mr anthony you told him you thought so   colonel downright yes  for i wished to turn the whole matter into a joke with his lordship  i did not think at the time that the young fellow would have been so violent  for till this was explained he was as patient as a lamb and only inquired with trembling and sighs for the lady  but when he heard what i said egad he laid hold of me and swore till i brought him to my friend the unpitying vile purchaser of innocence meaning you he would not quit me  so here he has followed me through the streets  and on condition that he would be patient while i came and announced him to you i have promised him you shall give him satisfaction   mr anthony what is this gentlemans name   anxiously colonel downright he did not tell us   mr anthony does he know mine   colonel downright no i thought it most prudent not to tell him for he is such a madman he might have bawled it as we came in the streets   mr anthony  much embarrassed what is he to the lady  her brother  her cousin   colonel downright why faith i have a notion though he did not say so i have a notion he is her husband   mr anthony indeed   starting colonel downright why you dont like the business the worse for that it is crim con now and you will be quite in the fashion   mr anthony let the young man come up  i will withdraw for a moment  but do not give him to suppose i have not injured him   colonel downright that you may depend upon  i never tell a falsehood for myself much less for another   mr anthony neither let him know my name i will first send the lady to him and then return myself   colonel downright he is coming    exit mr anthony charles  without where is this gentleman   colonel downright walk in here sir

see her more  aside  oh sir cooled with the restraint you have thus long imposed on me i wish to ask a favor  i thought i was resolved never again to behold the wretch i have been deprived of but my rage for a moment gone i cannot think of dying and she so near me without once looking on her  i have come far to see her  suffered much  crossed half the eastern clime in poverty  have endured more pain more toil to gain my freedom but to starve with her  and dying comfort her than had a throne been my waiting reward my spirits could have struggled with  and after all i feel i feel i could be repaid with a mere look  then why refuse me  if i escape my antagonist i have resolved on death let me then see her i will not exchange a word with her  will they refuse her coming   colonel downright no  for here she is    enter mrs euston and stops with emotion as soon as she enters mrs euston oh  but i am commanded not to fly to your arms  i must not run to you and tell you all i feel   charles  after a pause i said  i thought  i would not speak to you  but pity for your crimes and miseries compel me  and i tell you to alleviate your remorse i pardon you  nay perhaps love you better even in this agony of affliction than if we had been blessed with prosperous virtuous days  i know what you have suffered  your guilt convinces me  i want no other plea from a heart like yours  but where is your vile purchaser  my rage returns  i must die soon  but first in his breast   draws his sword colonel downright he is here    enter mr anthony charles then to his heart   going to flab him sees it is his father and after a pause falls an his knees may father    mr anthony yes  i am the man whose life you seek  and as your father you might pursue your purpose  but as your wifes friend and preserver still kneel to me and receive her virtuous from my hands    charles  embracing her virtuous  virtuous  o my father  even groaning under your displeasure ever dear and revered  what are you now while heavenly consolation pours from your lips    colonel downright father and son  why then there is to be no battle at last    mr anthony no  hostilities are past  and may their future days known only peace  my son    embracing him charles that tender name distracts me  let me be more composed  prepared  before i experience such unexpected happiness  maria lead me from my father  hereaster i will thank him but now i cannot    mrs euston oh yes my husband kneel to him again  kneel for me for your poor children saved from want and wretchedness  from being orphans  kneel to him for us all  preserved from infamy    charles o spare the recollection  i feel too much  a poor forsaken desperate dying man restored to love to life to him too  whose anger even while blessed with thee plunged me in constant sorrow  it is too much   mr anthony i thought my heart had been  but   he faulters and wipes his eyes colonel downright what do you weep  now that affects me more than any thing that has been said or done yet  i dont like to see a woman cry but i cannot bear to see a man  a mans tears flow from so deep a source  they always appear to have come a long journey and therefore i notice them as strangers that have gone through fatigue and trouble on their way  while a womans tears i consider as mere neighbors that can call upon you when they like and generally drop in on all occasions    exeunt scene iii major cypruss enter lady harriet and bloom lady harriet  aloud rap that is sir george  heavens    bloom yes my lady that it is    lady harriet heavens what a

or even abettor of the affront offered me at the masquerade    mr euston major cyprus  my brother anthony knew no more of the appointment at the masquerade than the child unborn  but bless you my niece and we meant you no ill by it we only meant to have a joke at your and sir harrys expense  that was all   major cyprus then give me leave to tell you mr euston and you also mr anthony that your

assured of his safety    major cyprus and pray sir who in this house is to assure you of it    sir george  bursting from the closet  himself    major cyprus confusion    mr anthony you see sir my intelligence was good    sir george strange as my concealment may appear the cause was such as i can with honor reveal   major cyprus then pray sir with honor reveal it   sir george why then i assure you major  and i assure you all  upon my honor  and on the word of a gentleman  that my being here  was  entirely  owing  to  to    major cyprus  warmly  to what  to what sir   colonel downright i

euston where is sir george   mr euston here my dear  just stepped out of the closet   lady euston what closet   colonel downright that  that very identical closet   major cyprus heigh ho    mr euston indeed lady euston you have cause to reproach him   lady euston i fear he will rather reproach me for this abrupt intrusion  but my apprehensions for his safety hearing no tidings from his uncles have alone impelled me to it   lady habriet had your ladyship not written this letter to the amiable sir harry harmless which i unfortunately supposed intended for major cyprus your ladyships alarming apprehensions might have been spared as i sent for sir george but to show him this letter   mr euston and that letter was only a joke  a scheme to mortify the major and sir harry   lady euston it was so  i own it  and the confusion the scheme has occasioned sir george needs all your forgiveness   sir george i sincerely pardon it  and hope the whole company will do me the justice to believe that my sole motive for entering this house was a compliance with what i then thought the dying request of that lady  and i now believe that her ladyships sole motive for wishing to see me was merely to show me the etter of which she speaks  a copy of which not without my knowledge but against my opinion was written by lady euston to major cyprus appointing a fictitious interview in return for his having dared to offend her with the profession of a licentious passion   major cyprus sir george i am perfectly satisfied with this explantation  but after what has happened the world may despise me for being so and therefore lady harriet from this moment we separate  and we had been wifer as well as happier if we had never met   lady harriet most willingly separate  your unkind treatment  and my own constant inquietude  have long since taught a woman of the world too feelingly to acknowledge no lasting friendship is formed on vice   mr anthony preach this my dear lady to all your fair countrywomen  enforce your words by your future conduct and they shall draw a veil over the frailty of your past life   lady harriet oh mranthony could i but retrieve my innocence my honor for ever lost   mr anthony yet do not despair  you can still possess one inestimable good  that inborn virtue which never perishes  which never leaves us but to return  for when you think it extinguished feel but due remorse and it rises again in the soul   mr euston that is right brother anthony  comfort her  it is your duty  and we are all relations you know  the whole company are related to one another  though it is in an odd kind of a jumbled way  i wish some learned gentleman of the law would tell us what relations we all are  and what relation the child of a first husband is to his mothers second husband while his own father is living   mr anthony brother you think too deeply   mr euston not at all brother anthony  and for fear the gentlemen of the long robe should not be able to find out the present companys affinity let us apply to the kindred ties of each others passions weaknesses and imperfections and thereupon agree to part this evening not only near relations but good friends   the end
