mead the art of healing would seem to be of all arts the most honorable even though no better reason could be given for it than that it is the most difficult the last is indeed so true that the task appears unsurmountable to many and even to some of those whom propitious heaven has blessed with the brightest and most intelligent faculties the provident and allwise governor of the universe has therefore imprinted on some minds a great and insuperable attachment to this science not to be overcome with difficulties or rather which knows no difficulties to whom the study is as easy as it is natural and is so far from being a task that it becomes a considerable part of their happiness who can penetrate with freedom and delight all the latent powers of created bodies and can discover by a sagacity somewhat more than human their dependence and effects on each other  to this wonderful bias this happy prejudice in favor of aesculapius we owe the characters of a pitcairne lister friend sloane sydenham etc but i shall not be thought guilty of flattery in saying that this attachment has in a very extraordinay manner distinguished dr mead  i am no stranger to addresses of this kind or to the general abuse of them than which nothing is more opposite to my temper and inclination but a generous mind however upright sincere and impartial cannot avoid acknowledging on these public occasions the merit which it admires and extolls in private conversation such a mind i say cannot forbear to confess in dr mead deep learning profound knowledge of medicine candor benevolence and condescension  some of these qualities have preserved thee from being moved with applause or adulation and have hindered envy itself from attacking thee they have both gained and preserved the esteem as well of the multitude as of the learned world through a very long series of successful practice  several of these considerations have induced me to present thee with the following sheets which contain naked truths undisguisd with subtle and hypothetical conjectures but established on plain and certain principles consonant to the unparalled system of boerhaave  that thou may long very long be preserved by thy own art to be an example of moderation an honor to the profession and a patron of it is rising sons is the most sincere wish and hope of  thy very respectful friend robert willan  the preface it will be unnecessary to tell the learned of the faculty that nothing has yet been wrote upon this subject which might be sufficient for the information of those who are unacquainted with it the systematic writers have either forgot it entirely as boerhaave has done or have passed it over superficially and as often obscurely to the young artist therefore i presume this piece will be acceptable in which though all has not been said which might be said yet perhaps sufficient to assist him to form a more clear and perfect idea of this disease and its method of cure than has hitherto been offered to the public the method of cure he will find more ample than the other parts of this discourse which are as concise as they could well be but this will be readily excused when he knows how much more difficult it is to cure this malady than to understand it  i should do injustice to the subject if i forgot to take notice in this place of that very short and subtle method by which the gross superstition of our ancestors taught them to believe this very obstinate disease might be cured viz by the wonderworking touch of a sceptered hand or of a piece of money from the same hand but we are to remark by the bye that it must be the hand of a lineal heir to the crown for those entitled to it by the invitation of the subject or the voice of the people though this was the best title in the world were not thought capable of performing this feat till this royalty had been propagated to the second or third generation and this was so much attended to that they scrupled not to make a miracle the test of his prerogative or genuine descent as may be gathered from the records of antiquity though the light of a better governed eaucation has shown the weakness and blind credulity of our forefathers and made us infidels to these and the like traditions yet we shall find that many of them still remain in esteem and even with those who want neither the advantages of learning or of natural sagacity and with the multitude most of them remain unshaken of these traditions the royal touch for the evil is none of the least sacred the origin of this whim seems to be at least as old as the dark night of popery in this island having probably been contrived to answer the designs of the crafty priests upon a superstitious people since by such a miracle as this they might claim a right to the throne for that prince who would best answer their purposes and such miracles they would not fail of publishing by wholesale though upon no better foundation than their own dark inventions this conjecture will appear more probable to those who know that from such vile arts as these viz the forging of miracles the popish religion receives no inconsiderable support even at this day in foreign countries though the learned amongst them are not so blind as not to see it but a hand of cruelty commands at least their silence and forbids them to say that they have eyes to see  from this piece of superstition then the disease has borrowed its english name at least a part of it but how it came to be called by way of eminence the evil is to be the subject of another enquiry it seems in reality to have been owing to its great obstinacy which made it esteemed desperate if not incurable we need not wonder if we suppose that they knew nothing of the true genius of this or any other diseases a very few centuries ago when the state of physic in england was as despicable as we can possibly conceive it to have been witness the histories of gilbert john gaddesden etc the archiaters of those days when the lives of princes were trusted in the hanas of ignorant mountebanks but though they were not perhaps less ignorant than their modern brethren they were however content not with doing much mischief or spreading destruction around them as some of these have done but with acting the impostor well and catching their game in which they discovered at least as much craft as our modern quacks and much more ingenious roguery by this we see that physic is but new to our clime though in justice to our countrymen it must be confessed it suits the soil so well that it is likely to make as great a figure in this island as in the ancient empire of arts and sciences  but they had another reason for esteeming this disease worthy the appellation of a plague or evil viz it is being remarkably hereditary this is indeed one of the worst circustances that can attend any disease which instead of being a private misfortune proves a calamity to families and becomes an unhappy mark of distinction as it appears always externally and offers itself to the observation of every spectator this indeed will appear a hard and unequal law to those who have not considered that the constitutions of parents properly belong to their children as much as the species itself nor can it be otherwise without reversing and counteracting those uniform and perfect laws which all matter and the organized bodies composed of it are obliged to obey these laws we may suppose as ancient as the first formation of matter and the mighty fiat which unfolded the great scene of nature they seem i say to be as old as the creation itself nor can they be contradicted varied or suspended without violating that order and most exact harmony which we observe in all natures works and which were inseparable from the perfection of her author  but does it not hence follow that all diseases are or must be hereditary no and why this is no easy question except it be sufficient to say that those diseases only are hereditary which can be communicated to the original stamina of an animal body if this answer be not satisfactory we must be content to acknowledge our ignorance by appealing to others  dicat qui novit this then was esteemed both an incurable and hereditary disease and this probably the reason why it was chosen as the most proper subject for a miracle as the cure of the greatest evil was fittest to demonstrate the best king  i have only now to acquaint my readers that the following doctrines are supported by the dissection of bodies and other matters of fact for as those things which affect our senses are always esteemed the surest and most infallible test of every doctrine so a more than common regard to those is necessary in our attempts for the advancement of medicine which as it is only conversible with sensible bodies ought not to admit any thing for truth which has not the testimony of the senses on this consideration wearied with the jargon and confusion which the flights of fertile but deceitful imagination had introaucd into the noblest of all sciences many of the wisest and most judicious of the moderns are resolved to allow no reasoning for orthodox which is not supported on the basis of demonstration by this means an art which has been accused of doubt and uncertainty is already arrived at such perfection as may enable her devoted sons to follow her steps with perfect uninterupted satisfaction and the testimony of a good conscience a great and admirable progress has been made in this reformation by the late incomparable boerhaave which will be a subject of praise and admiration in ages to come and an honor to the age and country in which he lived  an essay on the kings evil nothing is more necessary to the perfect understanding any disease than a just and exact definition such an one as may determine the bounds betwixt the real subject and every thing that may be disguised under a similar appearance this which we shall call a determinate definition was never more requisite in any disease than that which is to be the subject of this essay which as it is observed to be remarkably hereditary is reputed tho unjustly the most ignominious of diseases if we except the lues and for this reason we ought to be well informed of the requisites for distinguishing this hydra from the many maladies which bear any the least resemblance to it  for this purpose then we shall call by the name of scrophula or kings evil a swelling which has the following characters it is of the same color with the skin without pain and almost equal in hardness to a schirrus but these will not be so well understood without adding to them such a depraved state of the fluids as disposes them to be pituitous by deravity here i mean no more than that original disposition of both solids and fluids which the ancients called significantly enough  or temperamentum of which they had no less than eight different classes of these few were more remarkable than the temperamentum pituitosum  by pituit the ancients understood too great a solution of the blood in which its particles have lost that figure firmness and solidity from which it derives its red color but at the some time cohere together too tenaciously and thus we easily distinguish betwixt this and the humid crasis in which the tenacity is not included  it is easy to see that this disposition of the blood will render it unfit for many of its functions and alone is sufficient for the production of the worst diseases and if it be asked where these are most likely to be produced or what organs are most likely to suffer the answer will be easy those organs in which the circulation is the most difficult and pray which are these every body knows the glands their structure seems so much to retard the motion of the fluids through their vessels and the propelling force of the heart and arteries is so much diminished that it is the greatest wonder the circulation is not more frequently interrupted  these therefore are the parts of the body most liable to be obstructed and this is our case at present but amongst these the glands of the conglobte kind about the face axillae neck groin etc yet these are not all the glands that are observed o be affected those of the mesentery are also obstructed too and perhaps the readiest of any and indeed it is no wonder to those who consider the structure situation and the vis propellens of these glands this last obstruction is indeed the productive cause of the worst symptom of this disease as will appear afterward when we come to treat of the symptoms  but though this malady principally affects the glandular system and chiefly those glands which we have mentioned several other parts are sometimes sharers in the calamity this is in its last stage and does not happen till it has made a considerable progress and then indeed the tendons the articulations and the bones themselves are likewise affected  we ought next in order to deliver the symptoms of this disease but as these cannot be understood without a previous knowledge of its genuine cause we shall for the sake of perspicuity be obliged to postpone our account of the several phenomenon till we have discovered the sourse from whence they are derived and it had been well that this method had been followed by many of those who have taken some trouble to oblige the world with essays on diseases which though otherwise meritorious enough have for want of order failed in their design and left the subject involved in its former obscurity it is too well known to be dissembled that this has been the case with too many of our own countrymen the learned dr astruc speaking of a certain english writer says ordine parum composito disseritur saltem ea methodo quae lucem afferat quam in anglorum medicorum operibus plerumque desiderari dolemas pudet haec opprobria etc who wanted neither genius nor abilities to do honor to the subject to their art and to their country  the proximate see page   and   cause of this disease appears to be nothing more than a viscid pituitous state of the fluids and too great laxity of the solids by these we must endeavor to explain all the phenomenon we have to explain and where these prove insufficient we must patiently submit to the imputation of ignorance this however is only to be understood of the recent or simple struma without those desperate symptoms to be observed in its last stage and which are to be referred to their proper place  the remote causes of this disease are whatever accidents are capable of producing the aforesaid disposition such as first an hereditary labes which is perhaps the most frequent cause every body knows this disease to be hereditary but few know how it comes to be so we may solve this problem as easily as any other of the same kind by saying that an inviolable law is imposed upon every genus of created bodies whether animated or not which propagate their species by which its foetus or embryo not only agrees in every individual organ with its parent but likewise partakes of its perfections or imperfections thus the solid fiber produces another of the same sort and a lax fiber a lax one etc thus far we may proceed safely and perhaps no farther for in attempting a more minute solution we shall i believe find our selves at our utmost limits and on the border of obscurity there seem to be some bounds placed to all physical enquiries beyond which we cannot go except in imagination and sometimes even that will fail us i dont mean by this to undervalue the deep philosopher or his profound enquiries into the abscondita naturae no the deep man best deserves the title of philosopher and will always receive the most delight as well as honor for the reward of hs labor but let us endeavor to be contented with the knowledge within our reach and to place the bounds betwixt deep and unfathomable profound and unintelligible by this means we shall save ourselves some trouble and avoid not a few mistakes  thus much on hereditary diseases  the next of the remote causes must be understood from the consideration of that time of life in which it first discovers itself this is in childhood when both solids and fluids always tend too much to that cachexia which we have assigned as the proximate cause of the scrophula the faetus immediately after conception is a mere jelly and scarce any distinction can be made betwixt its solid and fluid parts in a few months the first have acquired a stronger power of cohaesion and the latter are more attenuated at the time of birth this change is yet more considerable but the vessels are yet very lax and their contained liquors are viscid and disposed to be pituitous nor are they brought to a proper crasis in less than about twenty years nobody who considers this will wonder why children are so subject to this disease but the disposition is often aggravated by their wy of living and from the immoderate use of sweet fruits farinaceous or other glutinous substances etc  we are now at lberty to observe the several phenomenon and will first begin with the tumors themselves which were already described in attempting to define the disease and first  they are dispersed or which is the same thing affect many different glands at the same time and this needs no explanation secondly they are very smooth and this will be best understood by considering the structure of the organs affected as their figure is globular they will be equally distended on every side by the obstructing matter in their cavities and thus their surface will be even and smooth though not commonly shining thirdly these tumors are also somewhat hard though not so hard as the schirrhus the viscid matter being lodged in the follicle and confined there the finer parts are carried off by the absorbent vessels and the remaining matter becomes more viscid then glutinous and at length firm this is no more than happens in a lesser degree in all the cavities of the body where their contained liquors are permitted to remain for some time as the vesiculae seminales gall bladder etc fourthly they are even when ulcerated without pain and this perhaps is not less remarkable than any of the other peculiars to this disease it will not be wondered that the conglobate glands have not this uneasy sensation before their being ulcerated as the same is observed in more diseases than this and may be explained afterward but the most sensible parts as well as the more firm such as tendons ligaments etc are destroyed by this labes without any sense of pain this indeed is not easily understood except it be sufficient to say that the destruction of these nerve us parts is not owing to any acrid matter which corrodes them but to the laxity of the vessels in which the tension or attractive force is so small as to allow their component fibers to be divided without that resistance which is the immediate cause of pain  the next symptom is an inflation of the face and neck this is indeed a constant attendant of the struma and perhaps one of the best distinguishing signs we are acquainted with i remember to have heard a learned physician a person of great ingenuity say that by means of his long experience and practice he could distiguish a patient affected with this disease by only looking him in the face this inflation is greatest in the inferior part of the cheeks and is best understood by considering that in this habit of body the vessels are supposed too lax which alone will be sufficient for understanding the cause of an inflation but why this is confined to the face and neck or at least is more remarkable in these than any other parts is not so easily understood perhaps the exposure of these parts to the action of cold by which the proximate cause of the disease is aggravated in their vessels the number of glands about these parts in which the motion of the blood is retarded or obstructed and lastly an hereditary disposition of the parts themselves may be sufficient for explaining this phenomenon we dont observe that the complexion is so much changed as might be expected there is however a certain livid or bluish cast which is better learned by observation than description this is seldom wanted and in children helps to complete that particular aspect of the face from which the presence of this disease will rarely be mistaken by those who have made the study familiar  another remarkable symptom of the scrophula is a great or frequent pain in the belly which is easily understood from what was said before of the mesenteric glands if these are rightly supposed to be the seat of this pain but indeed this uneasiness in the bowels seems not less probably to be produced by the viscid pituitous matter lodged in the rugae of the intestines themselves and this will perhaps appear more reasonable if we remember that the same sort of obstruction does not produce pain in the other glands or even much more sensible parts and that we find nothing more ready to produce a cholic than this pituit in the intestines as may be observed in the diseases of children  the last symptom we shall mention and which is rarely absent in this disease is a great prostration of the natural functions those to wit of digestion and nutrition this change or process is twofold and may be comprehended under the general heads of chylification and sanguification but both these will suffer greatly in such a stale of the solids and fluids as was before described as the proxima causa of this malady the first requisite to the first of these actions is appetite or inclination for food which is here destroyed by the great quantity of viscid pituit in the stomach and intestines again after they are received into the stomach the action of this is so weak and the juices necessary for dissolving the food are so much depraved that this part of digestion cannot proceed as it ought and the same defect will be found in the intestines the first process therefore either is not performed at all or at least very imperfectly and this deficiency cannot be repaired afterward for this crude and viscid chyle when received into the circulation in order to undergo it is second change by the action of the vessels but this is already too weak for that purpose and thus the pituit increases and at length the vital functions suffer the last consequence will be a hectic fever not to be expected till near the end of the tragedy  all these phenomenon are sometimes accompanied with a fever heat etc the tumor then becomes painful and at length ulcerated and what we commonly call malign pouring out a disagreeable sanies generating remarkably fungous flesh and yielding little or nothing to remedies the fever seems not to be the genuine effect of the disease except we suppose some other cause to have acceded as some acrid irritating virus latent in the fluids but as this is not presumed to be a part of the disease itself we must be obliged to impute the fever to a foreign cause of this or some other kind i know a fever to be the natural product of this malady in it is advanced state but it is of the hectic kind and generally the forerunner of death  this fever appears to be generally owing to the chyle which however crude and unprepared is received into the vessels and being incapable of undergoing its proper change there produces a febris symptomatica the circulation being now increased the fluids are propelld with more than wonted impetus into the glands their follicles are burst and pour out a disagreeable sanies  the consequence of all these is easily understood the sanies will be absorbed in pretty large quantity into the mass of blood which being now infected contaminates the whole circulation and thus all parts of the body may be affected  many fresh ulcers now appear on the external parts the tendons and ligaments themselves are eroded and exulcerated likewise the bones chiefly at their extremities where their texture is least firm by the laminae being more separated from ech other at length the internal viscera suffer in the common calamity as they must inevitably receive into their vessels the same morbific fluids which corrode and convert them into a similar sanies this again is absorbed into the common mass which now becomes yet more corrupted hence a phthisis multiplex which is certain death  it is unnecessary as well as unsuitable to the design we laid down to trace the various symptoms effects etc of this pthisis before it terminates in death but it may be proper to take notice that it is incurable nor will a proof of this be required after reflecting on what has been already delivered  but the progress of the scrophula does not always observe the order we have explained it sometimes makes a shorter period by swelling the thuroid gland which by compressing the aspera arteria puts a sudden end to the scene in this case the necessary relief cannot be easily given and our principal dependence must be on such medicines as can be immediately applied to the part affected which must be in the form of vapor but of this more hereafter  thus far we have traced the progress of the scrophula with its several symptoms without supposing any other disease connected with it but this too frequently happens and then it is easy to see how difficult will be the cure and how dubious the event  the diseases we find sometimes joined to this are several and those of the worst kind too which give a stimulus to the tardy progress of the struma and render its termination shorter as the scurvy and lues in each of which is a considerable degree of acrimony as is plain both from their origin and effects they are to be discovered by their proper signs and an exact and minute enquiry into the patients former way of living and into the errors he may have committed in the nonnaturals sufficient for producing this or the other species of acrimony by such a rigorous enquiry into his history we shall be able to judge more safely on this head than we can otherwise do by any signs whatever  both the abovementioned distempers show themselves pretty clearly to the external senses as they appear for the most part on the surface of the body the ulcers of the lues have some peculiarities which will not allow us to mistake them and their progress is so regular and uniform that we need not often be deceived  the presence of the scurvy is not determined with more difficulty than that of the other but to determine its species will require more sagacity than may be readily belivd by those who have not made the experiment to the want of this distinction we may impute the ill success with which the scurvy is so often treated which need not surprise us if we consider that one species requires a method of cure opposite to that of another and a third has no affinity with the other either in its origin or method of cure in a word they proceed from causes entirely repugnant and to attempt the cure of the scurvy by any one set of medicines would be just as reasonable as was the learned bishop of c  nes hardy attempt to cure both the pleurisy and dropsy by his subtle tarwater  whoever therefore undertakes the cure of the scrophula must examine with due attention whether it is accompanied with the abovementioned or any other diseases that he may be able to draw a certain and faithful indication  the diagnosis of this malady was given before and therefore nothing more need be said to it and of the prognosis what we have to say will now be easily apprehended  the hereditary struma is by much the worst species and the same is true of all original diseases for so we may call them which as they have their essence intermixed with the first principles of life can scarcely be separated by a less power than that which united them together and though the symptoms of perhaps all diseases admit of some mitigation yet the experience of antiquity as well as our own has taught us that the labes hereditaria of almost every kind is incurable  the next in malignity we shall esteem that of those children whose parents were of a lax and weakly habit effeminate in their way of living eating and drinking voluptuously and indulging a sedentary unactive life who for reasons we shall not attempt to give derive to their offspring a weak and sickly machine subject to the incroachment of many diseases from which their parents might yet be free and unable to make a proper defense or to receive all the benefit of medicinal aid these when attacked by the scrophula may indeed be relieved and perhaps cured but it will be necessary at the same time to repair and improve that constitution which nature had left imperfect or rather which natures antagonist had rendered so viz luxury in the parents  but other children there are afflicted with this disease whose parents were strong vigorous and healthy and themselves when first brought into the world in every respect healthy as their parents and likely to continue so yet these are perhaps pretty early attacked by this disease in these therefore it must be attributed to some error of the nonnaturals much aggravating that universal diathesis in children which was first assigned as the genuine source of the scrophula these indeed have the fairest chance of a sure and quick relief from medicine as the habit of body was before very good and is fit for undergoing the action of medicines these are indeed curable and will rarely be disappointed of a perfect cure from the method we shall endeavor to deliver  the first thing in order for order is here necessary we have to do for the effectual cure of this distemper will be the correction of that cachexy which is the fundamental cause of it the means of doing this are first by corroborating the vessels  dly by diminishing the quantity of the morbific matter both in the primae viae and whole body  dly by concocting the remainder  to the first intention a proper regimen of the nonnaturals must be adapted and on which it will principally depend let the patients food be light and dry not at all glutinous but rather somewhat astringent roasted meats well seasoned with spices such as are generally used in the kitchen as cinnamon mace cloves etc bread exceeding well fermented or such as has undergone that process a second time and made from the dryer and less glutinous vegetables to these may be added the dry fruits of the indies his liquors must also be well fermented and of these the best are fine old ale and the astringent wines if they are of a due maturity as rhenish redport etc which will be much fitter for our purpose after being well impregnated with the dry aromatics  exercise is of no small consequence in this case of the several diversions which go under that name prefer riding as well in this as most other diseases where exercise is necessary as it perhaps answers all the intentions of exercise in general without any of the inconveniences which attend some of the other species of it we are however to be governed in this as in every other change of the nonnaturals by the strict rules of prudence exercise is always to be proportioned to the strength of the patient nor ever to exceed it on any pretense whatever and the limits of this direction will be best determined by the patient who is always to take the first sensation of weariness as a caution to desist this will be a certain and safe rule which as it may be followed without any uneasiness as it is no more than avoiding uneasiness so he is always to esteem it sacred nor can he trespass upon it without greater mischiefs than those it was intended to remove to check nature or her luxuriant sallies is no difficult matter but to restore her when languid oppressed and almost overcome with the combat is an hardy task  hic labor hoc opus est   let us therefore remember always to have a proper regard to her preservation let us remember we are her servants and profess ourselves yea are ambitious of the title of the ministers of nature  the air is of no mean importance here the best is the dry serene and somewhat warm if the climate and season are contrary we must endeavor to supply their defects within doors and for this purpose a situation remote from much wood and water on a dry and barren soil defended from the rainy winds will be most suitable the house itself ought to be exceeding close and preserved from damp by large and constant fires and let its windows confront the meridian sun the patients chamber ought to be in the upper part of the house well wainscotted and let its air be impregnated with the effluvia of the most odoriferous spices let his bed be very hard and composed of the cordial astringent and most aromatic plants moderate sleep will be best that is within the compass of seven or eight hours which number ought never to be exceeded unless we are willing to increase the malady sleep is a time of relaxation and that always the muscles before wearied with contraction are now to be relieved by resting in a contrary state and whence is this change the contracting cause ceases in all the voluntary motions that all these being still and quiet the other functions may be performed with less interruption the circulation of the fluids through their vessels is now calm and undisturbed because the equilibrium betwixt them is not destroyed by any foreign agent but there is another cause of relaxation besides that of sleep itself and which seems not to have been hitherto sufficiently regarded and that is the vapor formed around the body by its own atmosphere which being confined and as it were reverberated by the bedclothes makes a true balneum vaporis than which a more powerful menstruum is scarcely known for relaxing the fibers of an animal body and this feems to produce all the ill effects we observe from long lyingabed in those who lie awake a considerable part of the time of this class perhaps may be supposed no small number of the ladies of ease and this is probably one grand cause of all those diseases which are more peculiar to the fair and imputed to a lax and feeble make of the solids the atmosphere we have been speaking of and which derives its name from its similitude to that surrounding the earth is no more than the invisible matter of perspiration exhaling from every point of the body and seems necessary for preserving it from the injuries of the air  the covering of the body is of no small consequence which as it ought to be well defended from the cold must also be incited to a brisk perspiration the patients clothes therefore are to be thick and warm and the best materials for this purpose is allowed to be wool  the last of the nonnaturals we shall speak to are the passions of the mind these ought never to be forgot in treating of any regimen for the cure of chronic diseases upon the mind as the first mover depends the freedom and perfection of all the functions of the body and this is reciprocally true and though we know not or are ever likely to know the laws by which they act upon each other this we wll know and constantly experience it that their connection is such as will not allow one of them to be hurt without drawing the other into inevitable suffering they rejoice and mourn together whoever therefore desires to restore the machine to its pristine alacrity and vigor must always have an attentive regard to its associate and fellowsufferer this design may be often effected in a considerable degree by medicine by means of the mutual intercourse we have been speaking of but other artful means are also to be used for exciting alleviating or diverting the passions which need not be mentioned here as they dont properly belong to this place in the present case a cheerful and lively disposition ought to be much encouraged and the contrary to be diligently avoided or prevented the first affords a free and liberal supply of spirits as well to the heart and the other involuntary organs as those subservient to the will and thus the circulation dependent on them is brisk and free which is always to be our study in this and the like diseases the latter or sorrowful mood produces the contrary effects and those remarkably enough  the second intention or the diminution of the morbific matter both in the primae viae and whole body is to be effected by cleansing that canal and evacuating the morbific matter out of it and by this means we cannot fail of lessening its quantity in every other part of the body but this is to be done by two and those very different evacuations  the first is vomiting which is no other than a convulsive contraction of the stomach and those organs which by means of nerves immediately communicate with it and is excited by any thing that is capable of producing that contraction it would be too tedious to give an account here of the operation of every kind of emetic a very small number of them is now in use and a much smaller will be sufficient for us here the celebrated ipec which is now deservedly had in so universal esteem is by much the safest and yet sufficiently effectual with this therefore alone we shall be contented in our present design of evacuating the viscid pituit lodged in the stomach if we may be allowed sometimes on occasion the tartar emet which if the dose be ascertained with the requisite exactness may deserve the second place  the latter evacuation is effected by a set of medicines intended for that sole use under the general name of cathartics but the judicious ancients having observed the various effects of cathartics in producing a larger discharge of different humors have with care and exactness enough reduced them into proper order according to these various effects and though they could not explain upon mechanical principles their causes or manner of operation as not being well enough acquainted with the laws of the animal economy as deduced by the light of modern discoveries their testimonies are however founded on experience and most accurate observation nor does it signify to us whether they have explained effects from some specific hidden or chimerical properties or by the qualities of hot and cold etc it is sufficient that they have faithfully acquainted us with matters of fact and give us the liberty of embracing or rejecting their reasoning these several classes of purging medicines derive their names from the humor they are observed most remarkably to act upon and though in some of the terms they have mistook one thing for another a very little candor will oblige us to excuse this and to admire that sagacity and extol the industry that has laid the foundation of almost all we know of these matters which deserves our confidence or the appellation of science  of these classes there is one tribe peculiarly adapted to our purpose of evacuating phlegm out of the stomach and intestines and thence called  their number is pretty considerable as their manner of operation is various we shall divide them into two classes of which  the first are those which dilute attenuate or resolve the viscid matter and so render it fit for expulsion these are   water which ought to be drank warm with the body lightly covered and exposed to a cool air to prevent its passing off by the skin   the same rendered saponaceous with sapos whether natural or artificial as honey sugar unrefined cassia manna common soap as that which bears the name of castile or venice sapo philosophorum and that natural one of animals the bile   the same fluid water impregnated with the saponaceous gums which by help also of their acrimony have a considerable solvent power as g aloes ammoniac galbanum sagapen etc   a solution of any of the chemical salts which have a resolvent quality such are the tartar regenerat tart vitriolat tart solub tart simplex sal ammoniac crud etc  the second class of phlegmagogues comprehends all those which are capable of giving such a stimulus as is sufficient and not more than sufficient for increasing the peristaltic motion of the intestines by which they are to be discharged of their contents these it is easy to see are to be endued with such an acrimony as is not too naked and violent or too volatile the first might blister and inflame the tender and very sensible tunica villosa and produce a train of the worst symptoms as convulsions dysentery etc the latter would not be constant enough for promoting this constant motion and be therefore insufficient for the purpose those therefore will best answer our end which have a moderate and corrigible acrimony or envelopd in some viscid and glutinous matter and of this sort are the following which have many of them likewise a solvent power oxymel hiera picra several preparations of mercury of which the safest and much the best is the merc sublimat dulc the chemical salts of the last class the roots of mechoacann brion jalap etc the fruit and middle bark of the ebulus juice of buckthorn etc  our next design is the concoction of the morbific matter in the vessels and whole body but before we proceed allow me to observe that this coction is no more than such a change of the morbid matter as renders it no longer noxious but assimilates it so much to the nature of the sound fluids as to fit it for passing through its vessels without hurt and then it will no longer deserve the name of morbid but is transmuted or concocted so as to be an humor sanus or which is the same thing the disease ceases how therefore is this happy change to be effected to this the answer is short  by nature herself and if this word be not acceptable i shall change it for another the vis vitae by which the design is to be principally effected though there is an additional means to be afterward mentioned in which we shall be much beholden to art and indeed we must be so here notwithstanding our expectation of seeing it performed by the hand of nature the vis vitae the action of the vessels and the force of the circulation as these have not been hitherto sufficient for the purpose or the disease could not have taken place we must render them so by proper methods which are first by corroborating the vessels secondly by stimulating them the first will render them fit for contraction and the latter will force them to it the best method of corroborating the vessels has been already given ex professo the stimulus necessary here may be communicated by a set of medicines which have on this account received the name of stimulantia which as they will be of eminent service deserve in this place to be ranged in some order the first shall be those which act so upon the mind as to produce a greater influx of the nervous fluid by which the heart and arteries are made to contract with greater force as well as velocity and this we observe remarkably in several of the stronger passions as will be sufficiently demonstrated to any one who will take the trouble of feeling the pulse of a person under such an agitation and this is true in a less degree of the cheerful and lively disposition formerly mentioned  the next and most general stimulants are the acria of every kind but these are so numerous that they cannot well be enumerated and this will be less necessary only shall be recommended here these are the aromatics of which the best are those which are at the same time corroborants or astringents such are the greater part of the following the barks of cinnamon peru winter cassia lignea etc the roots of gentian ginger imperatorium valerian calamus aromaticus galangal etc seeds of cardamomum mustard etc the leaves of the abrotanum absinthium ruta sabin etc  the last tribe of stimulants consists of those things which cannot be referred to either of the other two orders such as fire wounding instruments motion or exercise etc  having now laid down the method by which nature is to be enabled to concoct the morbid matter let us consider what further assistance can be given to this work by simple art the viscid pituit which constitutes the disease is to be attenuated and divided and therefore our indication commands the use of those medicines which are capable by a sole menstrual power of inciding and attenuating some such valuable medicines indeed we have whose menstrual force is perhaps much greater than is generally supposed the following are the principal viz the neutral salts as the tartar regenerat tartar solub tartar vitriolat the spiritus mindereri which is indeed an excellent resolvent and seems well to deserve the reputation it has acquired in a very few years a neutral spirit made for the most part extemporaneously by the affusion of juice of lemons on the sal absinth or any other fixed alcaline salt the crude sal ammoniac  i must not forget another medicine which seems to be endud with almost all the properties we could wish for our purpose viz of dissolving stimulting and attenuating i mean the aq calc which if it is used fresh as it always ought to be will perhaps preserve it is qualities through the whole course of circulation more perfectly than any medicine we are acquainted with  for all these inestimable preparations we are obliged to chemistry they perhaps deserve to be esteemed the most universal medicines we are acquainted with and the use of them is never to be forgot in this disease but to be insisted on with the greatest care and diligence from the beginning to the completing the cure  i shall not presume to direct my learned reader in the choice order and method of prescribing the medicines as all these will vary according to circumstances but it may not be amiss to observe that those which dilute and attenuate are always first to be used and that for a competent time and when this end is obtained the expulsion of the resolved or concocted matter will be easy but the attenuantia if prudently chosen can never be given unseasonably  we have now treated of our great design of correcting the universal cachexy and we are next to consider the safest and most effectual method of taking away the tumors and this is threefold first by resolution secondly by suppuration thirdly by the knife the resolution of this sort of tumors will be difficult enough nor ought it to be attempted in their more advanced state those only being fit for resolution which are recent gentle and where other circumstances are the best and then it is to be performed if it can be performed at all   by the internal medicines for correcting and eradicating the proximate cause of the disease   by topical applications of which perhaps the best will be in form of vapor for this purpose the antiseptics are best as vinegar whose vapor may be directed through a tunnel the antiseptic gums may be likewise very fitly applied in the form of plaster etc we shall not insist longer on this resolution as we are not acquainted with any better methods for that purpose    the suppuration of these obstinate tumors is to be attempted by the application of those substances we generally term maturants or suppurants which though supppsd to operate in some hidden or specific manner do no more than confine and if the term be allowable reverberate the natural heat and by this means promote that change which nature herself only can effect of the morbid matter into pus thus all glutinous oily or farinaceous substances become suppurants when applied in the form of plaster or poultice such are balsams most resins meal of barley oats or wheat etc these will not be less effectual if they have added to them some small degree of acrimony when the tumor is suppurated and not till the process is quite perfected it may be opened at discretion either by incision or the potential cautery and then the ulcer is to be treated like an ordinary one by the common detergents  but neither resolution nor suppuration will sometimes succeed and this is when the tumor is very hard and when this happens we have but one method to choose viz extirpation by the knife according to the ordinary rules of art but this operation is not to be undertaken without well considering the circumstances of the case if however the disease be not inveterate and the tumor is benign it may be extirpated but not without observing it is situation and proximity to the larger vessels which will sometimes absolutely forbid it  the exulcerated tumor is next to be treated of and is to be healed   by internal medicines viz such as may correct the putrid acrimony which has now contaminated the whole fluid mass and is likely to produce a pthisis multiplex this is to be done by mild demulcent medicines together with the antiseptics for this purpose the use of milk is to be insisted on together with such medicines as best answer this intention such are the native balsams viz turpentine tar bals capivi etc   by destroying the remainder of the tumor and fungous flesh by escharotics together with the ordinary detergents mixed with them and when this is done the cicatrizantia are to be applied  there is another kind or rather form of the exulcerated struma which preys upon the membrana cellulosa betwixt the muscles forming large sinuss betwixt them and these will be difficultly healed as indeed are all other sinuss betwixt muscles these are however to be treated much like others viz by filling them with digestives and injecting determents it is easy to see that this manner of treating them and we are not acquainted with a better will require a very considerable time for the healing of such very deep ulcers when the tendons articulations etc are affected in the manner we formerly described they are to be treated like ordinary apostems care being taken to correct as much as possible the putrid diathesis of the blood by the method above prescribed it seems unnecessary to mention after what has been said already that if we discover any signs of the scurvy or lues they are to be treated according to the established rules of treating those diseases and if any contraindications should occur we can never be at a loss if governed by that golden axiom of the schools  ubi indicatio impar simul urget tum semper erit satisfaciendum maximae thus i hope to have given such a method of cure in this obstinate disease as will not need further explication if it is persisted in with the resolution always to be expected from those who wait for the cure of chronic diseases we cannot doubt of all the success which it is in the power of art to give to say more will be superfluous i therefore shall proceed to some other matters relating to this malady absolutely necessary to be considered by those who wish to be masters of the subject  the first thing which deserves our animadversion is the common complaint of it is return after the tumors or ulcers have been extirpated and healed it is true this is often the case and is no small discouragement to the patient and his friends and sometimes obliges them to sit down contented with believing that the malady is incurable but the reason of all this is not difficult they have attempted the cure of the disease without eradicating it is real cause or essence the external appearances being no more than the product or effects of the other it is no wonder therefore that they have been disappointed and that the tumors return very soon after they have been taken away and indeed to expect a cure from this method is just as reasonable as it would be to hope for the cure of an inflammation by the use of an opiate  as the use of mercury has been much recommended in this disease we cannot avoid taking notice of it and giving our reasons for not mentioning it in delivering the method of cure we shall first therefore observe in what manner it operates so as to produce salivation and this is now generally agreed to depend on the weight and figure of its parts by which it increases the momentum of the blood divides the globules and destroys their attracting force in a word dissolves a great part of the mass into a putrid tabum and fits it for passing readily off by the secretory organs which however happens almost constantly for reasons we shall not now attempt to give by the salivary glands this wonderful effect of a wonderful fluid does not seem to depend on any other principles than these we have given and therefore it appears to act chiefly on the red globules of blood and that the phlegmatic particles cannot be easily attenuated by it even whilst in the vessels and this will be much less probable when out of the laws of circulation as the glands may in some sense be said to be but if mercury cannot eradicate the cause of the disease when in its recent state it will be much less beneficial yea an absolute poison when the disease is so far advanced as to have produced a suppuration and when the tendons articulations etc are affected when the pus being absorbed and conveyed into the blood contaminates the the whole mass with the putrid acrimony and thence produces an universal and desperate phthisis in this case i say quicksilver cannot be exhibited without the worst effects the putrid diathesis of the blood was already such as threatened inevitable death and is the whole mass to be now rendered in a worse degree putrid which is the genuine effect of mercury nor is this all the augmented velocity of the blood augments the hectic fever and thus every thing conspires toward a fatal period  the reader has perhaps already wondered that no mention has yet been made of mineral waters in the cure of the scrophula which must be excused by saying we designedly referred him hither for the sake of showing the use which has been discovered in one of our own mineral waters for that purpose i mean the celebrated spaw at scarborough whose reputation which long and repeated experience has acquired it is not more than equal to its merit we shall endeavor to demonstrate very soon that its constituent principles are such as render it as universally useful as it is possible for any mineral water to be or as any medicine which the benevolent hand of nature has hitherto pointed out for the preservation or restoration of the health of mortals it is indeed impossible for us to avoid the suspicion of prejudice in treating on this subject but we beg leave to observe that neither that suspicion nor any other reason ought to deter us from doing justice to the cause of truth or from publishing it when it concerns the welfare of the community and the happiness of mankind but we shall endeavor to prove that this character of the scarborough spawwaters is more than a panegyric and that they are adapted to the cure of very many obstinate chronic diseases though of few more aptly than the scrophula in which our grand intention has been to evacuate the viscid matter out of the primae viae to attenuate the fluids gently to stimulate the solids and to invigorate the spirits and i appeal to the judgment of the learned whether these indications are not the most universal ones we are acquainted with for eradicating the first cause or sourse of the whole chronic tribe in order therefore to determine the merit of these waters let us consider their principles separately which is doubtless the most certain method of determining the real properties and value of medicines or medicinal waters as by this means only we can be enabled to judge of their manner of operation and of explaining all their phenomenon we know it is objected and that truly that the component parts of bodies cannot be supposed to have existed in the same form before their separation as after they are divided by the action of fire and that therefore a chemical analysis is not sufficient for teaching us their properties as it does not show us in what form they existed before this separation and how the several heterogeneous particles were united since on the form of their previous existence and manner of union will very much depend their effects this objection as we have already confessed is just but it is punctually so of those solid bodies which cannot be analyzed without extreme torture of the fire in which the whole process is performed with violence but this is not the case with fluid bodies and those of a less firm texture for of these we can discover the constituent principles and their proportions to each other with little force and great certainty and can determine their effects with happy exactness in the scarborough spawwater accurate and judicious experiment has discovered the following principles    st an aqueous fluid differing very little in any of its sensible properties from common distilled water from which it is impossible by any sort of trial to distinguish it from whence let us learn that the medicinal virtues of the spaw water dont reside in this very simple fluid  we are now to consider what medicinal uses this simple water retains in order to understand the effects of that compound fluid of which it constitutes so great a part and first it is as we shall afterward see the most suitable and indeed the only suitable menstruum for dissolving the other principles and rendering them as effectual as possible by conveying them into the most minute branches of the vascular system as it is the most subtle fluid we are acquainted with mercury excepted and capable of passing through vessels of inconceivable smallness and the famous florentine experiment has taught us that it is capable of passing through the least porous that is most solid of all solid bodies viz gold this property alone is sufficient to render it valuable as a menstruum and the smoothness of its particles is such as renders it entirely innocent for it does not discover the least degree of acrimony when applied to the most sensible part of an animal body viz the eye but on the contrary is one of the most general antacria    dly the several properties of elementary water which cannot be fitly recited here will show us and the experience of antiquity has confirmed it that water the most common and for that reason the most neglected of all medicines ought to be esteemed one of the most universal if it be true that the much greater part of diseases proceed from obstruction that medicine will be most generally useful which best answers the indications which obstructions in general require and the two chief of these are to attenuate and relax whether are not these the remarkable effects of water in acute diseases the obstruction is attended with a fever and these constitute an inflammation and then another additional postulatum is required in the indication viz to moderate the fever by cooling diluting correcting acrimony and how beautifully are all these performed by water nor can they be performed without it i dont mean by this that simple water is only fit or necessary for all these purposes by no means but all the emulsions infusions decoctions etc which are or can be given in acute diseases consist for the far greatest part of elementary water we need not therefore wonder that boerhaave the sagacious and incomparable boerhaave in speaking of panaceas numbers water amongst the quatuor remedia maxim universalia i am far from intending by this to extol this medicine beyond its due merit or to espouse the cause of a late writer who weakly undertook to prove it a cure for every disease no let me be allowed this opportunity of declaring myself a professed enemy to all the panaceas which ignorance avarice or vainglory have hitherto introduced into the world and which have no foundation in the essence of things but are contrary to the known laws of nature and a very small share of plain philosophy or indeed of plain sense is sufficient to show them contrary both to philosophy and sense but the subject naturally led or rather obliged me to speak of the virtues of water and to do justice to its merit  the next and chief principle of the scarborough water is a neutral purgative salt as indeed all neutral salts are purgative when directed by a proper regimen of a remarkably bitter taste readily dissolving in the mouth its pungency seeming to penetrate deep into the tongue though without impressing any nauseous sensation it easily dissolves in the air though not near so readily as the tart regenerat and very quickly in twice its weight of cold water  these properties only are sufficient to show that this salt appears at least a priori to be an excellent deobstruent as all neutral salts deserve to be esteemed rational and experimental chemistry has taught us that they have a surprising solvent power and are therefore in a fluid form the fittest medicines we know of in the greater part of chronic diseases long and repeated experience has also taught that the scarborough salt or water are wonderfully safe and have produced as sew ill effects as any efficacious medicine can be supposed to do but this like all other medicines ought to be administered by a judicious hand to those who expect all its advantages without any inconveniences which may well be expected from the imprudent or unseasonable use of the best remedies in nature though these are perhaps no where fewer than in the scarborough salt and water it dont appear necessary in this place to repeat what has been already said or neutral medicines they were believed if not demonstrated to be the most useful class of remedies in the cure not only of the scrophula but of the greater part of chronic diseases if this be true or shall be granted by the adepts in physic the spawwaters of scarborough will certainly deserve their regard esteem and recommendation  the salt may be given like other neutrals either as a purgative or alterant by proportioning the dose to the intention its action may likewise by a proper regimen be directed to the kidneys and it seems not less fit for answering the best intentions of a diuretic than any other medicine of that denomination its operation is mild easy and gentle and in this differs from most other cathartics that it revives and exhilarates the spirits producing and leaving after it a cheerful briskness an effect i say contrary to that of most other purgatives which generally fatigue the body and depress the spirits    dly there is another salt in this water to be separated from it after the chrystallization of the other and appears no other than common sea salt whose singular properties it discovers on every experiment its quantity is but small being only to the other in the proportion of   to    its effects must consequently be inconsiderable it will however be allowed to promote in some small degree the operation of the waters and contribute to the preserving it from putrefaction  the fourth principle is a white powder or earth which the most ingenious dr shaw calls an alcaline substance as it effervates with all acids and changes the syrup of violets green to this earth are probably owing the good effects daily experienced from drinking these waters after the immoderate use of wine by correcting the acidity which such liquors contain and discover by their ill effects in the stomach  the fifth principle of the scarborough waters is air and this it will be said is contained in all water and indeed it had been unnecessary to have taken notice of it here as a principle but that it is observed in somewhat more than ordinary proportion of this air we shall say no more than that to it is considerably owing its brisk taste and perhaps its quicker operation    thly and lastly a mineral spirit consisting of particles of iron exceedingly subtilizd these are in no inconsiderable proportion and must produce in some degree the excellent effects of chalybeate preparations than which no medicines we are acquainted with more effectually corroborate the vessels attenuate the fluids increase the circulation and invigorate the spirits this spirit is inconceivably volatile almost as much so as heat itself and scarcely to be confined by any art which makes it necessary for those who wish to have the entire virtues of the water to drink it at the well  thus much on the scarborough spawwaters may be sufficient to give such an idea of their nature and properties as may show how well they are adapted to the cure not only of the disease which has been the subject of this essay but of the greater part of the formidable chronic tribe  finis
