in the chronicle till the  0th of march       an account of a remarkable operation on a broken arm by mr charles white surgeon at manchester communicated by george lloyd esquire f r s read march       0 robert elliot of eyam in derbyshire a very healthful boy of nine years old had the misfortune about midsummer in the year      by a fall to fracture the humerus near the middle of the bone he was immediately taken to a bonesetter in that neighborhood who applied a bandage and splints to his arm and treated him as properly as i suppose he was capable of for two or three months his endeavors however were by no means productive of the desired effect the bones not being at all united a surgeon of eminence in bakewell was afterward called in but as soon as he found he could be of no service to him and as the case was very curious he advised the lads friends to send him to the infirmary at manchester he was accordingly brought thither the christmas following and admitted an inpatient upon examination we found it to have been a simple oblique fracture and that the ends of the bone rode over each other his arm was become not only entirely useless but even a burden to him and not likely to be otherwise as there was little probability that it would ever unite it being now near six months since the accident happened  amputation was therefore proposed as the only method of relief but i could not give my consent to that for as the boy was young and had a good constitution it was hardly possible that it could be owing to any fault in the solids or fluids but that either nature was disappointed in her work by frequent friction while the callus was forming or rather that the oblique ends of the bone being sharp had divided a part of a muscle and some portion of it had probably insinuated itself betwixt the two ends of the bone preventing their union which ever of these might be the case i was of opinion that he might be relieved by the following operation viz to make a longitudinal incision down to the bone to bring out one of the ends of it which might be done with great ease as the arm was very flexible and cut off the oblique end either by the saw or cuttingpincers then to bring out the other end of the bone and cut off that likewise afterward to replace them end to end and then treat it entirely as a compound fracture  the objections made by the other gentlemen concerned to this proposal were  st the danger of wounding the humeral artery by the knife  dly the laceration of the artery by bringing out the ends of the bones and  dly that we had no authority for such an operation as to the first that was easily obviated by making the incision on the side of the arm opposite to the humeral artery the place of election appeared to me to be at the external and lower edge of the deltoid muscle as the fracture was very near to the insertion of that muscle into the humerus the danger of wounding the vessel not only being by that means avoided but after the operation while the patient was confined to his bed the matter would be prevented from lodging and the wound be easily come at to renew the dressings the second objection will not appear to be very great when we consider that in compound fractures the bone is frequently thrust with great violence through the integuments and seldom attended with the laceration of any considerable artery and as this would be done with great care and caution that danger would appear very trifling the third and last objection is no more than a general one to all improvements  this method which i have been proposing was at last resolved upon and i assisted in the operation which was performed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profession on the  d of january in the present year the patient did not lose above a spoonful of blood in the operation though the tourniquet was not made use of when the operation and dressings were finished the limb was placed in a fracturebox contrived on purpose the lad confined to his bed and the rest of the treatment nothing different from that of a compound fracture  the wound was nearly healed in a fortnights time when an erisipelas came on and spread itself all over the arm attended with some degree of swelling this by fomentations and the antiphlogistic method soon went off and the cure proceeded happily without any other interruption in about six weeks after the operation the callus began to form and is now grown quite firm that arm is as long as the other but somewhat smaller by such longcontinued bandage he daily acquires strength in it and will soon be fit to be discharged  manchester march       0 c white  to the editor of lloyds evening post  tulit alter honorem sir in your evening chronicle of the the  th of august last you have republished from the philosophical transactions vol     account of a remarkable operation on a broken arm by charles white surgeon at manchester communicated by g lloyd esquire f r s read before the royal society  on seeing this title of the case could any man doubt but that mr charles white surgeon had performed the operation  whereas the contrary is well known here and i would have the truth publicly known that the said operation and cure were performed and perfected only by james burchall surgeon to the manchester infirmary and that mr white had no more to do in it than any other of the surgeons who attended as is usual at such operations  it is true mr white does acknowledge the operation was not performed by himself but in a manner no less assuming to himself all the merit had his narration been continued in the style of the first paragraph i should not have taken the least notice but in his following paragraphs there is so much of the egotism and his proposals objections and his answers etc that i could not forbear to request my friend mr burchall to send me his account of the case and to desire your impartial favor in giving it a place in your chronicle which will oblige  manchester sept        your constant reader j f   as the case of robert elliot so artfully written by mr charles white and sent to george lloyd esquire without my knowledge or consent to be communicated to the royal society has met with a place in the philosophical transactions and since been published in the monthly and critical reviews and in lloyds chronicle wherein mr white has taken the sole merit of the cure to himself i think without apology i may be allowed to declare the truth that robert elliot was my patient and was admitted as such into the infirmary at manchester on the   th of december      when after a previous consultation agreeable to the printed rules it was agreed to try the method as related by mr white in his paper and accordingly i performed the operation on the  d of january    0 in presence of him and several of the faculty who as is usual in capital operations give their assistance by making an incision through the integuments in the interstice of the muscles on the external part of the humerus and sorcing the extremities of the fractured bone out of the wound which were afterward cut off with the cutting forceps i then reduced the bones as near as could be in point of contact and placed the arm in a fracturebox afterward i treated it as a compound fracture i duly attended him till the cure was completed which was about the beginning of april but for fear of any accident affecting the arm as the boy was of a very lively and heedless disposition and at a considerable distance from the place of his abode he was not discharged from the infirmary till the  th of may    0  james burchall published in lloyds evening chronicle sept  th       to the editor of lloyds evening post sir a letter from mr james burchall introduced by another pretended to be written by a friend of his both of them published in your chronicle of the  th of this month oblige me in common justice to myself to give you this trouble the intention of them was to insinuate to the public that i had misrepresented a case published in the   st vol of the philosophical transactions entitled  an account of a remarkable operation on a broken arm by mr charles white surgeon at manchester communicated by george lloyd esquire f r s  i shall make no remarks upon the inaccuracy with which mr j f has caused you to print this title in which by the alteration of a point the sense was entirely subverted i am ready to attribute it rather to his heedlessness than to any wilful design of misrepresentation in these letters i am charged with assuming to myself the sole merit of the cure how far i did this must be left to every impartial reader of the transaction the merit i assumed to myself was only that of the invention and if the invention be of any service to the public that merit i believe neither mr burchall nor his friend will deny me the operation i no where called my own i only asserted that i assisted in it and i said that it was performed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profession had i thought that the share which mr burchall had in the operation could possibly have redounded to his credit i should have had no objection to entering into particulars and to the insertion of his name especially as i have always looked upon him as a man of honor and knowledge in his profession and have constantly entertained a great regard for him but i am now publicly called upon and i think myself enjoined to an explanation of the account i have given lest the public should imagine that i have any way misled a society which has for a long time been one of the principal ornaments of this nation  previous to any consultation i proposed to dr mainwaring and dr brown at their own houses the mode of operation which was afterward pursued and i must here do them the justice to declare that i verily believe it never would have taken place if they had not seconded me in my proposal mr burchall was for amputation it was he that principally made the objections mentioned in the transaction and though my method was agreed upon he declared both before during the time of and for some weeks after the operation that he was very apprehensive it could never answer the patient was mr burchalls he made the incision in the place which i had pointed out i brought out one of the ends of the bone which he attempted to saw off but hesitated upon finding it to be attended with some difficulty the incision having been made too small upon this i cut off the end with the forceps replaced it and brought out the other end which i also cut off the dressings and bandage were applied by mr burchall it was i that contrived the fracturebox and the first being made too large a second which was made under my direction was used as long as the patient was confined to his bed i very frequently attended at the dressings for though the patient did not fall under my immediate care i was anxious for the success of my proposal and knew that if it did not succeed i was to bear the blame as the inventor of the operation  for the truth of these particulars i appeal to every disinterested gentleman present at the consultation and operation and if i have represented any thing wrong i publicly call upon them to a denial of any of the facts i have related  manchester sept         i am sir yours etc charles white  to the editor of lloyds evening post sir that the public may be better able to judge of the dispute betwixt mr charles white and myself concerning the invention method of operation and cure performed on the arm of robert elliott late a patient of mine in the infirmary at manchester i think it necessary to send you the following history of the case which i hope you will be kind enough to publish in your next evening paper with my observations and remarks on mr charles whites disingenuous letter published in your chronicle of the   th of september last about the latter end of the year      i received a letter from john wright esquire of eyam in derbyshire acquainting me with the unhappy circumstance of a poor boy in the said town who had the misfortune to break his arm several months before which notwithstanding all the endeavors that had been used to unite the bone still remained as loose as on the first day of the accident and desiring my opinion that if i thought any thing could be done to save his arm he should be glad to send him to manchester to be admitted under my care in the infirmary in answer to which i told his soninlaw mr ashwood who then lived here in what manner i thought his arm might be cured but that till i saw the boy i could not so properly judge of it accordingly he was brought to manchester on the   d of december      and the same evening i examined his arm at mr ashwoods when i gave my opinion that it might be cured without amputation the day following he was admitted my patient in the infirmary where i again examined his arm and called on the gentlemen then present to do the same who gave their opinions for amputation only to this i did not assent and the boys master strongly remonstrated against it saying he could have had that done at home and desired i would try all possible means rather than cut it off upon which i told him to leave the boy and i would consider further of the method i had before proposed which was the same that was afterward put in execution to corroborate the truth of which i beg leave to appeal to two certificates of which i have given copies at the end of this letter which are dated the   st of october instant and are signed by john wright esquire and the said mr thomas ashwood whether or no mr white might have heard of my design i cannot positively determine but i am the more inclined to believe that was the case from his asking upon first seeing the boy which was the day after his admission what method had been proposed for his relief on being told none bat amputation only that i had said i would take him in and consider of it he upon examining the arm a little immediately replied that he thought there was a method by which it might be saved without amputation and then described the method which i had before spoke of to mr ashwood which was afterward pursued mr white in his account published in the   st volume of the philosophical transactions allows the operation to be performed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profession but at the fame time assumes to himself the sole merit of the invention and mode of operation and in his letter of the   th ult in an explanation as he calls it of his former account he not only lays claim to the invention but likewise to the operation and cure by telling you that i was for amputation and that i principally made the objections mentioned in the transactions that i was not for amputation i think i have sufficiently proved besides in the present case that could only be the dernier resource the only objection which i made was that of lacerating the humeral artery by forcing out the ends of the bone and as i was to perform the operation the starting any objection at the consultation could not be construed otherwise than a desire to have their opinions on such operations he further asserts that though his method was agreed on i declared both before during the time and for some weeks after the operation that i was apprehensive it would never answer in contradiction to this i can prove that i frequently declared it was the only method both before and after the operation was concluded on and the method i had proposed on the receipt of mr wrights letter he next says i made the incision in the place he had pointed out pray what occasion for his pointing out when several days before the operation he cannot but remember that as i was showing a young gentleman where i intended to make the incision upon his coming into the room i repeated the same to him he then says he brought out one of the ends of the bone which i attempted to saw off but hesitated upon finding it to be attended with some difficulty the incision having been made too small i allow that he turned out one of the ends of the bone but not both as he has asserted that upon my attempting to saw off one end which was his proposal on finding it impracticable i immediately called for the cutting forceps which he very officiously laid hold of and cut off a small portion of the bone i then took the forceps from him and cut off some more from that end and afterward cut off the other end etc as the incision was found large enough to answer my intention in performing the operation and was not then or afterward enlarged how comes he now to say it was too small upon opening the arm i proposed its being placed in a fracturebox which i thought necessary for the more immediate convenience of dressing etc and mr white with his usual officiousness whilst i was otherwise employed said on his going out of the room if i pleased he would give orders for one i thinking this a matter of small consequence told him he might accordingly one was brought which proving considerably too large a second was made less and that not answering the purpose so well as i could wish was altered by my direction and used as long as i thought necessary  from what has been said i think it appears clearly that the assistance which mr white boasts to have given in the operation was an act of overofficiousness as the patient was mine and under my directions it would be tedious to analize the whole of his letter and i should not have mentioned these particulars but to show that the manner of representing facts is very different for different purposes i must remark that if mr whites opinion of my abilities or his esteem of me as a man of honor and knowledge in my profession was consistent with his declarations that he would have conferred with me upon or at least have informed me of his design of communicating that remarkable operation in which case if i had acquiesced in his relation he would have been justly entitled to the merit he has assumed but as he did not i surely cannot be condemned in saying that be has been endeavoring to raise a character and reputation to himself on account of that operations without acknowledging that i was the person who had the conduct and management of it  manchester oct         i am sir yours etc james burchall   i remember very well upon the return of edmund marsden from manchester the master of robert elliott to eyam he told me that mr burchall was the only one who was against amputation  oct         j wright   i was present when robert elliott was admitted into the infirmary and remember that amputation was the only method proposed by the gentlemen there except mr burchall who said he could propose a method to save the arm which he had before told me of more than once at my house  oct         thomas ashwood   a particular narrative etc a public dispute is a task of so disagreeable a nature that nothing but the vindication of my character from the undeserved assaults it has received could have induced me to appear in the light of a paper warrior  when an invention has been crowned with success it has been no uncommon thing to see others attempting to bear away the honor from it is author but in the case of robert elliot mr burchall did not only defer his claim till the success of the method proposed was evident but even till the operation had by repeated publications received the approbation of the public the following narrative will make it evident that i have done every thing i could consistently with truth to prevent a quarrel that the proposal of the mode pursued was entirely my own and that no one particular has been by me injuriously misrepresented mr burchall himself confesses that i performed a part and that a principal part too of the operation by bringing out and cutting off that end of the bone which was first attempted had i performed even the whole i should not have assumed to myself any merit upon that account the practice was so easy after the method had been laid down that any pupil might have readily succeeded i have frequently seen mr burchall successfully perform much more difficult operations and cannot therefore help attributing his hesitation in the midst of this to his having no good opinion of the contrivance and to his going about it therefore with a less degree of confidence than if he himself had been the inventor  mr lloyd went to london in the beginning of the year    0 before he set out upon his journey i had shown him in the infirmary robert elliots arm and described to him the mode of operation which had been pursued mr lloyd was pleased with the invention and after his arrival in town accidentally mentioned it at one of the meetings of the royal society to some of the members who begged he would write down into the country for a more particular relation he accordingly wrote to his son dr john lloyd to get him an account of the case from me and as he was then upon the point of leaving london he desired it might be sent by the return of the post that he might have an opportunity of showing it to his friends at the next meeting of the society  dr john lloyd called upon me with his fathers message on sunday the   th of march    0 about noon i was that day so much engaged that i could not begin to write out the case till eleven oclock at night but finished it before i went to bed from notes which i had kept by me since the time of the operation the doctor came to me for it as soon as i was up the next morning as i had wrote in haste i desired he would read it over and correct any grammatical mistakes if any such had escaped me it was then dated he enclosed it in a letter which he had brought along with him to his father and as it was near the time of the posts going out it was dispatched to the office immediately i had no opportunity of showing it to any person out of my own house not even to my father who was then at home but three doors from me and who never saw it as i had not time to take a copy till it was honored with a publication in the philosophical transactions mr lloyd gave it to dr birch one of the secretaries upon the  0th of march who read it before the society upon the   th of the same month but not till after mr lloyd had left london  i now mentioned to some few persons what had been done and amongst the rest to mr burchall in the surgeons room in the infirmary i did not however tell it him in the manner of asking his leave for i did not think it necessary to ask any man for liberty to publish my own inventions as to my letting him know the case would be published it was not in my power i did not know it would till i saw it had received a place in the transactions every paper carried to the society is not favored with a reading nor is every reading followed by a publication in the year      an order which is still in force was made that a committee of the members should be appointed to reconsider the papers read before them and select out of them such as they should think most proper for their future publications the volume of the transactions which contains the case of robert elliot was published in may      it was immediately sent down not only to the public library but to several gentlemen in manchester and an abstract of the case was printed in the critical review for the month of june and in the monthly review for july and the whole case was republished in the universal magazine for the month of july and in the british chronicle of the  th of august yet mr burchall never so much as hinted though i saw him every week in the infirmary nor had i any reason to imagine that the publication had given him umbrage till we accidentally met in the passage leading to the old coffeehouse in the last week of august i then told him i was extremely sorry he had taken any thing i had done amiss but that i thought i had mentioned him with as much respect as possible he replied his name was no where mentioned i answered if i had either seen him to have asked his leave or had known that the mention of his name would have been agreeable i should willingly have inserted it i represented the hasty manner in which the paper went out of my hands that the omission of his name was only owing to my over caution not to disoblige that i had given away the merit of the operation from myself and was desirous he should retain it that the case was generally known in manchester and that i had taken every opportunity wherever i had heard it mentioned of declaring him to be the operator he then asked me if i was willing to do the same in any of the public papers i told him i was willing to do it in any in which the case had appeared he said he should be satisfied if i would do it in lloyds evening chronicle desired that i would draw up a paper in a proper form for insertion and told me he would call upon me for it to send it to the printer immediately upon leaving him i wrote what follows  to the publisher of the british chronicle sir the royal society did me the honor to publish in the   st vol part ii of the philosophical transactions an account of a remarkable operation on a broken arm which account you have copied in your chronicle of the  th of this month in it it is said that i assisted in the operation which was performed by a gentleman of great abilities in his profession i take the liberty of declaring by the channel of your paper that the gentleman there meant was mr james burchall  yours etc c white manchester august          about three days afterward i accidentally met him in the smithydoor a street in manchester  i told him i had done what he desired hoped i had put the paper into such a form as would be agreeable had left it upon the desk in my study to be ready when he should call and that whenever he pleased he might insert it according to his proposal i understood him that he would call and left him as i thought in perfect friendship notwithstanding this he never called never sent any message nor made any apology for his omission but without acquainting me wrote the letter of the  d of september which along with one subscribed j f was printed in lloyds paper of the  th of the same month i must here appeal to the public whether my behavior to mr burchall whom i had been striving to oblige to the utmost of my power was such as merited the return it met with  notwithstanding this treatment i was still so averse to an open rupture that after i had drawn up my answer to his and his friends letter i desired dr brown would show it to him before i dispatched it to the printer i told the doctor i was so far from having any design of distressing mr burchall that i should be glad to do him any service i could consistently with my own reputation that i did not wish him either to contradict himself or submit to any meanness but that my veracity had been called in question by his anonymous friend and as his own letter had been printed with his friends i could not help thinking him in some measure accountable for it that therefore except he chose to publish something to clear up my character i should be obliged to print the answer which i had sent him and that as his friends name was no where mentioned i thought he might with honor subscribe the following  to the editor of the british chronicle notwithstanding what has been said by my friend j f in your chronicle of the  th of this month this is to satisfy the public that a case entitled an account of a remarkable operation on a broken arm by mr charles white surgeon at manchester communicated by george lloyd esquire f r s read before the royal society march   th    0 and published in the philosophical transactions vol    part  d is a true account mr charles white being the sole inventor and proposer of that operation  manchester sept          dr brown showed my answer to mr burchall in die infirmary and at the same time told him the publication of it would be dropped if it was either agreeable to him to sign the above paper which i had sent or any thing else to the same purpose mr burchall made two objections one was that it contained an accusation of his friend and the other that i had laid claim to the sole invention for he added that though i had had the fortune to make the first mention of it yet that he himself had thought of it as well as i after this dr brown told me that if i would erase the words  his friend and the sole inventor he was in hopes he could prevail with him to sign the paper and that he had promised to see him again the next morning i replied i should be glad to comply with anything the doctor thought proper and made the proposed alterations but upon dr browns offering the paper again to mr burchall the latter absolutely refused to sign it  the reasons why i gave dr brown this trouble were these i knew he was perfectly agreeable to mr burchall that he was thoroughly acquainted with the case upon his own knowledge and that from his known humanity i did not doubt but he would do his utmost to bring about a reconciliation  upon mr burchalls refusal my answer was published in the british chronicle of the   th of september      on its arrival at manchester i was sharply attacked by him at the weekly board of the infirmary and there publicly charged with having asserted falsities i told him i was certain i had strictly adhered to truth but that if he thought otherwise i was willing to abide by the following proposal  that he and i should join in a petition to all the gentlemen present at the consultation and operation to desire them to depose before a magistrate whatever they knew concerning the affair that if he would consent to this the depositions should be put into his own hands he should be at liberty to publish or suppress them as he thought most conducive to his own interest and that this should terminate the dispute betwixt us i repeated this proposal to him three several times before the board but he did not accept my offer there does but one reason occur to me why mr burchall should decline this offer the persons present both at the consultation and operation are gentlemen of probity and i have good reason to believe would at that time have complied with our request if mr burchall had accepted of my proposal as they all of them seemed to show a disposition to repair the breach between us  mr burchalls reply to mine of the   th of september dated october   th      was published in the chronicle of the  0th of march      in it he seems much disposed to play with words and indeed the whole performance must appear of a very extraordinary nature to those who by their attendance at the infirmary can be the only evidences in regard to the case from which the present dispute has arisen and to use his own words must have effectually convinced them that the manner of representing facts is very different for different purposes  he says whether or no mr white might have heard of my design i cannot positively determine but i am the more inclined to believe that was the case from his asking upon first seeing the lad which was the day after his admission what method had been proposed for his relief etc an inference as absurd as it is false and such a one as was perhaps never drawn from such a question he goes on with pretty round assertions and appeals for the truth of them to two certificates which by no means come up to the point in dispute the first is from mr wright of eyam containing no more than a remembrance of what he had heard from mr edmund marsden but as mr marsden has favored me with his own evidence this testimony of mr wrights will i imagine be esteemed of little consequence the second is from mr ashwood who recollects that amputation was the only method proposed by any of the gentlemen of the infirmary except by mr burchall who said he could propose a method to save the arm the minutes of the board will testify i did not attend it upon the day mr ashwood mentions and therefore he cannot include me amongst the number of those who were for amputation and i shall be able to prove that if mr burchall did not propose amputation in mr ashwoods hearing he did it however at another time mr ashwood does not say what was mr burchalls method and certainly if he ever had any method except amputation to propose he must himself upon reflection have been convinced of its insufficiency else why did not he mention it to the boys master mr marsden when he was pressed to think of some method to save the arm and told that if it had been imagined amputation must have taken place the operation might have been performed without the trouble of so long a journey why did not he propose it to some of the faculty rather than to mr ashwood who could not be supposed to be a competent judge in surgical cases why did not he propose it at the consultation held in the infirmary upon the thursday after the boys admission the only one in reality held upon this occasion there it was absolutely necessary the printed rules and orders of the public infirmary at manchester enjoin rule    that the physicians and surgeons do meet at the infirmary ever thursday at eleven oclock to visit their inpatients and to consult upon difficult cases etc  r    that no amputation or other great operation except an urgent occasion require it be performed without a previous consultation of the physicians and surgeons and that no one shall be admitted to see the practice of the house without their consent   had not i at that time proposed and been powerfully seconded in the method which was afterward pursued there is the greatest reason to imagine amputation would have taken place as mr burchall then proposed that method alone and i never heard except from mr ashwood that mr burchall ever proposed any other method  what danger might be apprehended from the operation i cannot pretend to say i was always clear in my opinion and often asserted that if the plan which i had laid down was strictly adhered to there was no more danger to be feared from this than from any other capital operation in surgery  in my letter of the    th of september      it is said that i brought out one of the ends of the bone which he mr burchall attempted to saw off but hesitated upon finding it to be attended with some difficulty the incision having been made too small the following is mr burchalls remark as the incision was found large enough to answer my intention in performing the operation and was not then or afterward enlarged how comes he now to say it was too small  when i asserted that the incision had been made too small i did not do it in order to throw dirt for i should be sorry to have said any thing in this dispute to which the case did not necessarily lead me i thought my meaning had been sufficiently clear but as it does not seem to have been understood by mr burchall i shall endeavor to explain myself in a more ample manner  my meaning was that if the incision had been made larger mr burchall would have had no occasion to have hesitated when he attempted to saw off the end of the bone and here he allows though he denies me the rest of the invention that the proposal for sawing off the end was my own apparently because this proposal did not meet with success  to law off the end of a bone is no new practice in compound fractures it has been performed by others as well as by myself and i believe it will be allowed by every intelligent surgeon that the saw where it can be used is for many and very obvious reasons superior to any other instrument  the disengenuous letter  officiously  usual officionsness  boasts  raising a character etc warmth of some of the expressions made use of by mr burchall in his last letter will not i hope ever tempt me to retaliation  i have in a great measure confined myself to facts and as mr burchall has friends in the infirmary if i have misrepresented any thing there can be no doubt made but i shall be sufficiently refuted  in the beginning of october      mr bent who resides in the infirmary gave mr burchall and me each of us a copy of his account with leave to publish it mr burchall asked mr bent for liberty to print a part of it which mr bent refused but again repeated that he was welcome to publish the whole  as mr burchall did not think proper to annex this account to his last letter i shall now myself give it to the public whoever carefully considers his relation will i imagine easily perceive what part of it mr burchall has been pleased to borrow and at the same time too discern that he has wrested the facts he has thought proper to give in such a manner as to make them suitable to his purpose i am the more induced to believe that this was the real case because mr burchall himself told me he had not kept any minutes of the affair is it not therefore probable this case would have been lost to the public if i had not committed it to paper  mr bent confirms many things i have advanced and does not contradict me in a single article he says indeed that mr burchall one morning marked out the place he thought the most eligible for the incision but at the same time tells you that this was in the interim betwixt the consultation and operation i had proposed the mode and pointed out the place at the consultation held upon the thursday  mr burchall though he was sensible at the same time there was no other method of saving the limb did not come into my scheme till some days after it was upon his giving his consent that he marked out the place agreeable to mr bents relation and upon my coming into the room he applied to me if i understood his meaning to know if we agreed in regard to the incision to which he received my answer in the affirmative mr bent says that mr white took the forceps and cut off the end that mr burchall took the forceps out of his hands either to cut off the other or to cut off more from that which was cut but cannot possibly determine which  upon my asking mr bent very particularly to recollect what he could relating to the cutting off the extremities of the broken bone he told me he perfectly well remembered that the first end was taken off by myself but that he could not possibly recollect who it was that amputated the second that he remembered mr burchall took hold of the forceps but could not determine with what view he did it whether it was to cut off the other end or to take something more from one of those upon which i had performed the operation but i must here again repeat it i dont pretend to any merit from an operation which is not a difficult one and therefore i shall not produce any more evidences upon that head i only mention these circumstances to show that mr bent has no where contradicted any thing i have asserted  though mr marsden does not positively say mr burchall declared for amputation yet he affirms that mr burchall said he did not know what could be done and when amputation was mentioned made no objection to the operation mr burchall though he was pressed to think of some other method gave him no encouragement to hope for more favorable treatment and had he had any other method to propose is it not to be imagined that common humanity would have prompted him either to have declared his method before mr marsden had left the town or at least to have given him reason to expect the prosecution of a milder practice  i shall not now detain my reader by any more of my own remarks but shall lay before him the evidences i have to produce and leave him to judge not only who has the best right to the invention but who has taken most pains to preserve that amity which i could heartily have wished to have subsisted and which ought always to be maintained between gentlemen of the same profession  being desired by mr burchall and mr white to give an account of the particulars i remembered relating to the case of robert elliott i have wrote the following with the greatest impartiality and strictest truth according to the best of my remembrance  i remember that on december   th      the day of robert elliotts admission into the infirmary that mr white was not there and that mr burchall desired dr brown who was then taking in for dr kay he being at that time ill of a fever and mr hall to see the boy and i dont remember that i heard any method proposed besides amputation but that mr burchall said he would take the boy in for a week or two in order to call a consultation and see if there might not be some other method proposed that mr white came the next morning and being showed the patient he asked what method had been proposed i answered i had not heard any except amputation and that after examining the parts a little he said he thought there was a method by which the boy might be relieved without cutting off h arm and accordingly described that which was afterward pursued and desired it might be told mr burchall which was accordingly done i dont remember exactly the answer mr burchall made upon his first being told this but i well remember him often repeating that there could be no other method for saving the limb but that he had an objection which he thought of great weight against it viz the danger of lacerating the artery by turning out the ends of the bone the consultation i think was held about a week before the operation was performed but dont remember any thing particularly that was there said or proposed i remember in the interim betwixt the consultation and operation that one morning mr burchall marked out the place he thought most eligible to make the incision in by pointing with his finger upon the lower edge of the deltoid muscle on the external part of the humerus to me and that mr white coming into the room immediately after he repeated the same to him who answered in the affirmative that that must be the place i dont remember the particular parts performed by either gentlemen in the operation but that mr burchall made the incision and attempted to saw off one end of the bone but made a stand upon finding it impracticable in which interim mr white took the forceps and cut off the end that mr burchall took the forceps out of his hands either to cut off the other or to try to cut off more from that which was cut but cannot possibly determine which mr burchall was the person who had the chief management of the patient mr white frequently attended the dressings and one morning i remember mr burchall mentioned the placing the arm in a fracturebox in a direct line but mr white thinking the ends of the bone did not come so well into contact in a straight line as when the cubitus lay at a right angle with the humerus said he could contrive one in which it might lie in that position and accordingly gave orders for the joiner to be sent to his house which was done and a box brought the next morning which proved greatly too large upon which he ordered a second which was likewise obliged to be altered the board that went on the inside of the arm from the shoulder to the elbow being made too long and with two hinges one of which being took off and the board cut shorter the same was used as long as the patient was confined to his bed as witness my hand  james bent   when mr barker of bakewell found he could be of no service to my apprentice robert elliot he desired i would get him into the infirmary at manchester under mr charles whites care mr ashwood of manchester afterward undertaking to get him a recommendation contrived to have him admitted under mr burchall saying he was a person he had an opinion of i brought him to mr ashwoods house on the sunday night mr burchall saw him there that night and said he could not tell what could be done for him but that he should have the opinion of all the other gentlemen at the infirmary i took him to the infirmary the next day to be admitted and heard the gentleman that was in the chair ask what could be done for the poor lad and a person that i took to be one of the physicians or surgeons replied that nothing could be done but taking off his arm i never heard any other method proposed nor had i any encouragement to hope for any thing else though i desired that mr burchall would think of some other method  edmund marsden ford september         signed in my presence and to which he said he would give his affidavit if necessary witness samuel bagshaw one of his majestys justices of the peace for the county of derty   in december      being an apprentice to mr white i attended at the infirmary in manchester at a consultation held upon the case of robert elliott the thursday aster his admission into the infirmary where dr brown mr burchall and mr white were present as the boy was a patient under mr burchalls care he showed him to the other gentlemen and told them what he knew concerning the accident and at the same time gave it as his opinion to the best of my recollection that nothing but amputation could be of service or words to that effect mr white upon examining the arm proposed that mode of operation which was afterward pursued some objections being started mr white replied that if the plan he proposed did not succeed amputation might be had recourse to at the last during the course of this consultation mr burchall never gave any reason to believe nor did it appear to me that he himself had the least thought of this method of treatment nor did he propose any other than amputation and the week following whilst the operation was performing mr burchall said it will never answer which words he some days afterward spoke again in my hearing  william starkie manchester april          mr poole the apothecary to the infirmary has often said the boy owed the preservation of his arm to me i imagine the principal facts i have advanced have been very sufficiently proved by the evidences i have produced and i hope the reasons i have given why i did not show the paper to mr burchall previous to its publication as well as why i omitted the mention of his name will be esteemed satisfactory but if any of my readers should be of a different opinion i desire they will do me the justice to remember that so soon as mr burchall made any remonstrances to me i readily offered to set the affair in a clear light either in the british chronicle or in any other paper in which the case had appeared this was certainly doing as much as man could do and he himself expressed his satisfaction at my proposal yet in a few days after this he wrote the letter printed in the british chronicle of the  th of september      without so much as mentioning to me that he had altered his opinion i appeal to the public whether this was genteel treatment if the paper i had drawn up had not been satisfactory to him i should willingly have altered it as far as a strict adherence to truth would have allowed me  i had an opportunity of seeing robert elliott and of examining his arm about michaelmas last his master informed me that after his discharge from the infirmary in may    0 he went to work as usual that he kept well the remainder of the year but that in the beginning of      he had the misfortune by a fall to break his arm again at or near the place of the former fracture a callus formed and the lad returned to his business shortly after but for want of a due observance of the surgeons directions the boy being of a restless playful disposition the arm became crooked and consequently shorter than the other i have only related this circumstance that i may not be accused of concealing any thing from the public relative to the case in question  i am not ignorant of the arts which some low emissaries have made use of to depreciate me amongst my friends of the threats which have been thrown out to deter me from publishing my defense nor of the methods which have been made use of to prevent my getting evidence in order to clear myself and maintain my right to the invention such artifices i despise and such menaces i defy  a contest of this nature no way tends to the advantage of mankind nor is the public interested in the event the profession has but too often suffered by differences made public whilst the selfinterested combatants have only afforded subject for the entertainment and ridicule of the standersby in cases like this an apology to the public is absolutely necessary but my pardon i hope i shall be able to obtain as it must be evident from this narrative i have done every thing in my power to prevent an open rupture  i must likewise beg leave to make an apology to those gentlemen whose names i have taken the liberty of making public as no other means were left me of setting matters in a proper light  manchester june         finis
