the beauties of the late right hon edmund burke  the beauties of the late right hon edmund burke selected from the writings etc of that extraordinary man alphabetically arranged  including the following celebrated political characters drawn by himself antoinette late queen of france comte dartois paul benfield esquire m brissot richard burke esquire late earl of chatham m condorcet right hon henry dundas hon c j fox george iii lord grenville late mr grenville warren hastings esquire late lord keppel sir hercules langrishe louis xvi louis xviii lord north right honorable william pit marquis of rockingham charles townsend esquire john wilkes esquire etc etc   to which is prefixed a sketch of the life with some original anecdotes of mr burke  in two volumes  vol i  london printed by j w myers and sold by w west no   queenshead passage paternosterrow       advertisement it is presumed that the following selection will be found extremely useful to readers of almost every class  to the youthful as it contains the choicest flowers of fancy which cannot fail to warm and refine the imagination  to the statesman philosopher etc as abounding in excellent maxims and reflections drawn from extensive reading tried and approved by experience and observation  to all who aspire to enlarge the sphere of their understanding but to englishmen in particular as every british subject is interested in some part of it  it is necessary to premise that the passages selected from mr burkes pamphlet entitled a vindication of natural society are not to be taken as conveying mr burkes own opinions but as an ingenious and artful attack on the principles of lord bolingbroke  a sketch of mr burkes life with some original anecdotes is prefixed for which the author entreats the indulgence of the public as it is the first attempt of a trembling pen in the biographic line  a copious index is added to supply any defects in the arrangement of the different articles as it was very difficult amidst such a variety to place every one under its proper head  the letter to mr smith was transmitted by an anonymous hand of course we cannot vouch for its authenticity  a sketch of the life with some original anecdotes of mr burke the gentleman who suggested the idea of the following selection conceived that it would be acceptable to prefix some anecdotes of the author if time talent and the nature of the work admitted it would in many respects be a pleasing task to trace this extraordinary man through all the mazes of his politics to attend him in studious retirement to mark the boldest flights of his imagination to fathom a mind rich and profound as the ocean and as easily agitated by every gust of passion and tornado of resentment  mr burke was called into action in the most eventful period that ever enriched the page of history his voice was early raised in favor of liberty in america the blazing suns of india have been often lost in the splendor of his eloquence the fable children of africa have numbered him in the list of their advocates and almost every state in europe has at one time or other been the subject of his tongue and his pen  mr burke was first taught to read by his mother a woman of excellent understanding and a highly cultivated mind he was instructed in writing and accounts by mr james fitzgerald who kept a dayschool near smithfield dublin at the age of twelve he was committed to the care of mr abraham shackelton a quaker master of an eminent classical academy in balitore in the county of kildare that the reader may form some idea of his preceptor and the seminary we transcribe the following advertisement which appeared in the public prints about that time  balitore boardingschool abraham shackelton informs his friends and the public that being placed guardian over the morals of the youth under his care he declines from conscientious motives to teach that part of the academic course which he conceives injurious to morals and subversive of sound principles particularly those authors who recommend in seducing language the illusions of love and the abominable trade of war those who design their sons for the college will take their measures accordingly he professes to fit youth for business and instruct them in polite literature his terms are six pounds per quarter  no entrance money demanded  mr shackelton was a man of fine even temper severe in his morals but extremely indulgent to his pupils with regard to the bent of their genius which he was studious to discover and cultivate  his maxim was natura sequitur melius quam ducitur young burke was very attentive to his studies  sometimes at the expense of his health he did not confine himself to the greek and roman classics he read at intervals some of the best english writers and evinced much taste in the selection of the finest passages  many of which he committed to memory he was passionately fond of reading don bellianis of greece this circumstance he mentioned himself one night in the house of commons in the debate on the affairs of holland in      he also takes notice of this romance in his essay on the sublime and beautiful notwithstanding he appears to have read the poets with all the enthusiasm of a warm imagination yet it does not appear that he ever invoked the muses at one time it is said he could repeat all youngs night thoughts by rote in a copy of this work which he used to carry in his pocket the two following lines in his handwriting were found some years since on a blank leaf jove claimed the verse old homer sung but god himself inspired young   several of his witticisms have been repeated by his schoolfellows but as they are all unworthy of so great a genius even in bud we shall pass them over with this single observation that the shafts of his wit were not always winged with the feather of a dove his filial piety was truly exemplary and his affection for mr shackelton his master was evinced on many occasions when the good old man visited him in london he received him as a father introduced him to many of his friends particularly to mr benjamin west the painter of posterity and what is still greater one of the best of men he also mentioned him with great respect and veneration in one of his speeches on the test act having passed a proper time at balitore academy he was transplanted to trinity college dublin as may appear from the following transcription from the admission book of that university       april    edmundus burke pens filius johannis genesis annum agens    natus dublinii educatus sub ferula m shakelton tut d pellifier  elected a scholar of the house   th of may      commenced a b   d february       he does not appear to have been elected a native this term in the irish university is applied to a student who having obtained a scholarship is entitled to an annual stipend after a certain standing   doctor m kearney senior fellow of the university shone as the rival of mr burke in every class of the college course the strictest friendship however subsisted between them and when separated they continued to correspond with each other till within a few weeks of mr burkes dissolution  mr burkes father was an attorney of some eminence in his profession very highly respected for the integrity of his character having completed his academic studies it is said that he offered himself as a candidate to fill the moral chair in the university of glasgow vacant by the death of his countryman mr hutcheson mr reid however was raised to that situation which induced mr burke to turn his attention to the bar for this purpose he came to london and entered his name on the books of the middle temple what a transition he that had ded the most charming season of life in culling the fairest flowers of imagination in tracing the plsing labyrinths of science to be obliged to w the midnight oil in pog over coke on lyttleton he wa not however to be dismayed the entrance was barren and rugged but it promised a gold  and ambition was not the least of mr burkes passions with such eagerness did he sit down to these new studies that something  almost forgot himself to stone his constitution was not equal to the task his health began to dne he was advised to consult his friend and countryman doctor nugent who had praed many years with great success at bath the doctor was so benevolent a man that it is said of him by those who knew him best that if he had the misfortune to lose a patient he felt as if he had lost a child in addition to this he was so highly charmed with the conversation and opening talents of mr burke that he was resolved if possible to preserve them to the world for this purpose he gned him apartments in his own house where he treated him with all the affection of an indulgent parent miss nugent the doctors only daughter evinced by her attention how deeply she was interested in the recovery of his health and what at first assumed the name of friendship changed into that of love in short mr burke was made happy in the possession of a hand that bestowed at the same time one of the gentlest of hearts  his studies became more diversified and the success of some pens induced him to turn his attention to some work that might raise his fame as a writer his success in this line was equal nay superior to his expectation but he soon found that fondness of fame was avarice of air in consequence of which he procured a letter of introduction to the late earl of bath the mecaenas of the day his lordship received him with the utmost politeness lamented that it was not in his power to render him any service as he was no longer in power the impression which this unexpected intelligence made on mr burke did not escape his lordships eye he felt for the situation of the young man and after a pause i will give you a letter said he to the earl of bute though i dont know that i am entitled to take that liberty the proposition revived mr burkes drooping spirits and he waited without loss of time on lord bute who professed his sorrow that it was likewise out of his power to render him any service as he had resigned all his employments that very morning adding that his influence with his majesty was greatly overrated anxious however that a man of genius and talent should not pine in the shade he would take one step he said which he did not know he ought to take but he would venture and if crowned with success it would yield him great pleasure as lord halifax had been appointed to assume the viceregal government of ireland perhaps in that situation he would be able to render mr burke some service in his native country the earl accordingly wrote to lord halifax and recommended the bearer of it as a man of promising genius who would reflect honor on his patronage and protection the new appointed viceroy expressed the deepest regret that every department in his appointment except that of private secretary to his own secretary was filled up mr burke was accordingly appointed private secretary to the right hon gerard hamilton commonly called single speech hamilton in consequence of his having made only one speech in the house of commons during all the time that he sat in parliament but which has ever been considered as an effort of unprecedented talent and is thought to have been composed by the subject of these memoirs  having now cursorily traced mr burke to his first debut on the great theater of public life in which it was allowed on all sides that he played his part with great applause we shall introduce him in another character not so splendid undoubtedly but still more amiable having contracted an early acquaintance with a mr michael smith a country schoolmaster it ripened into mutual friendship several letters passed between them the following is a copy of one which mr burke addressed to him soon after his arrival in london mr smith it appears taught the greek and roman classies at this time in the parish of fenagh in the county of leitrim   my dear michael mr balf was so very kind as to deliver me your friendly epistle about half an hour ago i read it over blessed the first inventor of letters and as i have plenty of ink pens and paper and as this is one of my holidays i intend to dedicate it to friendship  balzac having once escaped from a company where he found it necessary to weigh every word that he uttered chanced to meet a friend come said he to him let us retire to some place where we can converse freely together and commit as many solecisms as we please i need not tell you the application you will expect some short account of my journey to this great city to tell you the truth i made very few remarks as i rolled along for my mind was occupied with many thoughts and my eyes often filled with tears when i reflected on all the dear friends i left behind yet the prospects could not fail to attract the attention of the most indifferent country seats sprinkled round on every side some in the modern taste others in the style of old de coverley hall all smiling on the neat but humble cottage every village as gay and compact as a beehive resounding with the busy hum of industry and inns like palaces what a contrast between our poor country where you will scarce find a cottage ornamented with a chimney but what pleased me most of all was the progress of agriculture my favorite study and my favorite pursuit if providence had blessed me with a few paternal acres a description of london and its nations would fill a volume the buildings are very fine it may be called the sink of vice but her hospitals and charitable institutions whose turrets pierce the skies like so many electrical conductors avert the very wrath of heaven the inhabitants may be divided into two classes the undoers and the undone generally so i say for i am persuaded there are many men of honesty and women of virtue in every street an englishman is cold and distant at first he is very cautious even in forming an acquaintance he must know you well before he enters into friendship with you but if he does he is not the first to dissolve that sacred band in short a real englishman is one that performs more than he promises in company he is rather silent extremely prudent in his expressions even in politics his favorite topic the women are not quite so reserved they consult their glasses to the greatest advantage and as nature is very liberal in her gifts to their persons and even mind it is not easy for a young man to escape their glances or to shut his ears to their softly flowing accents as to the state of learning in this city you know i have not been long enough in it to form a proper judgment of that subject i dont think however there is as much respect paid to a man of letters on this side the water as you imagine i dont find that genius the rath primrose which forsaken dies is patronized by any of the nobility so that writers of the first talents are left to the capricious patronage of the public notwithstanding this discouragement literature is cultivated in a high degree poetry raises her enchanting voice to heaven history arrests the wings of time in his slight to the gulf of oblivion philosophy the queen of arts and the daughter of heaven is daily extending her intellectual empire fancy sports on airy wing like a meteor on the bosom of a summer cloud and even metaphysics spins her cobwebs and catches some flies the house of commons not unfrequently exhibits explosions of eloquence that rise superior to those of greece and rome even in their proudest days yet after all a man will make more by the figures of arithmetic than by the figures of rhetoric unless he can get into the trade wind and then he may sail secure over pactolean sands as to the stage it is sunk in my opinion into the lowest degree i mean with regard to the trash that is exhibited on it but i dont attribute this to the taste of the audience for when shakespeare warbles his native wood notes the boxes pit and gallery are crowded  and the gods are true to every word if properly winged to the heart  soon after my arrival in town i visited westminster abbey the moment i entered i felt a kind of awe pervade my mind which i cannot describe the very silence seemed sacred henry the sevenths chapel is a very fine piece of gothic architecture particularly the roof but i am told that it is exceeded by a chapel in the university of cambridge mrs nightingales monument has not been praised beyond its merit the attitude and expression of the husband in endeavoring to shield his wife from the dart of death is natural and affecting but i always thought that the image of death would be much better represented with an extinguished torch inverted than with a dart some would imagine that all these monuments were so many monuments of folly  i dont think so what useful lessons of mortality and sound philosophy do they not exhibit when the highborn beauty surveys her face in the polished parian though dumb the marble yet it tells her that it was placed to guard the remains of as fine form and as fair a face as her own they show besides how anxious we are to extend our loves and friendship beyond the grave and to snatch as much as we can from oblivion  such is our natural love of immortality but it is here that letters obtain the noblest triumphs it is here that the swarthy daughters of cadmus may hang their trophies on high for when all the pride of the chissel and the pomp of heraldry yield to the silent touches of time a single line a half wornout inscription remain faithful to their trust blessed be the man that first introduced these strangers into our islands and may they never want protection or merit i have not the least doubt that the finest poem in the english language i mean miltons ii penseroso was composed in the long resounding isle of a mouldering cloister or ivyd abbey yet after all do you know that i would rather sleep in the southern corner of a little country church yard than in the tomb of the capulets i should like however that my dust should mingle with kindred dust the good old expression family buryingground has something pleasing in it at least to me i am glad that dr sheridan is returned and determined to spend the rest of his days in your quarter i should send him some botanic writings which i have in view if i were not certain that the irish hippocrates would rather read nature in her own works with what pleasure i have seen him trace the delicate texture of a lily and exclaim with the god in humanity that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of those and you know that our lilies are fairer than new fallen snow i am extremely sorry that any dispute should arise betwixt you and your brotherinlaw he is i know a little hotheaded especially when he takes a glass and i am afraid he leans a little too much to the social can mr peyton however is a peace maker and i am sure if the whole was laid before him that he would settle it to your satisfaction and the sooner the better you are quite mistaken when you think i dont admire plutarch i prefer his writings to those of any other  sacra semper excipio quae in summa arce locare fas est and aequum nunquam non in manibus habenda  mr balse sets out for germany in the spring on a visit to his uncle who is now in vienna the general is very rich and advancing in years so that it is probable when he is called to repose on his laurels that his nephew will be his heir and i need not tell you that he is worthy of it i expect in a day or two to be introduced to miss woffington our countrywoman she is rapidly rising into theatric same i could wish to publish a few anecdotes of her she is of low origin it is true but talents and nature often avenge themselves on fortune in this respect the roses of florida spring out of the finest soil they are the fairest in the universe but they emit no fragrance i recollect that she read her recantation in a little country church somewhere in the county of cavan mr fleming of stahalmuck wrote some verses on that occasion i wish you could procure a copy of them for me as soon as possible i also wish that you could procure some anecdotes of mr brook author of the justly celebrated tragedy of gustavus vasa   the remainder of this letter touches on some of mr smiths family affairs which would not be proper to publish  that the reader may judge of the epistolary style of mr burkes correspondent it may not be unacceptable to insert the answer   my good sir i once read of a king of spain alphonsus i think who was cured of a dangerous disease by reading a passage in livy your kind letter had much the same effect on me for my spirits were so low the moment i received it that it is not in the power of words to describe my situation but scarce had i read six lines when my heart began to emerge and the sun shone as bright as ever and if you pity a poor dealer in syntax buried alive i may say write to me as often as you can my school is on the increase it is true but the people are so poor that they cannot pay i have thirteen latin scholars at a crown a quarter and six and twenty in writing and figures i have taken a little farm of about five acres so that betwixt the cultivation of my fields and that of the tender mind i have very little time on my hands or my feet i may say for sometimes i mingle in the dance as to greek there is no attention paid to it in this quarter last week i endeavored to prevail on mr johnson to permit me to give his nephew a few lessons in the language of heaven he said he had no objection if i could assure him that it would enable jack to buy a cow or a horse to more advantage having cast his eye on a greek book which i had in my hand what said he would you have my nephew spend his time in learning these pothooks and hangers thus you see how learning is prized in this part of the world and from your own account i dont find that the muses are held in such high estimation in england which i was early taught to consider as the seat of arms and arts what then is to become of their votaries  neglected and i am afraid despised  you will forgive me i feel myself so uneasy and depressed as often as i think on this matter that i cannot help dropping a tear on my books  the only source and companions of my solitary hours so that you see we have little cause to boast of the triumph of letters over the breathing marble or the proudest trophies of war yet i join with you in blessing the memory of the man that first introduced the swarthy daughter of cadinus into these islands i think i can recollect some lines on this subject in the form of an aenigma which perhaps you have not seen  bis venere novem juvenes ad moenia nostra ex aliis huc ad nos rediere locis conspicui forma pariles florentibus annis attamen his minime par decor oris adest nil est egregiae quod dicas de esse cohorti quam quod non potis est edere lingua non illis vox est sed secum quemque godales sonos dcunt ex his ut verba loquantur habent subeto nullum dicunt interpret verbum orb sed est toto gloria magna verum whilst i am on this interesting subject i am sorry to tell you that our old irish bard who could conduct those nymphs through all the mystic mazes of poetic dance resigned his tuneful breath last week i accompanied his remains to the grave he has left me all his manuscripts and i shall select some of the finest passages of them for you and translate them for you as well as i can  my schoolhouse was levelled with the ground last week in a storm  boreas of true russian descent pays very little respect to learning the neighbors however assembled the next day and raised me a new one on a more pleasing site so that my barefooted pupils are quite happy as it is better wooded and of course will afford them an opportunity of playing hound and hare with more art ogara has made me a present of a dial which i intend to erect in the spring oh the wit of man that can even turn a shadow into use and teach it to point out the sleeting hours as unsubstantial as itself but paullo majora canamus i once read in an old irish poem that when jupiter made man he gave him his choice either of wings or imagination he accepted the latter which shows that our first fabulous father had some brains let me rise on this divine plume then and for once cast a glance into futurity what do i see why i see my worthy friend arrayed in a flowing robe i hear his voice raised in the cause of innocence and distress the widow and the orphan bless his name and the wily villain hunted down through all the mazes of law once more astrea revisits the earth i see him raised to the seat of judgment his ermine as pure as his native snow the golden scales even balanced in his hands and the sword of justice tempered in the tears of mercy  the ascent to this eminence is difficult but interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis   i know you will be glad to hear that tom and i are on good terms  you are right he drinks whiskey as often as he can get it  ore rotundo and sometimes warm from the still and faithful to its fires too which is worst of all your account of london i believe is very just all great cities from rome down are the sinks of vice and the graves of genius i admire the idea of your public charities one of the three impossibilities amongst the ancients was eripere jovi fulmen and amongst the christians eripere deo fulmen iroe but charity is the emanation of heaven  as to miss woffington i can collect very little of her she was born in dublin read her recantation in the parish church of lurgan near virginy in the country of cavan before the reverend mr sterling who was a great musician mr fleming did write some verses on that occasion but it is not easy to procure them for you know he is a great man  a justice of peace and one of the grand jury they began thus i think  and now the sun revolving to the west bequeathed the wearied hemisphere to rest and now the moon in milder glories dight resumed the peaceful empire of the night   i can recollect no more and i dont know that these are correct there is an anecdote told of her and i believe there is very little doubt of the truth of it   mr  having spent some time in paris soon after his return happened to dine at mr gores where miss w captivated the company with her sprightly wit and easy manners our parisian hero paid such attention to the glass that the cloth was scarce removed when the table and chairs exhibited the effects of it as well as those that were present particularly miss w who as she happened to be formed of the common mould was reminded of it to which she only answered sir i expected all this i observed for some time past the yellow clay breaking through the plaster of paris  as to mr brook i believe i can collect you many particulars relative to him  his father was a clergyman of the church of england he is married to a miss mears a relation of his own he has lately built a house at longfield one of the most desert spots in the county of mead he is an enthusiast in agriculture and has spent his patrimony in draining lakes to very little advantage he has had many children but heaven was so indulgent as to call them out of this life just as they began to taste the miseries of it  doctor sheridan is well and desires to be remembered to you i hope that you will write as often as you can you cannot conceive what pleasure it will afford me to correspond with you  i am my good sir yours most truly m smith    these letters are taken from copies  notwithstanding the multiplicity of business that naturally devolved on mr burke as private secretary to mr hamilton he had the happy art of arranging his affairs in such a manner as to devote some moments to the cultivation of literature he used to pass two evenings every week in conversation with doctor thomas wilson senior fellow of trinity college dublin and doctor blundell the friends of humanity and letters the former offered to join with mr burke in a translation of livy but the latter preferred reading the sententious tacitus to the prince of roman historians and it appears from many parts of his maxims etc that he studied this writer with unwearied attention doctor wilson was considered as a wit but it seldom rose above a pun mr burke happened to meet him one evening in a short coat the doctor immediately observing that his friend did not know him in that guise exclaimed  brevis esse laboro obscurus fio   the doctor passing one day through a street chanced to espy a person advancing on the same side with whom he did not wish to speak at that time in consequence of which he crossed to the other side where he ran his head almost against another with whom he did not wish to speak at any time on which he repeated  incidit in scyllam que vult vitare charybdin   notwithstanding the rays of regal favor shone so conspicuously through the earl of halifax that it may be id preferment was in his nod and notwithstanding the prospects in this respect that opened on every side to mr burke yet he preserved great equanimity of mind and did not in the least affect the insolence of office he corresponded with his friends in every line as usual and received such as visited him with great affection his character at this time was drawn by a lady in the following lines with judgment witty eloquent with sense polite with ease and free without offense   this i had from a gentleman who to use his own expression was very well acquainted with single speech hamilton and double speech burke  mr hamilton entertained so high an opinion of the talents and integrity of mr burke that he procured him a pension of three hundred a year on the irish establishment on their return to england they lived on terms of the greatest intimacy till the protege began to think that his patron did not exert all the influence he still possessed to usher him into life several letters passed between them on this subject which ended in the dissolution of their political friendship and in order to lessen the debt of gratitude mr burke resigned his pension which was transferred to captain jephson author of the tragedy of braganza etc  as mr burke had now entered on the arduous study of politics he was determined not to relinquish the pursuit in hopes that some favorable opportunity would present itself which if taken at the tide might lead on to fortune and preferment the weakness and illtimed measures of the cabinet with respect to the american colonies threatened the downfall of the administration it lasted however much longer than was expected at length it was obliged to give way accordingly on the   th of april      the marquis of rockingham william dowdeswell esquire lord john cavendish thomas townshend esquire and george onslow esquire were appointed lords of the treasury mr dowdeswell chancellor of the exchequer the duke of grafton and general conway secretaries of state the marquis felt himself in want of a private secretary mr burke was recommended to fill that confidential situation by mr fitzherbert the father of the present lord st helens mr burke in a short time rendered himself so useful that he was brought into parliament for the borough of wendover through the interest of lord verney as the marquis knew that fortune had only hitherto smiled on mr burke deceitfully he lent him l 0000 on his bond as the most delicate mode of conferring such a savor mr burke immediately purchased his elegant seat near beaconsfield with this sum as an occasional retreat from the uneasy seat of high desires or the conflict of passions and happy would it have been for the world perhaps if he had thrown himself into the arms of philosophy and spent the rest of his days in the cultivation of those arts which elevate and embellish human nature but our young statesman had tasted of power and preferred the noise and intrigue of party to lettered ease and retirement in his enchanting tusculum  mr burke may be now considered as a fair public character and therefore when the history of the man to use lord bolingbrokes expression is also the history of the state great judgment is required in selecting and ability in composing to produce a full uniform and compacted piece i do not aspire to such qualifications nor does it fall within my plan i shall therefore only notice the pro events of his political life etc and leave the detail to abler pens  as the duke of cumberland had recommended the new ministry he constantly assisted them with his advice an advantage which it is very probable the nation could not have enjoyed under any other ministry and which alone might compensate all the defects if real which the friends of the old ministry were continually finding in them this advantage however though of continuance enough to be felt by the nation did not last as long as the nation could have wished even under men of equal integrity and capacity with the present and greater experience whilst his royal highness was preparing one evening to assist at one of those councils frequently held to put matters in a way of being more speedily dispatched by the privy council and without whose assistance the privy council business must go on slowly as the parliamnt business without that of the committees he was seized with a sudden disorder of which he had some symptoms the evening before and in a sit of shivering sunk senseless almost instantaneously in the arms of the earl of albemarle on the gist of october      annual register for        it is presumed that it would be almost an apology of itself for the introduction of the following sketch of parties etc at this period to say that it came from the pen of mr burke it will also serve as an early specimen of his powers as an historian and even of his moderation   at the conclusion of our last volume we saw the nation involved in the most distressful circumstances that could well be imagined our manufacturers at a stand commerce almost totally annihilated provisions extravagantly dear and a numerous populace unemployed without the means of procuring a livelihood such and so gloomy was the prospect that opened at home upon us along with the year nor did the view become more pleasing by extending it across the atlantic where the colonies exhibited nothing but scenes of anarchy and confusion where licentiousness was carried almost to the highest pitch that it could possibly admit without assuming another name whilst the profligate and abandoned as is usually the case in civil commotions under the specious pretext and mask of liberty and the common cause gave a loose to their own unruly passions and committed all those exorbitances which the vulgar are so prone to when under any pretense they are allowed to assemble in bodies and through any relaxation of the laws they have not the fears of immediate punishment upon them we have before observed that those of an higher rank amongst them did not take any pains to allay the ferment it is probable that many of the more serious of them condemned in their own minds several acts that were committed but did not think proper to damp a spirit which however irregularly or improperly exerted they perhaps at that time thought it conducive to their designs to keep alive  but though a violent resentment supported the spirit of the colonists they could not but sensibly feel the inconveniences which an entire stoppage of trade must occasion among a people who had hitherto subsisted by commerce however their warehouses were full of british goods for which they had not paid and the many resources of so vast an extent of country abounding in the most essential articles of life prevented them from feeling so much immediate distress as our own manufacturers and laboring poor at home  it must be observed that the enormous sums owing to our merchants in the colonies added greatly to the difficulties the public were under and severely afflicted the trading and manufacturing part of the community these debts amounting to several millions sterling the americans absolutely refused to pay pleading in excuse their utter inability which plea it appears the merchants admitted to be reasonable  as the nation was never perhaps in a more critical situation so of consequence no administration ever had greater difficulties to encounter than the new one they were under an immediate necessity of enforcing the stamp act by fire and sword or else of moving its immediate repeal in parliament in the former case though there was no doubt of the ability of great britain to crush or even extirpate the colonies yet such a decision if not looked upon as absolute suicide must at least be considered as making use of one arm to cut off the other  fatal were the consequences which it was foreseen and foretold would attend such an attempt and it was obvious that if such consequences should ensue the first framers and promoters of the obnoxious laws would have been entirely forgot in the general odium and execration which would have fallen solely upon the ministers who by enforcing such inous measures had wrought the destruction of their country  on the other hand if the act should be repealed a colorable appearance was not wanting to charge them with sacrificing the dignity of the crown together with the honor and interest of the nation to their own irresolution or else to a causeless animosity which it would be said they bore to their predecessors and a blind opposition to all their measures  the loss of their illustrious friend and patron the duke of cumberland seemed at this period to be truly critical to the ministry his influence his authority his good sense his patriotism and the high regard the public held him in would have added greatly to their strength and security  thus situated they had an opposition to encounter consisting of gentlemen several of whom had held the first employments in the kingdom and who for abilities experience knowledge of business property and connexions were very reputable and therefore truly formidable  some of these gentlemen seemed obliged in honor as well as through opinion and a spirit of opposition to embark warmly in vindication and support of measures which had originally been their own for which it may be supposed they had the natural partiality of a parent and in defense of which they were determined to dispute every inch of ground with the ministry some also joined them through principle  they thought that the insolence of the americans deserved chastisement where otherwise the hardship of their circumstances might merit relief others there were who gave themselves no trouble as to the rectitude of the american taxation but who would have been very glad that their own burdens at home could be at all lightened by any sums that could be drawn in any manner out of the pockets of the colonists and in general it may be supposed that the lovers and assertors of high prerogative naturally chimed in with the rest upon their own principles there were not a few also who first kept aloof from and in due time declared against the ministry upon some symptoms which appeared early of their wanting that countenance which as it has been favorable or adverse has determined the good or ill fortune of the several successive systems of administration for some years past this part of the opposition was for very obvious reasons by much the most dangerous  to balance this powerful opposition the administration consisted of gentlemen who though many of them were young in office were yet extremely high in estimation whose characters were clear whose integrity was far above suspicion and whose abilities seemed to grow with the difficulties of the business they were engaged in their constant adherence also to the cause of liberty had procured them the confidence and good will of the public both of which they enjoyed in a very eminent degree mr burke is supposed to have included himself in this class  they had besides some other advantages as they were not bound to the support of measures at all events merely because they had planned or advised them so they could weigh matters with coolness and impartiality and judge without prejudice or passion at least they had the happiness not to be obliged to act systematically wrong  they appear accordingly to have avoided as well as in matters so critical perhaps they could be avoided the two extremes in one which it was apprehended they must inevitably have struck they neither precipitated affairs in america by the rashness of their councils nor did they sacrifice the dignity of the crown or nation by irresolution or weakness and the firmness as well as temper which appeared in their dispatches to the different governors when examined by the house did them the greatest honor by preserving this medium by suspending their own judgment in a matter of so great importance till they had obtained that of the representatives of the nation they still left it in the power of the supreme legislature to use healing measures and did not urge their fellow subjects through desperation to the committal of such acts as could not be forgiven  notwithstanding the prudence of this conduct it was severely animadverted on by the opposite party these gentlemen would have the most coercive means made use of for forcing the new laws and regulations in which themselves had so great a share fully sensible of the disgrace that must be reflected on them by a repeal it is not unnatural to suppose that they wished to see the executive power so deeply engaged before the meeting of parliament that the legislative could not then in honor recede from the support of it upon this principle the plan of moderation that had been adopted was opposed with the greatest acrimony and the severest invectives pointed at administration for not having immediately employed troops and ships of war to enforce the laws in such a manner as the outrageousness of the resistance and the importance of the authority which was resisted did as they asserted indispensably require  in the mean time the american affairs were become a general subject of discussion and numberless pamphlets were wrote on both sides of the question in general both sides were guilty of the same fault though in the most opposite extremes the advocates for the colonies carried the idea of liberty to the highest pitch of enthusiasm while their antagonists seemed to imagine that a person forfeited every birthright and privilege of an englishman by going to live in america they both also proved a great deal too much while the former seemed to consider the colonies rather as independent states in a sort of equal alliance with the mother country than as deminions depending upon and belonging to her they furnished the strongest reasons why that irregular spirit of enthusiasm should be timely checked by making them sensible of their dependence  on the other hand the enemies of the colonies by exaggerating their power opulence and popularity sufficiently proved the necessity of treating them with tenderness as if their calculations were allowed to be half founded it must be impossible to retain them long in subjection by any other means  in this situation were affairs   th dec when the parliament met in the latter end of the year      particular notice was taken from the throne of the importance of the matters which had occurred in north america and which were given as a reason for assembling the two houses sooner than was intended that they might have an opportunity to issue the necessary writs on the many vacancies that had happened since the last session and proceed immediately after the recess to the consideration of the weighty matters that should then be laid before them for which purpose the fullest accounts of the american affairs should be prepared for their inspection most of the friends to administration had vacated their seats in consequence of the late changes so that by death and promotions there were fortyone seats now vacant some thought it would be ungenerous to make any strictures upon the conduct of the ministers till they should be in a situation to vindicate or explain it in their proper persons as members of the house it appears however that others were of a contrary opinion an address having been resolved in answer to the kings speech a motion was made by the opposition that his majesty might be addressed to give orders that copies of all lettters papers orders or instructions sent from the secretary of states office or the other principal departments to the governors and officers of the crown in north america together with copies of all answers thereto and of all other papers relative to the late disturbance there to the execution of the stamp duty to the enforcing of the law and to the quelling of riotous and tumultuous disorders should be laid before the house this motion seemed the more extraordinary as it had been declared from the throne that the fullest accounts of these affairs should be laid before parliament  the house probably thought the proposition not very decent with regard to the crown nor candid with regard to the ministry in their situation at that time so that on a sharp debate the previous question being put it was carried in the negative by a majority of  0 to    the house having then issued the necessary writs adjourned for the holidays  mr burke was thus brought into parliament at a time that a single glance even at the map of our territories was almost sufficient to dismay a young senator  our extensive colonies in america our possessions in the east  our navy triumphant in every quarter of the globe and the joyful sound of victory in our ears and all under the auspices of a youthful monarch the dawn of whose administration promised a refulgent day but these appear to have been so many objects that tended rather to excite than to dismay our young senator his mind was well stored with reading his imagination glowing his heart no do doubt filled with gratitude to those that had raised him to that exalted situation and every pulse beating high with emulation to distinguish himself by his tongue as he had already done so by his pen the first question of deep consideration that called forth his eloquence was on the impolicy of taxing the colonies the very first speech he made on this subject was so much admired that the late lord chatham who immediately followed him in the debate said he should not go any further into the detail of the business as that young member alluding to mr burke had forcibly and eloquently anticipated every thing he had to offer on the subject this compliment was felt by the house and insured mr burke a very patient hearing as often as he rose to deliver his opinion the next question that involved the consideration of parliament was a bill for the total repeal of the stamp act brought on in the spring of      this momentous question furnished mr burke with a full opportunity of bringing all his oratorial powers into the field it must be confessed that he conducted them with all the energy of a youthful commander and all the prudence of an experienced general till victory after a dubious contest at length perched on the banners of administration the universal joy which pervaded the nation on this occasion cannot be better expressed than in his own words i remember sir addressing himself to the speaker with a melancholy pleasure the situation of the honorable gentleman the late field marshal conway who made the motion for the repeal of the stamp act in that crisis when the whole trading interest of this empire crammed into your lobbies with a trembling and anxious expectation waited almost to a winters return of light their fate from your resolutions when at length you had determined in their favor and your doors thrown open showed them the figure of their deliverer in well earnest triumph of his important victory from the whole of that grave multitude there arose an involuntary burst of gratitude and transport they jumped upon him like children on a long absent father they clung about him as captives about their redeemer all england all america joined in his applause nor did he seem insensible to the best of all earthly rewards the love and admiration of his fellowcitizens hope elevated and joy brightened his crest i stood near him and his face to use the expression of the scripture of the first martyr his face was as if it had been the face of an angel i do not know how others feel but if i had stood in that situation i never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profusion could bestow  vide mr burkes speech   th april        to ed p     hitherto matters had gone on in the most successful manner with the ministry they had weathered a severe dangerous and stormy winter they had gained every point they attempted in parliament and had secured the confidence and good will of the public in a very high degree they had besides acquired some credit in their foreign transactions they had concluded an advantageous commercial treaty with the empress of russia they settled the long contested affair of the canada bills to the satisfaction of the owners of them and made some progress in reviving the long neglected affair of the manilla ransom  from the time that the right hon henry belson leg was discharged from the office of chancellor of the exchequer in may      and lord temple and mr pit resigned the   th of september that year no less than     changes of places outs and inns happened by the fluctuating of ministerial influence a circumstance hardly to be parallelled in any annals  those who had not considered the fluctuating state of administration for some years back might have been apt to imagine that in consequence of so fair a beginning they were securely fixed in their present situation  it was then to the great surprise of the nation that notwithstanding these appearances a sudden and unexpected change took place in the ministry for on the  0th of july the duke of grafton was appointed to the head of the treasury in the room of the marquis of rockingham the earl of shelburne secretary of state in the room of the duke of richmond lord camden high chancellor in the room of the earl of northington right hon charles townshend chancellor of the exchequer in the room of the right hon william dowdeswell and the right hon william pit created some days before viscount pynsent and earl of chatham lord privy seal many other changes took place both at home and subsequently in all the different departments of state  the patriotic opinion which has been conceived of the late ministry was much increased by the disinterestedness they had shown upon quitting their places as they retired without a place pensions or reversion secured to themselves or their friends the sense which the public held of their services was also testified by the numerous addresses which were presented to the marquis of rockingham upon that occasion on the other hand many of those who were most attached to the earl of chatham regretted that instead of weakening and dividing an interest which the public wished to be supported and contributing to remove a ministry in which they had placed a confidence he had most rather by coinciding and acting along with them contributed to give them that permanency which was so much desired and wanted there were other reasons which contributed greatly to lessen the popularity of which the noble lord had before possessed so boundless a share among those his quitting the house of commons and accepting peerage was not the least and his acting alone with and bringing into place and power persons who had the misfortune to be supposed of a party which had been long held very obnoxious contributed its full share annual register for        the following is mr burkes own account of his introduction into public life as well as the share which administration took in the repeal of the stamp act  sir i will answer him mr cornwall as clearly as i am able and with great openness i have nothing to conceal in the year sixtyfive being in a very private station far enough from any line of business and not having the honor of a seat in this house it was my fortune unknowing and unknown to the then ministry by the intervention of a common friend to become connected with a very noble person marquis of rockingham and at the head of the treasury department it was indeed in a situation of little rank and no consequence suitable to the mediocrity of my talents and pretensions but a situation near enough to enable me to see as well as others what was going on and i did see in that noble person such sound principles such an enlargement of mind such clear and sagacious sense and such unshaken fortitude as have bound me as well as others much better than me by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward sir lord rockingham very early in that summer received a strong representation from many weighty english merchants and manufacturers from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war against almost the whole of the american commercial regulations and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the spanish trade i believe sir the noble lord soon saw his way in this business but he did not rashly determine against acts which it migh be supposed were the result of much deliberation however sir he scarcely began to open the ground when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm a violent outcry of all except those who knew and felt the mischief was raised against any alteration on one hand his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public law  on the other the act of navigation and all the corpse of trade laws were drawn up in array against it  the first step the noble lord took was to have the opinion of his excellent learned and ever lamented friend the late mr york then attorney general on the point of law when he knew that formally and officially which in substance he had known before he immediately dispatched orders to redress the grievance but i will say it for the then minister he is of that constitution of mind that i know he would have issued on the same critical occasion the very same orders if the acts of trade had been as they were not directly against him and would have cheerfully submitted to the equity of parliament for his indemnity  on the conclusion of this business of the spanish trade the news of the troubles on account of the stamp act arrived in england it was not until the end of october that these accounts were received no sooner had the sound of that mighty tempest reached us in england than the whole of the then opposition instead of feeling humbled by the unhappy issue of their measures seemed to be infinitely elated and cried out that the ministry from envy to the glory of their predecessors were prepared to repeal the stamp act near nine years after the honorable gentleman takes quite opposite ground and now  me to put my hand to my heart and say whether the ministry had resolved on the repeal till a considerable time after the meeting of parliament though i do not very well know what the honorable gentleman wishes to infer from the admission or from the denial of this fact on which he so earnestly adjures me i do put my hand on my heart and assure him that they did not come to a resolution directly to repeal they weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required they considered maturely among themselves they consulted with all who could give advice or information it was not determined until a little before the meeting of parliament but it was determined and the main lines of their own plan marked out before that meeting two questions arose i hope i am not going into a narrative troublesome to the house  a cry of go on go on  the first of the two considerations was whether the repeal should be total or whether only partial taking out every thing burdensome and productive and reserving only an empty acknowledgment such as a stamp on cards or dice the other question was on what principle the act should be repealed on this head also two principles were started one that the legislative rights of this country with regard to america were not entire but had certain restrictions and limitations the other principle was that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the colonies were founded and contrary to every idea of political equity by which equity we are bound as much as possible to extend the spirit and benefit of the british constitution to every part of the british dominions the option both of the measure and of the principle of repeal was made before the session and i wonder how any one can read the kings speech at the opening of that session without seeing in that speech both the repeal and the declaratory act very sufficiently crayoned out those who cannot see this can see nothing  surely the honorable gentleman will not think that a great deal less time than was then employed ought to have been spent in deliberation when he considers that the news of the troubles did not arrive till toward the end of october the parliament sat to fill the vacancies on the   th day of december and on business the   th of the following january  speech on american taxation  mr burke then proceeded to state the principle on which administration acted in the repeal of this act  a partial repeal says he or as the bon ton of the court then was a modification would have satisfied a timid unsystematic procrastinating ministry as such a measure has since done such a ministry a modification is the constant resource of weak undeciding minds to repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble and this too did not want advisers would have cut in the heroic style the gordian knot with a sword either measure would have cost no more than a days debate but when the total repeal was adopted and adopted on principles of policy of equity and of commerce this plan made it necessary to enter into many and difficult measures it becomes necessary to open a very large field of evidence commensurate to these extensive views  i think the enquiry lasted in the committee for six weeks and at its conclusion this house by an independent noble spirited and unexpected majority  by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in parliament  in the teeth of all the old mercenary swiss of state  in despite of all the speculators and augurs of political events  in defiance of the whole embattled legion of veteran pensioners and practiced instruments of a court gave a total repeal to the stamp act and if it had been so permitted a lasting peace to this whole empire  mr burke then adds if the conduct of ministry in propg the repeal had arisen from timidity with regard to themselves it would have been greatly to be condemned interested timidity disgraces as much in this cabinet as personal timidity does in the field but timidity with regard to the well being of our country is heroic virtue the noble lord marquis of rockingham who then conducted affairs and his worthy colleagues whilst trembling at the prospects of such distresses as you have since brought upon yourselves were not afraid steadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blanched he looked in the face one of the ablest and let me say not the most scrupulous oppositions that perhaps ever was in this house and withstood it unaided by even one of the usual supports of administration  short a time as mr burke was in office he took care to render himself master of something more than what mr canning calls the mechanical part of it and accordingly we find him in opposition unfold the intrigues of the new administration with uncommon art and dexterity  nor was he sparing of ridicule which he always ot with unerring hand  in short it may be said that he brightened from collision and gathered strength even from defeat those that wrestle with us as he says himself strengthen us  nor did he confine his attacks to the senate for he and his brother richard assisted by his relative william burke published several papers in defense of the rockingham party in the gazetteer under various signatures from the year      to      some of those papers were written in answer to mr scott of cambridge who appeared at the time under the signature of antesejanus as mr burke was naturally of an active disposition of mind his moments were constantly employed either in consulting the best writers conversing with the most intelligent on the most useful subjects occasionally pruning his trees or directing his rivulets his own account of his studies will be preferred to mine  when said he i first devoted myself to the public service i considered how i should render myself fit for it and this i did by endeavoring to discover what it was that gave this country the rank it holds in the world i found that our prosperity and dignity arose principally if not solely from two sources  our constitution and commerce both these i have spared no study to understand and no endeavor to support  speech to the electors of bristol  in      mr burke paid a visit to ireland where he found a number of persons who had discovered that they were related to him since he became a british senator he did not however forget his old friends in the long list of his new relations  he visited all received all with affability and good nature retraced with rapture the scenes of his boyish days  and returned to his duty in the latter end of march      in the same year he was returned at the general election for the borough of malton in yorkshire through the interest of the marquis his patron  the session of      was opened with a clouded prospect the high price of provisions was very severely felt by those who earned them with the sweat of their brow the restraining act relative to the east india company the nullum tempus bill afforded ample room for discussion mr burke took a very active part in all those questions in which he was very ably supported by mr dowdeswell mr dunning late lord ashburton and colonel bar such union of talents was equal to the discussion of any subject that could possibly be advanced mr burke was always found on his post the first on the breach and the last on the mine the brilliancy of his talents was so universally felt and acknowledged that he was ranked as the leader of the rockingham party  sometimes his zeal and the natural warmth of his temper would urge him to press a point beyond its due bounds which afforded his opponents a temporary triumph  temporary indeed for the ease and ingenuity with which he used to recover his previous position evinced the resources of his mind and the subtilty of his imagination which induced the great lord chatham to say on one of these occasions that burke could only be wounded by burke  mr burke it is true enlisted under the banners of party but as that party may be called the guardian of the constitution he was left at full liberty to suggest such measures as would forward or secure the most patriotic objects in short he was left to the full display of his own powers and opinions and rather led than followed in almost every debate  the duke of grafton was daily losing ground an administration so chequered and speckled a piece of joinery so crossly indented and so whimsically dovetailed could not support itself against the eloquence of mr burke and the pen of junius accordingly on the   th of january    0 his grace resigned his situation as first lord of the treasury and was succeeded by the right hon frederick lord north mr burke describes the situation of public affairs at this period in the following words   nobody i believe will consider it merely as the language of spleen or disappointment if i say that there is something particularly alarming in the present conjuncture there is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language that government is at once dreaded and contemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respect and salutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and their exertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effect that our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy that our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened from their obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce that hardly any thing above or below abroad or at home is sound and entire but that disconnexion and confusion in office in parties in families in parliament in the nation prevail beyond the disorders of any former time  these are facts universally admitted and lamented  the earl of chatham saw things in the same alarming point of view at my time of life says that venerable statesman see earl of chathams speech on the address moved on the  th of january    0 by the duke of ancaster  loaded as i am with infirmities i might perhaps have stood excused if i had continued in retirement and never taken a part again in public affairs but the alarming state of the nation forced me to come forward once more and to execute that duty which i owe to god to my sovereign and to my country and i am determined to perform it at the risk of my life and in these three points of view it must be confessed that he performed his vow as a man an hereditary counselor of the crown and a patriot nobly falling with a falling state but though he raised his voice to heaven and poured the balm of conciliation from his lips that warning voice was not attended to and his venerable figure and the fire of his imagination were the only things that seem to have made an impression on those that heard him his lordships sentiments relative to america were well known previous to that day speaking however of that continent in the course of his speech he lamented the unhappy measure which had divided the colonies from the mother country and which he feared had drawn them into excesses which he could not justify he owned his natural partiality to america and was inclined to make allowance even for those excesses that they ought to be treated with tenderness for in his sense they were ebullitions of liberty which broke out upon the skin and were a sign if not of perfect health at least of a vigorous constitution and must not be driven in too suddenly least they should strike to the heart he professed himself entirely ignorant of the present state of america therefore should be cautious of giving any opinion of the measures fit to be pursued with respect to that country that it was a maxim he had observed through life when he had lost way to stop short lest by proceeding without knowledge and advancing as he feared a noble duke had done from one false step to another he should wind himself into an inextricable labyrinth and never be able to recover the right road again that as the house had yet no materials before them by which they might judge of the proceedings of the colonies he strongly objected to their passing that heavy censure upon them which was conveyed in the word unwarrantable contained in the proposed address that it was passing a sentence without hearing the cause or being acquainted with facts might expose the proceedings of the house to be received abroad with indifference or disrespect that if unwarrantable meant any thing it must mean illegal and how could their lordships decide that proceedings which had not been stated to them in any shape were contrary to law that what he had heard of the combinations in america and of their success in supplying themselves with goods of their own manufacture had indeed alarmed him much for the commercial interests of the mother country but he could not conceive in what sense they could be called illegal much less how a declaration of that house could remove the evil that they were dangerous indeed and he greatly wished to have that word substituted for unwarrantable that the discontent of two millions of people deserved consideration and the foundation of it ought to be removed that this was the true way of putting a stop to combinations and manufactures in that country but that he reserved himself to give his opinion more particularly upon this subject when authentic information of the state of america should be laid before the house  that we should be cautious how we invaded the liberties of any part of our fellow subjects however remote in situation or unable to make resistance that liberty was a plant that deserved to be cherished that he loved the tree and wished well to every branch of it that like the vine in scripture it had spread from east to west had embraced whole nations with its branches and sheltered them under its leaves that the americans had purchased their liberty at a dear rate since they had quitted their native country and gone in search of freedom to a desert  in      and      the east india affairs were submitted to the attention and consideration of parliament two committees were appointed to examine and report on this subject the first was an open committee and the second a secret one the former was very slow in their proceedings and the latter very hasty this contrast furnished mr burke with abundant pleasantry in discussing a subject of such magnitude he gave evident proofs that it was not beyond his reach nay that he was very intimate with the most intricate parts of it but majorities triumphed over arguments the house having resolved itself into a committee on a bill for leaving the company in possession of their territorial possessions in india for a time to be limited mr burke addressed the chairman thus   mr bacon you are every thing but what you should be you are chairman of a committee in the air  we are a committee of imagination of idea of every thing but reality and we might as well be employed in building castles in the air but sir i cannot help most seriously remarking how amazingly the opinions of men change what has now taken place is a special instance of it when a proposition comes originally from this side of the house it is heard with disgust and treated with contempt such reasons however accompany it as convince even the antagonists of the idea it passes through the political elaboratory the sun shines from the treasurybench on it it is given to the house and heard with applause this sir i have seen more than once and any member who will take the trouble of recollecting what i have advanced more than once within these ten days must also plainly perceive it now adopted in a manner which shows the conviction of that bench but clogged damned with attendants which seem coined to destroy all the good that could result from the other why will not the noble lord at once declare or give up the right of the crown to the territorial acquisitions why is that fantastic right to hang eternally over their heads in order to destroy that very solidity which he affects to give the company  sir i was answered in a former committee that i did not adhere to the question but sir it was a reply of ignorance alone if the proposers of a motion will pass the plain road that leads to common sense in order to wander into a rotten bog the man who calls them back again and tells them they will soon be up to the chin in that ground is he the man who runs from the question the noble lord in order to come immediately to his motion passes over the previous question of right the consequence of which is all his deductions are actions of absurdity  all his propositions strings of contradictions let him declare that right on the strength of which he seizes with the hand of power and the house will support him if he gives it up it will support him let him offer a purge you will swallow it  a vomit it will go down  an alterative or astringent  an acid or an alkali  all one  down it goes while the noble lord finds we have such a swallow let him give the pill at once without gilding  let him fairly declare the degree of this accursed right which hangs thus in terrorem on your trade to the east  mr burke had now shone with increasing luster as the steady advocate of civil liberty and in order to complete his character as a patriot and senator he availed himself of the first opportunity to evince his attachment to the cause of religious liberty  on the eighteenth of february      sir harry houghton moved for leave to bring in a bill for the relief of protestant dissenters in sundry matters relating to subscription it was vehemently opposed by sir william baggot on two grounds first because the penal laws against such of the dissenters as did not subscribe were never put in force and secondly because he believed that the attempt to set aside the thirtynine articles was agitated with a design unfavourable to christianity mr burke in reply spoke nearly to the following effect  i propose sir taking notice of what fell from the honorable gentlemans lips considered in a twofold view he advanced the following positions that the dissenters now enjoyed liberty by connivance and that toleration was an attack upon christianity  the dissenters enjoy liberty by connivance my good sir what sort of liberty is this what sir is liberty by connivance but a temporary relaxation of slavery is this a sort of liberty calculated for the meridian of england montesquieu places liberty in an exemption from fear are persons who enjoy it by connivance only  are they exempt from fear and divested of apprehension to talk then sir of a connivance is to talk only of a temporary suspension of tyranny you are desirous to keep the rod hanging over the dissenters heads at the very instant that you assure them they shall never smart under its stripes why then at once not set their hearts at rest by removing the impending danger why not release them from the dread of these penal statutes the cruelty of which so shocks your generous natures that you think it incumbent on you to declare they never should be put ino execution the question sir answers itself and to cavil at its propriety is to carp at truth and elude conviction  as to what the honorable gentleman let fall concerning toleration being an attack upon christianity it is an assertion so contrary to truth and history that it scarcely stands in need of refutation by toleration christianity flourished whilst the eastern and western churches were tolerant they were illustrious they were venerated they were held in sacred estimation when the romish church cast aside its toleration and had recourse to threatenings slaughter and persecutions commotions ensued ecclesiastical anarchy prevailed and the kingdom of darkness was erected on the ruins of christianity instead of combating the common foe christians combated each other instead of taking arms against the grand deceivers they strove by every deceptious art to harrass and torment those whom they ought to have cherished and loved as brethren in short the want of toleration has lessened the number of believers and for that reason i would have all protestants united that we may be the better enabled to make a common cause against infidels of every denomination  the church of england sir has not a firmer friend than myself  i wish her illustrious  i wish her head may reach that heaven to which she would conduct us  but i would also wish her family as numerous as possible  i would wish a brotherly affection to prevail among her offspring  i would have christians united  i would have them join in every attempt to crush the powers of darkness and trample under foot the foe to god and man like a mother tender of her children i would have the church with wide extended arms receive in her bosom every believing son not with unnatural austerity reproach her offspring and drive them to seek for ease for pleasure and for comfort in the harlot lap of infidelity  this speech made a great impression in and out of doors which is not to be wondered at if we consider the height from whence it fell surely it was time that religion should cease to be a crime and that punishment should not reach those that were guilty of no other persecution as the late earl of mansfield said may make hypocrites and martyrs but never made a real convert and it is strange that some persons should imagine that the thirtynine articles of the church of england should be fenced with oaths and perjuries this would be to plant reeds round an oak to defend it from a storm when penal laws are repealed in the heart they ought not to be found on the statute books  sir henry houghtons motion was very favorably received leave was given to bring in the bill which passed the commons without a division but was lost in the house of lords on the second reading by a great majority  an act was passed on the   th of march      called the boston port bill which threw the inhabitants of massachusetts into the greatest consternation the town of boston passed a resolution expressing their sense of this oppressive measure and a desire that all the colonies would concur to stop all importation from great britain most of the colonies entered into spirited resolutions on this occasion to unite with massachusetts in a firm opposition to the unconstitutional measures of the parliament the first of june the day on which the port bill was to take place was appointed to be kept as a day of humiliation fasting and prayer throughout the colonies to seek the divine direction and aid in that critical and gloomy junction of affairs  during the height of the consternation and confusion which the boston bort bill occasioned at the very time when a town meeting was sitting to consider of it general gage who had been appointed to the government of massachusetts arrived in the harbor his arrival however did not allay the popular ferment or check the progress of the measure then taking to unite the colonies in opposition to the oppressive act of parliament  but the port bill was not the only act that alarmed the apprehension of the americans determined to compel the province of massachusetts to submit to their law parliament passed an act for the better regulating government in the province of massachusetts bay the object of this act was to alter the government as it stood in the charter of king william to take the appointment of the executive out of the hands of the people and place it in the crown thus making even the judges and sheriffs dependent on the king and removeable only at his pleasure  this act was soon followed by another which ordained that any person indicted for murder or other capital offense committed in aiding the magistrates in executing the laws might be sent by the governor either to another colony or to great britain for his trial  this was soon followed by the quebec bill which extended the bounds of that province and granted many privileges to the roman catholics the object of this bill was to secure the attachment of that province to the crown of england and prevent its joining the colonies in their resistance to the laws of parliament  but these measures did not intimidate the americans on the other hand they served to confirm their former apprehensions of the evil designs of government and to unite the colonies in their opposition  a correspondence of opinion with respect to the unconstitutional acts of parliament produced a uniformity of proceedings in the colonies the people generally concurred in a proposition for holding a congress by deputation from the several colonies in order to concert measures for the preservation of their rights deputies were accordingly appointed and met at philadelphia on the   th october       on the   th of april      mr rose fuller member for rye made the following motion that an act made in the seventeenth year of the reign of his present majesty entitled an act for granting certain duties in the british colonies and plantations in america for allowing a drawback of the duties of customs upon the exportation from this kingdom of coffee and cocoanuts of the produce of the said colonies or plantations for discontinuing the drawbacks payable on china earthen ware exported to america and for more effectually preventing the clandestine running of goods in the said colonies and plantations might be read  and the same being read accordingly he moved that this house will upon this day sennight resolve itself into a committee of the whole house to take into consideration the duty of  d per pound weight upon tea payable in all his majestys dominions in america imposed by the said act and also the appropriation of the said duty  a warm and interesting debate took place on the question of american taxation that perhaps to use mr burkes expression no topic had been more familiar to the house mr wolfran cornwall took a wide view of it and when it was thought that the subject was entirely exhausted mr burke rose and to the surprise of those that were in the habits of admiring his powers poured fresh light upon it  not that light that misleads in proportion as it dazzles but the steady beam of reason and sound argument that at once vivifies charms and illumines all that was dark in speaking of the repeal of the stamp act i affirm said he that when departing from the maxims of that repeal you revived the scheme of taxation and thereby filled the minds of the colonists with new jealousy and all sorts of apprehensions then it was that they quarrelled with the old taxes as well as the new then it was and not till then that they questioned all the parts of your legislature and by the battery of such questions have shaken the solid structure of this empire to its deepest foundations mr burke followed up this assertion with such damning proofs arising out of the very acts and speeches of ministers themselves particularly in lord hillsboroughs letter to the american governors dated may   th      which he called the canonical book of ministerial scripture or the general epistle to the americans well knowing that his arguments on this head were unanswerable he was resolved not to omit the opportunity of a personal triumph upon the principles therefore said he of the honorable gentleman mr cornwall upon the principles of the minister himself the minister has nothing at all to answer he stands condemned by himself and by all his associates old and new as a destroyer in the first trust of finance of the revenues and in the first rank of honor as a betrayer of the dignity of his country  mr burke in the course of his speech made the following declaration   i will be content to be declared infamous if i do not to the last hour of my life at all times in all places and upon all occasions exert every power with which i either am or ever shall be legally invested in order to obtain and maintain for the continent of america that satisfaction which i have been authorized to promise this day by the confidential servants of our gracious sovereign who to my certain knowledge rates his honor so high that he would rather part with his crown than preserve it by deceit and it is but justice to say that he maintained his promise  having shown first on the narrow ground which mr cornwall measured says he that we were like to lose nothing by complying with the motion except what we had already lost that in time of peace we flourished in commerce and when war required it had sufficient aid from the colonies as long as we pursued our ancient policy that the stamp act threw every thing into confusion and that the repeal of it restored every thing to peace and order that the revival of the system of taxation produced the very worst effects and that the partial repeal produced not partial good but universal evil let these considerations said he founded on facts not one of which can be denied bring us back to our reason by the road of our experience but alas this was the old beaten road which ministers did not wish to tread it was not sufficiently strewed with places and pensions new paths must be struck out new turnpikes erected and additional toll paid  mr burke concluded this very able and argumentative speech with the following passage which many have considered as the keystone of the arch  on this business of america i confess i am serious even to sadness i have had but one opinion concerning it since i sat and before i sat in parliament the noble lord will as usual probably attribute the part taken by me and my friends in this business to a desire of getting his place let him enjoy this happy and original idea if i deprived him of it i should take away most of his wit and all his argument but i had rather bear the brunt of all his wit and indeed blows much heavier than stand answerable to god for embracing a system that tends to the destruction of some of the very best and fairest of his works but i know the map of england as well as the noble lord lord north  or as any other person and i know that the way i take is not the road to preferment my excellent and honorable friend under me on the floor mr dowdeswell  has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years together he is not yet arrived at the noble lords destination however the tracks of my worthy friend are those i have ever wished to follow because i know they lead to honor long may we tread the same road together whoever may accompany us or whoever may laugh at us on our journey i honestly and solemnly declare i have in all seasons adhered to the system of      for no other reason than that i think it laid deep in your truest interests  and that by unlimiting the exercise it fixes on the firmest foundations a real consistent wellgrounded authority in parliament until you come back to that system there will be no peace for england  a gentleman of talents who had the good fortune to be present at the delivery of this speech has pourtrayed it thus in this speech he had occasion to show the original plan of government in taxing the colonies and of course to exhibit the characters that were officially concerned either in its progress or opposition he began with the right honorable george grenville chancellor of the exchequer in      and then proceeded to the characters of the late lord chatham late right honorable charles townshend chancellor of the exchequer in      and the reproducer of the taxation scheme the marquis of rockingham and the late fieldmarshall conway with many others some of these characters who when living were in total opposition to mr burkes political sentiments on this subject but now being dead and their memories moreover being warmly protected by many high personages as relatives and friends presented a subject very difficult and delicate to expand upon lord chatham too was still living and though rather in the wane of his great political powers yet surrounded by his former greatness his accumulated wisdom and great experience he stood as the great mentor of opposition to whom all the parts occasionally looked up for advice and protection when we add to these that the marquis of rockingham and fieldmarshall conway were his particular friends  the difficulties of reproving and praising became so multiplied that the undertaking seemed to be one of those traps which vanity sometimes lays for great men to show them the extent of their own presumption  but mr burkes mind was fully equal to the task all the leading and pleasing features of those great men who were his political opponents he praised with a manly openness that would have done honor to the warmest and most exalted friendship even what he thought of their defects he softened in such a manner by either attributing them to original opinions or early habits or the cooperation of party that those most intimately attached to their memories could not be displeased with their general portraits  the late lord john cavendish had retired with other members to the gallery during the delivery of this speech and at mr burkes description of general conways feelings  good god exclaimed his lordship what a man is this  how could he acquire such transcendent powers  at the dissolution of the parliament on the last day of september      mr burke made his election for malton but scarce was he returned when a deputation from some of the most respectable merchants and dissenters in bristol invited him to stand for that city he could not resist so flattering an invitation so that to use george selwyns expression he resigned his little country wench for a fine city dame attired in the richest silks and showered with diamonds but it should not be forgotten that these ornaments were purchased at the expense of human blood the candidates who started on this occasion were lord clare one of the late representatives who declined on the second day of the poll mr brickdale and mr cruger an american merchant mr burke appeared on the hustings on the afternoon of the sixth days poll his address to the electors was manly candid and captivating  and such as might be expected from one whom neither avarice or ambition had justled out of the straight line of duty the exertions of his friends were crowned with success it was certainly a very pleasing sight to behold a man of mr burkes sensibility standing amidst the unbought plaudits of the populace dumb with gratitude till his tears got the start of his words  and as a gentleman who was present observed it was hard to say which of the two was the more eloquent the opening of his address was worthy of the man void of all affectation it arose naturally from the circumstances of the moment and conveyed a fine compliment to the feelings of his colleague mr cruger  it ran thus  gentlemen i cannot avoid sympathizing strongly with the feelings of the gentleman who has received the same honor that you have conferred on me if he who was bred and passed his whole life amongst you if he who through the easy gradations of acquaintance friendship and esteem has obtained the honor which seems of itself naturally and almost insensibly to meet with those who by the even tenor of pleasing manners and social virtues slide into the love and confidence of their fellowcitizens  if he cannot speak but with great emotion on this subject surrounded as he is on all sides with his old friends you will have the goodness to excuse me if my real unaffected embarrassment prevents me from expressing my gratitude to you as i ought  i was brought hither under the disadvantage of being unknown even by sight to any of you no previous canvass was made for me i was put in nomination after the poll was opened i did not appear until it was far advanced if under all these accumulated disadvantages your good opinion has carried me to this happy point of success you will pardon me if i can only say to you collectively as i said to you individually simply and plainly i thank you  i am obliged to you  i am not insensible of your kindness  mr burke declared that from the beginning to the end of the election that he never asked a question of a voter on the other side or supported a doubtful one on his own it is also well known that he never solicited a vote in person  and yet it does not appear that he was deficient in election cant from the following humourous specimen of it which he gave in the same speech  but how should i appear to the voters themselves if i had gone round to the citizens entitled to freedom and squeezed them by the hand  sir i humbly beg your vote  i shall be eternally thankful  may i hope for the honor of your support  well  come  we shall see you at the councilhouse  if i were then to deliver them to my managers pack them into tallies vote them off in court and when i heard from the bar  such a one only and such a one for ever  he is my man  thank you good sir  hah my worthy friend thank you kindly  that is an honest fellow  how is your good family  whilst these words were hardly out of my mouth if i should have wheeled round at once and told them  get you gone you pack of worthless fellows you have no votes  you are usurpers you are intruders on the rights of real freemen i will have nothing to do with you you ought never to have been produced at this election and the sheriffs ought not to have admitted you to poll  mr burke was extremely happy in the locality of his similes during the election  witness the following  as for the trifling petulance which the rage of party stirs up in little minds though it should show itself even in this court it has not made the slightest impression on me the highest flight of such clamorous birds is winged in an inferior region of the air we hear them and we look upon them just as you gentlemen when you enjoy the serene air on your lofty rocks look down upon the gulls that skim the mud of your river when it is exhausted of its tide  in this speech mr burke has drawn a picture of what he conceived to be the duty of a representative to his constituents the passage is too fine to be omitted or abridged especially as it is a point on which the ablest writers are divided  i am sorry i cannot conclude without saying a word on a topic touched upon by my worthy colleague i wish that topic had been passed by at a time when i have so little leisure to discuss it but since he has thought proper to throw it out i owe you a clear explanation of my poor sentiments on that subject  he tells you that the topic of instructions has occasioned much altercation and uneasiness in this city and he expresses himself if i understand him rightly in favor of the coercive authority of such instructions  certainly gentlemen it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union the closest correspondence and the most unreserved communication with his constituents their wishes ought to have great weight with him their opinion high respect their business unremitted attention it is his duty to sacrifice his repose his pleasures his satisfactions to theirs and above all ever and in all cases to prefer their interest to his own but his unbiassed opinion his mature judgment his enlightened conscience he ought not to sacrifice to you to any man or to any set of men living these he does not derive from your pleasure no nor from the law and the constitution they are a trust from providence for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion  my worthy colleague says his will ought to be subservient to yours if that be all the thing is innocent if government were a matter of will upon any side yours without question ought to be superior but government and legislation are matters of reason and judgment and not of inclination and what sort of reason is that in which the determination precedes the discussion in which one set of men deliberate and another decide and where those who form the conclusion are perhaps three hundred miles distant from those who hear the arguments  to deliver an opinion is the right of all men that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear and which he ought always most seriously to consider but authoritative instructions mandates issued which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey to vote and to argue for though contrary to the clearest conviction of his judgment and conscience these are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land and which arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution  parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests which interests each must maintain as an agent and advocate against other agents and advocates but parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation with one interest that of the whole where not local purposes not local prejudices ought to guide but the general good resulting from the general reason of the whole you choose a member indeed but when you have chosen him he is not a member of bristol but he is a member of parliament if the local constituent should have an interest or should form an hasty opinion evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community the member for that place ought to be as far as any other from any endeavor to get it effect i beg pardon for saying so much on this subject i have been unwillingly drawn into it but i shall ever use a respectful frankness of communication with you your faithful friend your devoted servant i shall be to the end of my life a flatterer you do not wish for on this point of instructions however i think it scarcely possible we ever can have any sort of difference perhaps i may give you too much rather than too little trouble  mr burke having found by experience that a strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless power a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm an inquisitive character to discover and a bold one to display every corruption and every error of government had recommended him to a seat for bristol he was determined to persevere in the same steady course  he had formed a most intimate friendship with sir george saville that good man who was very justly looked up to as the landmark of the constitution went to ireland about this time for the humane purpose of meliorating the condition of his numerous tenantry in that country having rode out one frosty morning without any attendant he espied a man at a little distance with whom he entered into conversation who does that mill belong to i rent it sir and what is the meaning that your mill is not better thatched and yourself better clad  i cannot help it sir i have a large family and i assure you we do not eat the bread of idleness but i pay a high rent who is your landlord an englishman sir and one of the best men sir george saville why how much do you pay an acre fourteen shillings what did you pay ten then take your bill and write down ten for i am your landlord the poor man could only look up to heaven as much as to say you are dropped from thence sir george made similar deductions over all his estate but he that was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame was called too soon to receive the reward of his virtue  the public statue of the late sir george saville is erected in york cathedral it is fixed on an elegant marble pedestal six feet high on the frize of which are introduced the emblems of wisdom fortitude and eternity sir george is represented leaning on a pillar holding in his right hand a scroll on which is written the petition of the freeholders of the county of york the back ground is of white marble and the whole height of the monument is sixteen feet and is executed in so masterly a manner as to do great credit to the statuary on the front of the pedestal is the following inscription said to be written by mr burke   to the memory of will continue to be beneficial to mankind as splendor gives the brightest mark to poisoned arrows in the dark   it is not to be wondered at if mr burkes character as an orator and a statesman was attacked by all the hireling scribblers of administration but as he did not wish to deprive them of a dinner he never condescended to take any notice of their scurrility it is a tax that every great character is doomed to pay as addison says and he was determined to contribute his share to it his judgment was now matured and his fancy no longer soared on trembling pinions but gazed steadfastly at the sun or built its aerie on the brow of the most arduous precipice the american war was the theme of every tongue and every pen mr burke as we have already observed took a decided part in it he resolved to make one more effort to extinguish the flames of civil discord not even discouraged by the rejection of a bill brought into the upper house by the earl of chatham for settling the troubles in america on the   d of march      he brought forward his celebrated conciliatory propositions his speech on that occasion was conciliation indeed in the true spirit of conciliation and may be truly termed his golden oration though there is scarce a quotation in the whole it may be said to contain the spirit of all that ancient and modern writers have said on the fittest means of allaying all those turbulent passions that civil war never fails to excite as no man was better qualified to resort to the witness of time the light of truth the life of memory and the messenger of antiquity his propositions were founded on the best rules of reason and though they were neither dictated by the passions nor addressed to the passions yet there is a certain atherial warmth that pervades all the arguments which he adduced in support of them and in many instances they abound in all the bold relief of expression throughout the whole he seems to have had the advice of a celebrated statesman in view  omnia sunt in republica suavissime tractanda art quae leniat non exasperet sanet non ulceret moveat no perturbeat non perturbeat animos civium he put the dignity of great britain in one scale and her concession in the other in order to prove that conciliation would add luster to both  in the opening of this speech mr burke describes the progress of the discontents of the americans and his own conduct in that approaching storm   surely says he it is an awful subject or there is none so on this side of the grave when i first had the honor of a seat in this house the affairs of that continent pressed themselves upon us as the most important and most delicate object of parliamentary attention my little share in this great deliberation oppressed me i found myself a partaker in a very high trust and having no sort of reason to rely on the strength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that trust i was obliged to take more than common pains to instruct myself in every thing which relates to our colonies i was not less under the necessity of forming some fixed ideas concerning the general policy of the british empire something of this sort seemed to be indispensible in order amidst so great a fluctuation of passions and opinions to concentre my thoughts to ballast my conduct to preserve me from being blown about by every wind of fashionable doctrine i really did not think it safe or manly to have fresh principles to seek upon every fresh mail which should arrive from america  at that period i had the fortune to find myself in perfect concurrence with a large majority in this house bowing under that high authority and penetrated with the sharpness and strength of that early impression i have continued ever since without the least deviation in my original sentiments whether this be owing to an obstinate perseverance in error or a religious adherence to what appears to me truth and reason it is in your equity to judge  sir parliament having an enlarged view of objects made during this interval more frequent changes in their sentiments and their conduct than could be justified in a particular person upon the contracted scale of private information but though i do not hazard any thing approaching to a censure on the motives of former parliaments to all those alterations one fact is undoubted that under them the state of america has been kept in continual agitation every thing administered as a remedy to the public complaint if it did not produce was at least followed by an heightening of the distemper until by a variety of experiments that important country has been brought into her present situation  a situation which i will not miscall which i dare not name which i scarcely know how to comprehend in the terms of any description  the americans had been traduced in the ministerial prints as the spawn of stews and gaols as the mere purgamenta urbium new england was originally settled by a religious sect denominated puritans who fled from the severe restraints imposed upon dissenters in the reign of king james i placed beyond the fear of control they formed a system of civil ecclesiastical government exactly suited to their rigid notions all their institutions were marks of an enthusiastic zeal of religion removed from the tyranny of one church they vibrated to the other extreme with an order to build up christs kingdom in what they quaintly call a howling wilderness they established a tyranny of the severest kind over the consciences and rights of their own society and by arbitrary decrees banished those who differed from them upon the most metaphysical points it was a law of the first settlers at boston that none could be free men and entitled to vote for civil rulers who were not in full communion with the church and none could be admitted to full communion without the recommendation of a clergyman these laws threw all the power of the state into the hands of the clergy it is equally astonishing and ridiculous to the posterity of those godly people to find the church and state in the infancy of the settlement of america rent with discord upon the simple question whether sanctification precedes justification yet hundreds of councils were held upon this or similar points and a dissent from the common opinion on such trifling questions was hereby punishable with excommunication and banishment  but candor requires some apology to be made for them bigotry was not confined to the new england settlers it was the characteristic of the age the first settlers in new jersey virginia and pennsylvania and indeed in most of the colonies prohibited witchcraft under penalty of death though the laws seem not to have been executed any where except in massachusetts but the same gloomy superstition reigned in england the statutes of henry viii and james i making witchcraft and sorcery felony without benefit of clergy upon which many persons suffered death were not repealed till the ninth year of george ii or about      just before the restoration in    0 no less than thirteen gypsies were condemned at one suffolk assizes and executed  noah webster  mr burke touched on this string and with the finger of a master too  see page    the predominant feature of their character was a love of liberty they sought it in the midst of deserts religion went before them like a pillar of light somewhat clouded it is true and the songs of zion soothed the wild murmurs of the ohio  mr burke points out in what manner the education of the colonists  see page    and    contributed to the growth and effect of their untractable spirit and that the study of the law so prevalent in that country rendered men acute inquisitive dextrous prompt in attack ready in defense and full of resources he then adverts to the religion of the country  see page    after which he describes the chief branches of their religion which ought to be remembered as a piece of history independent of its eloquence the roman catholic religion says he is at least coeval with most of the governments where it prevails that it has generally gone hand in hand with them and received great favor and every kind of support from authority the church of england was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of regular government but the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty their very existence depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim all protestantism even the most cold and passive is a sort of dissent but the religion most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of resistance it is the diffidence of dissent and the protestantism of protestantism  the religion under a variety of denominations agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty is predominant in most of the northern provinces where the church of england notwithstanding its legal rights is in reality no more than a sort of private sect not composing most probably the tenth of the people the colonists left england when this spirit was high and in the emigrants was the highest of all he then shows that the spirit of liberty was still more high and haughty in the southern than in the northern states and the reasons he assigns in support of this assertion are not less ingenious than true it is says he that in virginia and the carolinas they have a vast multitude of slaves where this is the case in any part of the world those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom freedom is to them not only an enjoyment but a kind of rank and privilege not seeing there that freedom as in countries where it is a common blessing and as broad and general as the air may be united with much abject toil with great misery with all the exterior of servitude liberty looks amongst them like something that is more noble and liberal i do not mean sir to commend the superior morality of this sentiment which has at least as much pride as virtue in it but i cannot alter the nature of man the fact is so and these people of the southern colonies are much more strongly and with an higher and more stubborn spirit attached to liberty than those to the northward such were all the ancient commonwealths such were our gothic ancestors such in our days were the poles and such will be all masters of slaves who are not slaves themselves in such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with the spirit of freedom fortifies it and renders it invincible  he then remarks on the rapid population of the colonists  see page    so rapid that whilst they were disputing about the exaggeration of it the exaggeration ended because they grew to it having stated what may be called the biography of the americans he proceeds to the natural resources of that country they had prosecuted agriculture  see page    with such a spirit that for some time past the old world had been fed by the new having traced the plough into woods and wilds he indulged his imagination in the richest description of their fisheries  see page  0 flies after the line and harpoon through all the thrilling regions of thick ribbed ice and seems to leave the gigantic pursuit with reluctance on the coast of brazil the commerce of america was a favorite theme  see page    for my part said he in another place speech on american taxation  i never cast an eye on their flourishing commerce and their cultivated and commodious life but they seem to me rather ancient nations grown to perfection through a long series of fortunate events and a train of successful industry accumulating wealth in many centuries than the colonies of yesterday than a set of miserable outcasts a few years ago not so much sent as thrown out on the bleak and barren shore of a desolate wilderness three thousand miles from all civilized intercourse  having gone round and round the subject and surveyed it minutely in every possible aspect he proceeded to take a view of the physical objects we had to contend with in the subjugation of the colonies  space and the ocean  no contrivance could shorten the one pump the other dry or remove the eternal barriers of the creation  see page       his sentiments on the idea of enfranchising the american slaves deserves to be remembered   it is sometimes as hard to persuade slaves to be free as it is to compel freemen to be slaves and in this auspicious scheme we should have both these pleasing tasks on our hands at once but when we talk of enfranchisement do we not perceive that the american master may enfranchise too and arm servile hands in defense of freedom a measure to which other people have had recourse more than once and not without success in a desperate situation of their affairs  slaves as these unfortunate black people are and dull as all men are from slavery must they not a little suspect the offer of freedom from that very nation which has sold them to their present masters from that nation one of whose causes of quarrel with those masters is their refusal to deal any more in that inhuman traffic an offer of freedom from england would come rather oddly shipped to them in an african vessel which is refused an entry into the ports of virginia or carolina with a cargo of three hundred angola negroes it would be curious to see the guinea captain attempting at the same instant to publish his proclamation of liberty and to advertise his sale of slaves  amidst the many shining passages in this speech it would be unpardonable to pass over one that may be called the brightest of all it is almost needless to say that i mean the picture of the rapid growth of our national prosperity the materials it is true were then abundant and his friend sir joshua reynolds could not have hit it off in gayer colors the artful manner in which he prepared the mind of his audience for this grand sight is worthy of remark first he sets out in the plain figures of arithmetic piling one year of prosperity on the top of the other as if he were speaking to a parcel of clerks in a counting house in an instant he flies off to an eminence and addresses the senate in language worthy of the british cicero  mr speaker said he i cannot prevail on myself to hurry over this great consideration the exports to america it is good for us to be here we stand where we have an immense view of what is and what is past clouds indeed and darkness rest upon the future let us however before we descend from this noble eminence reflect that this growth of our national prosperity has happened within the short period of the life of man it has happened within sixtyeight years there are those alive whose memory might touch the two extremities for instance my lord bathhurst might remember all the stages of the progress he was in   0  of an age at least to be made to comprehend such things he was then old enough acta parentum jam legere et qua sit poterit cognoscere virtus  suppose sir that the angel of this auspicious youth foreseeing the many virtues which made him one of the most amiable as he is one of the most fortunate men of his age had opened to him in vision that when in the fourth generation the third prince of the house of brunswick had sat twelve years on the throne of that nation which by the happy issue of moderate and healing councils was to be made great britain he should see his son lord chancellor of england turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its fountain and raise him to an higher rank of peerage whilst he enriched the family with a new one  if amidst these bright and happy scenes of domestic honor and prosperity that angel should have drawn up the curtain and unfolded the rising glories of his country and whilst he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of england the genius should point out to him a little speck scarce visible in the mass of the national interest a small seminal principle rather than a formed body and should tell him  young man there is america  which at this day serves for little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men and uncouth manners yet shall before you taste of death show itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world rapidly advancing in a progressive increase of improvement brought in by varieties of people by succession of civilizing conquests and civilizing settlements in a series of seventeen hundred years you shall see as much added to her by america in the course of a single life if this state of his country had been foretold to him would it not require all the sanguine credulity of youth and all the fervid glow of enthusiasm to make him believe it fortunate man he has lived to see it fortunate indeed if he lives to see nothing that shall vary the prospect and cloud the setting of his day  the earl of chatham on being asked his opinion of this speech answered it is seasonable reasonable and eloquent and now that i have mentioned this great statesman perhaps the reader would like to see a few extracts from his own speech on the same subject nearly as follows  i therefore urge and conjure your lordships immediately to adopt this conciliating measure i will pledge myself for its immediately producing conciliatory effects by its being thus well timed but if you delay till your vain hope shall be accomplished of triumphantly dictating reconciliation you delay for ever but admitting that this hope which in truth is desperate should be accomplished what do you gain by the imposition of your victorious amity you will be untrusted and unthanked adopt then the grace while you have the opportunity of reconcilement or at least prepare the way allay the ferment prevailing in america by removing the obnoxious hostile cause  obnoxious and unserviceable for the merit can be only in action non dimicare et vincere their victory can never be by exertion their force would be most disproportionately exerted against a brave generous and united people with arms in their hands and courage in their hearts three millions of people the genuine descendants of a valiant and pious ancestory driven to those deserts by the narrow maxims of a superstitious tyranny and is the spirit of persecution never to be appeased are the brave sons of those brave forefathers to inherit their sufferings as they have inherited their virtues are they to sustain the infliction of the most oppressive and unexampled severity beyond the accounts of history or description of poetry  rhadamanthus habet durissima regna castigatque auditque so says the wisest poet and perhaps the wisest statesman and politician but our ministers say the americans must not be heard they have been condemned unheard the indiscriminate hand of vengeance has lumped together innocent and guilty with all the formalities of hostility has blocked up the town boston  and reduced to beggary and famine thirty thousand inhabitants  the means of enforcing this thraldom are found to be as ridiculous and weak in practice as they are unjust in principle indeed i cannot but feel the most anxious sensibility for the situation of general gage and the troops under his command thinking him as i do a man of humanity and understanding and entertaining as i ever will the highest respect the warmest love for the british troops their situation is truly unworthy penned up pining in inglorious inactivity they are an army of impotence you may call them an army of safety and of guard but they are in truth an army of impotence and contempt and to make the folly equal to the disgrace they are an army of irritation and vexation  trade indeed increases the wealth and glory of a country but its real strength and stamina are to be looked for among the cultivation of the land in their simplicity of life is found the simpleness of virtue  the integrity and courage of freedom these true genuine sons of the earth are invincible and they surround and hem in the mercantile bodies even if these bodies which supposition i totally disclaim could be supposed disaffected to the cause of liberty  this resistance to your arbitrary system of taxation might have been foreseen it was obvious from the nature of things and of mankind and above all from the whiggish spirit flourishing in that country the spirit which now resists your taxation in america is the same which formerly opposed loans benevolences and ship money in england the same spirit which called all england on its legs and by the bill of rights vindicated the english constitution the same spirit which established the great fundamental essential maxim of your liberties that no subject of england shall be taxed but by his own consent  as the american war is now become a matter of history and can be useful and instructive only in that point of view we shall leave it to the historian and only touch on it merely to show the part that mr burke took in it in all wars a great deal is to be left to the chapter of accidents mr burke seems to have left as little to it as possible in all his calculations on that momentous subject in his very outset on this question he appears to have examined it with great caution and judgment and the cause only seems to have interested him for he says himself in his speech at bristol in    0 that the americans were utter strangers to him a nation amongst whom he was not sure he had a single acquaintance under these impressions as often as this contest was agitated he never failed to call forth fresh arguments and additional reprobation of it every aid that the human intellect and unwearied industry could furnish were at his devotion even scurrility furnished her silth and wit her poignant darts every one as pointed as the parthian arrow and as rapid as its flight if the premier chanced to nod mr burkes imagination furnished him with dreams of splendid victories and the interpretation of them into the bargain in short he excelled the minister in every thing but good humor and majorities money has been considered but too generally as the sinews of war the american coffers were exhausted nor did congress disguise their situation without arms ammunition discipline revenue government or ally and in the weakness of youth as it were with a staff and a sling only we americans dared in the name of the lord of hosts to engage a gigantic adversary prepared at all points boasti of his strength and of whom mighty warriors were greatly afraid this was the real unexaggerated situation of america at the time as published by congress  every day witnessed the depreciation of their paper credit till at length it fell like the leaves of their native woods in autumn mr burke saw this but at the same time he saw the buds of future credit he did not wish to chill them but he wished that england should share the promised fruit as friends and that they should not be plucked with the rude hand of power in short so early as the year      he seems to have seen with a prophetic eye the result of what time has confirmed america said he at that period is not subdued not one unattacked village which was originally adverse throughout that vast continent has yet submitted from love or terror you have the ground you encamp on and you have no more the cantonments of your troops and your dominions are exactly of the same extent you spread devastation but you do not enlarge the sphere of authority  at the opening of the session in october      opposition attended almost to a man in hopes that the minister had profitted from experience in the recess especially as he saw that several of his favorite plans to bring the americans to their senses as he called it had failed were failing and ought to be relinquished but it is with states as it is with individuals there is a season when arguments will not avail mr burke and his party felt this their attendance became more lax and a secession was proposed and as it was not generally approved he states the grounds on which it was disapproved and does justice to those who stood on that ground they questioned he says whether any member could consistently with his duty withdraw himself individually from the business of parliament merely from an opinion that he would be outvoted and that his attendance would therefore be useless they acknowledged that a secession collectively in a body had not only the sanction of precedent but might be practiced with great advantage and be productive of much benefit in such cases as the present but for this purpose it must be attended with the following circumstances in the first place it must be general including the whole minority against the measure that provoked the secession and in the next it should not be a silent act but the motives for the secession should be proclaimed either by a remonstrance on the journals or a public address to the people under these circumstances and in cases of imminent danger to the constitution a secession might operate as a call to the nation and awaken people to a sense of their situation  mr burke tried every means that argument and persuasion could suggest to point out the propriety and necessity of such a step and to remove every scruple on that head and in order to hasten the unanimity he drew up a paper on the subject in the shape of a remonstrance in order that it might find its way on the journals we shall only say that if it had been put and carried in that form it would have illumined those belgic folios it would have served as a precedent on all such emergent occasions it would have served as a faithful record in which ministers might learn that truth in the end will prevail over venal majorities it was thought advisable however to convey the substance of it in an address to the king and if this proposition had been adopted perhaps a more respectful and affectionate address never was conveyed to the foot of the throne it will remain as long as the english language lasts as a monument of the powers and beauties of that tongue and the use which the writer knew how to make of them independent of the force of the arguments and the happy manner in which they are arranged the first paragraph is filled with expressions of unfeigned loyalty of attachment to the sovereign and his true interest the second runs thus  a situation without example necessitates a conduct without precedent we are driven in this mode of addressing your majesty reluctantly to supersede those forms which in other circumstances we should highly respect and regulate ourselves by no other rules than those of our laws our rights and the profound reverence we bear to our sovereign  the third contains an apology for the proposed secession on the grounds of the preservation of their the seceders honor and what stood next in their estimation his majestys good opinion and for inflexibly persevering in their dissent from every part of those proceedings on the experience of their mischief which they originally gave from a sure foresight of their unhappy and inevitable tendency  we deplore say they along with your majesty the distractions and disorders which prevail in your empire but we are convinced that the disorders of the people in the present time are owing to the usual and natural cause of such disorders at all times  the misconduct of government that they are owing to plans laid in error pursued with obstinacy and conducted without wisdom we cannot attribute so much to the power of faction at the expense of human nature as to suppose that a combination of men few in number not considerable in rank of no natural hereditary dependencies of talents which however respectable appear to be no way uncommonly imposing should by the efforts of their policy alone be able to bring the people of your american dominions into the disposition which has produced the present troubles we cannot conceive that without some powerful concurring cause any management should prevail on some millions of people dispersed over a whole continent in thirteen provinces not only unconnected but in many particulars of religion manners government and local interest totally different and adverse voluntarily to submit themselves to a suspension of all the profits of industry and all the comforts of civil life added to all the evils of an unequal war carried on with circumstances of the greatest asperity and rigor this sire could never have happened but from a general sense of some grievance so radical in its nature and so spreading in its effects as to poison all the ordinary satisfactions of life to dislocate the frame of society and to convert into fear and hatred that habitual reverence ever paid by mankind to an ancient and venerable government  that grievance is as simple in its nature and as level to the most ordinary understanding as it is powerful in affecting the most languid passions it is an attempt made to dispose of the whole property of a whole people without their consent  having depreciated this scheme set up in direct opposition to the rooted and inveterate prejudices of the whole people of america they proceed to the following reflections highly worthy the consideration of every statesman  the sense of a whole people most gracious sovereign never ought to be contemned by wise and beneficent rulers whatever may be the abstract claims or even rights of the supreme power we have been too early instructed and too long habituated to believe that the only firm seat of all authority is in the minds affections and interests of the people to change our sentiments for the convenience of a temporary arrangement of state it is not consistent with equity or wisdom to set at defiance the general feelings of great communities and all the orders which compose them much power is tolerated and passes unquestioned where much is yielded to opinion all is disputed where every thing is enforced this is the tenet we hold on the duty and policy of conforming to the prejudices of a whole people even where the foundation of such prejudices may be false or disputable but permit us to lay at your majestys feet our deliberate judgment on the real merits of that principle the violation of which is the known ground and origin of these troubles we assure your majesty that on our parts we should think ourselves unworthy of life which we only value for the means of spending it in honor and virtue if we ever submitted to taxes to which we did not consent either directly or by a representation satisfactory to the body of the people and we add sire that if fortune instead of blessing us with a situation where we may have daily access to the propitious presence of a gracious prince had fixed us in settlements on the remotest part of the globe we must carry these sentiments with us as part of our being persded that the distance of situation would only render this privilege the more necessary in the disposal of property abuses of subordinate authority increase and all means of redress lessen as the distance of the subject removes him from the seat of the supreme power what in those circumstances can save him from the last extremes of indignity and oppression but something left in his own hands which may enable him to conciliate the favor and control the excesses of government when no means are possessed of power to awe or to oblige the strongest ties which connect mankind in every relation social and civil and which teach them mutually to respect each other are broken independency from that moment virtually exists its formal declaration will quickly follow such must be our feelings for ourselves we are not in possession of another rule for our brethren when the late attempt practically to annihilate that privilege was made great disorders and tumults very unhappily and very naturally arose from it in this state of things we were of opinion that satisfaction ought instantly to be given or that at least the punishment of the disorder ought to be attended with the redress of the grievance  because whenever a disorder arises from and is directly connected with a grievance to confine ourselves to the punishment of the disorder is to declare against the reason and justice of the complaint  having recapitulated the instruments which ministers employed in their unfortunate plan recourse was had to force and we saw a force say they sent out enough to menace liberty but not to awe resistance tending to bring odium on the civil power and contempt on the military at once to provoke and encourage resistance  this mode of proceeding by harsh laws and feeble armies could not be defended on the principle of mercy and forbearance for mercy as we conceive consists not in the weakness of the means but in the benignity of the ends we apprehend that mild measures may be powerfully enforced and that acts of extreme rigor and injustice may be attended with as much feebleness in the execution as severity in the formation  the concluding part of this address cannot be too highly esteemed by every lover of his king and country particularly the following passages  we deprecate the effect of the doctrines which must support and countenance the government over conquered englishmen it will be impossible long to resist the powerful and equitable arguments in favor of the freedom of these unhappy people to be drawn from the principle of our own liberty attempts will be made attempts have been made to ridicule and to argue away this principle and to inculcate into the minds of your people other maxims of government and other grounds of obedience than those which have prevailed at and since the glorious revolution by degrees these doctrines by being convenient may grow prevalent the consequence is not certain but a general change of principles rarely happens among a people without leading to a change of government  sire your throne cannot stand secure upon the principles of unconditional submission or passive obedience on powers exercised without the concurrence of the people to be governed on acts made in defiance of their prejudices and habits on acquiescence procured by foreign mercenary troops and secured by standing armies these may possibly be the foundation of other thrones they must be the subversion of yours  it was not to passive principles in our ancestors that we owe the honor of appearing before a sovereign who cannot feel that he is a prince without knowing that we ought to be free the revolution is a departure from the ancient course of the descent of this monarchy the people reentered into their original rights and it was not because a positive law authorized the act but because the freedom and safety of the subject the origin and cause of all laws required a proceeding paramount and superior to them at that evermemorable and instructive period the letter of the law was superseded in favor of the substance of liberty to the free choice therefore of the people without either king or parliament we owe that happy establishment of which both king and parliament were regenerated  from that great principle of liberty these statutes have originated which have confirmed and ratified that establishment from which your majesty derives your right to rule over us these statutes have not given us our liberties our liberties have produced them every hour of your majestys reign your title stands upon the very same foundation on which it was at first laid and we do not know a better on which it can possibly be placed convinced that you cannot have different rights and a different security in different parts of your dominions we wish to lay an even platform for your throne and to give it an immovable stability by laying it on the general freedom of your people and by securing equally to your majesty that confidence and affection in all parts of your dominions which makes your best security and dearest title in this chief seat of your empire  such sire being amongst us the foundation of the monarchy itself much more clearly and peculiarly is it the ground of all parliamentary power parliament is a security provided for the protection of freedom and not a subtle fiction contrived to amuse the people in its place and the authority of both houses can still less than that of the crown be supported upon different principles or different places so as to be for one part of your subjects a protector of liberty and for another a fund of despotism by which prerogative is extended by occasional powers whenever an arbitrary will finds itself streightened by the restrictions of law  this address which may be considered as the creed of the rockingham party was not carried into effect mr burke was however determined that it should meet the public eye in some form or other he therefore transfused the spirit of it in a letter which he addressed to john far and john harris esquires sheriffs of bristol on the affairs of america in      no man but himself perhaps could have transfused that spirit with so much art for every subject seemed to be as obedient to his touch as the clay to the plastic hand of the potter in short his pen on almost every occasion may be compared to the fabled wand of the old magicians  attempts were made to drag even the private characters of those that opposed the american war through all the filth and dirt of the ministerial prints mr burke in this letter defends those that opposed those ruinous measures he conceived that it would be happy for us if the colonists were taught to believe that there was even a formed american party in england to whom they could look for support happy would it be for us if in all tempers they might turn their eyes to the parent state so that their very turbulence and sedition should find vent in no other place than this he then comes to his own defense  i am charged with being an american if warm affection toward those over whom i claim any share of authority be a crime i am guilty of this charge but i do assure you and they who know me publicly and privately well bear witness to me that if ever one man lived more zealous than another for the supremacy of parliament and the rights of this imperial crown it was myself many others indeed might be more knowing in the extent of the foundation of these rights i do not pretend to be an antiquary a lawyer or qualified for the chair of professor in metaphysics i never ventured to put your solid interests upon speculative grounds my having constantly declined to do so has been attributed to my incapacity for such disquisitions and i am inclined to believe it is partly the cause i never shall be ashamed to confess that where i am ignorant i am diffident i am indeed not very solicitous to clear myself of this imputed incapacity because men even less conversant than i am in this kind of subtleties and placed in stations to which i ought not to aspire have by the mere force of civil discretion often conducted the affairs of great nations with distinguished felicity and glory  having given his opinion on the then state of public affairs i feel warmly said he on this subject and express myself as i feel i am too old too stiff in my inveterate partialities to be ready at all the fashionable evolutions of opinion i scarce know how to adapt my mind to the feelings with which the court gazettes mean to impress the people it is not instantly that i can be brought to rejoice when i hear of the slaughter and captivity of long lists of those names which have been familiar to my ears from my infancy and to rejoice that they have fallen under the sword of strangers whose barbarous appellations i scarcely know how to pronounce the glory acquired at the white plains by colonel roaille has no charms for me and i fairly acknowledge that i have not yet learned to delight in finding fort kniphausen in the heart of the british dominions in other instances as often as he touched on german mercenaries his warmth kindled into indignation his passions flew to arms and in the conflict it was seldom that the petty princes of germany themselves escaped with a string of epithets as long as their titles  toward the conclusion of this letter the writer combats with great force and eloquence the doctrine which every venal minister has endeavored to disseminate namely that every man has his price that the reader may judge for himself we shall lay an extract of the passage before him  the common cant is no justification for taking this party his own i have been deceived say they by titius and maevius i have been the dupe of this pretender or of that mountebank and i can trust appearances no longer but my credulity and want of discernment cannot as i conceive amount to a fair presumption against any mans integrity a conscientious person would rather doubt his own judgment than condemn his species he would say i have observed without attention or judged upon erroneous maxims i trusted to profession when i ought to have attended to conduct such a man will grow wise not malignant by his acquaintance with the world but he that accuses all mankind of corruption ought to remember that he is sure to convict only one in truth i should rather admit those whom at any time i have disrelished the most to be patterns of perfection than seek a consolation to my own unworthiness in a general communion of depravity with all about me  that this illnatured doctrine should be preached by the missionaries of a court i do not wonder it answers their purpose but that it should be heard among those who pretend to be strong asserters of liberty is not only surprising but hardly natural this moral levelling is a servile principle it leads to practical passive obedience far better than all the doctrines which the pliant accommodation of theology to power has ever produced  this letter found a ready reception with those who were already disposed to subscribe to the contents of it they did not fail to magnify it as a piece of sound political reasoning and manly sense  it was read with great avidity by all parties lord abingdon published some animadversions on it mr burke did not reply he left the public to judge  and his lordship did not appear to be highly pleased with the sentence  an increase of the civil list was the next question agitated in the commons this proposition underwent a warm discussion  it was however at length carried and when the speaker sir fletcher norton presented the bill at the bar of the house of lords he addressed the throne in the following speech   most gracious sovereign the bill which it is now my duty to present to your majesty is entitled an act for the better support of his majestys household and of the honor and dignity of the crown of great britain to which your commons humbly beg your royal assent  by this bill sir and the circumstances which preceded and accompanied it your faithful commons have given their fullest proofs and assurances to your majesty for in a time of public distress full of difficulty and danger your constituents laboring under burdens almost too heavy to be borne they have not only granted to your majesty a large present supply but also a very great additional revenue great beyond example great beyond your majestys highest expense but all this they have done in a wellgrounded confidence that you will apply wisely what they have granted so liberally and feeling what every good subject must feel that the affluence and grandeur of the crown will reflect honor and dignity upon the people  on the return of the speaker he received the thanks of the house for his speech and it was ordered to be printed mr burke speaking of it to a friend said that the constitutional sentiments which it contained were only equalled by the dignity of the manner in which they were delivered  hitherto mr burke had lived in the warmest friendship with the majority of his constituents they approved his parliamentary conduct and this if we may trust his own words was the highest meed he looked for but a period was now at hand that was to put that mutual friendship to trial he had taken a decided part in the support of two bills relative to the trade of ireland in      the truth is he only attempted to awaken the long neglected irish harp every string of which had been once in tune sir john davis mentions the prosperous state of ireland in his days which he ascribed to the encouragement given to the maritime towns and cities as well to increase the trade of merchandise as to cherish mechanical arts and the consequence of which was says he that the strings or the irish harps were all in tune  not at the expense of the british lyre but that the notes of both might flow into all the concord of sweet sounds and that the hearts of both nations might dance to the music but his endeavors were not taken in this point of view the result of which was that he wrote a letter to samuel span esquire master of the society of merchants adventurers of bristol in which he vindicated his conduct and pointed out the advantages that his constituents would reap from the adoption of even a more liberal system of commerce and that under this conviction he had given it all the support in his power the language was plain he knew that he was addressing it to a body of men the major part of whom did not place so high a value upon tropes and figures as they did upon the shining toys and trinkets which they exported to the coasts of africa  mr burke saw that america was on the verge of being lost and he wished to find an america nearer home he describes the state of england at that period in these lines   perhaps gentlemen are not yet fully aware of the situation of their country and what its exigencies absolutely require i find that we are still disposed to talk at our ease and as if all things were to be regulated by our good pleasure i should consider it as a fatal symptom if in our present distressed and adverse circumstances we should persist in the errors which are natural only to prosperity one cannot indeed sufficiently lament the continuance of that spirit of delusion by which for a long time past we have thought fit to measure our necessities by our inclinations moderation prudence and equity are far more suitable to our condition than lostiness and confidence and rigor we are threatened by enemies of no small magnitude whom if we think fit we may despise as we have despised others but they are enemies who can only cease to be truly formidable by our entertaining a due respect for their power our danger will not be lessened by our shutting our eyes to it nor will our force abroad be increased by rendering ourselves feeble and divided at home  there is a dreadful schism in the british nation since we are not able to reunite the empire it is our business to give all possible vigor and soundness to those parts of it which are still content to be governed by our councils sir it is proper to inform you that our measures must be healing such a degree of strength must be communicated to all the members of the state as may enable them to defend themselves and to cooperate in the defense of the whole their temper too must be managed and their good affections cultivated they may then be disposed to bear the load with cheerfulness as a contribution toward what may be called with truth and propriety and not by an empty form of words a common cause  having lamented that his conduct had given his constituents any uneasiness he declares that he would much rather run the risque of displeasing than injuring them if i am driven says he to make such an option you obligingly lament that you are not to have me for your advocate but if i had been capable of acting as an advocate in opposition to a plan so perfectly consonant to my known principles and to the opinions i had publicly declared on an hundred occasions i should only disgrace myself without supporting with the smallest degree of credit or effect the cause you wished me to undertake i should have lost the only thing which can make such abilities as mine of any use to the world now or hereafter i mean that authority which is derived from an opinion that a member speaks the language of truth and sincerity and that he is not ready to take up or lay down a great political system for the convenience of the hour that he is in parliament to support his opinion of the public good and does not form his opinion in order to get into parliament or to continue in it it is in a great measure for your sake that i wish to preserve this character without it i am sure i should be ill able to discharge by any service the smallest part of that debt of gratitude and affection which i owe you for the great and honorable trust you have reposed in me  he seems not to have been a little hurt at the reception which his conduct met amongst even some of his best friends in bristol as in a conversation a short time after on the mercantile interest he exclaimed dont talk to me of a merchant merchants are the same in every part of the world  his god his gold his invoice his country his ledger hs bible his desk his altar his church the exchange and he has faith in none but his banker  when mr burke found that ministers were determined to persevere in one of the most disastrous wars in which this country was ever engaged and that the people began to bend beneath the weight of taxes he resolved to see if it was possible to render the public any service it struck him that there was one path in which he might move with some degree of success and that was economy he had attempted it before and failed but he was determined to return to the attack with additional force the minister saw that it was a popular measure and capable of great modification accordingly on the   th of february    0 he brought in a bill for the regulation of his majestys civil establishments and of certain public offices for the limitations of pensions and the suppression of sundry useless expensive and inconvenient places and for applying the moneys saved thereby to the public service this bill was not so formidable in its contents as in its title and the honorable mover took care to soften the rigid features of it in a speech of considerable length lord north received it with great seeming cordiality he assured the house that no member in it was more zealous for the establishment of a permanent system of economy than himself but as among the various subjects treated of some of them respected the kings patrimonial income he thought the crown ought to be consulted before the bill was admitted colonel bar passed the highest encomiums on the ability assiduity extensive knowledge and comprehensive genius of his honorable friend mr burke the late lord george gordon thought the house ought not to entertain it and though he stood alone divided the house upon it mr burke hailed this as a lucky omen but was prudent enough to keep within the limits which he had prescribed to himself in the outset it was not his intention even to attempt to cleanse the augean stable or to pluck up corruption by the root that very corruption which he himself called the dryrot of the constitution  the subject was apparently barren and it was not expected that even mr burke could enliven it but the house was very agreeably disappointed  in his hand it became so fertile that to continue the metaphor it shot in many places into luxuriancy in the course of his speech it was necessary that he should point out the use and abuse of certain offices this was a point of great personal delicacy in which he was very successful speaking of the necessity of the proposed measure his words are worthy of remembrance there is a time said he when men will not suffer bad things because their ancestors have suffered worse there is a time when the hoary head of inveterate abuse will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection  the king of france at that time had seriously turned his attention to a reform in the finances of his country joined to a reform in his court by the edict of the king of france registered the   th of august four hundred and six places in this court were suppressed mr burke took notice of this and descanted on it in the following strain the minister neckar who does these things is a great man  but the king who desires that they should be done is a far greater we must do justice to our enemies  these are the acts of a patriot king i am not in dread of the vast armies of france i am not in dread of the gallant spirit of its brave and numerous nobility i am not alarmed even at the great navy which has been so miraculously created all these things louis the fourteenth had before with all these things the french monarchy has more than once fallen prostrate at the feet of the public faith of great britain it was the want of public credit which disabled france from recovering after her defeats or recovering even from her victories and triumphs it was a prodigal court it was an illordered revenue that sapped the foundations of all her greatness credit cannot exist under the arm of necessity necessity strikes at credit i allow with a heavier and quicker blow under an arbitrary monarchy than under a limited and balanced government but still necessity and credit are natural enemies and cannot be long reconciled in any situation  from necessity and corruption a free state may lose the spirit of that complex constitution which is the foundation of confidence on the other hand i am far from being sure that a monarchy when once it is properly regulated may not for a long time furnish a foundation for credit upon the solidity of its maxims though it affords no ground of trust in its institutions i am afraid i see in england and in france something like a beginning of both these things i wish i may be found in a mistake  there are many passages in this speech highly worthy the attention of the patriotic statesman as long as economy is to be considered what it has been found  the best mine in every nation gravity and gaiety perhaps were never more happily united in any speech or composition the revenue adventures of knight probert see p     and the mutiny of the household troops see p     are specimens of the latter the first is written in all the spirit of romance and the second threw the house into frequent bursts of laughter which induced lord north to whisper that such was the versality of mr burkes powers that if he were to speak of an old almanac he could set all the planets in the same humourous commotion having unfolded part of his plan he called on the house to do him justice if it did not tend to abolish offices more expensive than useful to combine duties improperly separated to change revenues more vexatious than productive into ready money to suppress offices which stood in the way of economy and to cut off lurking subordinate treasurers mr burke in a letter to a noble lord in      speaks of this measure thus my oeconomical reforms were not the suppression of a paltry pension or employment more or less economy in my plan was as it ought to be secondary subordinate instrumental i acted on state principles i found a great distemper in the commonwealth and according to the nature of the evil and the object i treated it the malady was deep it was complicated in the causes and in the symptoms throughout it was full of contraindicants on one hand government daily growing more invidious for an apparent increase of the means of strength was every day growing more contemptible by real weakness nor was this dissolution confined to government commonly so called it extended to parliament which was losing not a little in it is dignity and estimation by an opinion of it is not acting on worthy motives  a complaint was made of too much influence in the house of commons i reduced it in both houses and i gave my reasons article by article for every reduction and showed why i thought it safe for the service of the state i heaved the lead every inch of way i made  the parliament was suddenly dissolved on the first of september    0 mr burke had now faithfully served his constituents six years  yet strange as it may appear when the fame of his integrity and his talents went hand in hand and was daily increasing that his popularity should be on the decline in bristol and it is probable that he would not have offered himself a second time to the choice of the electors of that city if it were not out of respect to many worthy characters amongst the quakers and dissenters in it who promised him their support and acted up to their promise he accordingly appeared on the hustings at guildhall in bristol with all the openness and becoming confidence of a man who was conscious that he had discharged his duty the meeting was uncommonly numerous on that occasion three candidates offered themselves at the same time mr burke in his turn addressed the audience in a speech replete with arguments conveyed in the most eloquent language in which he defended his parliamentary conduct if you call upon me said he i shall solicit the favor of the city upon manly ground i come before you with the plain confidence of an honest servant in the equity of a candid and discerning master i come to claim your approbation not to amuse you with vain apologies or with professions still more vain and senseless i have lived too long to be served by apologies or to stand in need of them the part i have acted has been in open day and to hold out to a conduct which stands in that clear and steady light for all its good and all its evil to hold out to that conduct the paltry winking tapers of excuses and promises  i never will do it  they may obscure it with their smoke but they never can illumine sunshine by such a flame as theirs  one of the charges exhibited against him was the part which he took in lord beauchamps bill for reforming the law process for imprisonment for debt  see act of grace page   the next was his concurrence in the repeal of certain penal laws against the roman catholics his defense on this head was grounded on the laws of humanity the soundest maxims of policy and justice and on these points perhaps no man ever shone to such advantage he wanted to snatch the firebrand out of the hand of the furious zealot to extinguish it for ever and to show that the weapons of superstition and ignorance were not to be numbered with the celestial arms of religion and that notwithstanding various paths led to her peaceful abode yet they all united in the center like the rays of glory that play round her head  the part which he took relative to the trade of ireland gave offense all commercial maxims are selfish and narrow he did not wish to see the noble tide of british trade slumber on oozy beds or creep through crooked channels he wished to see it flow as bountifully as the ocean itself so that the sister kingdoms might mutually partake of its blessings he was also charged with having voted contrary to the instructions of his constituents this was a ground on which he defended himself with uncommon address he said he knew that he had been chosen in his place along with others to be a pillar of the state and not a weathercock on the top of the edifice exalted for his levity and versatility and of no use but to indicate the shiftings of every fashionable gale a similar charge was exhibited against thomas bourn esquire member of the american convention in consequence of which he addressed his constituents in these words fellow townsmen the line of conduct which has appeared to me right i have ever wished to pursue in the decline of life when a few revolving suns at most will bring me to the bar of impartial justice i am unwilling to adopt a different and less honest mode of acting it is true my sentiments at present are not in favor of the constitution american open however to conviction they may be very different when the subject is fairly discussed by able and upright men to place myself in a situation where conviction could only be followed by a bigoted persistance in error would be extremely disagreeable to me under the restrictions with which our delegates are fettered the greatest idiot may answer your purposes as well as the greatest man the suffrages of our fellow men when they neither mpose confidence in our integrity nor pay a tribute of respect to our abilities can never be agreeable i am therefore induced positively to decline accepting a seat in the convention whilst i sincerely wish you gentlemen and my countrymen every blessing which a wise and virtuous administration of a free government can secure   the picture which he drew of an informer in this speech  see page     is very highly finished at the same instant that we are disgusted with the subject we are obliged to admire the pencil dean swift in his excellent sermon on false witnesses says i number in this class all those who make a trade of being informers in hope of favor and reward and to this end employ their time either by listening in public places to catch up an accidental word or in corrupting mens servants to discover any unwary expression of their master or thrusting themselves into company and then using the most indecent scurrilous language fastening a thousand falsehoods and scandals upon a whole party on purpose to provoke such an answer as they may turn to their accusation  and truly their ungodly race is said to be grown so numerous that men of different principles can hardly converse together with any security nor is it any wonder at all that their trade of informing should be now in a flourishing condition since our case is manifestly thus we are divided into two parties with very little charity or temper toward each other the prevailing side may talk of things as they please with security and generally do it in the most provoking words they can invent while those who are down are sometimes tempted to speak in favor of a lost cause and therefore without great caution must needs be often caught tripping and thereby furnish plenty of materials for informers    this speech was very warmly received even by those whose mental eyes were too weak to bear the light of conviction  almost every thing perhaps that fell from his lips or his pen on this occasion are worthy of being preserved as mixed with his feelings or dictated by his opinions soon after his arrival in bristol the following address appeared in the public prints   to the gentlemen clergy freeholders and freemen of the city of bristol gentlemen my general conduct in parliament and my humble endeavors to serve the city and the citizens of bristol in these particular affairs having been honored by the unanimous approbation of a very large and very respectable meeting at guildhall this day in conformity with the desire of that meeting and under the sanction of their weighty authority i beg leave to renew to you my humble solicitation for your votes at this election and the favor of your early appearance at the poll on friday next and if i have the honor of being again chosen to represent you i trust that i shall not show myself less deserving of your favor than formerly or less sincerely grateful for it  i have the honor to be with the most perfect respect and esteem gentlemen your most obedient and most obliged servant  edmund burke bristol sept      0 such is the fluctuation of public opinion that mr burke felt himself under the necessity of soliciting many who had formerly solicited him he canvassed in person but there was nothing mean or unmanly either in his words or in his manner and notwithstanding the spirit of party ran high in the city yet it never found its way into the denials which he received or rather the apologies for many of them were conveyed in that language which as he said himself added to the regret notwithstanding all his exertions and the exertions of his friends he found there was little prospect of success which induced him to address the electors in the following speech  gentlemen i decline the election  it has ever been my rule through life to observe a proportion between my efforts and my objects i have never been remarkable for a bold active and sanguine pursuit of advantages that are personal to myself  i have not canvassed the whole of this city in form but i have taken such a view of it as satisfies my own mind that your choice will not ultimately fall upon me your city gentlemen is in a state of miserable distraction and i am resolved to withdraw whatever share my pretensions may have had in its unhappy divisions i have not been in haste i have tried all prudent means i have waited for the effect of all contingencies if i were fond of a contest by the partiality of my numerous friends whom ye know to be among the most weighty and respectable people of the city i have the means of a sharp one in my hands but i thought it far better with my strength unspent and my reputation unimpaired to do early and from foresight that which i might be obliged to do from necessity at last  i am not in the least surprised nor in the least angry at this view of things i have read the book of life for a long time and i have read other books a little nothing has happened to me but what has happened to men much better than me and in times and in nations full as good as the age and country we live in to say that i am no way concerned would be neither decent nor true the representation of bristol was an object on many accounts dear to me and i certainly should very far prefer it to any other in the kingdom my habits are made to it and it is in general more unpleasant to be rejected after long trial than not to be chosen at all  but gentlemen i will see nothing except your former kindness and i will give way to no other sentiments than those of gratitude from the bottom of my heart i thank you for what you have done for me you have given me a long term which is now expired i have performed the conditions and enjoyed all the profits to the full and i now surrender your estate into your hands without being in a single tile or a single stone impaired or wasted by my use i have served the public for fifteen years i have served you in particular for six what is passed is well stored it is safe and out of the power of fortune what is to come is in wiser hands than ours and he in whose hands it is best knows whether it is best for you and me that i should be in parliament or even in the world  gentlemen the melancholy event of yesterday the death of r coombe esquire who intended to offer himself a candidate for bristol reads to us an awful lesson against being too much troubled about any of the objects of ordinary ambition the worthy gentleman who has been snatched from us at the moment of the election and in the middle of the contest whilst his desires were as warm and his hopes as eager as ours has feelingly told us what shadows we are and what shadows we pursue  it has been usual for a candidate who declines to take his leave by a letter to the sheriffs but i received your trust in the face of day and in the face of day i accept your dismission i am not  i am not at all ashamed to look upon you nor can my presence discompose the order of business here i humbly and respectfully take my leave of the sheriffs the candidates and the electors wishing heartily that the choice may be for the best at a time which calls if ever time did call for service that is not nominal it is no plaything you are about i tremble when i consider the trust i have presumed to ask i confided perhaps too much in my intentions they were really fair and upright and i am bold to say that i ask no ill thing for you when on parting from this place i pray that whoever you choose to succeed me may resemble me exactly in all things except in my abilities to serve and my fortune to please you  hope at length sunk into resignation and mr burke declined the poll with the following address  to the gentlemen clergy freeholders and freemen of the city of bristol bristol sept      0 gentlemen a very large and respectable meeting of the principal citizens of bristol did by an unanimous vote authorize me to offer myself once more to your service my deference to that authority was the sole motive for giving you one moments trouble on my canvass so far as it has proceeded i have found that my pretensions were well received and even with a degree of warmth in many of the electors  but on a calm and very deliberate view of the state of the city i am convinced that no other consequence can be reasonably expected from my continuing a candidate than a long vexatious and expensive contest conscious that no difference between my service and that of any other man can be worth the inconveniences of such a struggle i decline the election  i return you my best thanks for having at any time or for any period condescended to think of me for your representative i have done my duty toward you and toward the nation as became me you dispose of the future trust as you have a right to do according to your discretion we have no cause of complaint on either side by being returned into the mass of private citizens my burdens are lessened my satisfactions are not destroyed these are duties to be performed and there are comforts to be enjoyed in obscurity for which i am not without a disposition or relish i am sure there is nothing in the retrospect of my public conduct which is likely to disturb the tranquillity of that situation to which you restore me  i have the honor to be with the utmost possible respect gentlemen your much obliged and most obedient humble servant  edmund burke  obscurity and retirement are favorite expressions on the lips of every great man but if mr burke thought that he was sufficiently prepared to throw himself into the arms of one or the other he seems to have been little acquainted with his own heart most of those whom he wished to please were still alive the circle of his friends was hourly expanding and it would have exhibited rather a kind of peevishness and ill humor to throw down his sword and buckler because he had lost one engagement when others of more importance remained to be contended in his friends exerted every nerve in support of his cause or rather their own and were determined to dispute every inch of ground to the last but he did not wish to put them to that trouble  he declined  and retired amidst the plaudits of even those who had not voted for him and though he lost the election it may be fairly said that he gained the victory  having made his election for malton he continued to attack ministers sometimes with a grossness of language which many of his friends reprobated and which lord north used to call the lava of mr burkes eloquence  much about this time the necessity of a parliamentary reform was contended for as essential to the salvation of the constitution a committee was appointed in yorkshire in order to take this important subject into consideration a similar committee was about to be appointed for the same purpose in buckinghamshire mr burke addressed a letter to a gentleman of that county in which he gave his opinion on this weighty matter the following extracts are taken from it  the country will in some way or other be called upon to declare it your opinion that the house of commons is not sufficiently numerous and that the elections are not sufficiently frequent that an hundred new knights of the shire ought to be added and that we are to have a new election once in three years for certain and as much oftener as the king pleases such will be the state of things if the propositions made shall take effect  all this may be proper but as an honest man i cannot possibly give my vote for it until i have considered it more fully i will not deny that our constitution may have faults and that those faults when found ought to be corrected it is not every thing which appears at first view to be faulty in such a very complicated plan as our constitution to enable us to correct the constitution the whole constitution must be viewed together and it must be compared with the actual constitution of the people and the circumstances of the time for that which taken singly and by itself may appear to be wrong when considered with relation to other things may be perfectly right or at least such as ought to be patiently endured as the means of preventing something that is much worse so far with regard to what at first view may appear a distemper in the constitution as to the remedy of that distemper an equal caution ought to be used because this latter consideration is not single and separate no more than the former there are many things in reformation which would be proper to be done if other things can be done along with them but which if they cannot be so accompanied ought not to be done at all i therefore wish when any deep matter of this new nature is proposed to me to have the whole scheme distinctly in my view and full time to consider of it please god i will walk with caution whenever i am not able to see my way clearly before me  i am now growing old i have from very early youth been conversant in reading and thinking upon the subjects of our laws and constitution as well upon those of other times and other countries i have been for fifteen years a very laborious member of parliament and in that time have had great opportunities of seeing with my own eyes the working of the machine of our government of remarking where it went smoothly and did its business and where it checked in its movements or where it damaged its work i have also had and used the opportunities of conversing with men of the greatest wisdom and fullest experience in these matters and i do declare to you most solemnly and most truly that on the result of all this reading thinking experience and communication i am not able to come to an immediate resolution in savor of a change in the groundwork of our constitution and in particular that in the present state of the country in the present state of our representation in the present state of our modes and rights of electing in the present state of the several prevalent interests in the present state of the affairs and manners of this country i am not able to vote that the addition of the hundred knights of the shire and the hurrying of election on election will be things advantageous either to liberty or to good government  i most heartily wish that the deliberative sense of the kingdom on this great subject should be known when it is known it must be prevalent it would be dreadful indeed if there were any power in the nation capable of resisting its unanimous desire or even the desire of any great or very decided majority of the people the people may be deceived in their choice of an object but i can scarcely conceive that any choice they can make to be so very mischievous as the existence of any human force capable of resisting it it will certainly be the duty of every man in the situation to which god has called him to give his best opinion and advice upon the matter it will not be his duty let him think what he will to use any violent or fraudulent means of counteracting the general wish or even of employing the legal and constructive organ of expressing the peoples sense against the sense which they so actually entertained  toward the conclusion of the year      mr burke and several characters in the nation preeminently distinguished by their rank and patriotism their riches and their influence were applied to from a quarter where the sources of a secret and important intelligence were as indubitable as the readiness to communicate it was fervent and unsullied a variety of delicate circumstances of which not the least cogent is the present existence of several of the illustrious parties concerned forbids us to expatiate on the subject whilst we lament that we are compelled to allude to it in an exceedingly abridged statement representations had been made which had they been followed up with unanimous energy and perseverance would in all probability have prevented the dismemberment of america from great britain what were the answers of other individuals to an awful and pressing requisition must be passed over we can almost verbally affirm that the delivered opinion of mr burke was that he did not entertain the least doubt of the truth of the information but that all his endeavors in consequence of it would prove fruitless because the administration explicitly manifested a rivetted determination to pursue the same measures until they should become quite annihilated by their positive inability to continue the war against the colonies  on the   th of march      lord north assured the house on authority that the present administration was no more and that for the purpose of giving the necessary time for new arrangements he moved an adjournment which was instantly agreed to the arrangements were as follow the marquis of rockingham first lord of the treasury the earl of shelburne and mr fox joint secretaries of state lord camden president of the council duke of grafton privy seal lord john cavendish chancellor of the exchequer mr burke paymastergeneral of the forces  a few days after mr burke was made a privy counselor  the dawn of the new administration promised a refulgent day the leading members of it had pledged themselves to many regulations and reforms which they began to carry into execution as soon as the parliament met with a degree of alacrity and liberality unknown in the parliamentary history of this country the integrity and judgment of the marquis of rockingham justly exalted him in the opinion of the nation but at the very instant that his bleeding country leaned on his honest heart it pleased the king of kings to call him to himself this illustrious patriot expired on the first of july      of a complaint with which he had been long afflicted  the hydrothorax and which had latterly very much increased from his unremitting attention to public business his loss was felt and deplored by the whole nation mr burke drew his character when living  see page     and little did he think perhaps at the time that he should be so soon called on to pay the last sad tribute to his memory which he did in the following inscription for the mausoleum erected in wentworth park and in which earl fitzwilliam has also placed a bust of the writer of it  charles marquis of rockingham a statesman in whom constancy fidelity sincerity and directness were the sole instruments of his policy his virtues were his arts  a clear sound unadulterated sense not perplexed with intricate design or disturbed by ungoverned passion gave consistency dignity and effect to all his measures in opposition he respected the principles of government in administration he provided for the liberties of the people he employed his moments of power in realizing every thing which he had proposed in a popular situation this was the distinguishing mark of his conduct after twentyfour years of service to the public in a critical and trying time he left no debt of just expectation unsatisfied  by his prudence and patience he brought together a party which it was the great object of his labors to render permanent not as an instrument of ambition but as a living depository of principle  the virtues of his public and private life were not in him of different characters it was the same feeling benevolent liberal mind which in the internal relations of life conciliated the unfeigned love of those who see men as they are which made him an inflexible patriot he was devoted to the cause of liberty not because he was haughty and untractable but because he was beneficent and humane  let his successors who from this house behold this monument reflect that their conduct will make it their glory or their reproach let them be persuaded that similarity of manners not proximity of blood gives them an interest in this statue  remember resemble persevere on the death of lord rockingham lord shelburne now marquis of landsdowne was appointed first lord commissioner of the treasury and this giving umbrage to the rockingham part of the cabinet who states that by this change the measures of the former administration would be broken in upon mr fox lord john cavendish mr burke and others resigned their respective offices when mr pit succeeded lord john cavendish as chancellor of the exchequer the present lord sydney mr fox as secretary of state and colonel bar mr burke as paymastergeneral of the forces  by this change mr burke fell once more into the ranks of opposition and continued so till after the peace of      we have now followed mr burke to this period and it was easy and pleasant to follow him as the road was direct and he was always found in the middle of it and though there were alluring prospects on either side he was never known to be drawn aside from the rugged path of virtue and integrity  he had traveled this road many years and was never known to faint or lag in the dreary journey with many companions it is true rich in worth rich in wealth but mr burke was only rich in fame and he had a son the center of his affections mr burke at that period shone to the highest advantage in every point of view even the shades of his character served to embody the lights  he censures god who quarrels with the imperfections of man he had lost his leading star in his patron and thus for a moment bewildered he fell into the coalition so often reprobated by members of a more extraordinary one the result of this junction of parties was that the duke of portland was placed at the head of the treasury lord john cavendish resumed his office as chancellor of the exchequer lord north and mr fox were appointed secretaries of state mr sheridan secretary to the treasury and mr burke paymastergeneral of the forces  on the   th of november      mr fox moved for leave to bring in his east india bill leave was given and on the first of december following when the question was put that the speaker do now leave the chair after some opposition to it mr burke rose and defended the principles of the bill in a speech in which it may almost be said that he surpassed himself in brilliancy of language and richness of argument it would not fall short of a comparison with india itself  such dominion of mind such grasp of thought  such powers of description  and so intimate a knowledge of the subject that every scene seemed to be the effect of magic instead of oratory the peroration is the finest in any language for it was the character of his friend mr fox  see page      warm from the soul and faithful to its fires   in the discussion of this bill mr burke noticed particularly a phrase that had frequently been employed by mr w pit with a view of exciting odium against the bill and its promoters viz the chartered rights of men the phrase he observed was full of affectation and ambiguity the rights of men that is the natural rights of mankind he said were sacred things and if any public measure was sound mischievously to affect them that circumstance ought to be an objection fatal to the measure but that was not the case here the rights the india companys charters communicated to speak of them in terms of the greatest possible moderation did at least suspend the natural rights of mankind and were liable to fall into a direct violation of them and it was the absolute duty of parliament he added to guard against such violation a new arrangement of ministers took place in      when mr w pit was appointed first lord of the treasury  the next subject of importance that occupied the parliamentary attention of mr burke was the impeachment of mr hastings on the   th of february      mr burke opened the accusation i am told said he that the step i am now about to take is not likely to be a pleasing one to the public and that the good people of england wish that their old and popular member would decline it but there is a sentence in the best book which tingles in my ear  happy are ye when men shall revile you and speak lightly of you for my sake  this speech was very long but he had the happy art of rendering it interesting had mr hastings said he taught the pyramid to seek the sky had he conducted the plough into the desolate bosom of the valley reined the proud arch over the foaming flood sent the sluggard to the ant the politician to the be and the plunderer to prison i should be readier to applaud him than i am to accuse him but instead of that he banished science from her natal seat the native princes were packed up in prisons like bales of muslin and left to feed on the vapors of a gaol even deprived of opium to lull their senses into forgetfulness the plough was arrested in its shining career and wherever he trod he marked his footsteps in blood and devastation after this he proceeded to a description of the province of oude the paradise of the ancients and having depicted the beauty and natural fertility of that country in all the glow of a youthful poet he adverted to the unhappy state of the zemindars and the conduct of mr hastings to the rohillas those who heard this speech imagined that little more could be said on the subject but what was their surprise when mr sheridan delivered his celebrated oration on summing up the begum charge on friday june        which abounded with so many beauties that to point out one in preference to the other would be to attempt to single out a star in the milky way ambitious however that some portion of it should adorn our humble page we insert the following where speaking of the calamities brought on the province of oude by the english  had a stranger at this time in      gone into the kingdom of oude ignorant of what had happened since the death of sujah dowla that man who with a savage heart had still great lines of character and who with all his ferocity in war had still with a cultivating hand preserved to his country the riches which it derived from benignant skies and a prolific soil if this stranger ignorant of all that had happened in the short interval and observing the wide and general devastation and all horrors of the scene  of plains uncloathed and brown  of vegetation burnt up and extinguished  of villages depopulated and in ruin  of temples unroofed and perishing  of reservoirs broken down and dry  he would naturally enquire what war has thus laid waste the fertile fields of this once beautiful and opulent country  what civil dissentions have happened thus to tear asunder and separate the happy societies that once possessed those villages  what disputed succession  what religious rage has with unholy violence demolished those temples and disturbed fervent but unobtruding piety in the exercises of its duties  what merciless enemy has thus spread the horrors of fire and sword  what severe visitation of providence has thus dried up the fountain and taken from the face of the earth every vestige of verdure or rather what monsters have stalked over the country tainting and poisoning with pestiferous breath what the voracious appetite could not devour to such question what must be the answer no wars have ravaged these lands and depopulated these villages  no civil discords have been felt  no disputed succession  no religious rage  no merciless enemy  no affliction of providence which while it scourged for the moment cut off the sources of resuscitation  no voracious and poisoning monsters  no all this has been accomplished by the friendship generosity and kindness of the english nation they have embraced us with their protecting arms and lo those are the fruits of their alliance what then shall we be told that under such circumstances the exasperated feelings of a whole people thus goaded and spurred on to clamor and resistance were excited by the poor and seeble influence of the begums when we hear from captain naylor the description that he gives of the paroxism fever and delirium into which despair had thrown the natives when on the banks of the polluted ganges panting for death they tore more widely open the lips of their gaping wounds to accelerate their dissolution and while their blood was issuing presented their ghastly eyes to heaven breathing their last and fervent prayer that the dry earth might not be suffered to drink their blood but that it might rise up to the throne of god and rouse the eternal providence to avenge the wrongs of their country will it be said that this was brought about by the incantations of these begums in their secluded zenana or that they could inspire this enthusiasm and this despair into the breasts of a people who felt no grievance and had suffered no torture what motive then could have such influence in their bosom what motive that which nature the common parent plants in the bosom of man and which though it may be less active in the indian than in the englishman is still congenial with and makes a part of his being  that feeling which tells him that man was never made to be the property of man but that when through pride and insolence of power one human creature dares to tyrannize over another it is a power usurped and resistance is a duty  that feeling which tells him that all power is delegated for the good not for the injury of the people and that when it is converted from the original purpose the compact is broken and the right is to be resumed  that principle which tells him that resistance to power usurped is not merely a duty which he owes to himself and to his neighbor but a duty which he owes to his god in asserting and maintaining the rank which he gave him in his creation  to that common god who where he gives the form of man whatever may be the complexion gives also the feelings and the rights of man  that principle which neither the rudeness of ignorance can stifle nor the enervation of refinement extinguish  that principle which makes it base for a man to suffer when he ought to act which tending to preserve to the species the original designations of providence spurns at the arrogant distinction of man and vindicates the independent quality of his race he said that it had been a practice with mr hastings to hold himself out as a preternatural being gifted with good fortune or else the peculiar favorite of heaven and that providence never failed to take up and carry by wife but hidden means every project of his to its destined end in this blasphemous way did the prisoner at the bar libel the course of providence thus according to him when his corruptions and bribers were on the eve of exposure providence inspired the heart of nunducomar to commit a low base crime in order to save mr hastings from ruin thus also when in his attempts on cheyt sing and his plunder of the begums providence stepped in and inspired the one with resistance and the other with rebellion to forward his purposes thus did he arrogantly hold himself forth as a man not only the favorite of providence but as one for whose sake providence departed from the eternal cause of its own wise dispensations thus did he presume to say that he was honored and assisted in the administration of office by inspiring felonies heavenborn crimes and providential treasons arraigning that providence whose works are goodness and whose ways are right  mr burkes panegyric on this speech ought not to be omitted it ran nearly as follows   he has this day surprised the thousands who hung with rapture on his accents by such an array of talents such an exhibition of capacity such a display of powers as are unparalleled in the annals of oratory a display that reflected the highest honor upon himself  luster upon letters  renown upon parliament  glory upon the country of all species of rhetoric of every kind of eloquence that has been witnessed or recorded either in ancient or modern times whatever the acuteness of the bar the dignity of the senate the solidity of the judgment seat and the sacred morality of the pulpits have hitherto furnished nothing have equalled what we have this day heard in westminster hall no holy seer of religion no statesman no orator no man of any literary description whatever has come up in the one instance to the pure sentiments of morality or in the other to that variety of knowledge force of imagination propriety and vivacity of allusion beauty and elegance of diction strength and copiousness of style pathos and sublimity of conception to which we this day listened with ardour and admiration from poetry up to eloquence there is not a species of composition of which a complete and perfect specimen might not from that single speech be called and collected  those who had never read mr burkes speeches or heard him speak before might be easily induced to suppose that he had reserved all the stores of his eloquence for the impeachment of mr hastings so that the beauties of those speeches were as countless as the beauties of the fair that assembled to listen to them in the course of one of them he styled mr hastings the commander and captain general of the enormities in india when he conferred this title on him he took care that it should not be a mere empty one he soon furnished him with abundance of troops agents etc which he marshalled and depicted in the most artful and eloquent manner having drawn the character of congo bulwant sing a secretary employed by mr hastings in the blackest colors he came to that of debi sing which he painted as one of the greatest villains that ever stained the page of history this monster or rather this collection of monsters according to mr burke raised the rents of the inhabitants he crowded the prisons with persons of all ranks and made them give bonds to what amount he pleased as the price of their liberty these bonds were put in force and their demesnes sold at one years purchase to cancel the unjust debt this was not sufficient he sold even the very ground destined for the burial of the owners and this was to them from the nature of their education and religion the most heartrending of all their losses having robbed the living of their liberty food etc and the dead even of a resting place he recollected there was another class the poor peasantry who though unable to assist in the gratification of his avarice they could still however administer to his cruelty  this inoffensive race was cruelly tortured cords were drawn tight round the fingers until the flesh of the four on each hand was actually incorporated and become one solid mass the fingers were then separated by wedges of iron and wood driven in between them others were tied two and two by the feet and thrown across a wooden bar upon which they hung with their feet uppermost they were then beat on the soals of their feet until their toenails dropped off  they were afterward beat about the head until the blood gushed out at the mouth nose and ears they were also flogged upon the naked body with bamboo canes and prickly bushes and above all with some poisonous weeds which were of a most caustic nature and burnt at every touch the cruelty of the monster who had ordered all this had contrived to tear the mind as well as body he frequently had a father and a son tied naked to one another by the feet and arms and then flogged until the skin was torn from the flesh and he had the devilish satisfaction to know that every blow must hurt for if one escaped the son his sensibility was wounded by the knowledge he had that the blow had fallen upon his father when the same torture was felt by the father then he knew that every blow that missed him had fallen upon his son  the treatment of the females could not be described dragged forth from the inmost recesses of their houses which the religion of the country had made for many sanctuaries they were exposed naked to the public view the virgins were carried to the court of justice where they might naturally have looked for protection but now they looked for it in vain for in the face of the ministers of justice in the face of the spectators in the face of the sun those tender and modest virgins were brutally violated  the only difference between their treatment and that of the mothers was that the former were dishonored in the face of day the latter in the gloomy recesses of their dungeons other females had the nipples of their breasts put in a clift of bamboo and torn off what modesty in all nations most carefully conceals this monster revealed to view and consumed by slow fires nay some of the monstrous tools of this monster debi sing had horrid to tell carried their unnatural brutality so far as to introduce death into the source of life  here mr burke dropped his head upon his hands unable to proceed so greatly was he oppressed by the horror which he felt at this relation the effect of it was visible through the whole auditory the late mrs sheridan fainted away several ladies sunk under the agitation of their feelings amongst others mrs siddons such a tragedy was never exhibited on any stage or delivered in such impassionate tones and when his tongue could no longer perform its office indignation and pity alternately spoke from his brow  notwithstanding mr burke could command all the figures of rhetoric all the flowers of fancy all the beauties of poetry all the fruits of experience all the axioms maxims authorities and quotations of ancient and modern writers yet he could not command his temper nor could he mention mr hastings name without adding some degrading epithet which he well knew he ought not to do out of respect to the court and even to himself this involved him sometimes in dilemmas which he might have easily avoided if he had followed the gentlemanlike conduct of mr fox and the rest of the managers on one of these occasions he was rebuked by a right reverend prelate on the   th of june      mr francis deended the conduct of mr burke as a manager and lamented that he who had written so much in favor of a certain class of men did not experience gentler treatment from them the scripture had said continued mr francis put not your trust in princes and if he might take the liberty he would add nor yet bishops mr burke thanked mr francis and said he never did nor would put his trust in great men nor in little men but in him that commanded him neither to trust in the one nor the other mr fox on the opening of the benares charge having occasion to mention mr burke could not be satisfied with the bare mention of a name that was so dear to him  if we are no longer in shameful ignorance of india said he if india no longer makes us blush in the eyes of europe let us know and feel our obligations to him  whose admirable resources of opinion and affection whose untiring toil sublime genius and high aspiring honor raised him up conspicuous among the most beneficent worthies of mankind  we shall not pretend to say what was the motive which induced mr burke to become the public accuser of mr hastings but his perseverance in the pursuit undoubtedly tended to increase his fame which was then on the decline and if he had abstained from all asperity of language to the accused he would have stood in a still fairer point of view with the public perhaps no man ever exhibited even in his very countenance tone and gesture a higher degree of personal triumph than he did the day after he found himself in the majority on the question of impeachment having met one of his friends he could scarce contain himself with rapture this is a proud day for england said he what a glorious prospect her justice extending to asia her humanity to africa her friendship to america and her faith and good will to all europe  the result of the impeachment is so well known and the whole of the proceedings so amply detailed in various publications that it is unnecessary to dwell any longer on the subject  in the debate on the commercial treaty with france on the   d of january      mr burke opposed it with his usual eloquence and violence mr pit he said with that narrowness which leads men of limited minds to look at great objects in a confined point of view spoke of the transaction as if it was the affair of two little comptinghouses and not of two great nations he seemed to consider it as a contention between the sign of the fleurdelis and the sign of the old red lion which should obtain the best custom  the love said he that france bears to this country has been depicted in all the glowing rant of romance nay in order to win upon our passions at the expense of our reason she has been personified  decked out in all her lilies  and endued with a heart incapable of infidelity and a tongue that seems only at a loss to convey the artless language of that heart she desires nothing more than to be in friendship with us she has stretched forth her arms to embrace us nay more she has stretched them through the sea  witness cherbourg curiosity may be indulged without danger in surveying the pyramids of egypt those monuments of human power for no human purpose would i could say the same of cherbourg we gaze at the works now carrying on in that harbor like the silly trojans who gazed at the wooden horse whose bowels teemed with their destruction  the two houses met on the   th of november      it was stated in the speech that the king of prussia had taken measures to enforce his demand of satisfaction for the insult offered to the princess of orange  mr burke took occasion to mention the kings speech which he spoke of with great humor and pleasantry he said it was usual to hold it out as a morsel of finished eloquence and as a proof of the ministers powers of composition the speech was certainly an extraordinary performance but if any man was to make it and the facts it contained the grounds of historical narrative he would certainly risque a good deal of ridicule instead of grave history it partook more of the nature of an epic poem rather resembling an agreeable allegory or a romance in the style of ancient chivalry it reminded him pretty strongly of palmeron of england don bellianis of greece and other books of that romantic nature which he formerly had lost much of his time in reading he was glad to find however that the gallantry of those kings and princes that had so eminently distinguished themselves when chivalry prevailed was revived let any gentleman examine the vein in which the speech proceeded and he would instantly perceive the strong resemblance it bore to the subjects of ancient romance a chivalrous king hearing that a princess had been affronted takes his lance assembles his knights and determines to do her justice he sets out instantly with his knights in quest of adventures and carries all before him atchieving wonders in the cause of the injured princess this reminded him of the ancient story of a princess named latona who having been insulted by a nation like the dutch appealed to jupiter for satisfaction when the god in revenge for her wrongs turned the nation that had affronted her into a nation of frogs and left them to live among dykes and waters  the house burst into a roar of laughter at the apt introduction of this old fable mr burke pursued his pleasantry with laughable comments on the speech and among others he remarked that although the king of prussia had professedly set out merely to obtain adequate satisfaction for the injury done his sister his army by accident took utrecht possessed themselves of amsterdam restored the stadtholder and the former government and all this at a stroke and by the bye which put him in mind of a verse in a sprightly song of cowleys his ballad entitled the chronicle that he often had read with pleasure but when isabella came armed with resistless flame and the artillery of her eye while she proudly marched about greater conquests to find out she beat out susan by the bye   though mr burke affected to despise popularity yet no man perhaps was ever more susceptible of flattery which he always paid in kind but a stroke of wit or a single paragraph in a newspaper were sufficient to discompose his temper particularly when he was sinking into the vale of life a few years since he happened to call on an old friend who was very fond of collecting prints of british patriots mr burke was not a little pleased to see one of himself in that list with the following rude but pointed lines written under it with a pencil which he did not immediately perceive pelliculam veterem retinet ac front polite astutam vapido servat sub pectore vulpem   the old gentleman saw by mr burkes countenance that it displeased him but protested he was wholly ignorant of the writer and that as he did not understand latin he thought the lines were filled with his praise and immediately effaced them but they had sunk too deep in mr burkes memory to be effaced he took a hasty leave and never after entered the house in the parliamentary recess of      he went to ireland accompanied by his son his arrival in that country was announced in a provincial newspaper in the following words after an absence of many years the celebrated irish orator and british member of parliament edmund burke has arrived in his native country it is not flattery to say that he is the boast of the english senate and the glory of the irish nation one of the first poets in that kingdom wrote some encomiastic verses on the occasion which mr burke repaid in prose equal in point of fancy and imagination to the tuneful effusion it was deemed a little extraordinary that the university of dublin did not then present him with the honorary degree of doctor of laws but he was never heard to acknowledge that he was highly indebted to the education which he received in that seminary having spent some months in the south of ireland he returned to england the reverend doctor campbell author of the history of ireland happened to sail in the packet with him i dont know any thing said the doctor to a friend one day that gave me so much pleasure as to find that i was to cross the irish hellespont in the company of a man of whom i had heard so much i was extremely sorry that i had not the honor of being known to any one of the passengers who could introduce me to him but it was not difficult to provoke mr burke to conversation we were in sight of the hill of howth just as the sun began to spread his beams mr burke enjoyed the beauties of the scenery even the light clouds which enveloped the top of the hill did not escape his attention i wonder said he that some of the dublin milliners do not form a headdress in imitation of those many colored clouds and call it the howthcap his conversation was rich and captivating he told me he had passed some days at lord kenmeres country seat near the lakes of killarney  that delightful spot which taste seems to have selected from all that is beautiful in the volume of nature but his description of it exceeded any thing i had ever read or heard before particularly when he touched on the flowery race good heaven how he clothed the lilly in newborn light and the rose in virgin blushes in short it may be said that he almost colored round speaking of lord charlemont he praised the gentleness of his manners and the mildness of his temper and concluded by comparing him to an old picture whose tints were mellowed by time when i talked of the state of learning in ireland he shook his head folded his arms and remained silent for a few minutes in his person he is about five feet eight inches remarkably straight for his years but his mind is more erect than his body there is a good deal of placidity in his countenance but nothing of dignity and from his nose i think that no man can sneer with more ease and effect if he chooses  a gentleman mr t  favored me some time since with the following minutes of a conversation with mr burke   december the sixth i happened to be in mr townleys study about eleven oclock mr burke and the reverend doctor king came in to view mr townleys fine collection of statues mr burke seemed highly pleased with the whole particularly that of the baian homer having paid many just compliments to the taste of the collector he entered into conversation with me in so easy and friendly a manner that if i was charmed a few minutes before with the taste and judicious reflection of the scholar i was not less delighted with the man i showed him an old manuscript copy of homer written i believe in the tenth century he read a few passages in it with the greatest fluency and criticized some of the critics who had written on the father of immortal verse he invited me to breakfast with him the next morning without so much as knowing my name i promised to do myself that honor my name is edmund burke said he just as he was going out of the door i live in gerardstreet soho i called the next morning about nine it was excessively cold i was shown into the drawing room and in a few minutes mr burke entered and shook me by the hand in the most friendly manner  mr b have you been long out of ireland sir  t some years  mr b i paid that country a visit last summer for the purpose of seeing a sister a widow mrs french i believe i had not seen it for twenty years before  t it is very much changed within the last twenty years  mr b very much for the better  t a spirit of industry has pervaded almost every quarter of the kingdom the morals of the people are improved the country gentlemen in many parts have relinquished the favorite amusements of the chase for the plough  mr b not as much as i could wish but still more than i expected as to agriculture it may be called the eighth science we may talk what we please says cowley of lillies and lions rampant and spread eagles in fields dor or dargent but if heraldry were guided by reason a plough in a field arable would be the most noble and ancient arms  t very true sir but it is said that the physical situation of ireland is not favorable to the progress of tillage  mr b i have often heard so but experience proves the contrary i saw and i saw it with pleasure in my little tour through some parts of the south of ireland two or three mountains clothed with luxuriant grass that in my time was scarcely covered with barren heath and halfstarved briars breakfast was now brought in young mr burke and dr king were present  t there are many passages in the ancient laws of ireland that evince that agriculture flourished at a very early period in that country  mr b do you mean in the brehon laws i wish they were translated  t i wish so too i am sure the university of dublin is very much obliged to you sir for the fragments which you presented of the seabright collection they are valuable as they contain many particulars that shed light on the manners and customs of the ancient irish but life is short and in some respect it would be a pity that a man of genius should waste his time in such pursuits  mr b to set a man of genius down to such a task would be to yoke a courser of the sun in a mud cart no no one of your cool plodding halfburnt bricks of the creation would be the fittest person in the world for such studies  t colonel vallancy has labored hard in that mine  mr b yes in that race he has carried off the prize of industry from all his competitors and if he has done nothing more he has wakened a spirit of curiosity in that line but he has built too much on etymology and that is a very sandy foundation  dr king ireland was samed for piety and learning at a very early period  mr b bid says so and several other writers  dr king can you speak irish  mr b i could speak a little of it when i was a boy and i can remember a few words and phrases still poetry was highly cultivated by the ancient irish some of their kings were so smitten with the love of song as to exchange the scepter for the harp  t the bards were very much protected and encouraged but having indulged too much in satire and ribaldry they were rather dreaded than esteemed and at one time the whole body was on the eve of being banished if st columkill had not interfered  mr b sedulius was an excellent poet  t yes his latin poetry is very much admired  mr b i read one of his hymns that glowed with all the poet the spirit of it might be said to ascend like the spirit of a christian martyr in the midst of flames but i never could light on his works  t nor i neither but many of his verses are scattered through colgan  mr b wherever they are scattered they will shine like stars there was a poet that used to compose a little in his native language when i was a boy i forget his name  t dignum i suppose  mr b yes yes he could neither read nor write nor speak any language but his own i have seen some of his effusions translated into english but was assured by judges that they fell far short of the original yet they contained some graces snatched beyond the reach of art i remember one thought in an address to a friend the poet advises him to lose no time in paying his addresses to a young lady for that she was of age and as a proof of it upon her cheek he saw loves letter sealed with a damask rose spencer who was himself a bard says that the irish poetry was sprinkled with many pretty flowers i wish they were collected in one nosegay  t yes sir but there is no encouragement  mr b no not in this rust of the iron age i wish however that some able industrious and patient pen would give a history of that country it is much wanted  t great expectations were formed from doctor leland he had leisure talents and almost every opportunity when lord chesterfield was viceroy of that kingdom he was told that the doctor intended to follow up a prospectus he had published on the subject of a voluminous history his lordship one day at levee applauded the doctors intentions but requested that he would make it a pleasant one  mr b your pleasant historians should be read with caution leland promised a voluminous history and so far he has kept his promise but he has not done justice to all  t it is said that he had an eye to a mitre  mr b mitres and coronets will dazzle but the truth is he had an eye to his bookseller and to be candid he went over it with a heavy hand  t he has scarce dipped into the earlier ages  mr b he was no antiquary but he might have said a little more on the subject hooker says the reason why first we do admire those things which are greatest and secondly those things which are ancientest is because the one is least distant from the infinite substance the other from the infinite continuance of god neither has he detailed with candor the feuds betwixt the house of desmond and butler  t the implacable hatred that existed betwixt the two is astonishing  mr b struggles for power i remember an anecdote of one of the desmonds i dont know which who happened to be severely wounded in an engagement with a party of the butlers one of the latter threw him on his shoulders to carry him off in triumph and as he passed along tauntingly asked him ah desmond where are you now though quite feeble from loss of blood he collected all his expiring strength and exclaimed where am i i am where i ought to be on the neck of my enemy  the conversation turned on poetry which mr burke called the art of substantiating shadows and to lend existence to nothing he praised milton for the judicious choice of his epithets this led him to say a few words on the use and abuse of those flowery adjectives as pontanus calls them and lamented that some person of taste did not collect a garland of them out of the english poets as textor had out of the latin which laid every classical scholar under great obligation to him as he had plucked the fairest flowers that sipped castalion dew  geography he said was an earthly subject but a heavenly study one of the company happened to mention some gentlemen who intended to promote discoveries in the interior parts of africa mr burke said the intention was truly laudable africa he said was worth exploring it seemed as if nature in some great convulsion or revolution of her empire had fled to that quarter with all her treasures some of which she had concealed in the bowels of the earth but the surface exhibited such abundance and variety of the vegetable and animal race that a few miles would enrich the conquests of natural history witness on the very shores of that continent  the cabbagetree that towered into all the sublimity of the pine and the luxuriance of the spreading oak and yet so tender that a few strokes of a fabre were sufficient to lay it prostrate on the earth africa was rightly called the mother of monsters for there was not a sufficient number of minor animals elsewhere to feed the huge beasts that ranged the forests in that country he was persuaded the interior was healthy civilized and so fertile that the reaper trod on the heels of the sower  but the thirst of european avarice and cruelty had raised a barrier round the coasts of that quarter which prevented all communication with the inoffensive inhabitants the sight of a white face was sufficient to make their curly locks stand on end death is natural to man but slavery unnatural and the moment you strip a man of his liberty you strip him of all his virtues you convert his heart into a dark hole in which all the vices conspire against you toward the close of the conversation he asked me if i was acquainted with mr sheridan i answered that i was very sorry i could not boast that honor i shall have the pleasure said he of introducing you to him for he is one of the best natured men in the universe he accompanied me on my departure to the door and told me that dr king was a very learned man assured me that he would be very happy to see me at beconsfield throw yourself in a coach said he come down and make my house your inn  in      several petitions were presented to the house of commons praying the abolition of the slave trade and on the  th of may in the same year mr pit moved and carried a resolution founded on their petitions the purport of which was to declare that the house would proceed to the investigation of that infamous traffic early in the next session  mr burke entered into this subject with the spirit of a man who felt for all mankind his eloquence was never poured forth in a better cause  it was the cause of humanity as he knew that he had interest and prejudice to contend with he took the question even on these grounds he clearly evinced the impolicy of it raised the african from that low scale of creation into which he had been thrown up to the dignity of man vindicated the wisdom goodness and providence of god in the formation situation and order of all his beings his description of a slave ship and the unhappy wretches that were piled together in its womb drew tears from many that heard him he then ran out into an eulogy on humanity in order to show that man divested of feeling may be classed with the greatest monster  the part which he took during his majestys indisposition in      is sufficiently known mr burkes best friends must lament that he did not abstain from some expressions on that melancholy occasion which have subtracted from the sincerity of subsequent professions his sovereign however treated him in a very different manner when he was afflicted by the hand of providence during the discussion of this business in parliament mr pit addressed a letter to the prince of wales dated  0th december which stated that it was the opinion of his majestys faithful servants that his royal highness should be empowered to exercise the royal authority during the illness and in the name of his father provided nevertheless that the care of the kings person with the disposition of his household should be committed to the queen and that the power to be exercised by the prince should not extend to the personal property of his father to the granting of any office reversion or pension except where the law absolutely required it as in the case of the judges for any other term than during the kings pleasure nor to the conferring of any peerage unless upon such persons of the royal issue as should have attained the age of twenty one years the prince of waless answer was written by mr burke is dated jan         it is worthy of being presented as a pure model of the epistolary style and expressive of the sentiments of the prince on a subject of the highest and most natural concern and personal delicacy after acknowledging the receipt of mr pitts letter nothing he said done by the two houses of parliament could be a proper subject of his animadversion but when previously to any discussion in parliament the outline of a scheme of government in which it was proposed that he should be personally and principally concerned and by which the royal authority and the public welfare might be deeply affected were sent to him for his consideration it would be unjustifiable in him to withhold an explicit declaration of his sentiments his silence might be construed into a previous approbation of a plan the accomplishment of which every motive of duty to his father and sovereign as well as of regard for the public interest obliged him to consider as injurious to both he did not expect that a plan by which government was to be rendered difficult if not impracticable would be offered to his consideration at a moment when government deprived of its chief energy and support seemed peculiarly to need the cordial and united aid of all descriptions of good subjects he forbore to remark on the several parts of the sketch laid before him it was not probable that any argument of his would produce an alteration of sentiment in the projectors of it but he trusted to the wisdom and justice of parliament when the subject should come under their deliberation it was with deep regret that he perceived in the contents of mr pitts paper a project for introducing weakness disorder insecurity into every branch of political business  a project for dividing the royal family from each other for separating the court from the state and depriving government of its natural and accustomed support  a scheme for disconnecting the authority to command service from the power of animating it by reward and for allotting to the prince all the invidious duties of government without the means of softening them to the public by any one act of grace favor or benignity his feelings were rendered more painful by observing that the plan was not founded in any general principle but was calculated to infuse jealousies and suspicions in that quarter whose confidence it would ever be the first pride of his life to merit and obtain on the motives and object of the restriction he had little to observe ministers had only informed him what the powers were which they meant to refuse not why they were withheld as the powers and prerogatives of the crown were vested there in trust for the benefit of the people and were secured only because necessary to preserve the point and balance of the constitution the plea of public utility ought to be strong manifest and urgent which called for the extinction or suspension of any one of those essential rights in the supreme power or its representatives or which could justify the prince in consenting that in his person an experiment should be made to ascertain with how small a portion of the kingly power the executive government of the country might be carried on if security for the kings repossessing his rightful government were any part of the object of the proposed plan the prince had only to be convinced that any measure was necessary or even conducive to that end to be the first to urge it as the preliminary and paramount consideration of any settlement in which he would consent to share if attention to what it was presumed might be the kings feelings and wishes on the happy day of his recovery were the object it was with the truest sincerity the prince expressed his firm conviction that no event could be more repugnant to the feelings of his royal father than to know that the government of his son and representative had exhibited the sovereign power in a state of degradation of curtailed authority and diminished energy  a state hurtful in practice to the prosperity and good government of his people and injurious in its precedent to the security of the monarch and the rights of his family the prince also felt himself compelled to remark that it was not necessary for mr pit nor proper to suggest a restraint on his granting away the kings real and personal property he did not conceive that he was by law entiled to make any such grant and he was sure that he never had shown the smallest inclination to possess any such power he had discharged his duty in thus giving his free opinion of the plan yet his conviction of the evils which might arise from the government of the country remained longer in a maimed and debilitated state outweighed in his mind every other consideration and would determine him to undertake the painful trust imposed upon him by the present melancholy necessity which of all the kings subjects he deplored the most in full confidence that the affection and loyalty to the king the experienced attachment to the house of brunswick and the generosity which had always distinguished the nation would carry him through the many difficulties inseparable from so critical a situation with comfort to himself with honor to the king and with advantage to the public  mr burke is also said to have been the author of a speech intended to have been delivered by the duke of york in the upper house on certain provisions in the regency bill it is now in print  it abounds with eloquence and argument and does not appear to have diminished the writers stock either of the one or the other in the discussion of every stage of the bill mr burke sometimes ruffled even the placid temper of mr pit in these debates the latter called the former to order several times mr burke was not very fond of being interrupted in his flights especially when he mounted his fiery footed courser and dealt out his arrows in almost every direction which happened to be one night the case the first time he was arrested in his career in a tone little less impassionate than his own which did not escape his observation the right honorable gentleman mr pit said he calls me to order in so mild a voice that it reminds me of two lines which i once read in an old poet  there roared the prophet of the northern nation scorched in a flaming speech on moderation he had not proceeded very far when he was called to order again by mr pit with a smile which mr burke said reminded him of a line in another poet there madness laughed in ireful mood   the asperities which passed betwixt these two gentlemen throughout the discussion of this bill lest little room to expect for that coalition which afterward took place  on the  th of march      mr steel brought up the report of mr pitts east india declaratory bill mr burke declared on the introduction of this bill that he would resist it in every stage he kept his word and having exhausted all his arguments he flew to those that were inexhaustible in his hands  satyr and pleasantry he was particularly severe on mr dundas he compared the bill itself to a polypus of preambles it came forward he said like other insects in the humble form of an egg then a caterpillar then a fly etc he then changed the simile and said when it was first brought in it was shown about like an abortion in a bottle such was the severity of some of his remarks that even mr dundas evidently evinced that he felt sore  on the  d of march    0 mr fox moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal the corporation and test acts mr burke opposed the motion in a speech of considerable length in the course of which he read several extracts from the political writings of dr priestley and commented on them with great acerbity and personal rancour  mr gray actuated by the purest motives of humanity brought in a bill for the relief of unfortunate debtors mr burke paid many handsome compliments to the honorable mover and the pains which he had taken to distinguish the unfortunate from the criminal his mr bs description of the first class was extremely pathetic and affecting the facility of credit in this country he observed gave the creditor a rash resort to the person of debtor the mind of the latter might be said to be imprisoned even before his person was immured in the walls of a gaol the sight of a strange face filled him with alarm the appearance of a letter shook his nerves and a knock at the door filled his breast with anxiety suspense and fear and after he had pined for some years in misery and distress if enlarged by an act of grace or insolvency he returned from the bare walls of a prison to the bare walls of a gloomy apartment and a famished family with his credit blasted and every ray of hope tinged with despair  on the   th of february    0 mr flood gave notice that he intended on the  th of the next month to move for leave to bring in a bill to reform the representation in parliament mr burke requested his honorable friend mr f would recall the notice he had just given and abstain from all discussion on the subject the fire of liberty as it was falsely called had been kindled in a neighboring country and he did not wish that one of the sparks of that flame should fall in this for it was not that mild temperate flame that might be called the emanation of reason religion and prudence but a devouring fire at which the ferocious demagogue lighted his brand this was the first time that he mentioned the revolution of france in the house of commons as he had touched on this subject he scarce ever missed to introduce it in the most trivial debate as mr sheridan and mr fox did not accompany him to the full extent of all those philippics it was easy to observe from his countenance and some expressions which he dropped that he meditated an attack on those two gentlemen which he carried partly into execution on the report of the army estimates on the  th of february    0 the manly openness and candor of mr fox and the mildness of his reply to what had fallen from mr burke on that occasion seemed to have some effect in soothing his temper for the time so that he did not pour out all the vials of his wrath but on the  th of the same month he came down to the house fully prepared to renew the attack he began with a detail of the french revolution from what he called the bloodbud of it to the time he was speaking he then entered into a history of the authors of it such a biographical sketch was never exhibited scarce could the imagination of a shakespeare call such a bloody tyrannical proscribing ferocious crew into existence such a catalogue of crimes such a list of vices were never cast in the mint of human depravity those wretches he said had lost all pretension to the name of man they like herod and nero looked on humanity to be weakness virtue a prejudice their hearts could be only warmed with the sacrilegious flames that devoured priests and altars they naturalized murder croaked and thirsted for blood and power attempted to invert the very decrees of nature and called on confusion as the order of the day  throughout the whole of this speech mr burke did not so much as touch on lettres de cachet the bastile or the farmers general who drank the tears of the widows and orphans out of cups of gold  mr fox complimented mr burke on his eloquence but repeated his former declaration that if ever he could look at a standing army with less constitutional jealousy than before it was now since during the late transactions in france the army had manifested that on becoming soldiers they did not cease to continue citizens and would not act as the mere instruments of a despot this expression renewed mr burkes choler and as his brain was well known to be a mint of phrases he attacked the french revolution with redoubled rage nor was he choice of the epithets which he applied to mr fox they passed by him it is true like the idle wind which he respected not but his heart was so full to think of the conduct of a man who held so dear a place in it that he burst into tears mr sheridan rose and commented on mr burkes speech with such irresistible force of argument eloquence and poignancy of wit that mr burke immediately threw off the mask burst into an open declaration of hostilities and declared that his honorable friend and he were from that moment separated in their politics for ever his gesture and countenance on pronouncing these words were compared by a gentleman in the gallery to the soldier mentioned in lucans pharsalia who was bit by a serpent in the desert of lybia tendit cutem pereunte figuta miscens cuncta tumor toto jam corpore major humanumque egressa modum super omnia membra efflatur sanies late pollente veneno ipse latet penitus congesto corpore mersus   mr burkes conduct on this occasion gave birth to various conjectures it was supposed by some that he envied the talents of mr fox and mr sheridan but truth is the daughter of time and she has since brought the whole to light  mr burke was amongst the first to praise the revolution in poland but he was scarce ever heard to lament the fate of it when he saw the foundation of that glorious edifice laid he rejoiced at it but when he saw it buried in ruins he never was known to shed a tear over it in commemoration of that promising event in which to use his own words every thing was kept in its place and order but in that place and order every thing was bettered the poles struck a medal of the late unfortuate poniatouski his majesty sent one of those warm from the mint to mr burke with a letter in his own hand writing in the english language as he said he thought it the most copious and energetic to convey the high sense which he entertained of mr burkes patriotism and talents mr burke returned a very polite answer stating that so high a mark of esteem might be supposed to awaken his vanity but it tended rather to increase his veneration and esteem for the character of a prince whom he had long admired he said he had no cabinet of medals but that if he had the richest in the universe he was persuaded he would be at a loss in what illustrious series he would place that of his majesty it must be placed as the first of a new one he had a son and happy would it be for him if he lived to be able to add a second to it he then launched out in praise of the polish revolution the origin and progress of which he ascribed to the king you said he that may be truly called the father and not the proprietor of your people he entreated his majesty to pardon the length of the letter as the language of command was brevity but he was grown old and fond of dwelling on a theme so dear to his heart besides it was the very nature of gratitude that it thought it never could say enough  on the  0th of april      mr gray brought forward the question of parliamentary reform mr burke rose immediately after mr fox had delivered his opinion on this momentous question he claimed the indulgence of the house as one that did not trouble them often and one who was not to be impelled by a small exigency he knew himself unfit for the general duties of the house and was not like the archbishop of grenada who contrary to the motives and remonstrances of his best friends would not be persuaded that his faculties were on the decline when found no longer fit for the situation he held he could without great concern obey the voice that warned him to retire yet after serving in that house for twentyseven years he might still be of some use in defending it is borders as invalids after wearing out their youth and compacted manhood are placed in garrison when discharged from the active duties of military life he insisted that a remedy should not be resorted to till the disease was pointed out and that the grievances pointed out and exaggerated did not exist and that the attempt was merely to ensnare people by the gingle of the word reform a word of five letters and worth little more than the sounds they conveyed  mr burke still affected a kind of whining friendship for mr fox he did not rise so often as usual and when he did it was merely to introduce the french revolution almost every speech which he delivered on this subject might be divided into three parts the tragic the comic and the farcical in the last he often sunk to mere buffoonery but the whole was eloquent in general it was in the first of these divisions that he introduced the dagger scene this was a practical trope as mr sheridan called it and as he had declared a few minutes before he drew that weapon from his bosom that neutrality was his motto mr courtenay humourously called it an armed neutrality as soon as he saw it in his hand in one of his antigallican speeches he drew a humourous picture of the metaphysicians rhetoricians and politicians of france in the course of which he illustrated the new lights of that country with the following quotation  so have i seen in larder dark of veal a lucid loin replete with many a brilliant spark as wise philosophers remark at once both stink and shine   on the   th of february      mr fox brought forward a motion relative to the war as mr burke was at war with the french at war with mr fox etc etc and at war with himself this motion furnished him with an opportunity of pouring out all that he had bottled up on the subject toward the conclusion of his speech he entered into a character of all the individuals in france with whom a minister from this country might be supposed to treat from roland down to santerre he protested that the hangman was the only honest man in france and that every man woman and child in that country were murderers he was extremely angry with mr fox for calling the late king of prussia a despot with respect to the part which he took in the plunder of poland he said he could buy a parrot for a shilling that could be taught to say despot despot from morn till night mr gray answered that a parrot could be also taught to say murderer banditti brissot etc etc on the  th of march      mr sheridan moved for a committee to enquire into the seditious practices alleged to exist in the country mr burke continued to sit in the opposition bench but as soon as mr sheridan had handed his motion to the speaker mr burke started up ran toward the treasury bench and when he got to the middle of the floor he turned round looked with an eye full of indignation on those he had left behind him and exclaimed  i quit the camp i quit the camp mr sheridan said he hoped as the honorable gentleman had quitted the camp as a deserter that he would not return as a spy  in      mr burke addressed a letter to his friend sir h langrishe on the roman catholics of ireland and the propriety of admitting them to the elective franchise consistently with the principles of the constitution as established at the revolution as this question had occupied his attention from his earliest days so it exhibits all the marks of the different stages of his life  the toys of childhood the fire of youth the vigor of manhood and the cool collected judgment of old age he has endeavored to prove in this pamphlet that the ascendancy of humanity justice and sound policy ought to rise superior to the ascendancy of any religious sect or party  religionis non est cogere religionem  on the   th of february      mr burke and his son withdrew their names from the whig club  mr burkes writings on the french revolution have been so universally read that it is needless to make any remarks on them and though they abound with many splendid passages there is scarce an original thought in the whole the first pamphlet which he published on that subject is chiefly taken from the writings of mallet du pan having now retired on a pension it was thought that he would have laid down the pen and enjoyed himself in the conversation of a few select friends or in reading such writers as teach us to wean our affections from all sublunary matters especially as he had lost his son the prop of his old age in this situation it was expected that he would have exclaimed with the poet on a similar occasion know all the distant din the world can keep rolls over my grotto and but sooths my sleep   but his passions accompanied him whithersoever he went and in that very retirement he attacked the duke of bedford because that young nobleman discharged his public duty the privileged class however we believe will not consider that attack as a trophy that ought to be hung on the corinthian pillar of polished society his conduct to mr fox was rather mysterious but his pension explained it he might have parted with his old friend in a more decent and dignified manner he was envious of his great talents undoubtedly and though artful enough in every other respect he could not conceal it for he complained in the house of commons that mr foxs speeches were detailed at greater length and with more fidelity than his own it was still more visible one day with a man of letters who made the following remark  in tullio omnes linguam mirantur pectus non aeque in aristotele pectus omnes linguam non item in foxio pectus et linguam aeque his irritability might be said to have grown with his growth and to have gathered strength with his weakness and there was scarce a shaft leveled at him in the public prints or other medium that he did not read some years since at dinner at lord tankervilles the conversation turned on caricatures a gentleman observed that he believed mr fox had been oftener exhibited in that line than any other man in the kingdom i beg your pardon said mr burke i think i may put in my claim to a greater number and variety of exhibitions in that way than my honorable friend i hope said mr fox they give you no uneasiness not in the least replied mr burke i have seen them all and i remember them all and if it would not be trespassing on the indulgence of the company i could repeat the different characters in which i have been represented obedient to the mimic powers of the pencil accordingly he began and described them all in so humourous a manner as to set the table on a roar  mr burke had only one child a son he was educated at oxford and returned for the borough of malton but never took his seat as his health was visibly on the decline his father took lodgings for him at brompton for the benefit of the air he was attended by doctor brocklsby his father was inconsolable and in the agony of his grief wrung his hands one morning and sighed so deeply that his son overheard him which induced him to rise dress and walk down stairs with the assistance of his servant when he came to the door he paused to collect strength walked in without any help and seated himself on the sopha between his father and mother the day was fine he rose and repeated miltons morning hymn sat down rose a second time to repeat it again but had scarce uttered a few lines when he sunk into the arms of his parents and expired without a sigh in the thirtyseventh year of his age  soon after mr burke published his reflections on the revolution in france it was intended to present him with the freedom of the university of dublin and other academic honors but the warm part which he took in the question of the emancipation of the roman catholics of ireland prevented that intention it is said from being carried into effect and if it even had it could not increase his fame as a writer or speaker he did not trust to his pen in promoting the cause of the catholics he sent his son to ireland for that purpose who received a thousand pounds for his mission this induced many to believe that the zeal which was exhibited on that occasion flowed from his attachment to the romish church and the old erroneous story of his being bred at st omers was revived this question being put one day to dr doctor goldsmith i dont see said the doctor that he had any occasion to be bred there to repel those charges he wrote a letter to thomas burgh esquire of old town in ireland in which he stated at full length the reasons which induced him to become the advocate of the irish catholics when mr burke was a young man it is said that he attempted to write a tragedy but that having shown a few passages of it to a friend he was persuaded to turn his attention to some other literary line in which he would shine to more advantage his essay on the sublime and beautiful was the first production of his pen that drew the attention of the learned when the late lord chesterfield first read it he said the sublime was beautiful and the beautiful sublime as an orator mr burke paid very little attention to the graces as his utterance was in general vehement his gesticulation partook of the same passion his reading was various and he had the happy art of making every thing he read his own so that his plagiarism often escaped in the peculiar flow and modification of his words his memory was tenacious his imagination so fervid and head strong that it could scarce be restrained by his judgment but swelled due on and scarce ever knew retiring ebb the solidity of his judgment was often lost in the brilliancy of his fancy as the solidity of the sun is often lost in the splendor of his beams in the heat and whirlwind of his passions he fell at times into low expressions as the rapid showers in south america when they wash down gold mingle it with common sand he was a great lover of agriculture abstemious in his diet and plain in his dress his favorite maxim was that the passions ought to instruct the reason this perhaps may account for his conduct in the evening of his life if he had paid more attention to his private affairs his friends and admirers perhaps would not have to lament that he died a pensioner  grandeur of soul says a celebrated writer that haughtily struggles with poverty and will neither yield to nor make terms with misfortunes which through every situation reposes a noble confidence in itself and has an immovable view to future glory and honor astonishes the world with admiration and delight we as it were lean forward with surprise and trembling joy to behold the human soul collecting its strength and asserting a right to superior fates during his last illness mr burke was attended by doctor lynn of windsor a cancerous abscess had been long gathering in his side which at last came to a suppuration he was perfectly collected and sound in his intellects to the last moment and a few hours before his death conversed with some of his friends on political subjects his enmity to the french republic continued to burn till the fuel was quite exhausted having read one of addisons papers in the spectator he felt himself so weak that he beckoned to be removed and expired as his domestics were conveying him to his bed  character of mr burke by an anonymous writer as a senator he was uniformly attached to the party he set out with and though his private fortune was far from being established and though different administrations would be proud to detach him he rose and fell with his party  he has been charged with not being always constant to his own declarations and definitions but before he is judged on this ground times and circumstances should be well weighed in our mixed constitution there are times when the power of the prince or the people may be alternately too much or too little and the politician who now speaks in favor of the one and then of the other may be equally consistent there was a period not very remote from the present when the power of the crown was thought to have increased was increasing and ought to be diminished but now that democracy is taking such hideous strides in europe every englishman feels it his duty to rally round the throne as the best support of freedom subordination and liberty  he was a firm professor of the christian religion and exercised its principles in its duties wisely considering that whatever disunites man from god disunites man from man he looked within himself for the regulation of his conduct which was exemplary in all the relations of life he was warm in his affections simple in his manners plain in his table arrangements etc etc and so little affected with the follies and dissipations of what is called the higher classes that he was totally ignorant of them so that this great man with all his talents would be mere lumber in a modern drawing room not but he excelled in all the refinements as well as strength of conversation and could at times badinage with great skill and natural ease but what are such qualifications to a people where cards and dice constitute their business and fashionable vices their conversation  character of mr burke by thomas burgh esquire take him for all in all edmund burke must be considered as a man of great and extraordinary talents who justly acquired in his own day the applauses of his countrymen and who will always hold an elevated rank amongst the statesmen and philosophers of europe  a character that would be indeed generally imitated if it had not arrived at a height discouraging to human nature that yielded to none of any age or country as every virtue public and private every ability had raised it to the highest point of perfection of which our nature was found to be capable which stood indeed not only distinguished above those of modern times but added to the greatness of the greatest of antiquity the accumulated knowledge and accumulated wisdom of the ages that have elapsed and the worlds that have been since discovered i cannot but lament that in a country distinguished by the birth and education of such a person a country for which had risqued his most near his most advantageous interests some had been found who affected to regard him as an alien and to deny him the rank of a friend and citizen he disdained to think any vindication necessary but should have no difficulty in telling his countrymen what was told to the greatest people of the earth in behalf of a character much inferior in every of consideration eum cum sit civis non modo non segregandum a numero civium verum etiam si non esset civis adsciscendum fuisse  character of mr burke by the rev thomas campbell author of the history of ireland his learning is so various and extensive that we might praise it for its range and compass were it not still more praiseworthy for its solidity and depth his imagination is so lively and so creative that he may justly be called the child of fancy and therefore his enemies for even he is not without them would persuade us that his fancy overbears his judgment  whereas this fine frenzy is as it ought to be only a secondary ingredient in the high composition of a man who not only reflects honor on his native country but elevates the dignity of human nature in his most eccentric flights in his most seemingly wild excursions in the most boisterous tempest of his passion there is always a guardian angel which rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm his grand characteristic is genius and ruling faculty his judgment though certainly not of that cold kind which the low world call prudence but his reason is enlightened by intuition and whilst he persuades as an orator he instructs as a philosopher  a nobleman of the highest station and abilities in england though of an opposite party in politics when he heard the petty minions of the day decry his powers stopped them short and said come come hold your tongue the next age could not know that there was oratory in this if edmund burke had not printed his speeches and dr johnson generally a niggard in panegyric speaking of that parity of talents which is generally distributed to the sons of men has been heard to say that during his acquaintance with life he knew but two men who had risen considerably above the common standard the one was lord chatham the other was edmund burke  the beauties of burke act of grace i never relished acts of grace nor ever submitted to them but from despair of better they are a dishonorable invention by which not from humanity not from policy but merely because we have not room enough to hold these victims of the absurdity of our laws we turn loose upon the public three or four thousand naked wretches corrupted by the habits debased by the ignominy of a prison if the creditor had a right to those carcases as a natural claim for his property i am sure we have no right to deprive him of that security but if the few pounds of flesh were not necessary to his security we had not a right to detain the unfortunate debtor without any benefit at all to the person that confined him  speech previous to the election at bristol accountants public as the extent of our wars has scattered the accountants under the paymaster into every part of the globe the grand and sure paymaster death in all his shapes calls these accountants to another reckoning death indeed domineers over every thing but the forms of the exchequer over these he has no power they are impassive and immortal the audit of the exchequer more severe than the audit to which the accountants are gone demands proofs which in the nature of things are difficult sometimes impossible to be had in this respect too rigor as usual defeats itself then the exchequer never gives a particular receipt or clears a man of his account as far as it goes a final acquittance or a quietus as they term it is scarcely ever to be obtained terrors and ghosts of unlaid accountants haunt the houses of their children from generation to generation families in the course of succession fall into minorities the inheritance comes into the hands of females and very perplexed affairs are often delivered over into the hands of negligent guardians and faithless stewards so that the demand remains when the advantage of the money is gone if ever any advantage at all has been made of it this is a cause of infinite distress to families and becomes a source of influence to an extent that can scarcely be imagined but by those who have taken some pains to trace it the mildness of government in the employment of useless and dangerous powers furnishes no reason for their continuance  oecon reform abuse of office it is necessary n all matters of public complaint where men frequently feel right and argue wrong to separate prejudice from reason and to be very sure in attempting the redress of a grievance that we hit upon its real seat and its true nature where there is an abuse in office the first thing that occurs in heat is to censure the officer our natural disposition leads all our inquiries rather to persons than to things but this prejudice is to be corrected by maturer thinking  ibid  abuse inveterate but there is a time when men will not suffer bad things because their ancestors have suffered worse there is a time when the hoary head of inveterate abuse will neither draw reverence nor obtain protection  ibid  ambassadors the foreign ministers are the links of our connection with other nations  ibid  addressers there are many circumstances in the zeal shown for civil war which seem to discover little of real magnanimity the addressers offer their own persons and they are satisfied with hiring germans they promise their private fortunes and they mortgage their country they have all the merit of volunteers without risque of person or charge of contribution and when the unfeeling arm of a foreign soldiery pours out their kindred blood like water they exult and triumph as if they themselves had performed some notable exploit  speech on conciliation with america arbitrary power i should be sorry that any thing framed in contradiction to the spirit of our constitution did not instantly produce in fact the grossest of the evils with which it was pregnant in its nature it is by lying dormant a long time or being first very rarely exercised that arbitrary power steals upon a people on the next unconstitutional act all the fashionable world will be ready to say your prophecies are ridiculous your fears are vain you see how little of the mischiefs which you formerly foreboded are come to pass thus by degrees that artful softening of all arbitrary power the alleged unfrequency or narrow extent of its operations will be received as a sort of aphorism and mr hume will not be singular in telling us that the felicity of mankind is no more disturbed by it than by earthquakes or thunder or the more universal accidents of nature  ibid  ambition god has planted in man a sense of ambition and a satisfaction arising from the contemplation of his excelling his fellows in something deemed valuable amongst them it is this passion that drives men to all the ways we see in use of signalizing themselves and that tends to make whatever excites in a man the idea of this distinction so very pleasant it has been so strong as to make very miserable men take comfort that they were supreme in misery and certain it is that where we cannot distinguish ourselves by something excellent we begin to take a complacency in some singular infirmities follies or defects of one kind or other it is on this principle that flattery is so prevalent for flattery is no more than what raises in a mans mind an idea of a preference which he has not now whatever either on good or upon bad grounds tends to raise a man in his own opinion produces a sort of swelling and triumph that is extremely grateful to the human mind and this swelling is never more perceived nor operates with more force than when without danger we are conversant with terrible objects the mind always claiming to itself some part of the dignity and importance of the things which it contemplates hence proceeds what longinus has observed of that glorying and sense of inward greatness that always fills the reader of such passages in poets and orators as are sublime it is what every man must have felt in himself upon such occasions  ibid  aristocracy and despotism it is now found by abundant experience that an aristocracy and a despotism differ but in name and that a people who are in general excluded from any share of the legislative are to all intents and purposes as much slaves when twenty independent of them govern as when but one domineers the tyranny is even more felt as every individual of the nobles has the haughtiness of a sultan the people are more miserable as they seem on the verge of liberty from which they are for ever debarred this fallacious idea of liberty whilst it presents a vain shadow of happiness to the subject binds faster the chains of his subjection what is left undone by the natural avarice and pride of those who are raised above the others is completed by their suspicions and their dread of losing an authority which has no support in the common utility of the nation  vindic of not society athenian degeneracy described the athenians made a very rapid progress to the most enormous excesses the people under no restraint soon grew dissipated luxurious and idle they renounced all labor and began to subsist themselves from the public revenues they lost all concern for their common honor or safety and could bear no advice that tended to reform them at this time truth became offensive to those lords the people and most highly dangerous to the speaker the orators no longer ascended the rostrum but to corrupt them further with the most fulsome adulation these orators were all bribed by foreign princes on the one side or the other and besides its own parties in this city there were parties and avowed ones too for the persians spartans and mac donians supported each of them by one or more demagogues pensioned and bribed to this iniquitous service the people forgetful of all virtue and public spirit and intoxicated with the flatteries of their orators these courtiers of republics and endowed with the distinguishing characteristics of all other courtiers this people i say at last arrived at that pitch of madness that they coolly and deliberately by an express law made it capital for any man to propose an application of the immense sums squandered in public shows even to the most necessary purposes of the state when you see the people of this republic banishing or murdering their best and ablest citizens dissipating the public treasure with the most senseless extravagance and spending their whole time as spectators or actors in playing fiddling dancing and singing does it not my lord strike your imagination with the image of a sort of a complex nero and does it not strike you with the greater horror when you observe not one man only but a whole city grown drunk with pride and power running with a rage of folly into the same mean and senseless debauchery and extravagance  the whole history of this celebrated republic is but one tissue of rashness folly ingratitude injustice tumult violence and tyranny and indeed of every species of wickedness that can well be imagined  this was a city of wise men in which a minister could not exercise his functions a warlike people amongst whom a general did not dare either to gain or lose a battle a learned nation in which a philosopher could not venture on a free inquiry this was the city which banished themistocles starved aristides forced into exile miltiades drove out anaxagoras and poisoned socrates this was a city which changed the form of its government with the moon eternal conspiracies revolutions daily nothing fixed and established a republic as an ancient philosopher has observed is no one species of government but a magazine of every species here you find every sort of it and that in the worst form as there is a perpetual change one rising and the other falling you have all the violence and wicked policy by which a beginning power must always acquire its strength and all the weakness by which falling states are brought to a complete destruction  vindic not society american war effects of the act of which i speak is among the fruits of the american war a war in my humble opinion productive of many mischiefs of a kind which distinguish it from all others not only our policy is deranged and our empire distracted but our laws and our legislative spirit appear to have been totally perverted by it we have made war on our colonies not by arms only but by laws as hostility and law are not very concordant ideas every step we have taken in this business has been made by trampling on some maxim of justice or some capital principle of wise government what precedents were established and what principles overturned i will not say of english privilege but of general justice in the boston port the massachusets charter the military bill and all that long array of hostile acts of parliament by which the war with america has been begun and supported had the principles of any of these acts been first exerted on english ground they would probably have expired as soon as they touched it but by being removed from our persons they have rooted in our laws and the latest posterity will taste the fruits of them  nor is it the worst effect of this unnatural contention that our laws are corrupted whilst manners remain entire they will correct the vices of law and soften it at length to their own temper but we have to lament that in most of the late proceedings we see very few traces of that generosity humanity and dignity of mind which formerly characterized this nation war suspends the rules of moral obligation and what is long suspended is in danger of being totally abrogated civil wars strike deepest of all into the manners of the people they vitiate their politics they corrupt their morals they pervert even the natural taste and relish of equity and justice by teaching us to consider our fellowcitizens in an hostile light the whole body of our nation becomes gradually less dear to us the very names of affection and kindred which were the bond of charity whilst we agreed become new incentives to hatred and rage when the communion of our country is dissolved we may flatter ourselves that we shall not fall into this misfortune but we have no charter of exemption that i know of from the ordinary frailties of our nature  what but that blindness of heart which arises from the phrensy of civil contention could have made any persons conceive the present situation of the british affairs as an object of triumph to themselves or of congratulation to their sovereign nothing surely could be more lamentable to those who remember the flourishing days of this kingdom than to see the insane joy of several unhappy people amidst the sad spectacle which our affairs and conduct exhibit to the scorn of europe we behold and it seems some people rejoice in beholding our native land which used to sit the envied arbiter of all her neighbors reduced to a servile dependence on their mercy acquiescing in assurances of friendship which she does not trust complaining of hostilities which she dares not resent deficient to her allies lofty to her subjects and submissive to her enemies whilst the liberal government of this free nation is supported by the hireling sword of german boors and vassals and three millions of the subjects of great britain are seeking for protection to english privileges in the arms of france  indeed our affairs are in a bad condition i do assure those gentlemen who have prayed for war and obtained the blessing they have sought that they are at this instant in very great straits  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  american war ministers who conducted the believe me gentlemen the way still before you is intricate dark and full of perplexed and treacherous mazes those who think they have the clue may lead us out of this labyrinth we may trust them as amply as we think proper but as they have most certainly a call for all the reason which their stock can furnish why should we think it proper to disturb its operation by inflaming their passions i may be unable to lend an helping hand to those who direct the state but i should be ashamed to make myself one of a noisy multitude to hollow and hearten them into doubtful and dangerous courses a conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood he would feel some apprehension at being called to a tremendous account for engaging in so deep a play without any sort of knowledge of the game it is no excuse for presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolence or passion the poorest being that crawls on earth contending to save itself from notice and oppression is an object respectable in the eyes of god and man but i cannot conceive any existence under heaven which in the depth of its wisdom tolerates all sorts of things that is more odious and disgusting than an impotent helpless creature without civil wisdom or military skill without a consciousness of any other qualification for power but his servility to it bloated with pride and arrogance calling for battles which he is not to sight contending for a violent dominion which he can never exercise and satisfied to be himself mean and miserable in order to render others contemptible and wretched  ibid  american cowardice i am really ashamed of the fashionable language which has been held for some time past which to say the best of it is full of levity you know that i allude to the general cry against the cowardice of the americans as if we despised them for not making the kings soldiery purchase the advantage they have obtained at a dearer rate it is not gentlemen it is not to respect the dispensations of providence nor to provide any decent retreat in the mutability of human affairs it leaves no medium between insolent victory and infamous defeat it tends to alienate our minds further and further from our natural regards and to make an eternal rent and schism in the british nation those who do not wish for such a separation would not dissolve that cement of reciprocal esteem and regard which can alone bind together the parts of this great fabric it ought to be our wish as it is our duty not only to forbear this style of outrage ourselves but to make every one as sensible as we can of the impropriety and unworthiness of the tempers which give rise to it and which designing men are laboring with such malignant industry to diffuse amongst us it is our business to counteract them if possible if possible to awake our natural regards and to revive the old partiality to the english name without something of this kind i do not see how it is ever practicable really to reconcile with those whose affection after all must be the surest hold of our government and which is a thousand times more worth to us than the mercenary zeal of all the circles of germany  ibid  american war partisans of the all this rage against unresisting dissent convinces me that at bottom they are far from satisfied they are in the right for what is it they would have a war they certainly have at this moment the blessing of something that is very like one and if the war they enjoy at present be not sufficiently hot and extensive they may shortly have it as warm and as spreading as their hearts can desire is it the force of the kingdom they call for they have it already and if they choose to fight their battles in their own person no body prevents their setting sail to america in the next transports do they think that the service is stinted for want of liberal supplies indeed they complain without reason the table of the house of commons will glut them let their appetite for expense be never so keen and i assure them further that those who think with them in the house of commons are full as easy in the control as they are liberal in the vote of these expenses if this be not supply or confidence sufficient let them open their own private pursestrings and give from what is left to them as largely and with as little care as they think proper  ibid  american assemblies at the first designation of these assemblies they were probably not intended for any thing more nor perhap did they think themselves much higher than the municipal corporations within this island to which some at present love to compare them but nothing in progression can rest on its original plan we may as well think of rocking a grown man in the cradle of an infant therefore as the colonies prospered and increased to a numerous and mighty people spreading over a very great tract of the globe it was natural that they should attribute to assemblies so respectable in their formal constitution some part of the dignity of the great nations which they represented no longer tied to bylaws these assemblies made acts of all sorts and in all cases whatsoever they levied money not for parochial purposes but upon regular grants to the crown following all the rules and principles of a parliament to which they approached every day more and more nearly those who think themselves wiser than providence and stronger than the course of nature may complain of all this variation on the one side or the other as their several humors and prejudices may lead them but things could not be otherwise and english colonies must be had on these terms or not had at all  ibid  american war state of england at the commencement of the i know and have long felt the difficulty of reconciling the unwieldy haughtiness of a great ruling nation habituated to command pampered by enormous wealth and confident from a long course of prosperity and victory to the high spirit of free dependencies animated with the first glow and activity of juvenile heat and assuming to themselves as their birthright some part of that very pride which oppresses them  ibid  american war effect of the on our national character there never gentleman was a period in which the stedfastness of some men has been put to so sore a trial it is not very difficult for wellformed minds to abandon their interest but the separation of same and virtue is an harsh divorce liberty is in danger of being made unpopular to englishmen contending for an imaginary power we begin to acquire the spirit of domination and to lose the relish of honest equality the principles of our forefathers become suspected to us because we see them animating the present opposition of our children the faults which grow out of the luxuriance of freedom appear much more shocking to us than the base vices which are generated from the rankness of servitude accordingly the least resistance to power appears more inexcusable in our eyes than the greatest abuses of authority all dread of a standing military force is looked upon as a superstitious panic all shame of calling in foreigners and savages in a civil contest is worn off we grow indifferent to the consequences inevitable to ourselves from the plan of ruling half he empire by a mercenary sword we are taught to believe that a desire of domineering over our countrymen is love to our country that those who hate civil war abet rebellion and that the amiable and conciliatory virtues of lenity moderation and tenderness to the privileges of those who depend on this kingdom are a sort of treason to the state  it is impossible that we should remain long in a situation which breeds such notions and dispositions without some great alteration in the national character those ingenuous and feeling minds who are so fortified against all other things and so unarmed to whatever approaches in the shape of disgrace finding these principles which they considered as sure means of honor to be grown into disrepute will retire disheartened and disgusted those of a more robust make the bold able ambitious men who pay some of their court to power through the people and substitute the voice of transient opinion in the place of true glory will give into the general mode and those superior understandings which ought to correct vulgar prejudice will confirm and aggravate its errors many things have been long operating toward a gradual change in our principles but this american war has done more in a very few years than all the other causes could have effected in a century it is therefore not on its own separate account but because of its attendant circumstances that i consider its continuance or its ending in any way but that of an honorable and liberal accommodation as the greatest evils which can befall us  ibid  america effect of the victory in long island you remember that in the beginning of this american war that era of calamity disgrace and downfall an era which no feeling mind will ever mention without a tear for england you were greatly divided and a very strong body if not the strongest opposed itself to the madness which every art and every power were employed to render popular in order that the errors of the rulers might be lost in the general blindness of the nation this opposition continued until after our great but most unfortunate victory at long island then all the mounds and banks of our constancy were borne down at once and the phrensy of the american war broke in upon us like a deluge this victory which seemed to put an immediate end to all difficulties perfected us in that spirit of domination which our unparalleled prosperity had but too long nurtured we had been so very powerful and so very prosperous that even the humblest of us were degraded into the vices and follies of kings we lost all measure between means and ends and our headlong desires became our politics and our morals all men who wished for peace or retained any sentiments of moderation were overborne or silenced and this city was led by every artifice and probably with the more management because i was one of your members to distinguish itself by its zeal for that fatal cause in this temper of yours and of my mind i should have sooner fled to the extremities of the earth than have shown myself here i who saw in every american victory for you have had a long series of these misfortunes the germ and seed of the naval power of france and spain which all our heat and warmth against america was only hatching into life i should not have been a welcome visitant with the brow and the language of such feelings  when afterward the other face of your calamity was turned upon you and showed itself in defeat and distress i shunned you full as much i felt sorely this variety in our wretchedness and i did not wish to have the least appearance of insulting you with that show of superiority which though it may not be assumed is generally suspected in a time of calamity from those whose previous warnings have been despised i could not bear to show you a representative whose face did not reflect that of his constituents a face that could not joy in your joys and sorrow in your sorrows but time at length has made us all of one opinion and we have all opened our eyes on the true nature of the american war to the true nature of all its successes and all its failures  ibid  america proposition of peace with america the proposition is peace not peace through the medium of war not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negociations not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented from principle in all parts of the empire not peace to depend on the juridical determination of perplexing questions or the precise marking the shadowy boundaries of a complex government it is simply peace sought in its natural course and its ordinary haunts  it is peace sought in the spirit of peace and laid in principles purely pacific i propose by removing the ground of the difference and by restoring the former unsuspecting confidence of the colonies in the mother country to give permanent satisfaction to your people and far from a scheme of ruling by discord to reconcile them to each other in the same act and by the bond of the very same interest which reconciles them to british government  my idea is nothing more refined policy ever has been the parent of confusion and ever will be so as long as the world endures plain good intention which is as easily discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at last is let me say of no mean force in the government of mankind genuine simplicity of heart is an healing and cementing principle my plan therefore being formed upon the most simple grounds imaginable may disappoint some people when they hear it it has nothing to recommend it to the pruriency of curious ears there is nothing at all new and captivating in it it has nothing of the splendour of the project which has been lately laid upon your table by the noble lord in the blue ribband that when the governor council or assembly or general court of any of his majestys provinces or colonies in america shall propose to make provision according to the condition circumstances and situation of such province or colony for contributing their proportion to the common defense such proportion to be raised under the authority of the general court or general assembly of such province or colony and disposable by parliament and shall engage to make provision also for the support of the civil government and the administration of justice in such province or colony it will be proper if such proposal shall be approved of by his majesty and the two houses of parliament and for so long as such provision shall be made accordingly to forbear in respect of such province or colony to levy any duty tax or assessment or to impose any farther duty tax or assessment except such duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or impose for the regulation of commerce the nett produce of the duties last mentioned to be carried to the account of such province or colony respectively resolution moved by lord north in the committee and agreed to by the house    feb      it does not propose to fill your lobby with squabbling colony agents who will require the interposition of your mace at every instant to keep the peace amongst them it does not institute a magnificent auction of finance where captivated provinces come to general ransom by bidding against each other until you knock down the hammer and determine a proportion of payments beyond all the powers of algebra to equalize and settle  speech on conciliation with america america rapid population of the colonies the first thing that we have to consider with regard to the nature of the object is  the number of people in the colonies i have taken for some years a good deal of pains on that point i can by no calculation justify myself in placing the number below two millions of inhabitants of our own european blood and color besides at least  00000 others who form no inconsiderable part of the strength and opulence of the whole this sir is i believe about the true number there is no occasion to exaggerate where plain truth is of so much weight and importance  but whether i put the present numbers too high or too low is a matter of little moment such is the strength with which population shoots in that part of the world that state the numbers as high as we will whilst the dispute continues the exaggeration ends whilst we are discussing any given magnitude they are grown to it whilst we spend our time in deliberating on the mode of governing two millions we shall find we have millions more to manage your children do not grow faster from infancy to manhood than they spread from families to communities and from villages to nations  ibid  strength of that population i put this consideration of the present and the growing numbers in the front of our deliberation because sir this consideration will make it evident to a blunter discernment than yours that no partial narrow contracted pinched occasional system will be at all suitable to such an object it will show you that it is not to be considered as one of those minima which are out of the eye and consideration of the law not a paltry excrescence of the state not a mean dependant who may be neglected with little damage and provoked with little danger it will prove that some degree of care and caution is required in the handling such an object it will show that you ought not in reason to trifle with so large a mass of the interests and feelings of the human race you could at no time do so without guilt and be assured you will not be able to do it long with impunity  ibid  america commerce with our american colonies when we speak of the commerce with our colonies fiction lags after truth invention is unfruitful and imagination cold and barren  ibid  imports from america if i were to detail the imports i could show how many enjoyments they procure which deceive the burden of life how many materials which invigorate the springs of national industry and extend and animate every part of our foreign and domestic commerce  ibid  american agriculture i pass therefore to the colonies in another point of view their agriculture this they have prosecuted with such a spirit that besides feeding plentifully their own growing multitude their annual export of grain comprehending rice has some years ago exceeded a million in value of their last harvest i am persuaded they will export much more at the beginning of the century some of these colonies imported corn from the northern country for some time past the old world has been fed from the new the scarcity which you have felt would have been a desolating famine that if this child of your old age with a true filial piety with a roman charity had not put the full breast of its youthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhausted parent  ibid  american fisheries as to the wealth which the colonies have drawn from the sea by their fisheries you had all that matter fully opened at your bar you surely thought those acquisitions of value for they seemed even to excite your envy and yet the spirit by which that enterprizing employment has been exercised ought rather in my opinion to have raised your esteem and admiration and pray sir what in the world is equal to it pass by the other parts and look at the manner in which the people of new england have of late carried on the whale fishery whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of hudsons bay and daviss streights whilst we are looking for them beneath the arctic circle we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar cold that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen serpent of the south falkland island which seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp of national ambition is but a stage and resting place in the progress of their victorious industry nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging to them than the accumulated winter of both the poles we know that whilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of africa others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along the coast of brazil no sea but what is vexed by their fisheries no climate that is not witness to their toils neither the perseverance of holland nor the activity of france nor the dexterous and firm sagacity of english enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent people a people who are still as it were but in the gristle and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood when i contemplate these things when i know that the colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours and that they are not squeezed into this happy form by the constraints of watchful and suspicious government but that through a wise and salutary neglect a generous nature has been suffered to take her own way to perfection when i reflect upon these effects when i see how profitable they have been to us i feel all the pride of power sink and all presumption in the wisdom of human contrivances melt and die away within me my rigor relents i pardon something to the spirit of liberty  ibid  americans love of freedom in this character of the americans a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole and as an ardent is always a jealous affection your colonies become suspicious restive and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by force or shuffle from them by chicane what they think the only advantage worth living for this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the english colonies probably than in any other people of the earth and this from a great variety of powerful causes which to understand the true temper of their minds and the direction which this spirit takes it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely  ibid  american descent first the people of the colonies are descendants of england england sir is a nation which still i hope respects and formerly adored her freedom the colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character was most predominant and they took this biass and direction the moment they parted from your hands they are therefore not only devoted to liberty but to liberty according to english ideas and on english principles abstract liberty like other mere abstractions is not to be found liberty inheres in some sensible object and every nation has formed to itself some favorite point which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happiness it happened you know sir that the great contests for freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of taxing most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magistrates or on the balance among the several orders of the state the question of money was not with them so immediate but in england it was otherwise on this point of taxes the ablest pens and most eloquent tongues have been exercised the greatest spirits have acted and suffered in order to give the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point it was not only necessary for those who in argument defended the excellence of the english constitution to insist on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact and to prove that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parchments and blind usages to reside in a certain body called an house of commons they went much further they attempted to prove and they succeeded that in theory it ought to be so from the particular nature of a house of commons as an immediate representative of the people whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not they took infinite pains to inculcate as a fundamental principle that in all monarchies the people must in effect themselves mediately or immediately possess the power of granting their own money or no shadow of liberty could subsist the colonies draw from you as with their lifeblood these ideas and principles their love of liberty as with you fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing liberty might be safe or might be endangered in twenty other particulars without their being much pleased or alarmed here they felt its pulse and as they found that beat they thought themselves sick or sound i do not say whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own case it is not easy indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries the fact is that they did thus apply those general arguments and your mode of governing them whether through lenity or indolence through wisdom or mistake confirmed them in the imagination that they as well as you had an interest in these common principles  ibid  american government they were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their provincial legislative assemblies their governments are popular in an high degree some are merely popular in all the popular representative is the most weighty and this share of the people in their ordinary government never fails to inspire them with losty sentiments and with a strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance  ibid  american religion if any thing were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of government religion would have given it a complete effect religion always a principle of energy in this new people is no way worn out or impaired and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this free spirit the people are protestants and of that kind which is the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion this is a persuasion not only favorable to liberty but built upon it i do not think sir that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in their religious tenets as in their history  ibid  american education permit me sir to add another circumstance in our colonies which contributes no mean part toward the growth and effect of this untractable spirit i mean their education in no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study the profession itself is numerous and powerful and in most provinces it takes the lead the greater number of the deputies sent to the congress were lawyers but all who read and most do read endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science i have been told by an eminent bookseller that in no branch of his business after tracts of public devotion were so many books as those on the law exported to the plantations the colonists have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own use i hear that they have sold nearly as many of blackstones commentaries in america as in england general gage marks out this disposition very particularly in a letter on your table he states that all the people in his government are lawyers or smatterers in law and that in boston they have been enabled by successful chicane wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal constitutions the smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legislature their obligations to obedience and the penalties of rebellion all this is mighty well but my the attorney general honourabe and learned friend on the floor who condescends to mark what i say for animadversion will disdain that ground he has heard as well as i that when great honors and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to the service of the state it is a formidable adversary to government if the spirit be not tamed and broken by these happy methods it is stubborn and litigious abeunt studia in mores this study renders men acute inquisitive dexterous prompt in attack ready in defense full of resources in other countries the people more simple and of a less mercurial cast judge of an ill principle in government only by an actual grievance here they anticipate the evil and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle they augur misgovernment at a distance and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze  ibid  remoteness of situation from the first mover of government the last cause of this disobedient spirit in the colonies is hardly less powerful than the rest as it is not merely moral but laid deep in the natural constitution of things three thousand miles of ocean lie between you and them no contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in weakening government seas roll and months pass between the order and the execution and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat an whole system you have indeed winged ministers of vengeance who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of the sea but there a power steps in that limits the arrogance of raging passions and furious elements and says so far shall thou go and no farther who are you that should fret and rage and bite the chains of nature  nothing worse happens to you than does to all nations who have extensive empire and it happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown in large bodies the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremities nature has said it the turk cannot govern egypt and arabia and curdistan as he governs thrace nor has he the same dominion in crimea and algiers which he has at brusa and smyrna despotism itself is obliged to truck and huckster the sultan gets such obedience as he can he governs with a loose rein that he may govern at all and the whole of the force and vigor of his authority in his center is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders spain in her provinces is perhaps not so well obeyed as you are in yours she complies too she submits she watches times this is the immutable condition the eternal law of extensive and detached empire  ibid  america plan to check the population of the colonies as the growing population in the colonies is evidently one cause of their resistance it was last session mentioned in both houses by men of weight and received not without applause that in order to check this evil it would be proper for the crown to make no further grants of land but to this scheme there are two objections the first that there is already so much unsettled land in private hands as to afford room for an immense future population although the crown not only withheld its grants but annihilated its soil if this be the case then the only effect of this avarice of desolation this hoarding of a royal wilderness would be to raise the value of the possessions in the hands of the great private monopolists without any adequate check to the growing and alarming mischief of population  but if you stopped your grants what would be the consequence the people would occupy without grants they have already so occupied in many places you cannot station garrisons in every part of these deserts if you drive the people from one place they will carry on their annual tillage and remove with their flocks and herds to another many of the people in the back settlements are already little attached to particular situations already they have topped the apalachian mountains from thence they behold before them an immense plain one vast rich level meadow a square of five hundred miles over this they would wander without a possibility of restraint they would change their manners with the habits of their life would soon forget a government by which they were disowned would become hordes of english tartars and pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irresistible cavalry become masters of your governors and your counselors your collectors and comptrollers and of all the slaves that adhered to them such would and in no long time must be the effect of attempting to forbid as a crime and to suppress as an evil the command and blessing of providence increase and multiply such would be the happy result of an endeavor to keep as a lair of wild beasts that earth which god by an express charter has given to the children of men  ibid  america the ocean but let us suppose all these moral difficulties got over the ocean remains you cannot pump this dry and as long as it continues in its present bed so long all the causes which weaken authority by distance will continue ye gods annihilate but space and time and make two lovers happy  was a pious and passionate prayer  but just as reasonable as many of the serious wishes of very grave and solemn politicians  ibid  america conduct of ministers with respect to the repeal of the american stamp act it is not a pleasant consideration but nothing in the world can read so awful and so instructive a lesson as the conduct of ministry in this business upon the mischief of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of great affairs never have the servants of the state looked at the whole of your complicated interests in one connected view they have taken things by bits and scraps some at one time and one pretense and some at another just as they pressed without any sort of regard to their relations or dependencies they never had any kind of system right or wrong but only invented occasionally some miserable tale for the day in order meanly to sneak out of difficulties into which they had proudly strutted and they were put to all these shifts and devices full of meanness and full of mischief in order to pilfer piecemeal a repeal of an act which they had not the generous courage when they found and felt their error honorably and fairly to disclaim by such management by the irresistible operation of feeble councils so paltry a sum as threepence in the eyes of a financier so insignificant an article as tea in the eyes of a philosopher have shaken the pillars of a commercial empire that circled the whole globe  speech on american taxation  american tax on tea it is through the american trade of tea that your east india conquests are to be prevented from crushing you with their burden they are ponderous indeed and they must have that great country to lean upon or they tumble upon your head it is the same folly that has lost you at once the benefit of the west and of the east this folly has thrown open foldingdoors to contraband and will be the means of giving the profits of the trade of your colonies to every nation but yourselves never did a people suffer so much for the empty words of a preamble it must be given up for on what principle does it stand this famous revenue stands at this hour on all the debate as a description of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehensive but too comprehensive vocabulary of finance  a preambulary tax it is indeed a tax of sophistry a tax of pedantry a tax of disputation a tax of war and rebellion a tax for any thing but benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject  ibid  america feelings of the colonies the feelings of the colonies were formerly the feelings of great britain theirs were formerly the feelings of mr hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty shillings would twenty shillings have ruined mr hampdens fortune no but the payment of half twenty shillings on the principle it was demanded would have made him a slave it is the weight of that preamble of which you are so fond and not the weight of the duty that the americans are unable and unwilling to bear  ibid  america house of commons it was in america that your resolutions were predeclared it was from thence that we knew to a certainty how much exactly and not a scruple more or less we were to repeal we were unworthy to be let into the secret of our own conduct the assemblies had confidential communications from his majestys confidential servants we were nothing but instruments do you after this wonder that you have no weight and no respect in the colonies after this are you surprised that parliament is every day and every where losing i feel it with sorrow i utter it with reluctance that reverential affection which so endearing a name of authority ought ever to carry with it that you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet and that this house the ground and pillar of freedom is itself held up only by the treacherous underpinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary power  ibid  america false statements it is remarkable sir that the persons who formerly trumpeted forth the most loudly the violent resolutions of assemblies the universal insurrections the seizing and burning the stamped papers the forcing stamp officers to resign their commissions under the gallows the rifling and pulling down of the houses of magistrates and the expulsion from their country of all who dared to write or speak a single word in defense of the powers of parliament these very trumpeters are now the men that represent the whole as a mere trifle and choose to date all the disturbances from the repeal of the stamp act which put an end to them hear your officers abroad and let them refute this shameless falsehood who in all their correspondence state the disturbances as owing to their true causes the discontent of the people from the taxes you have this evidence in your own archives  and it will give you complete satisfaction if you are not so far lost to all parliamentary ideas of information as rather to credit the lie of the day than the records of your own house  sir this vermin of court reporters when they are forced into day upon one point are sure to burrow in another but they shall have no refuge i will make them bolt out of all their holes conscious that they must be baffled when they attribute a precedent disturbance to a subsequent measure they take other ground almost as absurd but very common in modern practice and very wicked which is to attribute the ill effect of illjudged conduct to the arguments which had been used to dissuade us from it they say that the opposition made in parliament to the stamp act at the time of its passing encouraged the americans to their resistance this has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume from an advocate of that faction a dr tucker this dr tucker is already a dean and his earnest labors in his vineyard will i suppose raise him to a bishopric  ibid  america lenity to for my own part i should choose if i could have my wish that the proposition of the honorable gentleman mr fuller for the repeal could go to america without the attendance of the penal bills alone i could almost answer for its success i cannot be certain of its reception in the bad company it may keep in such heterogeneous assortments the most innocent person will lose the effect of his innocence though you should send out this angel of peace yet you are sending out a destroying angel too and what would be the effect of the conflict of these two adverse spirits or which would predominate in the end is what i dare not say whether the lenient measures would cause american passion to subside or the severe would increase its fury  all this is in the hand of providence yet now even now i should confide in the prevailing virtue and efficacious operation of lenity though working in darkness and in chaos in the midst of all this unnatural and turbid combination i should hope it might produce order and beauty in the end  ibid  american taxation let us sir embrace some system or other before we end this session do you mean to tax america and to draw a productive revenue from thence if you do speak out name fix ascertain this revenue settle its quantity define its objects provide for its collection and then fight when you have something to fight for if you murder  rob if you kill take possession and do not appear in the character of madmen as well as assassins violent vindictive bloody and tyrannical without an object but may better counsels guide you  ibid  american representation a noble lord carmarthen who spoke some time ago is full of the fire of ingenuous youth and when he has modelled the ideas of a lively imagination by further experience he will be an ornament to his country in either house he has said that the americans are our children and how can they revolt against their parent he says that if they are not free in their present state england is not free because manchester and other considerable places are not represented so then because some towns in england are not represented america is to have no representative at all they are our children but when children ask for bread we are not to give a stone it is because the natural resistance of things and the various mutations of time hinders our government or any scheme of government from being any more than a sort of approximation to the right is it therefore that the colonies are to recede from it infinitely when this child of ours wishes to assimilate to its parent and to reflect with a true filial resemblance the beauteous countenance of british liberty are we to turn to them the shameful parts of our constitution are we to give them our weakness for their strength our opprobrium for their glory and the slough of slavery which we are not able to work off to serve them for their freedom  if this be the case ask yourselves this question will they be content in such a state of slavery if not look to the consequences reflect how you are to govern a people who think they ought to be free and think they are not your scheme yields no revenue it yields nothing but discontent disorder disobedience and such is the state of america that after wading up to your eyes in blood you could only end just where you begun that is to tax where no revenue is to be found to  my voice fails me my inclination indeed carries me no further  all is confusion beyond it  well sir i have recovered a little and before i sit down i must say something to another point with which gentlemen urge us what is to become of the declaratory act asserting the entireness of british legislative authority if we abandon the practice of taxation  for my part i look upon the rights stated in that act exactly in the manner in which i viewed them on its very first proposition and which i have often taken the liberty with great humility to lay before you i look i say on the imperial rights of great britain and the privileges which the colonists ought to enjoy under these rights to be just the most reconcilable things in the world the parliament of great britain sits at the head of her extensive empire in two capacities one as the local legislature of this island providing for all things at home immediately and by no other instrument than the executive power  the other and i think her nobler capacity is what i call her imperial character in which as from the throne of heaven she superintends all the several inferior legislatures and guides and controls them all without annihilating any as all these provincial legislatures are only coordinate to each other they ought all to be subordinate to her else they can neither preserve mutual peace nor hope for mutual justice nor effectually afford mutual assistance it is necessary to coerce the negligent to restrain the violent and to aid the weak and deficient by the overruling plenitude of her power she is never to intrude into the place of the others whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution but in order to enable parliament to answer all these ends of provident and beneficient superintendance her powers must be boundless  ibid  angles indeed there is nothing more prejudicial to the grandeur of buildings than to abound in angles a fault obvious in many and owing to an inordinate thirst for variety which whenever it prevails is sure to leave very little true taste  sublime and beautiful  artist a true artist should put a generous deceit on the spectators and effect the noblest designs by easy methods  ibid  art no work of art can he great but as it deceives to be otherwise is the prerogative of nature only a good eye will fix the medium betwixt an excessive length or height for the same objection lies against both and a short or broken quantity and perhaps it might be ascertained to a tolerable degree of exactness if it was my purpose to descend far into the particulars of any art  ibid  animals cries of such sounds as imitate the natural inarticulate voices of men or any animals in pain or danger are capable of conveying great ideas unless it be the wellknown voice of some creature on which we are used to look with contempt the angry tones of wild beasts are equally capable of causing a great and awful sensation  hinc exaudiri gemitus iroeque leonum vincla recusantum et sera sub nocte rudentum setigerique sues atque in praesepibus ursi saevire et formae magnorum ululare luporum it might seem that these modulations of sound carry some connection with the nature of the things they represent and are not merely arbitrary because the natural cries of all animals even of those animals with whom we have not been acquainted never fail to make themselves sufficiently understood this cannot be said of language the modifications of sound which may be productive of the sublime are almost infinite those i have mentioned are only a few instances to show on what principles they are all built  ibid  ally there are very few in the world who will not

good is to be found in the world because of the mixture of evil that will always be in it the smallness of the quantity in currency only heightens the value they who raise suspicions on the good on account of the behavior of ill men are of the party of the latter  ibid  action and motives virtue will catch as well as vice by contact and the public stock of honest manly principle will daily accumulate we are not too nicely to scrutinize motives as long as action is irreproachable it is enough and for a worthy man perhaps too much to deal out its infamy to convicted guilt and declared apostasy  ibid  administration consequences of an exterior administration an exterior administration chosen for its impotency or after it is chosen purposely rendered impotent in order to be rendered subservient will not be obeyed the laws themselves will not be respected when those who execute them are despised and they will be despised when their power is not immediate from the crown or natural in the kingdom never were ministers better supported in parliament parliamentary support comes and goes with office totally regardless of the man or the merit is government strengthened it grows weaker and weaker the popular torrent gains upon it every hour let us learn from our experience it is not support that is wanting to government but reformation when ministry rests upon public opinion it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant it has however some stability but when it stands upon private humor its structure is of stubble and its foundation is on quicksand i repeat it again  he that supports every administration subverts all government the reason is this the whole business in which a court usually takes an interest goes on at present equally well in whatever hands whether high or low wise or foolish scandalous or reputable there is nothing therefore to hold it firm to any one body of men or to any one consistent scheme of politics nothing interposes to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the passions of a court upon the servants of the public the system of administration is open to continual shocks and changes upon the principles of the meanest cabal and the most contemptible intrigue nothing can be solid and permanent all good men at length sly with horror from such a service men of rank and ability with the spirit which ought to animate such men in a free state while they decline the jurisdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes will for both cheerfully put themselves upon their country they will trust an inquisitive and distinguishing parliament because it does enquire and does distinguish if they act well they know that in such a parliament they will be supported against any intrigue if they act ill they know that no intrigue can protect them this situation however awful is honorable but in one hour and in the selfsame assembly without any assigned or assignable cause to be precipitated from the highest authority to the most marked neglect possibly into the greatest peril of life and reputation is a situation full of danger and destitute of honor it will be shunned equally by every man of prudence and every man of spirit  cause of the discontents of the nation  acquisition of property to be enabled to acquire the people without being servile must be tractable and obedient the magistrate must

 speech on mr foxs east india bill  beauty defined by beauty i mean that quality or those qualities in bodies by which they cause love or some passion similar to it i confine this definition to the merely sensible qualities of things for the sake of preserving the utmost simplicity in a subject which must always distract us whenever we take in those various causes of sympathy which attach us to any persons or things from secondary considerations and not from the direct force which they have merely on being viewed  sublime and beautiful  beauty the passion which belongs to generation merely as such is lust only this is evident in brutes whose passions are more unmixed and which pursue their purposes more directly than ours the only distinction they observe with regard to their mates is that of sex it is true that they stick severally to their own species in preference to all others but this preference i imagine does not arise from any sense of beauty which they find in their species as mr addison supposes but from a law of some other kind to which they are subject and this we may fairly conclude from their apparent want of choice amongst those objects to which the barriers of their species have confined them but man who is a creature adapted to a greater variety and intricacy of relation connects with the general passion the idea of some social qualities which direct and heighten the appetite which he has in common with all other animals and as he is not designed like them to live at large it is fit that he should have something to create a preference and fix his choice and this in general should be some sensible quality as no other can so quickly so powerfully or so surely produce its effect the object therefore of this mixed passion which we call love is the beauty of the sex men are carried to the sex in general as it is the sex and by the common law of nature but they are attached to particulars by personal beauty i call beauty a social quality for where women and men and not only they but when other animals give us a sense of joy and pleasure in beholding them and there are many that do so they inspire us with sentiments of tenderness and affection toward their persons we like to have them near us and we enter willingly into a kind of relation with them unless we should have strong reasons to the contrary but to what end in many cases this was designed i am unable to discover for i see no greater reason for a connection between man and several animals who are attired in so engaging a manner than between him and some others who entirely want this attraction or possess it in a far weaker degree but it is probable that providence did not make even this distinction but with a view to some great end though we cannot perceive distinctly what it is as his wisdom is not our wisdom nor our ways his ways  ibid  female beauty observe that part of a beautiful woman where she is perhaps the most beautiful about the neck and breasts the smoothness the softness the easy and insensible swell the variety of the surface which is never for the smallest space the same the deceitful maze through which the unsteady eye slides giddily without knowing where to fix or whither it is carried is not this a demonstration of that change of surface continual yet hardly perceptible at any point which forms one of the great constituents of beauty it gives me no small pleasure to find that i can strengthen my theory in this point by the opinion of the very ingenious mr hogarth whose idea of the line of beauty i take in general to be extremely just but the idea of variation without attending so accurately to the manner of the variation has led him to consider angular figures as beautiful these figures it is true vary greatly yet they vary in a sudden and broken manner and i do not find any natural object which is angular and at the same beautiful indeed few natural objects are entirely angular  ibid  beauty of the sex i need here say little of the fair sex where i believe the point will be easily allowed me the beauty of women is considerably owing to their weakness or delicacy and so even enhanced by their timidity a quality of mind analogous to it i would not here be understood to say that weakness betraying very bad health has any share in beauty but the ill effect of this is not because it is weakness but because the ill state of health which produces such weakness alters the other conditions of beauty the parts in such a case collapse the bright color the lumen purpureum juventae is gone and the fine variation is lost in wrinkles sudden breaks and right lines  ibid  bird description of a beautiful one the view of a beautiful bird will illustrate this observation here we see the head increasing insensibly to the middle from whence it lessens gradually until it mixes with the neck the neck loses itself in a larger swell which continues to the middle of the body when the whole decreases again to the tail the tail takes a new direction but it soon varies its new course it blends again with the other parts and the line is perpetually changing above below upon every side in this description i have before me the idea of a dove it agrees very well with most of the conditions of beauty it is smooth and downy its parts are to use that expression melted into one another you are represented with no sudden protuberance through the whole and yet the whole is continually changing  ibid  british freedom this act therefore has this distinguished evil in it that it is the first partial suspension of the habeas corpus that has been made the precedent which is always of very great importance is now established for the first time a distinction is made among the people within

conjoined i mean the sole purpose of all the separations and all conjunctions that have been lately made  a job i speak sir of the board of trade and plantations this board is a sort of temperate bed

the greatest variety of creeds and is the least disposed to sacrifice any one of them to another or to the whole it aims at taking in the whole circle of human desires and securing for them their fair enjoyment our legislature has been very closely connected in its most efficient part with individual feeling and with individual interest personal liberty the most lively of these feelings and the most important of these interests which in other european countries has rather arisen from the system of measures and the habitudes of life than from the laws of the state in which it flourished more from neglect than attention in england has been a direct object of government  regicide peace  bank paper at present the state of their treasury france sinks every day more and more in cash and swells more and more in fictitious representation when so little within or without is now found but paper the representative not of opulence but of want the creature not of credit but of power they imagine that our flourishing state in england is owing to that bank paper and not the bank paper to the flourishing condition of our commerce to the solidity of our credit and to the total exclusion of all idea of power from any part of the transaction they forget that in england not one shilling of papermoney of any description is received but of choice that the whole has had its origin in cash

change because in westminsterhall it is not  reflect on the revolution in france  bishops and canons with regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons and commendatory abbots i cannot find out for what reason some landed estates may not be held otherwise than by inheritance can any philosophy spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the comparative evil of having a certain and that too a large portion of landed property passing in succession through persons whose title to it is always in theory and often in fact an eminent degree of piety morals and learning a property which by its destination in their turn and on the score of merit gives to the noblest families renovation and support to the lowest the means of dignity and elevation a property the tenure of which is the performance of some duty whatever value you may choose to set upon that duty and the character of whose proprietors demands at least an exterior decorum and gravity of manners who are to exercise a generous but temperate hospitality part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for charity and who even when they fail in their trust when they slide from their character and degenerate into a mere common secular nobleman or gentleman are in no respect worse than those who may succeed them in their forfeited possessions is it better that estates should be held by those who have no duty than by those who have one  by those whose character and destination point to virtues than by those who have no rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own will and appetite nor are these estates held altogether in the character or with the evils supposed inherent in mortmain they pass from hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other no excess is good and therefore too great a proportion of landed property may be held officially for life but it does not seem to me of material injury to any commonwealth that there should exist some estates that have a chance of being acquired by other means than the previous acquisition of money  ibid  board of works the board of works which in the seven years preceding      has cost toward  00000 l and if i recollect rightly has not cost less in proportion from the beginning of the reign is under the very same description of all the other illcontrived establishments and calls for the very same reform we are to seek for the visible signs of all this expense  for all this expense we do not see a building of the size and importance of a pigeonhouse buckinghamhouse was reprised by a bargain with the public for one hundred thousand pounds and the small house at windsor has been if i mistake not undertaken since that account was brought before us the good works of that board of works are as carefully concealed as other good works ought to be they are perfectly invisible but though it is the perfection of charity to be concealed it is sir the property and glory of magnificence to appear and stand forward to the eye  oecon reform  bishoprics i know well enough that the bishoprics and cures under kingly and seignoral patronage as now they are in england and as they have been lately in france are sometimes acquired by unworthy methods  reflections on the revolution in france  british liberty an entailed inheritance from magna charta to the declaration of rights it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assist our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers and to be transmitted to our posterity as an estate specially belonging to the people of this kingdom without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right by this means our constitution preserves an unity in so great a diversity of its parts we have an inheritable crown an inheritable peerage and an house of commons and a people inheriting privileges franchises and liberties from a long line of ancestors  this policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection or rather the happy effect of following nature which is wisdom without reflection and above it a spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views people will not look forward to posterity who never look backward to their ancestors besides the people of england well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of conservation and a sure principle of transmission without at all excluding a principle of improvement it leaves acquisition free but it secures what it acquires whatever advantages are obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in a sort of family settlement grasped as in a kind of mortmain for ever by a constitutional policy working after the pattern of nature we receive we hold we transmit our government and our privileges in the same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives the institutions of policy the goods of fortune the gifts of providence are handed down to us and from us in the same course and order our political system is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order of the world and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts wherein by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race the whole at one time is never old or middleaged or young but in a condition of unchangeable constancy moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay fall renovation and progression  thus by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state in what we improve we are never wholly new in what we retain we are never wholly obsolete by adhering in this manner and on these principles to our forefathers we are guided not by the superstition of antiquarians but by the spirit of philosophic analogy in this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections keeping inseparable and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities our state our hearths our sepulchers and our altars  through the same plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial institutions and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason we have derived several other and those no small benefits from considering our liberties in the light of an inheritance always acting as if in the presence of canonized forefathers the spirit of freedom leading in itself to misrule and excess is tempered with an awful gravity this idea of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of habitual native dignity which prevents that upstart insolence almost inevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers of any distinction by this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom it carries an imposing and majestic aspect it has a pedigree and illustrating ancestors it has its bearings and its ensigns armorials it has its gallery of portraits its monumental inscriptions its records evidences and titles we procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men on account of their age and on account of those from whom they are descended  ibid  caution great caution to be used in the consideration of any complex matter the characters of nature are legible it is true but they are not plain enough to enable those who run to read them we must make use of a cautious i had almost said a timorous method of proceeding we must not attempt to fly when we can scarcely pretend to creep in considering any complex matter we ought to examine every distinct ingredient in the composition one by one and reduce every thing to the utmost simplicity since the condition of our nature binds us to a strict law and very narrow limits we ought afterward to reexamine the principles by the effect of the composition as well as the composition by that of the principles we ought to compare our subject with things of a similar nature and even with things of a contrary nature for discoveries may be and often are made by the contrast which would escape us on the single view  sublime and beautiful  constitution spirit of the british constitution do not entertain so weak an imagination as that your register and your bonds your affidavits and your sufferances your cockets and your clearances are what form the great securities of your commerce do not dream that your letters of office and your instructions and your suspending clauses are the things that hold together the great contexture of this mysterious whole these things do not make your government dead instruments passive tools as they are it is the spirit of the english communion

to beauty those colors which seem most appropriated to beauty are the milder of every sort light greens soft blues weak whites pink reds and violets if the colors be strong and vivid they are always diversified and the object is never of one strong color there are almost always such a number of them as in variegated flowers that the strength and glare of each is considerably abated in a fine complexion there is not only some variety in the coloring but the colors neither the red nor the white are strong and glaring besides they are mixed in such a manner and with such gradations that it is impossible to fix the bounds on the same principle it is that the dubious color in the necks and tails of peacocks and about the heads of drakes is so very agreeable in reality the beauty both of shape and coloring are as nearly related as we can well suppose it possible for things of such different natures to be  sublime and beautiful  christendom the states of the christian world the states of the christian world have grown up to their present magnitude in a great length of time and by a great variety of accidents they have been improved to what we see them with greater or less degrees of felicity and skill not one of them has been formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design as their constitutions are not systematical they have not been directed to any peculiar end eminently distinguished and superseding every other the objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety and have become in a manner infinite in all these old countries the state has been made to the people and not the people conformed to the state every state has pursued not only every sort of social advantage but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual his wants his wishes even his tastes have been consulted this comprehensive scheme virtually produced a degree of personal liberty in forms the most adverse to it that was found under monarchies styled absolute in a degree unknown to the ancient commonwealths from hence the powers of all our modern states meet in all their movements with some obstruction it is therefore no wonder that when these states are to be considered as machines to operate for some one great end that this dissipated and balanced force is not easily concentred or made to bear upon one point  regicide peace  constitution and commerce when i mr burke first devoted myself to the public service i considered how i should render myself fit for it and this i did by endeavoring to discover what it was that gave this country the rank it holds in the world i found that our prosperity and dignity arose principally if not solely from two sources our constitution and commerce both these i have spared no study to understand and no endeavor to support  the distinguishing part of our constitution is its liberty to preserve that liberty inviolate seems the particular duty and proper trust of a member of the house of commons but the liberty the only liberty i mean is a liberty connected with order that not only exists along with order and virtue but which cannot exist at all without them it inheres in good and steady government as in its substance and vital principle  the other source of our power is commerce of which you are so large a part and which cannot exist no more than your liberty without a connection with many virtues  speech to the electors of bristol  civil dissentions at this proposition i must pause a moment the thing seems a great deal too big for my ideas of jurisprudence it should seem to my way of conceiving such matters that there is a very wide difference in reason and policy between the mode of proceeding on the irregular conduct of scattered individuals or even of bands of men who disturb order within the state and the civil dissentions which may from time to time on great questions agitate the several communities which compose a great empire it looks to me to be narrow and pedantic to apply the ordinary ideas of criminal justice to this great public contest i do not know the method of drawing up an indictment against an whole people i cannot insult and ridicule the feelings of millions of my fellow creatures as sir edward coke insulted one excellent individual sir walter raleigh at the bar i am not ripe to pass sentence on the gravest public bodies entrusted with magistracies of great authority and dignity and charged with the safety of their fellowcitizens upon the very same title that i am i really think that for wise men this is not judicious for sober men not decent for minds tinctured with humanity not mild and merciful  speech on conciliation with america  clergy if your clergy or any clergy should show themselves vicious beyond the fair bounds allowed to human infirmity and to those professional faults which can hardly be separated from professional virtues though their vices never can countenance the exercise of oppression i do admit that they would naturally have the effect of abating very much of our indignation against the tyrants who exceed measure and justice in their punishment i can allow in clergymen through all their divisions some tenaciousness of their own opinion some overflowings of zeal for its propagation some predilection to their own state and office some attachment to the interest of their own corpse some preference to those who listen with docility to their doctrines beyond those who scorn and deride them i allow all this because i am a man who have to deal with men and who would not through a violence of toleration run into the greatest of all intolerance i must bear with infirmities until they fester into crimes  reflect on the revolution in france  church establishmemt first i beg leave to speak of our church establishment which is the first of our prejudices not a prejudice destitute of reason but involving in it profound and extensive wisdom i speak of it first it is first and last and midst in our minds for taking ground on that religious system of which we are now in possession we continue to act on the early received and uniformly continued sense of mankind that sense not only like a wise architect has built up the august fabric of states but like a provident proprietor to preserve the structure from profanation and ruin as a sacred temple purged from all the impurities of fraud and violence and injustice and tyranny has solemnly and for ever consecrated the commonwealth and all that officiate in it this consecration is made that all who administer in the government of men in which they stand in the person of god himself should have high and worthy notions of their function and destination that their hope should be full of immortality that they should not look to the paltry pelf of the moment nor to the temporary and transient praise of the vulgar but to a solid permanent existence in the permanent part of their nature and to a permanent fame and glory in the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world  such sublime principles ought to be infused into persons of exalted situations and religious establishments provided that may continually revive and enforce them every sort of moral every sort of civil every sort of politic institution aiding the rational and natural ties that connect the human understanding and affections to the divine are not more than necessary in order to build up that wonderful structure man whose prerogative it is to be in a great degree a creature of his own making and who when made as he ought to be made is destined to hold no trivial place in the creation but whenever man is put over men as the better nature ought ever to preside in that case more particularly he should as nearly as possible be approximated to his perfection  ibid  church and state the consecration of the state by a state religious establishment is necessary also to operate with an wholesome awe upon free citizens because in order to secure their freedom they must enjoy some determinate portion of power to them therefore a religion connected with the state and with their duty toward it becomes even more necessary than in such societies where the people by the terms of their subjection are confined to private sentiments and the management of their own family concerns all persons possessing any portion of power ought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that they act in trust and that they are to account for their conduct in that trust to the one great master author and founder of society  ibid  council such a body kings generally have as a council a monarchy may exist without it but it seems to be in the very essence of a republican government it holds a sort of middle place between the supreme power exercised by the people or immediately delegated from them and the mere executive  ibid  conscience it is thus and for the same end that they the regicides endeavor to destroy that tribunal of conscience which exists independently of edicts and decrees your despots govern by terror they know that he who fears god fears nothing else and therefore they eradicate from the mind through their voltaire their helvetius and the rest of that infamous gang hat only sort of fear which generates true courage their object is that their fellow citizens may be under the dominion of no awe but that of their committee of research and of their lantern  ibid  commons of great britain the power of the house of commons direct or indirect is indeed great and long may it be able to preserve its greatness and the spirit belonging to true greatness at the full and it will do so as long as it can keep the breakers of law in india from becoming the makers of law for england  ibid  observations on the nature and character of the house of commons see kings men i have my eye chiefly on the house of commons i hope i shall be indulged in a few observations on the nature and character of that assembly not with regard to its legal form and power but to its spirit and to the purposes it is meant to answer in the constitution  the house of commons was supposed originally to be no part of the standing government of this country it was considered as a control issuing immediately from the people and speedily to be resolved into the mass from whence it arose in this respect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower the capacity of a magistrate being transitory and that of a citizen permanent the latter capacity it was hoped would of course preponderate in all discussions not only between the people and the standing authority of the crown but between the people and the fleeting authority of the house of commons itself it was hoped that being of a middle nature between subject and government they would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest every thing that concerned the people than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legislature  whatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may have introduced this character can never be sustained unless the house of commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of the people at large it would among public misfortunes be an evil more natural and tolerable that the house of commons should be infected with every epidemical phrensy of the people as this would indicate some consanguinity some sympathy of nature with their constituents than that they should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors by this want of sympathy they would cease to be an house of commons for it is not the derivation of the power of that house from the people which makes it in a distinct sense their representative the king is the representative of the people so are the lords so are the judges they all are trustees for the people as well as the commons because no power is given for the sole sake of the holder and although government certainly is an institution of divine authority yet its forms and the persons who administer it all originate from the people  a popular origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction of a popular representative this belongs equally to all parts of government and in all forms the virtue spirit and essence of a house of commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the nation it was not ed to be a control upon the people as of late  been taught by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency it was designed as a control for the people other institutions have been formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses and they are i apprehend fully adequate to their object if not they ought to be made so the house of commons as it was never intended for the support of peace and subordination is miserably appointed for that service having no stronger weapon than its mace and no better officer than its sergeant at arms which it can command of its own proper authority a vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy an anxious care of public money an openness approaching toward facility to public complaint these seem to be the true characteristics of an house of commons but an addressing house of commons and a petitioning nation an house of commons full of confidence when the nation is plunged in despair in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence who vote thanks when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments who are eager to grant when the general voice demands account who in all disputes between the people and administration presume against the people who punish their disorders but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them this is an unnatural a monstrous state of things in this constitution such an assembly may be a great wise awful senate but it is not to any popular purpose an house of commons  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  carnatic see india history of hyder alis irruption into the eastern carnatic when at length hyder ali found that he had to do with men who either would sign no convention or whom no treaty and no signature could bind and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself he decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestined criminals a memorable example to mankind he resolved in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things to leave the whole carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no protection he became at length so confident of his force so collected in his might that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of the nabob of arcot he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction and compounding all the materials of fury havoc and desolation into one black cloud he hung for a while on the declivities of the mountains whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the carnatic then ensued a scene of woe the like of which no eye had seen no heart conceived and which no tongue can adequately tell all the horrors of war before known or heard of were mercy to that new havoc a storm of universal fire blasted every field consumed every house destroyed every temple the miserable inhabitants flying from their flaming villages in part were slaughtered others without regard to sex to age to the respect of rank or sacredness of function fathers torn from children husbands from wives enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry and amidst the goading spears of drivers and the trampling of pursuing horses were swept into captivity in an unknown and hostile land those who were able to evade this tempest fled to the walled cities but escaping from fire sword and exile they fell into the jaws of famine  the alms of the settlement in this dreadful exigency were certainly liberal and all was done by charity that private charity could do but it was a people in beggary it was a nation which stretched out its hands for food for months together these creatures of sufferance whose very excess and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of our austerest fasts silent patient resigned without sedition or disturbance almost without complaint perished by an hundred a day in the streets of madras every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the streets or on the glacis of tanjore and expired of famine in the granary of india i was going to awake your justice toward this unhappy part of our fellow citizens by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this plague of hunger of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of man this comes the nearest to our heart and is that wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is but i find myself unable to manage it with decorum these details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the hearers they are so humiliating to human nature itself that on better thoughts i find it more advisable to throw a pall over this hideous object and to leave it to your general conceptions  appendix no   report of the committee of assigned revenue for eighteen months without intermission this destruction raged from the gates of madras to the gates of tanjore and so completely did these masters in their art hyder ali and his more ferocious son absolve themselves of their impious vow that when the british armies traversed as they did the carnatic for hundreds of miles in all directions through the whole line of their march they did not see one man not one woman not one child not one fourfooted beast of any description whatever one dead uniform silence reigned over the whole region with the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few forts i wish to be understood as speaking literally i mean to produce to you more than three witnesses above all exception who will support this assertion in its full extent that hurricane of war passed through every part of the central provinces of the carnatic six or seven districts to the north and to the south and these not wholly untouched escaped the general ravage  speech on the nabob of arcots debts  carnatic described the carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to england figure to yourself mr speaker the land in whose representative chair you sit figure to yourself the form and fashion of your sweet and cheerful country from thames to trent north and south and from the irish to the german sea east and west emptied and embowelled may god avert the omen of our crimes by so accomplished a desolation extend your imagination a little further and then suppose your ministers taking a survey of this scene of waste and desolation what would be your thoughts if you should be informed that they were computing how much had been the amount of the excises how much the customs how much the land and malt tax in order that they should charge take it in the most favorable light for public service upon the relics of the satiated vengeance of relentless enemies the whole of what england had yielded in the most exuberant seasons of peace and abundance what would you call it to call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an image yet this very madness is the principle upon which the ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of the revenues of the carnatic when they were providing not supply for the establishments of its protection but rewards for the authors of its ruin  every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant the carnatic is a country that will soon recover and become instantly as prosperous as ever they think they are talking to innocents who will believe that by sowing of dragons teeth men may come up ready grown and ready armed they who will give themselves the trouble of considering for it requires no great reach of thought no very profound knowledge the manner in which mankind are increased and countries cultivated will regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded in order that the people after a long period of vexation and plunder may be in a condition to maintain government government must begin by maintaining them here the road to economy lies not through receipt but through expense and in that country nature has given no short cut to your object men must propagate like other animals by the mouth never did oppression light the nuptial torch never did extortion and usury spread out the genial bed  does any of you think that england so wasted would under such a nursing attendance so rapidly and cheaply recover but he is meanly acquainted with either england or india who does not know that england would a thousand times sooner resume population fertility and what ought to be the ultimate secretion from both revenue than such a country as the carnatic  the carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil the general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much otherwise it is some days since i moved that a curious and interesting map kept in the india house should be laid before you the india house is not yet in readiness to send it i have therefore brought down my own copy and there it lies for the use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of his attention it is indeed a noble map and of noble things but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations of avarice run mad in addition to what you know must be the case in every part of the world the necessity of a previous provision of habitation seed stock capital that map will show you that the use of the influences of heaven itself are in that country a work of art the carnatic is refreshed by few or no living brooks or running streams and it has rain only at a season but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual command this is the national bank of the carnatic on which it must have a perpetual credit or it perish irretrievably for that reason in the happier times of india a number almost incredible of reservoirs have been made in chosen places throughout the whole country they are formed for the greater part of mounds of earth and stones with sluices of solid masonry the whole constructed with admirable skill and labor and maintained at a mighty charge in the territory contained in that map mr barnards map of the jaghire alone i have been at the trouble of reckoning the reservoirs and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred from the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit from these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the fields and these watercourse again call for a considerable expense to keep them properly scoured and duly levelled taking the district in that map as a measure there cannot be in the carnatic and tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the larger and middling dimensions to say nothing of those for domestic services and the use of religious purification these are not the enterprises of your power nor in a style of magnificence suited to the taste of your minister these are the monuments of real kings who were the fathers of their people testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own these are the grand sepulchers built by ambition but by the ambition of an unsatiable benevolence which not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life had strained with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations the guardians the protectors the nourishers of mankind  what sir would a virtuous and enlightened ministry do on the view of the ruins of such works before them on the view of such a chasm of desolation as that which yawned in the midst of those countries to the north and south which still bore some vestiges of cultivation they would have reduced all their most necessary establishments they would have suspended the justest payments they would have employed every shilling derived from the producing to reanimate the powers of the unproductive parts while they were performing this fundamental duty whilst they were celebrating these mysteries of justice and humanity they would have told the corpse of fictitious creditors whose crimes were their claims that they must keep an awful distance that they must silence their inauspicious tongues that they must hold off their profane unhallowed paws from this holy work they would have proclaimed with a voice that should make itself heard that on every country the first creditor is the plow that this original indefeasible claim supersedes every other demand  this is what a wise and virtuous ministry would have done and said this therefore is what our minister could never think of saying or doing a ministry of another kind would have first improved the country and have thus laid a solid foundation for future opulence and future force but on this grand point of the restoration of the country there is not one syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers from the first to the last they felt nothing for a land desolated by fire sword and famine their sympathies took another direction they were touched with pity for bribery so long tormented with a fruitless itching of its palms their bowels yearned for usury that had long missed the harvest of its returning months they flt for peculation which had been for so many years ing in the dust of an empty treasury they were ed into compassion for rapine and oppression king their dry parched unbloody jaws these were the necessities for which they were studious to provide  ibid  contributions voluntary and what is the soil or climate where experience has not uniformly proved that the voluntary flow of heaped up plenty bursting from the weight of its own rich luxuriance has ever run with a more copious stream of revenue than could be squeezed from the dry husks of oppressed indigence by the straining of all the politic machinery in the world  speech on conciliation with america  crimes is confounding the order of crimes which whether by putting them from a higher part of the scale to the lower or from the lower to the higher is never done without dangerously disordering the whole frame of jurisprudence  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  convocation of the clergy we know that the convocation of the clergy had formerly been called and sat with nearly as much regularity to business as parliament itself it is now called for form only it sits for the purpose of making some polite ecclesiastical compliments to the king and when that grace is said retires and is heard of no more it is however a part of the constitution and may be called out into act and energy whenever there is occasion and whenever those who conjure up that spirit will choose to abide the consequences it is wise to permit its legal existence it is much wiser to continue it a legal existence only so truly has prudence constituted as the god of this lower world the entire dominion over every exercise of power committed into its hands and yet i have lived to see prudence and conformity to circumstances wholly set at naught in our late controversies and treated as if they were the most contemptible and irrational of all things i have heard it an hundred times very gravely alleged that in order to keep power in wind it was necessary by preference to exert it in those very points in which it was most likely to be resisted and the least likely to be productive of any advantage  ibid  cabinet the double it must be remembered that since the revolution until the period we are speaking of the influence of the crown had been always employed in supporting the ministers of state and in carrying on the public business according to their opinions but the party now in question is formed upon a very different idea it is to intercept the favor protection and confidence of the crown in the passage to its ministers it is to come between them and their importance in parliament it is to separate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies it is intended as control not the support of administration the machinery of this system is perplexed in its movements and false in its principle it is formed on a supposition that the king is something external to his government and that he may be honored and aggrandized even by its debility and disgrace the plan proceeds expressly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power it proceeds on the idea of weakening the state in order to strengthen the court the scheme depending entirely on distrust on disconnection on mutability by principle on systematic weakness in every particular member it is impossible that the total result should be substantial strength of any kind  as a foundation of their scheme the cabal have established a sort of rota in the court all sorts of parties by this means have been brought into administration from whence few have had the good fortune to escape without disgrace none at all without considerable losses in the beginning of each arrangement no professions of confidence and support are wanting to induce the leading men to engage but while the ministers of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power while they have all their canvas spread out to the wind and every sail filled with the fair and prosperous gale of royal favor in a short time they find they know not how a current which sets directly against them which prevents all progress and even drives them backwards they grow ashamed and mortified in a situation which by its vicinity to power only serves to remind them the more strongly of their insignificance they are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors or to see themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office with the loss of their dignity they lose their temper in their turn they grow troublesome to that cabal which whether it supports or opposes equally disgraces and equally betrays them it is soon found necessary to get rid of the heads of administration but it is of the heads only as there always are many rotten members belonging to the best connections it is not hard to persuade several to continue in office without their leaders by this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in and is only reduced in strength by its temporary possession of power besides if by accident or in course of changes that power should be recovered the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of these carcases which may serve to cover themselves in a day of danger they conclude not unwisely that such rotten members will become the first objects of disgust and resentment to their ancient connexions  they contrive to form in the outward administration two parties at the least which whilst they are tearing one another to pieces are both competitors for the favor and protection of the cabal and by their emulation contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior managers  a minister of state will sometimes keep himself totally estranged from all his colleagues will differ from them in their councils will privately traverse and publicly oppose their measures he will however continue in his employment instead of suffering any mark of displeasure he will be distinguished by an unbounded profusion of court rewards and caresses because he does what is expected and all that is expected from men in office he helps to keep some form of administration in being and keeps it at the same time as weak and divided as possible  however we must take care not to be mistaken or to imagine that such persons have any weight in their opposition when by them administration is convinced of its insignificancy they are soon to be convinced of their own they never are suffered to succeed in their opposition they and the world are to be satisfied that neither office nor authority nor property nor ability eloquence counsel skill or union are of the least importance but that the mere influence of the court naked of all support and destitute of all management is abundantly sufficient for all its own purposes  when any adverse connection is to be destroyed the cabal seldom appear in the work themselves they find out some person of whom the party entertains an high opinion such a person they endeavor to delude with various pretenses they teach him first to distrust and then to quarrel with his friends among whom by the same arts they excite a similar diffidence of him so that in this mutual fear and distrust he may suffer himself to be employed as the instrument in the change which is brought about afterward they are sure to destroy him in his turn by setting up in his place some person in whom he had himself reposed the greatest confidence and who serves to carry off a considerable part of his adherents  as in destroying their enemies they make use of instruments not immediately belonging to their corpse so in advancing their own friends they pursue exactly the same method to promote any of them to considerable rank or emolument they commonly take care that the recommendation shall pass through the hands of the oftensible ministry such a recommendation might however appear to the world as some proof of the credit of ministers and some means of increasing their strength to prevent this the persons so advanced are directed in all companies industriously to declare that they are under no obligations whatsoever to administration that they have received their office from another quarter that they are totally free and independent  when the faction has any job of lucre to obtain or of vengeance to perpetrate their way is to select for the execution those very persons to whose habits friendships principles and declarations such proceedings are publicly known to be the most adverse at once to render the instruments the more odious and therefore the more dependent and to prevent the people from ever reposing a confidence in any appearance of private friendship or public principle  if the administration seem now and then from remissness or from fear of making themselves disagreeable to suffer any popular excesses to go unpunished the cabal immediately sets up some creature of theirs to raise a clamor against the ministers as having shamefully betrayed the dignity of government then they compel the ministry to become active in conferring rewards and honors on the persons who have been the instruments of their disgrace and after having first vilified them with the higher orders for suffering the laws to sleep over the licentiousness of the populace they drive them in order to make amends for their former inactivity to some act of atrocious violence which renders them completely abhorred by the people  they who remember the riots which attended the middlesex election the opening of the present parliament and the transactions relative to saint georges fields will not be at a loss for an application of these remarks  that this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution its members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices of the state they are distributed with art and judgment through all the secondary but efficient departments of office and through the households of all the branches of the royal family so as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne and on the other to forward or frustrate the execution of any measure according to their own interests for with the credit and support which they are known to have though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary they possess all the influence of the highest posts and they dictate publicly in almost every thing even with a parade of superiority whenever they dissent as it often happens from their nominal leaders the trained part of the senate instinctively in the secret is sure to follow them provided the leaders sensible of their situation do not of themselves recede in time from their most declared opinions this latter is generally the case it will not be conceivable to any one who has not seen it what pleasure is taken by the cabal in rendering these heads of office thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous and when they are become so they have then the best chance for being well supported  the members of the court faction are fully indemnified for not holding places on the slippery heights of the kingdom not only by the lead in all affairs but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less conspicuous but very advantageous situations their places are in express legal tenure or in effect all of them for life whilst the first and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like tennis balls the sport of a blind and insolent caprice no minister dares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body if an attempt be made upon one of this corpse immediately he flies to sanctuary and pretends to the most inviolable of all promises no convenience of public arrangement is available to remove any one of them from the specific situation he holds and the slightest attempt upon one of them by the most powerful minister is a certain preliminary to his own destruction  conscious of their independence they bear themselves with a lofty air to the exterior ministers like janissaries they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their servitude they may act just as they please provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their institution it is therefore not at all wonderful that people should be so desirous of adding themselves to that body in which they may possess and reconcile satisfactions the most alluring and seemingly the most contradictory enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of independence and all the gross lucre and sat emoluments of

more affecting idea than pain because there are very few pains however equisite which are not preferred to death nay what generally make pain itself if i may say so is that it is considered as an emissary of this king of terrors  sublime and beautiful  darkness darkness is more productive of sublime ideas than light our great poet was convinced of this and indeed so full was he of this idea so entirely possessed with the power of a wellmanaged darkness that in describing the appearance of the deity amidst that profusion of magnificent images which the grandeur of his subject provokes him to pour out upon every side he is far from forgetting the obscurity which surrounds the most incomprehensible of all beings but  with the majesty of darkness round circles his throne and what is no less remarkable our author had the secret of preserving this idea even when he seemed to depart the farthest from it when he describes the light and glory which flows from the divine presence a light which by its very excess is converted into a species of darkness  dark with excessive light thy skirts appear here is an idea not only poetical in an high degree but strictly and philosophically just extreme light by overcoming the organs of sight obliterates all objects so as in its effect exactly to resemble darkness after looking for some time at the sun two black spots the impression which it leaves seem to dance before our eyes thus are two ideas as opposite as can be imagined reconciled in the extremes of both and both in spite of their opposite nature brought to concur in producing the sublime and this is not the only instance wherein the opposite extremes operate equally in favor of the sublime which in all things abhors mediocrity  ibid  dignity dignity hitherto has belonged to the mode of proceeding not to the matter of a treaty never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peace no never by the most violent of conquerors indemnity is capable of some estimate dignity has no standard  regicide peace  debt civil there are two capital faults in our law with relation to civil debts one is that every man is presumed solvent a presumption in innumerable cases directly against truth therefore the debtor is ordered on a supposition of ability and fraud to be coerced his liberty until he makes payment by this means in all cases of civil insolvency without a pardon from his creditor he is to be imprisoned for life  and thus a miserable mistaken invention of artificial science operates to change a civil into a criminal judgment and to scourge misfortune or indiscretion with a punishment which the law does not inflict on the greatest crimes  the next fault is that the inflicting of that punishment is not on the opinion of an equal and public judge but is referred to the arbitrary discretion of a private nay interested and irritated individual he who formally is and substantially ought to be the judge is in reality no more than ministerial a mere executive instrument of a private man who is at once judge and party every idea of judicial order is subverted by this procedure if the insolvency be no crime why is it punished with arbitrary imprisonment if it be a crime why is it delivered into private hands to pardon without discretion or to punish without mercy and without measure  speech previous to

age they were formed sir on the principle of purveyance and receipt in kind in former days when the household was vast and the supply scanty and precarious the royal purveyors sallying forth from under the gothic portcullis to purchase provision with power and prerogative instead of money brought home the plunder of an hundred markets and all that could be seized from a flying and hiding

govern there without society and without sympathy with the natives they have no more social habits with the people than if they still resided in england nor indeed any species of intercourse but that which is necessary to making a sudden fortune with a view to a remote settlement animated with all the avarice of age and all the impetuosity of youth they roll in one after another wave after wave

even ground will never work such an effect as a tower an hundred yards high or a rock or mountain of that altitude i am apt to imagine likewise that height is less grand than depth and that we are more struck at looking down from a precipice than looking up at an object of equal height but of that i am not very positive a perpendicular has more force in forming the sublime than an inclined plain and the effects of a rugged and broken surface seem stronger than where it is smooth and polished it would carry us out of our way to enter in this place into the cause of these appearances but certain it is they afford a large and fruitful field of speculation however it may not be amiss to add to these remarks upon magnitude that as the great extreme of dimension is sublime so the last extreme of littleness is in some measure sublime likewise when we attend to the infinite divisibility of matter when we pursue animal life into these excessively small and yet organized beings that escape the nicest inquisition of the sense when we push our discoveries yet downward and consider those creatures so many degrees yet smaller and the still diminishing scale of existence in tracing which the imagination is lost as well as the sense we become amazed and confounded at the wonders of minuteness nor can we distinguish in its effect this extreme of littleness from the vast itself for division must be infinite as well as addition because the idea of a perfect unity can no more be arrived at than that of a complete whole to which nothing can be added  sublime and beautiful  eye i think then that the beauty of the eye consists first in its clearness what colored eye shall please most depends a good deal on particular fancies but none are pleased with an eye whose water to use that term is dull and muddy we are pleased with the eye in this view on the principle upon which we like diamonds clear water glass and such like transparent substances secondly the motion of the eye contributes to its beauty by continually shifting its direction but a slow and languid motion is more beautiful than a brisk one the latter is enlivening the former lovely thirdly with regard to the union of the eye with the neighboring parts it is to hold the same rule that is given of other beautiful ones it is not to make a strong deviation from the line of the neighboring parts nor to verge into any exact geometrical figure  ibid  ecclesiastics our education is in a manner wholly in the hands of ecclesiastics and in all stages from infancy to manhood even when our youth leaving schools and universities enter that most important period of life which begins to link experience and study together and when with that view they visit other countries instead of old domestics whom we have seen as governors to principal men from other parts threefourths of those who go abroad with our young nobility and gentlemen are ecclesiastics not as austere masters nor as mere followers but as friends and companions of a graver character and not seldom persons as well born as themselves with them as relations they most commonly keep up a close connection through life by this connection we conceive that we attach our gentlemen to the church and we liberalize the church by an intercourse with the leading characters of the country  reflections on the revolution in france  english character four hundred years have gone over us but i believe we are not materially changed since that period thanks to our sullen resistance to innovation thanks to the cold sluggishness of our national character we still bear the stamp of our forefathers we have not as i conceive lost the generosity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century nor as yet have we subtilized ourselves into savages we are not the converts of rousseau we are not the disciples of voltaire helvetius has made no progress amongst us atheists are not our preachers madmen are not our lawgivers we know that we have made no discoveries and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality nor many in the great principles of government nor in the ideas of liberty which were understood long before we were born altogether as well as they will be after the grave has heaped its mould upon our presumption and the silent tomb shall have imposed its law on our pert loquacity in england we have not yet been completely embowelled of our natural entrails we still feel within us and we cherish and cultivate those inbred sentiments which are the faithful guardians the active monitors of our duty the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals we have not been drawn and trussed in order that we may be filled like stuffed birds in a museum with chaff and rags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man we preserve the whole of our feelings still native and entire unsophisticated by pedantry and infidelity we have real hearts of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms we fear god we look up with awe to kings with affection to parliaments with duty to magistrates with reverence to priests and with respect to nobility the english are i conceive misrepresented in a letter published in one of the papers by a gentleman thought to be a dissenting minister  when writing to dr price of the spirit which prevails at paris he says the spirit of the people in this place has abolished all the proud distinctions which the king and nobles had usured in their minds whether they talk of the king the noble or the priest their whole language is that of the most enlightened and liberal amongst the english if this gentleman means to confine the terms enlightened and liberal to one set of men in england it may be true it is not generally so  because when such ideas are brought before our minds it is natural to be so affected because all other feelings are false and spurious and tend to corrupt our minds to vitiate our primary morals to render us unfit for rational liberty and by teaching us a servile licentious and abandoned insolence to be our low sport for a few holidays to make us perfectly fit for and justly deserving of slavery through the whole course of our lives  you see sir that in this enlightened age i am bold enough to confess that we are generally men of untaught feelings that instead of casting away all our old prejudices we cherish them to a very considerable degree and to take more shame to ourselves we cherish them because they are prejudices and the longer they have lasted and the more generally they have prevailed the more we cherish them we are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because we suspect that this stock in each man is small and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages many of our men of speculation instead of exploding general prejudices employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them if they find what they seek and they seldom fail they think it more wise to continue the prejudice with the reason involved than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to leave nothing but the naked reason because prejudice with its reason has a motive to give action to that reason and an affection which will give it permanence prejudice is of ready application in the emergency it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical puzzled and unresolved prejudice renders a mans virtue his habit and not a series of unconnected acts through just prejudice his duty becomes a part of his nature  ibid  france old constitution of france  consequences of the revolution you might if you pleased have profited of our example and have given to your recovered freedom a correspondent dignity your privileges though discontinued were not lost to memory your constitution it is true whilst you were out of possession suffered waste and dilapidation but you possessed in some parts the walls and in all the foundations of a noble and venerable castle you might have repaired those walls you might have built on those old foundations your constitution was suspended before it was perfected but you had the elements of a constitution very nearly as good as could be wished in your old states you possessed that variety of parts corresponding with the various descriptions of which your community was happily composed you had all that combination and all that opposition of interests you had that action and counteraction which in the natural and in the political world from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers draws out the harmony of the universe these opposed and conflicting interests which you considered as so great a blemish in your old and in our present constitution interpose a salutary check to all precipitate resolutions they render deliberation a matter not of choice but of necessity they make all change a subject of compromise which naturally begets moderation they produce temperaments preventing the sore evil of harsh crude unqualified reformations and rendering all the headlong exertions of arbitrary power in the few or in the many for ever impracticable through that diversity of members and interests general liberty had as many securities as there were separate views in the several orders whilst by pressing down the whole by the weight of a real monarchy the separate parts would have been prevented from warping and starting from their allotted places  you had all these advantages in your ancient states but you chose to act as if you had never been molded into civil society and had every thing to begin anew you began ill because you began by despising every thing that belonged to you you set up your trade without a capital if the last generations of your country appeared without much luster in your eyes you might have passed them by and derived your claims from a more early race of ancestors under a pious predilection for those ancestors your imaginations would have realized in them a standard of virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the hour and you would have risen with the example to whose imitation you aspired respecting your forefathers you would have been taught to respect yourselves you would not have chosen to consider the french as a people of yesterday as a nation of lowborn servile wretches until the emancipating year of      in order to furnish at the expense of your honor an excuse to your apologists here for several enormities of yours you would not have been content to be represented as a gang of maroon slaves suddenly broke loose from the house of bondage and therefore to be pardoned for your abuse of the liberty to which you were not accustomed and ill fitted would it not my worthy friend have been wiser to have you thought what i for one always thought you a generous and gallant nation long misled to your disadvantage by your high and romantic sentiments of fidelity honor and loyalty that events had been unfavourable to you but that you were not enslaved through any illiberal or servile disposition that in your most devoted submission you were actuated by a principle of public spirit and that it was your country you worshipped in the person of your king had you made it to be understood that in the delusion of this amiable error you had gone further than your wise ancestors that you were resolved to resume your ancient privileges whilst you preserved the spirit of your ancient and your recent loyalty and honor or if diffident of yourselves and not clearly discerning the almost obliterated constitution of your ancestors you had looked to your neighbors in this land who had kept alive the ancient principles and models of the old common law of europe meliorated and adapted to its present state  by following wise examples you would have given new examples of wisdom to the world you would have rendered the cause of liberty venerable in the eyes of every worthy mind in every nation you would have shamed despotism from the earth by showing that freedom was not only reconcilable but as when well disciplined it is auxiliary to law you would have had an unoppressive but a productive revenue you would have had a flourishing commerce to feed it you would have had a free constitution a potent monarchy a disciplined army a reformed and venerated clergy a mitigated but spirited nobility to lead your virtue not to overlay it you would have had a liberal order of commons to emulate and to recruit that nobility you would have had a protected satisfied laborious and obedient people taught to seek and to recognize the happiness that is to be found by virtue in all conditions in which consists the true moral equality of mankind and not in that monstrous fiction which by inspiring false ideas and vain expectations into men destined to travel in the obscure walk of laborious life serves only to aggravate and imbitter that real inequality which it never can remove and which the order of civil life establishes as much for the benefit of those whom it must leave in an humble state as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more splendid but not more happy you had a smooth and easy career of felicity and glory laid open to you beyond any thing recorded in the history of the world but you have shown that difficulty is good for man  compute your gains see what is got by those extravagant and presumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all their predecessors and all their contemporaries and even to despise themselves until the moment in which they became truly despicable by following those false lights france has bought undisguised calamities at a higher price than any nation has purchased the most unequivocal blessings france has bought poverty by crime france has not sacrificed her virtue to her interest but she has abandoned her interest that she might prostitute her virtue all other nations have begun the fabric of a new government or the reformation of an old by establishing originally or by enforcing with greater exactness some rites or other of religion all other people have laid the foundations of civil freedom in severer manners and a system of a more austere and masculine morality france when she let loose the reins of regal authority doubled the license of a ferocious dissoluteness in manners and of an insolent irreligion in opinions and practices and has extended through all ranks of life as if she were communicating some privilege or laying open some secluded benefit all the unhappy corruptions that usually were the disease of wealth and power this is one of the new principles of equality in france  france by the perfidy of her leaders has utterly disgraced the tone of lenient council in the cabinets of princes and disarmed it of its most potent topics she has sanctified the dark suspicious maxims of tyrannous distrust and taught kings to tremble at what will hereafter be called the delusive plausibilities of moral politicians sovereigns will consider those who advise them to place an unlimited confidence in their people as subverters of their thrones as traitors who aim at their destruction by leading their easy goodnature under specious pretenses to admit combinations of bold and faithless men into a participation of their power this alone if there were nothing else is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind remember that your parliament of paris told your king that in calling the states together he had nothing to fear but the prodigal excess of their zeal in providing for the support of the throne it is right that these men should hide their heads it is right that they should bear their part in the ruin which their counsel has brought on their sovereign and their country such sanguine declarations tend to lull authority asleep to encourage it rashly to engage in perilous adventures of untried policy to neglect those provisions preparations and precautions which distinguish benevolence from imbecility and without which no man can answer for the salutary effect of any abstract plan of government or of freedom for want of these they have seen the medicine of the state corrupted into its poison they have seen the french rebel against a mild and lawful monarch with more fury outrage and insult than ever any people has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper or the most sanguinary tyrant their resistance was made to concession their revolt was from protection their blow was aimed at an hand holding out graces favors and immunities  this was unnatural the rest is in order they have found their punishment in their success laws overturned tribunals subverted industry without vigor commerce expiring the revenue unpaid ye the people impoverished a church pillaged and a state not relieved civil and military anarchy made the constitution of the kingdom every thing human and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit and national bankruptcy the consequence and to crown all the paper securities of new precarious tottering power the discredited paper securities of impoverished fraud and beggared rapine held out as a currency for the support of an empire in lieu of the two great recognized species that represent the lasting conventional credit of mankind which disappeared and hid themselves in the earth from whence they came when the principle of poverty whose creatures and representatives they are systematically subverted  reflections on the revolution in france  french bishops you had before your revolution about one hundred and twenty bishops a few of them were men of eminent sanctity when we talk of the heroic of course we talk of rare virtue i believe the instances of eminent depravity may be as rare amongst them as those of transcendent goodness examples of avarice and of licentiousness may be picked out i do not question it by those who delight in the investigation which leads to such discoveries a man as old as i am will not be astonished that several in every description do not lead that perfect life of selfdenial with regard to wealth or to pleasure which is wished for by all by some expected but by none exacted with more rigor than by those who are the most attentive to their own interests or the most indulgent to their own passions when i was in france i am certain that the number of vicious prelates was not great certain individuals among them not distinguishable for the regularity of their lives made some amends for their want of the severe virtues in their possession of the liberal and were endowed with qualities which made them useful in the church and state i am told that with few exceptions louis the sixteenth had been more attentive to character in his promotions to that rank than his immediate predecessor and i believe as some spirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign that it may be true but the present ruling power has shown a disposition only to plunder the church it has punished all prelates which is to favor the vicious at least in point of reputation it has made a degrading pensionary establishment to which no man of liberal ideas or liberal condition will destine his children it must settle into the lowest classes of the people as with you the inferior clergy are not numerous enough for their duties as these duties are beyond measure minute and toilsome as you have left no middle classes of clergy at their ease in future nothing of science or erudition can exist in the gallican church to complete the project without the least attention to the rights of patrons the assembly has provided in future an elective clergy an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical profession all men of sobriety all who can pretend to independence in their function or their conduct and which will throw the whole direction of the public mind into the hands of a set of licentious bold crafty factious flattering wretches of such condition and such habits of life as will make their contemptible pensions in comparison of which the stipend of an exciseman is lucrative and honorable an object of low and illiberal intrigue those officers whom they still call bishops are to be elected to a provision comparatively mean through the same arts that is electioneering arts by men of all religious tenets that are known or can be invented the new lawgivers have not ascertained any thing whatsoever concerning their qualifications relative either to doctrine or to morals no more than they have done with regard to the subordinate clergy nor does it appear but that both the higher and the lower may at their discretion practice or preach any mode of religion or irreligion that they please i do not yet see what the jurisdiction of bishops over their subordinates is to be or whether they are to have any jurisdiction at all  ibid  french clergy when my occasions took me into france toward the close of the late reign the clergy under all their forms engaged a considerable part of my curiosity so far from finding except from one set of men not then very numerous though very active the complaints and discontents against that body which some publications had given me reason to expect i perceived little or no public or private uneasiness on their account on further examination i found the clergy in general persons of moderate minds and decorous manners i include the seculars and the regulars of both sexes i had not the good fortune to know a great many of the parochial clergy but in general i received a perfectly good account of their morals and of their attention to their duties with some of the higher clergy i had a personal acquaintance and of the rest in that class very good means of information they were almost all of them persons of noble birth they resembled others of their own rank and where there was any difference it was in their favor they were more fully educated than the military noblesse so as by no means to disgrace their profession by ignorance or by want of fitness for the exercise of their authority they seemed to me beyond the clerical character liberal and open with the hearts of gentlemen and men of honor neither insolent nor servile in their manners and conduct they seemed to me rather a superior class a set of men amongst whom you would not be surprised to find a fenelon i saw among the clergy in paris many of the description are not to be met with any where men of great learning and candor and i had reason to believe that this description was not confined to paris what i found in other places i know was accidental and therefore to be presumed a fair sample i spent a few days in a provincial town where in the absence of the bishop i passed my evenings with three clergymen his vicars general persons who would have done honor to any church they were all well informed two of them of deep general and extensive erudition ancient and modern oriental and western particularly in their own profession they had a more extensive knowledge of our english divines than i expected and they entered into the genius of those writers with a critical accuracy one of these gentlemen is since dead the abbe morangis i pay this tribute without reluctance to the memory of that noble reverend learned and excellent person and i should do the same with equal cheerfulness to the merits of the others who i believe are still living if i did not fear to hurt those whom i am unable to serve  some of these ecclesiastics of rank are by all titles persons deserving of general respect they are deserving of gratitude from me and from many english if this letter should ever come into their hands i hope they will believe there are those of our nation who feel for their unmerited fall and for the cruel confiscation of their fortunes with no common sensibility what i say of them is a testimony as far as one feeble voice can go which i owe to truth whenever the question of this unnatural persecution is concerned i will pay it no one shall prevent me from being just and grateful the time is fitted for the duty and it is particularly becoming to show our justice and gratitude when those who have deserved well of us and of mankind are laboring under popular obloquy and the persecutions of oppressive power  ibid  french nobility but the nobility of france are degenerated since the days of henry the fourth  this is possible but it is more than i can believe to be true in any great degree i do not pretend to know france as correctly as some others but i have endeavored through my whole life to make myself acquainted with human nature otherwise i should be unfit to take even my humble part in the service of mankind in that study i could not pass by a vast portion of our nature as it appeared modified in a country but twentyfour miles from the shore of this island on my best observation compared with my best enquiries i found your nobility for the greater part composed of men of an high spirit and of a delicate sense of honor both with regard to themselves individually and with regard to their whole corpse over whom they kept beyond what is common in other countries a censorial eye they were tolerably wellbred very officious humane and hospitable in their conversation frank and open with a good military tone and reasonably tinctured with literature particularly of the authors in their own language many had pretensions far above this description i speak of those who were generally met with  ibid  french gentlemen the great object of your tyrants is to destroy the gentlemen of france and for that purpose they destroy to the best of their power all the effect of those relations which may render considerable men powerful or even safe to destroy that order they vitiate the whole community that no means may exist of confederating against their tyranny by the false sympathies of this nouvelle eloise they endeavor to subvert those principles of domestic trust and fidelity which form the discipline of social life they propagate principles by which every servant may think it if not his duty at least his privilege to betray his master by these principles every considerable father of a family loses the sanctuary of his house debet sua cuique domus esse perfugium tu tissimum says the law which your legislators have taken so much pains first to decry then to repeal they destroy all the tranquillity and security of domestic life turning the asylum of the house into a gloomy prison where the father of the family must drag out a miserable existence endangered in proportion to the apparent means of his safety where he is worse than solitary in a crowd of domestics and more apprehensive from his servants and inmates than from the hired bloodthirsty mob without doors who are ready to pull him to the lantern  ibid  french manners it is not clear whether in england we learned those grand and decorous principles and manners of which considerable traces yet remain from you or whether you took them from us but to you i think we trace them best you seem to me to be  gentis incunabula nostrae france has always more or less influenced manners in england and when your fountain is choked up and polluted the stream will not run long or not run clear with us or perhaps with any nation this gives all europe in my opinion but too close and connected a concern in what is done in france excuse me therefore if i have dwelt too long on the atrocious spectacle of the sixth of october      or have given too much scope to the reflections which have arisen in my mind on occasion of the most important of all revolutions which may be dated from that day i mean a revolution in sentiments manners and moral opinions as things now stand with every thing respectable destroyed without us and an attempt to destroy within us every principle of respect one is almost forced to apologize for harboring the common feelings of men  ibid  french assembly already there appears a poverty of conception a coarseness and vulgarity in all the proceedings of the assembly and of all their instructors their liberty is not liberal their science is presumptuous ignorance their humanity is savage and brutal  the assembly their organ acts before them the farce of deliberation with as little decency as liberty they act like the comedians of a fair before a riotous audience they act amidst the tumultuous cries of a mixed mob of ferocious men and of women lost to shame who according to their insolent fancies direct control applaud explode them and sometimes mix and take their seats amongst them domineering over them with a strange mixture of servile petulance and proud presumptuous authority as they have inverted order in all things the gallery is in the place of the house this assembly which overthrows kings and kingdoms has not even the physiognomy and aspect of a grave legislative body  nec color imperii nec frons erat ulla senatus they have a power given to them like that of the evil principle to subvert and destroy but none to construct except such machines as may be fitted for further subversion and further destruction  ibid  french clubs in these meetings of all sorts every counsel in proportion as it is daring and violent and perfidious is taken for the mark of superior genius humanity and compassion are ridiculed as the fruits of superstition and ignorance tenderness to individuals is considered as treason to the public liberty is always to be estimated perfect as property is rendered insecure amidst assassination massacre and confiscation perpetrated or meditated they are forming plans for the good order of future society embracing in their arms the carcases of base criminals and promoting their relations on the title of their offenses they drive hundreds of virtuous persons to the same end by forcing them to subsist by beggary or by crime  ibid  french faction the faction is not local or territorial it is a general evil where it least appears in action it is still full of life in its sleep it recruits its strength and prepares its exertion its spirit lies deep in the corruptions of our common nature the social order which restrains it feeds it it exists in every country in europe and among all orders of men in every country who look up to france as to a common head the center is there the circumference is the world of europe wherever the race of europe may be settled every where else the faction is militant in france it is triumphant in france is the bank of deposit and the bank of circulation of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every state it will be a folly scarcely deserving of pity and too mischievous for contempt to think of restraining it in any other country whilst it is predominant there  regicide peace  french philosophers the politicians soon found that they could not do without the philosophers and the philosophers soon made them sensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with means of conquest first at home and then abroad the philosophers were the active internal agitators and supplied the spirit and principles the second gave the general direction  sometimes the one predominated in the composition sometimes the other the only difference between them was in the necessity of concealing the general design for a time and in dealing with foreign nations the fanatics going straight forward and openly the politicians by the surer mode of zigzag in the course of events this among other causes produced fierce and bloody contentions between them but at the bottom they thoroughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and irreligion and substantially in all the means of promoting these ends  ibid  france ancient you may call this france if you please but of the ancient france nothing remains but its dangerous and central geography its iron frontier its spirit of ambition its audacity of enterprise its perplexing intrigue these and these alone remain and they remain heightened in their principle and augmented in their means all the old correctives whether of virtue or of weakness which existed in the old monarchy are gone no single corrective is to be foung in the whole body of the new institutions  how should such a thing be found there when every thing has been chosen with care and selection to forward all those ambitious designs and dispositions not to control them the whole is a body of ways and means for the supply of dominion without one heterogeneous particle in it  ibid  france state of in the year    0 when i look to the other side of the water i cannot help recollecting what pyrrhus said on reconnoitring the roman camp these barbarians have nothing barbarous in their discipline when i look as i have pretty carefully looked into the proceedings of the french king i am sorry to say it i see nothing of the character and genius of arbitrary finance none of the bold frauds of bankrupt power none of the wild struggles and plunges of despotism in distress no lopping off from the capital of debt no suspension of interest no robbery under the name of loan no raising the value no debasing the substance of the coin i see neither louis the fourteenth nor louis the fifteenth on the contrary i behold with astonishment rising before me by the very hands of arbitrary power and in the very midst of war and confusion a regular methodical system of public credit i behold a fabric laid on the natural and solid foundations of trust and confidence among men and rising by fair gradations order over order according to the just rules of symmetry and art what a reverse of things principle method regularity economy frugality justice to individuals and care of the people are the resources with which france makes war upon great britain god avert the omen but if we should see any genius in war and politics arise in france to second what is done in the bureau  i turn my eyes from the consequences  oecon reform  france body politic of the body politic of france existed in the majesty of its throne in the dignity of its nobility in the honor of its gentry in the sanctity of its clergy in the reverence of its magistracy in the weight and consideration due to its landed property in the respect due to its moveable substance represented by the corporations of the kingdom in all countries all these particular moleculae united form the great mass of what is truly the body politic they are so many deposits and receptacles of justice because they can only exist by justice nation is a moral essence not a geographical arrangement or a denomination of the nomenclator france though out of her territorial possession exists because the sole possible claimant i mean the proprietary and the government to which the proprietary adheres exists and claims god forbid that if you were expelled from your house by ruffians and assassins that i should call the material walls doors and windows of  the ancient and honorable family of  am i to transfer to the intruders who not content to turn you out naked to the world would rob you of your very name all the esteem and respect i owe to you  reflections on the revolution in france  france republics of algiers and france compared i know something of the constitution and composition of this very extraordinary republic it has a constitution i admit similar to the present tumultuous military tyranny of france by which an handful of obscure russians domineer over a fertile country and a brave people for the composition too i admit the algerine community resembles that of france being the very scum scandal disgrace and pest of the turkish asia the grand seignior to disburthen the country suffers the dey to recruit in his dominions the corpse of janissaries or asaphs which form the directory or council of elders of the african republic one and indivisible but notwithstanding this resemblance which i allow i never shall so far injure the janissarian republic of algiers as to put it in comparison for every sort of crime turpitude and oppression with the jacobin republic of paris there is no question with me to which of the two i should choose to be a neighbor or a subject but situated as i am i am in no danger of becoming to algiers either the one or the other it is not so in my relation to the atheistical fanatics of france have the gentlemen who borrowed this happy parallel no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very same evil at an immense distance and when it is at your door when its power is enormous as when it is comparatively as feeble as its distance is remote and when there is a barrier of languages and usages which prevents your being corrupted through certain old correspondences and habitudes which cannot for a long time be so wholly taken away as not to make many of your people susceptible of contagion from horrible novelties that are introduced into every thing else i can contemplate without horror a royal or a national tiger on the borders of pegu i can look at him with an easy curiosity as prisoner within bars in the menagerie of the tower but if by habeas corpus or otherwise he was to come into the lobby of the house of commons whilst your door was open any of you would be more stout than wise who would not gladly make his escape out of the back windows this ambassador from bengal would disperse you sooner than a dissolution by royal prerogative i certainly should dread more from a wild cat in my bedchamber than from all the lions that roar in the deserts behind algiers but in this parallel it is the cat that is at a distance and the lions and tigers that are in our antichambers and our lobbies algiers is not near algiers is not powerful algiers is not our neighbor algiers is not infectious algiers whatever it may be is not an old creation and we have good data to calculate all the mischief to be expected from it when i find algiers transferred to calais i will tell you what i think of that point in the mean time the case quoted from the algerine reports will not apply as authority we shall put it out of court and so far as that goes let the counsel for the jacobin peace take nothing by their motion  regicide peace  france president of the french directory a strange uncouth thing a theatrical figure of the opera his head shaded with three colored plumes his body fantastically habited strutted from the back scenes and after a short speech in the mockheroic falsetto of stupid tragedy delivered the gentleman who came to make the representation into the custody of a guard with directions not to lose sight of him for a moment and then ordered him to be sent from paris in two hours  ibid  france theatrical amusements in whilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals and silent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion no fewer than ten theaters were kept open at public expense at one time i have reckoned fourteen of their advertisements of public diversion among the gaunt haggard forms of famine and nakedness amidst the yells of murder the tears of affliction and the cries of despair the song the dance the mimic scene the buffoon laughter went on as regularly as in the gay hour of festive peace i have it from good authority that under the scaffold of judicial murder and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators the space was hired out for a show of dancing dogs i think without conceit we made the very same remark on reading some of their pieces which being written for other purposes let us into a view of their social life  ibid  french revolution compared to a nuisance in describing the nuisance erected by so pestilential a manufactory by constructing so infamous a brothel by digging a nightcellar for such thieves murderers and housebreakers as never infested the world i am so far from aggravating that i have fallen infinitely short of the evil no man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done in france and combined them with the principles there asserted can possibly doubt it when i compare with this great cause of nations the trifling points of honor the still more contemptible points of interest the light ceremonies the undefinable punctilios the disputes about precedence the lowering or the hoisting of a sail the dealing in a hundred or two of wild catskins on the other side of the globe which have often kindled up the flames of war between nations i stand astonished at those persons who do not feel a resentment not more natural than politic at the atrocious insults that this monstrous compound offers to the dignity of every nation and who are not alarmed with what it threatens to their safety  ibid  france previous to the revolution when i consider the face of the kingdom of france the multitude and opulence of her cities the useful magnificence of her spacious high roads and bridges the opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the conveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so immense an extent when i turn my eyes to the stupendous works of her ports and harbors and to her whole naval apparatus whether for war or trade when i bring before my view the number of her fortifications constructed with so bold and masterly a skill and made and maintained at so prodigious a charge presenting an armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every side when i recollect how very small a part of that extensive region is without cultivation and to what complete perfection the culture of many of the best productions of the earth have been brought in france when i reflect on the excellence of her manufactures and fabrics second to none but ours and in some particulars not second when i contemplate the grand foundations of charity public and private when i survey the state of all the arts that beautify and polish life when i reckon the men she has bred for extending her same in war her able statesmen the multitude of her profound lawyers and theologians her philosophers her critics her historians and antiquaries her poets and her orators sacred and profane i behold in all this something which awes and commands the imagination which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and indiscriminate censure and which demands that we should very seriously examine what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us at once to level so spacious a fabric with the ground  ibid  financier the objects of a financier are then to secure an ample revenue to impose it with judgment and equality to employ it oeconomically and when necessity obliges him to make use of credit to secure its foundations in that instance and for ever by the clearness and candor of his proceedings the exactness of his calculations and the solidity of his funds on these heads we may take a short and distinct view of the merits and abilities of those in the national assembly who have taken to themselves the management of this arduous concern far from any increase of revenue in their hands i find by a report of m vernier from the committee of finances of the second of august last that the amount of the national revenue as compared with its produce before the revolution was diminished by the sum of two hundred millions or eight millions sterling of the annual income considerably more than onethird of the whole  reflections on the revolution in france  forefathers a politic caution a guarded circumspection a moral rather than a complexional timidity were among the ruling principles of our forefathers in their most decided conduct not being illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of france tell us they have got so abundant a share they acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and fallibility of mankind he that had made them thus fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct attended to their nature let us imitate their caution if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their bequests let us add if we please but let us preserve what they have left and standing on the firm ground of the british constitution let us be satisfied to admire rather than attempt to follow in their desperate flights the aeronauts of france  ibid  fanaticism of all things wisdom is the most terrified with epidemical fanaticism because of all enemies it is that against which she is the least able to furnish any kind of resource  ibid  freedom civil civil freedom is not as many have endeavored to persuade us a thing that lies hid in the depth of abstruse science it is a blessing and a benefit not an abstract speculation and all the just reasoning that can be upon it is of so coarse a texture as perfectly to suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy and of those who are to defend it far from any resemblance to those propositions in geometry and metaphysics which admit no medium but must be true or false in all their latitude social and civil freedom like all other things in common life are variously mixed and modified enjoyed in very different degrees and shaped into an infinite diversity of forms according to the temper and circumstances of every community the extreme of liberty which is its abstract perfection but its real fault obtains no where nor ought to obtain any where because extremes as we all know in every point which relates either to our duties or satisfactions in life are destructive both to virtue and enjoyment liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed the degree of restraint it is impossible in any case to settle precisely but it ought to be the constant aim of every wise public counsel to find out by cautious experiments and rational cool endeavors with how little not how much of this restraint the community can subsist  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  freedom whilst freedom is true to itself every thing becomes

made for great general and proscriptive exclusions sooner or later it will destroy them or they will destroy the constitution in our constitution there has always been a difference made a franchise and an office and between the capacity for the one and for the other franchises were supposed to belong to the subject as a subject and not as a member of the governing part of the state the policy of government has considered them as things very different for whilst parliament excluded by the test acts and for a while these test acts were not a dead letter as now they are in england protestant dissenters from all civil and military employments they never touched their right of voting for members of parliament or sitting in either house a point i state not as approving or condemning with regard to them the measure of exclusion from employments but to prove that the distinction has been admitted in legislature as in truth it is founded in reason  letter to sir h langrishe  gaming

interested in every thing which even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tend finally to compose the minds of the subject and to conciliate their affections i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the voice of the people but as long as reputation the most precious possession of every individual and as long as opinion the great support of the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be considered as a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence whatever original energy may be supposed either in force or regulation the operation of both is in truth merely instrumental nations are governed by the same methods and on the same principles by which an individual without authority is often able to govern those who are his equals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by a judicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily and quietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scuffle between the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one and sometimes the other is uppermost in which they alternately yield and prevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous submissions the temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought therefore to be the first study of a statesman  thoughts on

compromise and barter we balance inconveniences we give and take we remit some rights that we may enjoy others and we choose rather to be happy citizens than subtle disputants as we must give away some natural liberty to enjoy civil advantages so we must sacrifice some civil liberties for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellowship of a great empire but in all fair dealings the thing bought must bear some proportion to the purchase paid none will barter away the immediate jewel of his soul though a great ouse is apt to make slaves haughty yet it is purchasing a part of the artificial importance of a great empire too dear to pay for it all essential rights and all the intrinsic dignity of human nature none of us who would not risque his life rather than fall under a government purely arbitrary but although there are some amongst us who think our constitution wants many improvements to make it a complete system of liberty perhaps none who are of that opinion would think it right to aim at such improvement by disturbing his country and risquing every thing that is dear to him in every arduous enterprise we consider what we are to lose as well as what we are to gain and the more and better stake of liberty every people possess the less they will hazard in a vain attempt to make it more these are the cords of man man acts from adequate motives relative to his

that time they are indeed brought to abhor that massacre ferocious as they are it is not difficult to make them dislike it because the politicians and fashionable teachers have no interest in giving their passions exactly the same direction still however they find it their interest to keep the same savage dispositions alive it was but the other day that they caused this very massacre to be acted on the stage for the diversion of the descendants of those who committed it in this tragic farce they produced the cardinal of lorraine in his robes of function ordering general slaughter was this spectacle intended to make the parisians abhor persecution and loath the effusion of blood  no it was to teach them to persecute their own pastors it was to excite them by raising a disgust and horror of their clergy to an alacrity in hunting down to destruction an order which if it ought to exist at all ought to exist not only in safety but in reverence it was to stimulate their cannibal appetites

archbishop of paris whose function was known to his people only by his prayers and benedictions and his wealth only by his alms is forced to abandon his house and to fly from his flock as from ravenous wolves because truly in the sixteenth century the cardinal of lorraine was a rebel and a murderer  such is the effect of the perversion of history by those who for the same nefarious purposes have perverted every other part of learning but those who will stand upon that elevation of reason which places centuries under our eye and brings things to the true point of comparison which obscures little names and effaces the colors of little parties and to which nothing can ascend but the spirit and moral quality of human actions will say to the teachers of the palais royal  the cardinal of

possesses a sort of creative power of its own either in representing at pleasure the images of things in the order and manner in which they were received by the senses or in combining those images in a new manner and according to a different order this power is called imagination and to this belongs whatever is called wit fancy invention and the like but it must be observed that the power of the imagination is incapable of producing any thing absolutely new it can only vary the disposition of those ideas which it has received from the senses now the imagination is the most extensive province of pleasure and pain as it is the region of our fears and our hopes and of all our passions that are connected with them and whatever is calculated to affect the imagination with these commanding ideas by force of any original natural impression must have the same power pretty equally over all men for since the imagination is only the representation of the senses it can only be pleased or displeased with the images from the same principle on which the sense is pleased or displeased with the realities and consequently there must be just as close an agreement in the imaginations as in the senses of men a little attention will convince us that this must of necessity be the case  but in the imagination besides the pain or pleasure arising from the properties of the natural object a pleasure is perceived from the resemblance which the imitation has to the original the imagination i conceive can have no pleasure but what revolts from one or the other of these causes and these causes operate pretty uniformly upon all men because they operate by principles of nature and are not derived from any particular habits or advantages  sublime and beautiful  india company conduct to

fructified the whole country to maintain these reservoirs and to keep up an annual advance to the cultivators for seed and cattle formed a principal object of the piety and policy of the priests and rulers of the gentu religion  this object required a command of money and there was no pollam or castle which in the happy days of the carnatic was without some hoard of treasure by which the governors were enabled to combat with the irregularity of the seasons and to resist or to buy off the invasion of an enemy in all the cities were multitudes of merchants and bankers for all occasions

present in the taxes that had been originally exacted from his industry in aid of casual distress the country was full of choultries which were inns and hospitals where the traveller and the poor were relieved all ranks of people had their place in the public concern and their share in the common stock and common prosperity but the chartered rights of men and the right which it was thought proper to set up in the nabob of arcot introduced a new system it was their policy to consider hoards of money as crimes to regard moderate rents as frauds on the sovereign and to view in the lesser princes any claim of exemption from more than settled tribute as an act of rebellion accordingly all the castles were one after the other plundered and destroyed the native princes were expelled the hospitals

the company was very early sensible of these mischiefs and of their true cause they gave precise orders that the native princes called polygars should not be extirpated  that the rebellion so they choose to call it of the polygars may they fear with too much justice be attributed to the maladministration of the nabobs collectors that they observe with concern that their troops have been put to disagreeable services they might have used a stronger expression without impropriety but they make amends in another place speaking of the polygars the directors say that it was repugnant to humanity to force them to such dreadful extremeties as they underwent that some examples of severity might be necessary when they fell into the nabobs hands and not by the destruction of the country that they fear his government is none of the mildest and that there is great oppression in collecting his revenues they state that the wars in which he has involved the carnatic had been a cause of its distresses that these distresses have been certainly great but those by the nabobs oppressions we believe to be greater than all pray sir attend to the reason for their opinion that the government of this their instrument is more calamitous to the country than the ravages of war  because say they his oppressions are  without intermission  the others are temporary by all which oppressions we believe the nabob has great wealth in store from this store neither he nor they could derive any advantage whatsoever upon the invasion of hyder ali in the hour of their greatest calamity and dismay  it is now proper to compare these declarations with the companys conduct the principal reason which they assigned against the extirpation of the polygars was that the weavers were protected in their fortresses they might have added that the company itself which slung them to death had been warmed in the bosom of these unfortunate princes for on the taking of madras by the french it was in their hospitable pollams that most of the inhabitants found refuge and protection but notwithstanding all these orders reasons and declarations they at length gave an indirect sanction and permitted the use of a very direct and irresistible force to measures which they had over and over again declared to be false policy cruel inhuman and oppressive having however forgot all attention to the princes and the people they remembered that they had some sort of interest in the trade of the country and it is matter of curiosity to observe the protection which they afforded to this their natural object  full of anxious cares on this head they direct that in reducing the polygars they their servants were to be cautious not to deprive the weavers and manufacturers of the protection they often met with in the strong holds of the polygar countries  and they write to their instrument the nabob of arcot concerning these poor people in a most pathetic strain we entreat your excellency say they in particular to make the manufacturers the object of your tenderest care particularly when you root out the polygars you do not deprive the weavers of the protection they enjoyed under them when they root out the protectors in favor of the oppressor they show themselves religiously cautious of the rights of the protected when they extirpate the shepherd and the shepherds dogs they piously

are larger than the kingdom of france and once contained as france does contain a great and independent landed interest composed of princes of great lords of a numerous nobility and gentry of freeholders of lower tenants of religious communities and public foundations so early as      the companys servants perceived the decay into which these provinces had fallen under english administration and they made a strong representation upon this decay and what they apprehended to be the causes of it soon after this representation mr hastings became president of bengal instead of administering a remedy to this melancholy disorder upon the heels of a dreadful famine in the year      the succor which the new president and the council lent to this afflicted nation was  shall i be believed in relating it  the landed interest of a whole kingdom of a kingdom to be compared to france was set up to public auction they set up mr hastings set up the whole nobility gentry and freeholders to the highest bidder no preference was given to the ancient proprietors they must bid against every usurer every temporary adventurer every jobber and schemer every servant of every european or they were obliged to content themselves in lieu of their extensive domains with their house and such a pension as the stateauctioneers thought fit to assign in this general calamity several of the first nobility thought and in all appearance justly that they had better submit to the necessity of this pension than continue under the name of zemindars the objects and instruments of a system by which they ruined their tenants and were ruined themselves another reform has since come upon the back of the first and a pension having been assigned to these unhappy persons in lieu of their hereditary lands a new scheme of economy has taken place and deprived them of that pension  the menial servants of englishmen persons to use the emphatical phrase of a ruined and patient eastern

of one hundred and forty thousand pounds a year  such an universal proscription upon any pretense has few examples such a proscription without even a pretense of delinquency has none it stands by itself it stands as a monument to astonish the imagination to confound the reason of mankind i confess to you when i first came to know this business in its true nature and extent my surprise did a little suspend my indignation i was in a manner stupefied by the desperate boldness of a few obscure young men who having obtained by ways which they could not comprehend a power of which they saw neither the purposes nor the limits tossed about subverted and tore to pieces as if it were in the gambols of a boyish unluckiness and malice the most established rights and the most ancient and most revered institutions of ages and nations sir i will not now trouble you with any detail with regard to what they have since done with these same lands and landholders only to inform you that nothing has been suffered to settle for two seasons together upon any basis and that the levity and inconstancy of these mock legislators were not the least afflicting parts of the oppressions suffered under their usurpation nor will any thing give stability to the property of the natives but an administration in england at once protecting and stable the country sustains almost every year the miseries of a revolution at present all is uncertainty misery and confusion there is to be found through these vast regions no longer one landed man who is a resource for voluntary aid or an object for particular rapine some of them were not long since great princes they possessed treasures they levied armies there was a zemindar in bengal i forget his name that on the threat of an invasion supplied the soubah

the second member of the british empire in the east the trade of that city and of the adjacent territory was not very long ago among the most flourishing in asia but since the establishment of the british power it has wasted away under an uniform gradual decline insomuch that in the year      not one merchant of eminence was to be found in the whole country mr smiths examination before the select committee appendix no    during this period of decay about six hundred thousand sterling pounds a year have been drawn off by english gentlemen on their private account by the way of china alone appendix no    if we add four hundred thousand as probably remitted through other channels and in other mediums that is in jewels gold and silver directly brought to europe and in bills upon the british and foreign companies you will scarcely think the matter overrated if we fix the commencement of this extraction of money from the carnatic at a period no earlier than the year    0 and close it in the year    0 it probably will not amount to a great deal less than twenty millions of money  during the deep silent flow of this steady stream of wealth which set from india into europe it generally passed on with no adequate observation but happening at some periods to meet rifts of rocks that checked its course it grew more noisy and attracted more notice the pecuniary discussions caused by an accumulation of part of the fortunes of their servants in a debt from the nabob of arcot was the first thing which very particularly called for and long engaged the attention of the court of directors this debt amounted to eight hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling and was claimed for the greater part by english gentlemen residing at madras this grand capital settled at length by order at ten per cent afforded an annuity of eightyeight thousand pounds fourth report mr dundass committee p     whilst the directors were digesting their astonishment at this information a memorial was presented to them from three gentlemen informing them that their friends had lent likewise to merchants of canton in china a sum of not more than one million sterling in this memorial they called upon the company for their assistance and interposition with the chinese government for the recovery of the debt this sum lent to chinese merchants was at    per cent which would yield if paid an annuity of two hundred and forty thousand pounds a witness examined before the committee of secrecy says that eighteen per cent was the usual interest but he had heard that more had been given the above is the account which mr b received   perplexed as the directors were with these demands you may conceive sir that they did not find themselves very much disembarrassed by being made acquainted that they must again exert their influence for a new reserve of the happy parsimony of their servants collected into a second debt from the nabob of arcot amounting to two millions four hundred thousand pounds settled at an interest of    per cent this is known by the name of the consolidation of      as the former of the nabobs debts was by the title of the consolidation of      to this was added in a separate parcel a little reserve called the cavalry debt of one hundred and sixty thousand pounds at the same interest the whole of these four capitals amounting to four millions four hundred and forty thousand pounds produced at their several rates annuities amounting to six hundred and and twentythree thousand pounds a year a good deal more than one third of the clear land tax of england at four shillings in the pound a good deal more than double the whole annual dividend of the east india company the nominal masters to the proprietors in these funds of this interest three hundred and eightythree thousand two hundred pounds a year stood chargeable on the public revenues of the carnatic  speech on the nabob of arcots debts  india debt and peculators sir at this moment it will not be necessary to consider the various operations which the capital and interest of this debt have successively undergone i shall speak to these operations when i come particularly to answer the right honorable gentleman mr dundas on each of the heads as he has thought proper to divide them but this was the exact view in which these debts first appeared to the court of directors and to the world it varied afterward but it never appeared in any other than a most questionable shape when this gigantic phantom of debt first appeared before a young minister mr pit it naturally would have justified some degree of doubt and apprehension such a prodigy would have filled any common man with superstitious fears he would exorcise that shapeless nameless form and by every thing sacred would have adjured it to tell by what means a small number of slight individuals of no consequence or situation possessed of no lucrative offices without the command of armies or the known administration of revenues without profession of any kind without any sort of trade sufficient to employ a pedlar could have in a few years as to some even in a few months have amassed treasures equal to the revenues of a respectable kingdom was it not enough to put these gentlemen in the noviciate of their administration on their guard and to call upon them for a strict enquiry if not to justify them in a reprobation of those demands without any enquiry at all that when all england scotland and ireland had for years been witness to the immense sums laid out by the servants of the company in stocks of all denominations in the purchase of lands in the buying and building of houses in the securing quiet seats in parliament or in the tumultuous riot of contested elections in wandering throughout the whole range of those variegated modes of inventive prodigality which sometimes have excited our wonder sometimes roused our indignation that after all india was four millions still in debt to them india in debt to them for what every debt for which an equivalent of some kind or other is not given is on the face of it a fraud what is the equivalent they have given what equivalent had they to give what are the articles of commerce or the branches of manufacture which those gentlemen have carried hence to enrich india what are the sciences they bed out to enlighten it what are the arts they introduced to cheer and to adorn it what are the religious what the moral institutions they have taught among that people as a guide to life or as a consolation when life is to be no more that there is an eternal debt a debt still paying still to owe which must be bound on the present generation in india and entailed on their mortgaged posterity for ever a debt of millions in favor of a set of men whose names with few exceptions are either buried in the obscurity of their origin and talents or dragged into light by the enormity of their crimes  in my opinion the courage of the minister was the most wonderful part of the transaction especially as he must have read or rather the right honorable gentleman says he has read for him whole volumes upon the subject the volumes by the way are not by one tenth part so numerous as the right honorable gentleman has thought proper to pretend in order to frighten you from enquiry but in these volumes such as they are the minister must have found a full authority for a suspicion at the very least of every thing relative to the great fortunes made at madras what is that authority why no other than the standing authority for all the claims which the ministry has thought fit to provide for  the grand debtor  the nabob of arcot himself hear that prince in the letter written to the court of directors at the precise period whilst the main body of these debts were contracting in this letter he states himself to be what undoubtedly he is a most competent witness to this point after speaking of the war with hyder ali in      and      and of other measures which he censures whether right or wrong it signifies nothing and into which he says he had been led by the companys servants he proceeds in this manner  if all these things were against the real interests of the company they are ten thousand times more against mine and against the prosperity of my country and the happiness of my people for your interests and mine are the same what were they owing to then to the private views of a few individuals who have enriched themselves at the expense of your influence and of my country for your servants have no trade in this country neither do you pay them high wages yet in a few years they return to england with many lacks of pogodas how can you or i account for such immense fortunes acquired in so short a time without any visible means of getting them  when he asked this question which involves its answer it is extraordinary that curiosity did not prompt the chancellor of the exchequer to that enquiry which might come in vain recommended to him by his own act of parliament does not the nabob of arcot tell us in so many words that there was no fair way of making the enormous sums sent by the companys servants to england and do you imagine that there was or could be more honesty and good faith in the demands for what remained behind in india of what nature were the transactions with himself if you follow the train of his information you must see that if these great sums were at all lent it was not property but spoil that was lent if not lent the transaction was not a contract but a fraud either way if light enough could not be furnished to authorize a full condemnation of these demands they ought to have been left to the parties who best knew and understood each others proceedings it was not necessary that the authority of government should interpose in favor of claims whose very foundation was a defiance of that authority and whose object and end was its entire subversion  it may be said that this letter was written by the nabob of arcot in a moody humor under the influence of some chagrin certainly it was but it is in such humors that truth comes out and when he tells you from his own knowledge what every one must presume from the extreme probability of the thing whether he told it or not one such testimony is worth a thousand that contradict that probability when the parties have a better understanding with each other and when they have a point to carry that may unite them in a common deceit  if this body of private claims of debt real or devised were a question as it is falsely pretended between the nabob of arcot as debtor and paul benfield and his associates as creditors i am sure i should give myself but little trouble about it if the hoards of oppression were the fund for satisfying the claims of bribery and peculation who would wish to interfere between such litigants if the demands were confined to what might be drawn from the treasures which the companys records uniformly assert that the nabob is in possession of or if he had mines of gold or silver or diamonds as we know that he has none these gentlemen might break open his hoards or dig in his mines without any disturbance from me but the gentlemen on the other side of the house know as well as i do and they dare not contradict me that the nabob of arcot and his creditors are not adversaries but collusive parties and that the whole transaction is under a false color and false names the litigation is not nor ever has been between their rapacity and his hoarded riches no it is between him and them combining and confederating on one side and the public revenues and the miserable inhabitants of a ruined country on the other these are the rl plaintiffs and the real defendants in the suit refusing a shilling from his hoards for the satisfaction of any demand the nabob of arcot is always ready nay he earnestly and with eagerness and passion contends for delivering up to these pretended creditors his territory and his subjects it is therefore not from treasuries and mines but from the food of your unpaid armies from the blood withheld from the veins and whipped out of the backs of the most miserable of men that we are to pamper extortion usury and peculation under the false names of debtors and creditors of state  ibid  india company policy of the invariable course of the companys policy is this either they set up some prince too odious to maintain himself without the necessity of their assistance or they soon render him odious by making him the instrument of their government in that case troops are bountifully sent to him to maintain his authority that he should have no want of assistance a civil gentleman called a resident is kept at his court who under pretense of providing duly for the pay of these troops gets assignments on the revenue into his hands under his provident management debts soon accumulate new assignments are made for these debts until step by step the whole revenue and with it the whole power of the country is delivered into his hands the military do not behold without a virtuous emulation the moderate gains of the civil department they feel that in a country driven to habitual rebellion by the civil government the military is necessary and they will not permit their services to go unrewarded tracts of country are delivered over to their discretion then it is found proper to convert their commanding officers into farmers of revenue thus between the well paid civil and well rewarded military establishment the situation of the natives may be easily conjectured the authority of the regular and lawful government is every where and in every point extinguished disorders and violences arise they are repressed by other disorders and other violences wherever the collectors of the revenue and the farming colonels and majors move ruin is about them rebellion before and behind them the people in crowds fly out of the country and the frontier is guarded by lines of troops not to exclude an enemy but to prevent the escape of the inhabitants  speech on mr foxs east india bill  india fate of the natives of india

living testimony and even of evidence yet unborn from that time not a complaint has been heard from the natives against their governors all the grievances of india have found a complete remedy  ibid  india british dominions in india described in the northern parts it is a solid mass of land about eight hundred miles in length and four or five hundred broad as you go southward it becomes narrower for a space it afterward dilates but narrower or broader you possess the whole eastern and northeastern coast of that vast country quite from the borders of pegu  bengal bahar and orissa with benares now unfortunately in our immediate possession measure        square english miles a territory considerably larger than the whole kingdom of france oude with its dependant provinces is       square miles not a great deal less than england the carnatic with tanjour and the circars is       square miles very considerably larger than england and the whole of the companys dominions comprehending bombay and salsette amounts to        square miles which forms a territory larger than any european dominion russia and turkey excepted through all that vast extent of country there is not a man who eats a mouthful of rice but by permission of the east india company  so far with regard to the extent the population of this great empire is not easy to be calculated when the countries of which it is composed came into our possession they were all eminently peopled and eminently productive though at that time considerably declined from their ancient prosperity but since they are come into our hands  however if we take the period of our estimate immediately before the utter desolation of the carnatic and if we allow for the havoc which our government had even then made in these regions we cannot in my opinion rate the population at much less than thirty millions of souls more than four times the number of persons in the island of great britain  my next enquiry to that of the number is the quality and description of the inhabitants this multitude of men does not consist of an abject and barbarous populace much less of gangs of savages like the guaranies and chiquitos who wander on the waste borders of the river of amazons or the plate but a people for ages civilized and cultivated cultivated by all the arts of polished life whilst we were yet in the woods there have been and still the skeletons remain princes once of great dignity authority and opulence there are to be found the chiefs of tribes and nations there is to be found an ancient and venerable priesthood the depository of their laws learning and history the guides of the people whilst living and their consolation in death a nobility of great antiquity and renown a multitude of cities not exceeded in population and trade by those of the first class in europe merchants and bankers individual houses of whom have once vied in capital with the bank of england whose credit had often supported a tottering state and preserved their governments in the midst of war and desolation millions of ingenious manufacturers and mechanics millions of the most diligent and not the least intelligent tillers of the earth here are to be found almost all the religions professed by men the bramincal the mussulmen the eastern and the western christians  if i were to take the whole aggregate of our possessions there i should compare it as the nearest parallel i can find with the empire of germany our immediate possessions i should compare with the austrian dominions and they would not suffer in the comparison the nabob of oude might stand for the king of prussia the nabob of arcot i would compare as superior in territory and equal in revenue to the elector of saxony cheyt sing the rajah of benares might well rank with the prince of hesse at least and the rajah of tanjore though hardly equal in extent of dominion superior in revenue to the elector of bavaria the polygars and the northern zemindars and other great chiefs might well class with the rest of the princes dukes counts marquisses and bishops in the empire all of whom i mention to honor and surely without disparagement to any or all of those most respectable princes and grandees  all this vast mass composed of so many orders and classes of men is again infinitely diversified by manners by religion by hereditary employment through all their possible combinations this renders the handling of india a matter in an high degree critical and delicate but oh it has been handled rudely indeed even some of the reformers seem to have forgot that they had any thing to do but to regulate the tenants of a manor or the shopkeepers of the next county town  it is an empire of this extent of this complicated nature of this dignity and importance that i have compared to germany and the german government not for an exact resemblance but as a sort of a middle term by which india might be approximated to our understandings and if possible to our feelings in order to awaken something of sympathy for the unfortunate natives of which i am afraid we are not perfectly susceptible whilst we look at this very remote object through a false and cloudy medium  ibid  india directors a directors qualification may be worth about two thousand five hundred pounds  and the interest at eight per cent is about one hundred and sixty pounds a year of what value is that whether it rise to ten or fall to six or to nothing to him whose son before he is in bengal two months and before he descends the steps of the council chamber sells the grant of a single contract for forty thousand pounds accordingly the stock is bought up in qualifications the vote is not to protect the stock but the stock is bought to acquire the vote and the end of the vote is to cover and support against justice some man of power who has made an obnoxious fortune in india or to maintain in power those who are actually employing it in the acquisition of such a fortune and to avail themselves in return of his patronage that he may shower the spoils of the east barbaric pearl and gold on them their families and dependents so that all the relations of the company are not only changed but inverted the servants in india are not appointed by the directors but the directors are chosen by them the trade is carried on with their capitals to them the revenues of the country are mortgaged the seat of the supreme power is in calcutta the house in leadenhallstreet is nothing more than a change for their agents factors and deputies to meet in to take care of their affairs and support their interests and this so avowedly that we see the known agents of the delinquent servants marshalling and disciplining their forces and the prime spokesmen in all their assemblies  ibid  jacobinism jacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising talents of a country against its property when private men form themselves into associations for the purpose of destroying the preexisting laws and institutions of their country when they secure to themselves an army by dividing amongst the people of no property the estates of the ancient and lawful proprietors when a state recognizes those acts when it does not make confiscations for crimes but makes crimes for confiscations when it has its principal strength and all its resources in such a violation of property when it stands chiefly upon such a violation massacreing by judgments or otherwise those who make any struggle for their old legal government and their legal hereditary or acquired possessions i call this jacobinism by establishment  regicide peace  jacobins i have a good opinion of the general abilities of the jacobins not that i suppose them better born than others but strong passions awake the faculties they suffer not a particle to be lost the spirit of enterprise gives them the full use of all their native energies  ibid  jacobins character of the british jacobins it cannot be concealed we are a divided people but in divisions where a part is to be taken we are to make a muster of our strength i have often endeavored to class those who in any political view are to be called the people without doing something of this sort we must proceed absurdly we should presume as absurdly if we pretended to very great accuracy in our estimate but i think in the calculation i have made the error cannot be very material in england and scotland i compute that those of adult age not declining in life of tolerable leisure for such discussions and of some means of information more or less and who are above menial dependence or what virtually is such may amount to about four hundred thousand in this number i include the women that take a concern in those transactions who cannot exceed twenty thousand there is such a thing as a natural representative of the people this body is that representative and on this body more than on the legal constituent the artificial representative depends this is the british public and it is a public very numerous the rest when feeble are the objects of protection when strong the means of force they who affect to consider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us they do not want us for counselors in deliberation but to list us as soldiers for battle  of these four hundred thousand political citizens i look upon one fifth or about eighty thousand to be pure jacobins utterly incapable of amendment objects of eternal vigilance and when they break out of legal constraint on these no reason no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence they desire a change and they will have it if they can if they cannot have it by english cabal they will make no sort of scruple of having it by the cabal of france into which already they are virtually incorporated  this minority is great and formidable i do not know whether if i aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom i should wish to be encumbered with a larger body of partisans these by their spirit of intrigue and by their restless agitating activity are of a force far superior to their numbers and if times grew the least critical have the means of debauching or intimidating many of those who are now sound as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more passive part of the nation this minority is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace or for war or for any object they are led vehemently to desire by passing from place to place with a velocity incredible and diversifying their character and description they are capable of mimicking the general voice we must not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noise of the acclamation  the majority the other fourfifths is perfectly sound and of the best possible dispositions to religion to government to the true and undivided interest of their country such men are naturally disposed to peace they who are in possession of all they wish are languid and improvident with this fault and i admit its existence in all its extent they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them however the desire of peace is essentially the weak side of all such men all men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities there they are unguarded they do not suspect that their destruction is attempted through their virtues this their enemies are perfectly aware of and accordingly they the most turbulent of mankind who never made a scruple to shake the tranquillity of their country to its center raise a continual cry for peace with france peace with regicides and war with the rest of the world is their true motto from the beginning and even whilst the french gave the blows and we hardly opposed the vis inertiae to their efforts from that day to this hour like importunate guineafowls crying one note day and night they have called peace peace  ibid  judgment and sensibility a rectitude of judgment in the arts which may be called a good taste does in a great measure depend upon sensibility because if the mind has no bent to the pleasures of the imagination it will never apply itself sufficiently to works of that species to acquire a competent knowledge in them but though a degree of sensibility is requisite to form a good judgment yet a good judgment does not necessarily arise from a quick sensibility of pleasure it frequently happens that a very poor judge merely by force of a greater complexional sensibility is more affected by a very poor piece than the best judge by the most perfect for as every thing new extraordinary grand or passionate is well calculated to affect such a person and that the faults do not affect him his pleasure is more pure and unmixed and as it is merely a pleasure of the imagination it is much higher than any which is derived from a rectitude of the judgment the judgment is for the greater part employed in throwing stumbling blocks in the way of the imagination in dissipating the scenes of its enchantment and in tying us down to the disagreeable yoke of our reason for almost the only pleasure that men have in judging better than others consists in a sort of conscious pride and superiority which arises from thinking rightly but then this is an indirect pleasure a pleasure which does not immediately result from the object which is under contemplation in the morning of our days when the senses are unworn and tender when the whole man is awake in every part and the gloss of novelty fresh upon all the objects that surround us how lively at that time are our sensations but how false and inaccurate the judgments we form of things i despair of ever receiving the same degree of pleasure from the most excellent performances of genius which i felt at that age from pieces which my present judgment regards as trifling and contemptible every trivial cause of pleasure is apt to affect the man of too sanguine a complexion his appetite is too keen to suffer his taste to be delicate and he is in all respects what ovid says of himself in love molle meum levibus cor est violabile telis et semper causa

itself the great standing policy of civil society and any eminent departure from it under any circumstance lies under the suspicion of being no policy at all  reflections on the revolution in france  irish catholics conduct of the irish catholics in london during the riots in    0 there was a circumstance justice will not suffer me to pass it over which if any thing could enforce the reasons i have given would fully justify the act of relief and render a repeal or any thing like a repeal unnatural impossible it was the behavior of the persecuted roman catholics under the acts of violence and brutal insolence which they suffered i suppose there are not in london less than four or five thousand of that persuasion from my country who do a great deal of the most laborious works in the metropolis and they chiefly inhabit those quarters which were the principal theater of the fury of the bigoted multitude they are known to be men of strong arms and quick feelings and more remarkable for a determined resolution than clear ideas or much foresight but though provoked by every thing that can stir the blood of men their houses and chapels in flames and with the most atrocious profanations of every thing which they hold sacred before their eyes not a hand was moved to retaliate or even to defend  speech at bristol previous to the election  irish catholics object and effect of the popery laws setting therefore this case out of the question it becomes an object of very serious consideration whether because wicked men of various descriptions are engaged in seditious courses the rational sober and valuable part of one description should not be indulged in their sober and rational expectations you who have looked deeply into the spirit of the popery laws must be perfectly sensible that a great part of the present mischief which we abhor in common if it at all exists has arisen from them their declared object was to reduce the catholics of ireland to a miserable populace without property without estimation without education the professed object was to deprive the few men who in spite of those laws might hold or obtain any property amongst them of all sort of influence or authority over the rest they divided the nation into two distinct bodies without common interest sympathy or connection one of these bodies was to possess all the franchises all the property all the education the other was to be composed of drawers of water and cutters of turf for them are we to be astonished when by the efforts of so much violence in conquest and so much policy in regulation continued without intermission for near an hundred years we had reduced them to a mob that whenever they came to act at all many of them would act exactly like a mob without temper measure or foresight surely it might be just now a matter of temperate discussion whether you ought not apply a remedy to the real cause of the evil if the disorder you speak of be real and considerable you ought to raise an aristocratic interest that is an interest of property and education amongst them and to strengthen by every prudent means the authority and influence of men of that description it will deserve your best thoughts to examine whether this can be done without giving such persons the means of demonstrating to the rest that something more is to be got by their temperate conduct than can be expected from the wild and senseless projects of those who do not belong to their body who have no interest in their well being and only wish to make them the dupes of their turbulent ambition  letter to sir h langrishe m p  irish catholics state of the the protestants of ireland are not alone sufficiently the people to form a democracy and they are too numerous to answer the ends and purposes of an aristocracy admiration that first source of obedience can be only the claim or the imposture of the few i hold it to be absolutely impossible for two millions of plebeians catholics composing certainly a very clear and decided majority in that class to become so far in love with six or seven hundred thousand of their fellowcitizens to all outward appearance plebeians like themselves and many of them tradesmen servants and otherwise inferior to some of them as to see with satisfaction or even with patience an exclusive power vested in them by which constitutionally they become the absolute masters and by the manners derived from their circumstances must be capable of exercising upon them daily and hourly an insulting and vexatious superiority neither are the majority of the irish indemnified as in some aristocracies for this state of humiliating vassalage often inverting the nature of things and relations by having the lower walks of industry wholly abandoned to them they are rivalled to say the least of the matter in every laborious and lucrative course of life while every franchise every honor every trust every place down to the very lowest and least confidential besides whole professions is reserved for the master cast  ibid  irish catholics excluded the elective franchise the right of election has been since extended to the irish catholics  i will not here examine whether the principles of the british the irish constitution be wise or not i must assume that they are and that those who partake the franchises which make it partake of a benefit they who are excluded from votes under proper qualifications inherent in the constitution that gives them are excluded not from the state but from the british constitution they cannot by any possibility whilst they hear its praises continually rung in their ears and are present at the declaration which is so generally and so bravely made by those who possess the privilege  that the best blood in their veins ought to be shed to preserve their share in it they the disfranchised part cannot i say think themselves in an happy state to be utterly excluded from all its direct and all its consequential advantages the popular part of the constitution must be to them by far the most odious part of it to them it is not on actual and if possible still less a virtual representation it is indeed the direct contrary it is power unlimited placed in the hands of an adverse description because it is an adverse description and if they who compose the privileged body have not an interest they must but too frequently have motives of pride passion petulance peevish jealousy or tyrannic suspicion to urge them to treat the excluded people with contempt and rigor  then since our oldest fundamental laws follow or rather couple freehold with franchise since no principle of the revolution shakes these liberties since the oldest and one of the best monuments of the constition demands for the irish the privilege which they supplicate since the principles of the revolution coincide with the declarations of the great charter since the practice of the revolution in this point did not contradict its principles since from that event twentyfive years had elapsed before a domineering party on a party principle had ventured to disfranchise without any proof whatsoever of abuse the greater part of the community since the kings coronation oath does not stand in his way to the performance of his duty to all his subjects since you have given to all other dissenters these privileges without limit which are hitherto withheld without any limitation whatsoever from the catholics since no nation in the world has ever been known to exclude so great a body of men not born slaves from the civil state and all the benefits of its constitution the whole question comes before parliament as a matter for its prudence i do not put the thing on a question of right that discretion which in judicature is well said by lord coke to be a crooked cord in legislature is a golden rule supplicants ought not to appear too much in the character of litigants if the subject thinks so highly and reverently of the sovereign authority as not to claim any thing of right so that it may seem to be independent of the power and free choice of its government and if the sovereign on his part considers the advantages of the subjects as their right and all their reasonable wishes as so many claims in the fortunate conjunction of these mutual dispositions are laid the foundations of a happy and prosperous commonwealth for my own part desiring of all things that the authority of the legislature under which i was born and which i cherish not only with a dutiful awe but with a partial and cordial affection to be maintained in the utmost possible respect i never will suffer myself to suppose that at bottom their discretion will be found to be at variance with their justice  ibid  irish catholic possesses no virtual representation see representation virtual the irish catholic as a catholic and belonging to a description has no virtual relation to the representative but the contrary there is a relation in mutual obligation gratitude may not always have a very lasting power but the frequent recurrence of an application for favors will revive and refresh it and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention it will produce at least acquaintance the several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as they now are as if they were not only separate nations but separate species the stigma and reproach the hideous mask will be taken off and men will see each other as they are sure i am that there have been thousands in ireland who have never conversed with a roman catholic in their whole lives unless they happened to talk to their gardeners workmen or to ask their way when they had lost it in their sports or at best who had known them only as footmen or other domestics of the second and third order and so averse were they some time ago to have them near their persons that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable i well remember a great and in many respects a good man who advertised for a blacksmith but at the same time added he must be a protestant it is impossible that such a state of things though natural goodness in many persons will undoubtedly make exceptions must not produce alienation on the one side and pride and insolence on the other  reduced to a question of discretion and that discretion exercised solely upon what will appear best for the conservation of the state on its present basis i should recommend it to your serious thoughts whether the narrowing of the foundation is always the best way to secure the building the body of disfranchised men will not be perfectly satisfied to remain always in that state if they are not satisfied you have two millions of subjects in your bosom full of uneasiness not that they cannot overturn the act of settlement and put themselves and you under an arbitrary master or that they are not permitted to fpawn an hydra of wild republics on principles of a pretended natural equality in man but because you will not suffer them to enjoy the ancient fundamental tried advantages of a british constitution that you will not permit them to profit of the protection of a common father or the freedom of common citizens and that the only reason which can be assigned for this disfranchisement has a tendency more deeply to ulcerate their minds than the act of exclusion itself what the consequence of such feelings must be it is for you to look to to warn is not to menace  ibid  irish catholics repeal of the test act in ireland etc so far as to england in ireland you have outran us without waiting for an english example you have totally and without any modification whatsoever repealed the test as to protestant dissenters not having the repealing act by me i ought not to say positively that there is no exception in it but if it be what i suppose it is you know very well that a jew in religion or a mohammedan or even a public declared atheist and blasphemer is perfectly qualified to be lord lieutenant a lord justice or even keeper of the kings conscience and by virtue of his office if with you it be as it is with us administrator to a great part of the ecclesiastical patronage of the crown  now let us deal a little fairly we must admit that protestant dissent was one of the quarters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution and against which a part of the coronation oath was peculiarly directed by this unqualified repeal you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to preserve the church against protestant dissenters or taking this to be the true sense of the two revolution acts of king william and of the previous and subsequent union acts of queen anne you did not declare by this most unqualified repeal by which you broke down all the barriers not invented indeed but carefully preserved at the revolution you did not then and by that proceeding declare that you had advised the king to perjury toward god and persidy toward the church no far very far from it you never would have done it if you did not think it could be done with perfect repose to the royal conscience and perfect safety to the national established religion you did this upon a full consideration of the circumstances of your country now if circumstances required it why should it be contrary to the kings oath his parliament judging on those circumstances to restore to his catholic people in such measure and with such modifications as the public wisdom shall think proper to add some part in these franchises which they formerly had held without any limitation at all and which upon no sort of urgent reason at the time they were deprived of if such means can with any probability be shown from circumstances rather to add strength to our mixed ecclesiastical and secular constitution than to weaken it surely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties incapacities and proscriptions continued from generation to generation they are perfectly consistent with the other parts of the coronation oath in which the king swears to maintain the laws of god and the true profession of the gospel and to govern the people according to the statutes in parliament agreed upon and the laws and customs of the realm in consenting to such a statute the crown would act at least as agreeable to the laws of god and to the true profession of the gospel and to the laws and customs of the kingdom as george i did when he passed the statute which took from the body of the people every thing which to that hour and even after the monstrous acts of the  d and  th of anne the objects of our common hatred they still enjoyed inviolate  ibid  ireland irish catholic clergy see protestant clergy when we are to provide for the education of any body of men we ought seriously to consider the particular functions they are to perform in life a roman catholic clergyman is the minister of a very ritual religion and by his profession subject to many restraints his life is a life full of strict observances and his duties are of a laborious nature toward himself and of the highest possible trust toward others the duty of confession alone is sufficient to set in the strongest light the necessity of his having an appropriated mode of education the theological opinions and peculiar rites of one religion never can be properly taught in universities founded for the purposes and on the principles of another which in many points are directly opposite if a roman catholic clergyman intended for celibacy and the function of confession is not strictly bred in a seminary where these things are respected inculcated and enforced as sacred and not made the subject of derision and obloquy he will be ill fitted for the former and the latter will be indeed in his hands a terrible instrument  there is a great resemblance between the whole frame and constitution of the greek and latin churches the secular clergy in the former by being married living under little restraint and having no particular education suited to their function are universally fallen into such contempt that they are never permitted to aspire to the dignities of their own church it is not held respectful to call them papas their true and ancient appellation but those who wish to address them with civility always call them hieromonachi in consequence of this disrespect which i venture to say in such a church must be the consequence of a secular life a very great degeneracy from reputable christian manners has taken place throughout almost the whole of that great member of the christian church  it was so with the latin church before the restraint on marriage even that restraint gave rise to the greatest disorders before the council of trent which together with the emulation raised and the good examples given by the reformed churches wherever they were in view of each other has brought on that happy amendment which we see in the latin communion both at home and abroad  the council of trent has wisely introduced the discipline of seminaries by which priests are not trusted for a clerical institution even to the severe discipline of their colleges but after they pass through them are frequently if not for the greater part obliged to pass through peculiar methods having their particular ritual function in view it is in a great measure to this and to similar methods used in foreign education that the roman catholic clergy of ireland miserably provided for living among low and illregulated people without any discipline of sufficient force to secure good manners have been prevented from becoming an intolerable nuisance to the country instead of being as i conceive they generally are a very great service to it  letter on the penal laws against irish catholics  ireland genius and policy of the english government in ireland revolution etc see irish catholics i cannot possibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the revolution with the principles of the revolution as in most great changes many things were done from the necessities of the time well or ill understood from passion or from vengeance which were not only not perfectly agreeable to its principles but in the most direct contradiction to them i shall not think that the deprivation of some millions of people of all the rights of citizens and all interest in the constitution in and to which they were born was a thing conformable to the declared principles of the revolution this i am sure is true relatively to england where the operation of these antiprinciples comparatively were of little extent and some of our late laws in repealing acts made immediately after the revolution admit that some things then done were not done in the true spirit of the revolution but the revolution operated differently in england and irelend in many and these essential particulars supposing the principles to have been altogether the same in both kingdoms by the application of those principles to very different objects the whole spirit of the system was changed not to say reversed in england it was the struggle of the great body of the people for the establishment of their liberties against the efforts of a very small faction who would have oppressed them in ireland it was the establishment of the power of the smaller number at the expense of the civil liberties and properties of the far greater part and at the expense of the political liberties of the whole it was to say the truth not a revolution but a conquest which is not to say a great deal in its favor to insist on every thing done in ireland at the revolution would be to insist on the severe and jealous policy of a conqueror in the crude settlement of his new acquisition as a permanent rule for its future government this no power in no country that ever i heard of has done or professed to do  except in ireland where it is done and possibly by some people will be professed time has by degrees in all other places and periods blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors so after some time and after one of the most rigid conquests that we read of in history the normans softened into the english i wish you to turn your recollection to the fine speech of cerealis to the gauls made to dissuade them from revolt speaking of the romans   nos quamvis toties lacessiti jure victoriae id solum vobis addidimus quo pacem tueremur nam neque quies gentium sine armis neque arma sine stipendiis neque stipendia sine tributis haberi queant coetera in communi sita sunt ipsi plerumque nostris exercitibus proesidetis ipsi has aliasque provincias regitis nil seperatum clausumve  proinde pacem et urbem quam victores victique eodem jure obtinemus amate colite you will consider whether the arguments used by that roman to these gauls would apply to the case in ireland and whether you could use so plausible a preamble to any severe warning you might think it proper to hold out to those who should resort to sedition instead of supplication to obtain any object that they may pursue with the governing power  for a much longer period than that which had sufficed to blend the romans with the nation to which of all others they were the most adverse the protestants settled in ireland considered themselves in no other light than that of a sort of colonial garrison to keep the natives in subjection to the other state of great britain the whole spirit of the revolution in ireland was that of not the mildest conqueror in truth the spirit of those proceedings did not commence at that era nor was religion of any kind their primary object what was done was not in the spirit of a contest between two religious factions but between two adverse nations the statutes of kilkenny show that the spirit of the popery laws and some even of their actual provisions as applied between englishry and irishry had existed in that harassed country before the words protestant and papist were heard of in the world if we read baron finglas spenser and sir john davis we cannot miss the true genius and policy of the english government there before the revolution as well as during the whole reign of queen elizabeth sir john davis boasts of the benefits received by the natives by extending to them the english law and turning the whole kingdom into shire ground but the appearance of things alone was changed the original scheme was never deviated from for a single hour unheard of confiscations were made in the northern parts upon grounds of plots and conspiracies never proved upon their supposed authors the war of chicane succeeded to the war of arms and of hostile statutes and a regular series of operations were carried on particularly from chichesters time in the ordinary courts of justice and by special commissions and inquisitions first under pretense of tenures and then of titles in the crown for the purpose of the total extirpation of the interest of the natives in their own soil  until this species of subtle ravage being carried to the last excess of oppression and insolence under lord strafford it kindled the flames of that rebellion which broke out in      by the issue of that war by the turn which the earl of clarendon gave to things at the restoration and by the total reduction of the kingdom of ireland in      the ruin of the native irish and in a great measure too of the first races of the english was completely accomplished the new english interest was settled with as solid a stability as any thing in human affairs can look for all the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppression which were made after the last event were manifestly the effects of national hatred and scorn toward a conquered people whom the victors delighted to trample upon and were not at all afraid to provoke they were not the effect of their fears but of their security they who carried on this system looked to the irresistible force of great britain for their support in their acts of power they were quite certain that no complaints of the natives would be heard on this side of the water with any other sentiments than those of contempt and indignation their cries served only to augment their torture machines which could answer their purposes so well must be of an excellent contrivance indeed in england the double name of the complainants irish and papists it would be hard to say singly which singly was the most odious shut up the hearts of every one against them whilst that temper prevailed and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory every measure was pleasing and popular just in proportion as it tended to harass and ruin a set of people who were looked upon as enemies to god and man and indeed as a race of bigoted savages who were a disgrace to human nature itself  however as the english in ireland began to be domiciliated they began also to recollect that they had a country the english interest at first by aint and almost insensible degrees but at length openly and avowedly became an independent irish interest full as independent as it could ever have been if it had continued in the persons of the native irish and it was maintained with more skill and more consistency than probably it would have been in theirs with their views the angloirish changed their maxims  it was necessary to demonstrate to the whole people that there was something at least of a common interest combined with the independency which was to become the object of common exertions the mildness of government produced the first relaxation toward the irish the necessities and in part too the temper that predominated at this great change produced the second and the most important of these relaxations english government and irish legislature felt jointly the propriety of this measure the irish parliament and nation became independent  the true revolution to you that which most intrinsically and substantially resembled the english revolution of      was the irish revolution of      the irish parliament of      bore little resemblance to that which sat in that kingdom after the period of the first of these revolutions it bore a much nearer resemblance to that which sat under king james the change of the parliament in      from the character of the parliament which as a token of its indignation had burned all the journals indiscriminately of the former parliament in the council chamber was very visible the address of king williams parliament the parliament which assembled after the revolution amongst other causes of complaint many of them sufficiently just complains of the repeal by their predecessors of poynings law no absolute idol with the parliament of       great britain finding the angloirish highly animated with a spirit which had indeed shown itself before though with little energy and many interruptions and therefore suffered a multitude of uniform precedents to be established against it acted in my opinion with the greatest temperance and wisdom she saw that the disposition of the leading part of the nation would not permit them to act any longer the part of a garrison she saw that true policy did not require that they ever should have appeared in that character or if it had done so formerly the reasons had now ceased to operate she saw that the irish of her race were resolved to build their constitution and their polites upon another bottom with those things under her view she instantly complied with the whole of your demands without any reservation whatsoever she surrendered that boundless superiority for the preservation of which and the acquisition she had supported the english colonies in ireland for so long a time and at so vast an expense according to the standard of those ages of her blood and treasure  when we bring before us the matter which history affords for our selection it is not improper to examine the spirit of the several precedents which are candidates for our choice might it not be as well for your statesmen on the other side of the water to take an example from this latter and surely more conciliatory revolution as a pattern for your conduct toward your own fellowcitizens than from that of      when a paramount sovereignty over both you and them was more loftily claimed and more sternly exerted than at any former or at any subsequent period great britain in      rose above the vulgar ideas of policy the ordinary jealousies of state and all the sentiments of national pride and national ambition if she had been more disposed than i thank god for it she was to listen to the suggestions of passion than to the dictates of prudence she might have urged the principles the maxims the policy the practice of the revolution against the demands of the leading description in ireland with full as much plausibility and full as good a grace as any amongst them can possibly do against the supplications of so vast and extensive a description of their own people  a good deal too if the spirit of domination and exclusion had prevailed in england might have been excepted against some of the means then employed in ireland whilst her claims were in agitation they were at least as much out of the ordinary course as those which are now objected against admitting your people to any of the benefits of an english constitution most certainly neither with you nor here was any one ignorant of what was at that time said written and done but on all sides we separated the means from the end and we separated the cause of the moderate and rational from the illintentioned and seditious which on such occasions are so frequently apt to march together at that time on your part you were not afraid to review what was done at the revolution of      and what had been continued during the subsequent flourishing period of the british empire the change then made was a great and fundamental alteration in the execution it was an operose business on both sides of the water it required the repeal of several laws the modification of many and a new course to be given to an infinite number of legislative judicial and official practices and usages in both kingdoms this did not frighten any of us you are now asked to give in some moderate measure to your fellowcitizens what great britain gave to you without any measure at all yet notwithstanding all the difficulties at the time and the apprehensions which some very wellmeaning people entertained through the admirable temper in which this revolution or restoration in the nature of a revolution was conducted in both kingdoms it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either and i trust with the continuance of the same temper that it never will i think that this small inconsiderable change relative to an exclusive statute not made at the revolution for restoring the people to the benefits from which the green soreness of a civil war had not excluded them will be productive of no sort of mischief whatsoever compare what was done in      with what is wished in      consider the spirit of what has been done at the several periods of reformation and weigh maturely whether it be exactly true that conciliatory concessions are of good policy only in discussions between nations but that among descriptions in the same nation they must always be irrational and dangerous what have you suffered in your peace your prosperity or in what ought ever to be dear to a nation your glory by the last act by which you took the property of that people under the protection of the laws what reason have you to dread the consequences of admitting the people possessing that property to some share in the protection of the constitution  letter to sir h langrishe m p  ireland the english parliament early communicated to ireland ireland before the english conquest though never governed by a despotic power had no parliament how far the english parliament itself was at that time modelled according to the present form is disputed among antiquarians but we have all the reason in the world to be assured that a form of parliament such as england then enjoyed she instantly communicated to ireland and we are equally sure that almost every successive improvement in constitutional liberty as fast as it was made here was transmitted thither the feudal baronage and the feudal knighthood the roots of our primitive constitution were early transplanted into that soil and grew and flourished there magna charta if it did not give us originally the house of commons gave us at least an house of commons of weight and consequence but your ancestors did not churlishly sit down alone to the feast of magna charta ireland was made immediately a partaker this benefit of english laws and liberties i confess was not at first extended to all ireland mark the consequence english authority and english liberties had exactly the same boundaries your standard could never be advanced an inch before your privileges sir john davis shows beyond a doubt that the refusal of a general communication of these rights was the true cause why ireland was five hundred years in subduing and after the vain projects of a military government attempted in the reign of queen elizabeth it was soon discovered that nothing could make that country english in civility and allegiance but your laws and your forms of legislature it was not english arms but the english constitution that conquered ireland from that time ireland has ever had a general parliament as she had before a partial parliament you changed the people you altered the religion but you never touched the form or the vital substance of free government in that kingdom you deposed kings you restored them you altered the succession to theirs as well as to your own crown but you never altered their constitution the principle of which was respected by usurpation restored with the restoration of monarchy and established i trust for ever by the glorious revolution this has made ireland the great and flourishing kingdom that it is and from a disgrace and a burden intolerable to this nation has rendered a principal part of our strength and ornament this country cannot be said to have ever formally taxed her the irregular things done in the confusion of mighty troubles and on the hinge of great revolutions even if all were done that is said to have been done form no example if they have any effect in argument they make an exception to prove the rule none of your own liberties could stand a moment if the casual deviations from them at such times were suffered to be used as proofs of their nullity by the lucrative amount of such casual breaches in the constitution judge what the stated and fixed rule of supply has been in that

against my will mangled and stripped of the parts which were necessary to make out their just correspondence and connection in trade were of no use the next year a feeble attempt was made to bring the thing into better shape this attempt countenanced by the minister lord north  on the very first appearance of some popular uneasiness was after a considerable progress through the house thrown out by him  what was the consequence the whole kingdom of ireland was instantly in a flame threatened by foreigners and as they thought insulted by england they resolved at once to resist the power of france and to cast off yours as for us we were able neither to protect nor to restrain them forty thousand men were raised and disciplined without commission from the crown two illegal armies were seen with banners displayed at the same time and in the same country no executive magistrate no judicature in ireland would acknowledge the legality of the army which bore the kings commission and no law or appearance of law authorized the army commissioned by itself in this unexampled state of things which the least error the least trespass on the right or left would have hurried down the precipice into an abyss of blood and confusion the people of ireland demand a freedom of trade with arms in their hands they interdict all commerce between the two nations they deny all new supply in the house of commons although in time of war they stint the trust of the old revenue given for two years to all the kings predecessors to six months the british parliament in a former session frightened into a limited concession by the menaces of ireland frightened out of it by the menaces of england was now frightened back again and made an universal surrender of all that had been thought the peculiar reserved uncommunicable rights of england  the exclusive commerce of america of africa of the west indies  all the enumerations of the acts of navigation  all the manufactures  iron glass even the

chasms of our ruin we were taught wisdom by humiliation no town in england presumed to have a prejudice or dared to mutter a petition what was worse the whole parliament of england which retained authority for nothing but surrenders was despoiled of every shadow of its superintendance it was without any qualification denied in theory as it had been trampled upon in practice this scene of shame

all their subjects as on a level they are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility on account of the occasional resistance to their will which will be made by their virtue their petulance or their pride it must indeed be admitted that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flatterers talebearers parasites pimps and bussoons as any of the lowest and vilest of mankind can possibly be but they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition the want of a regular education and early habits and some lurking remains of their dignity will never permit them to become a match for an italian eunuch a mountebank a fiddler a player or any regular practitioner of that tribe the roman emperors almost from the beginning threw themselves into such hands and the mischief increased every day till its decline and its final ruin it is therefore of very great importance provided the thing is not overdone to contrive such an establishment as must almost whether a prince will or not bring into daily and hourly offices about his person a great number of his first nobility and it is rather an useful prejudice that gives them a pride in such a

should be told on occasions of congratulation that he is to consider himself as more properly the servant than the sovereign of his people for a compliment this new form of address does not seem to be very soothing those who are servants in name as well as in effect do not like to be told of their situation their duty and their obligations the slave in the old play tells his master  haec commemoratio est quafi exprobratio it is not pleasant as compliment it is not wholesome as instruction after all if the king were to bring himself to echo this new kind of address to adopt it in terms and even to take the appellation of servant of the people as his royal style how either he or we should be much mended by it i cannot imagine i have seen very assuming letters signed your most obedient humble servant the proudest domination that ever was endured on earth took a title of still greater humility than that which is now proposed for sovereigns by the apostle of liberty kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himself the servant of servants and mandates for deposing sovereigns were sealed with the signet of the fisherman  i should have considered all this as no more than a sort of slippant vain discourse in which as in an unsavory fume several persons suffer the spirit of liberty to evaporate if it were not plainly in support of the idea and a part of the scheme of cashiering kings for misconduct in that light it is worth some observation  kings in one sense are undoubtedly the servants of the people because their power has no other rational end than that of the general advantage but it is not true that they are in the ordinary sense by our constitution at least any thing like servants the essence of whose situation is to obey the commands of some other and to be removeable at pleasure  but the king of great britain obeys no other person all other persons are individually and collectively too under him and owe to him a legal obedience the law which knows neither to flatter nor to insult calls this high magistrate not our servant as this humble divine calls him but  our sovereign lord the king and we on our parts have learned to speak only the primitive language of the law and not the confused jargon of their babylonian pulpits  as he is not to obey us but as we are to obey the law in him our constitution has made no sort of provision toward rendering him as a servant in any degree responsible our constitution knows nothing of a magistrate like the justicia of arragon nor of any court legally appointed nor of any process legally settled for submitting the king to the responsibility belonging to all servants in this he is not distinguished from the commons and the lords who in their several public capacities can never be called to an account for their conduct although the revolution society chooses to assert in direct opposition to one of the wisest and most beautiful parts of our constitution that a king is no more than the first servant of the public created by it and responsible to it  reflections on the revolution in france  kings men to reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements principles correspondent to them had been preached up with great zeal every one must remember that the cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery both moral and political those who in a few months after soused over head and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption cried out violently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments which had formerly prevailed this mavelous abhorrence which the court had suddenly taken to all influence was not only circulated in conversation through the kingdom but pompously announced to the public with many other extraordinary things in a pamphlet which had all the appearance of a manifesto preparatory to some considerable enterprise throughout it was a satire though in terms managed and decent enough on the politics of the former reign it was indeed written with no small art and address  in this piece sentiments of an honest man appeared the first dawning of the new system there first appeared the idea then only in speculation of separating the court from the administration of carrying every thing from national connection to personal regards and of forming a regular party for that purpose under the name of kings men  to recommend this system to the people a perspective view of the court gorgeously painted and finely illuminated from within was exhibited to the gaping multitude party was to be totally done away with all its evil works corruption was to be cast down from court as ate was from heaven power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public spirit and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence except those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at court which was to stand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions a scheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the visionary republic of plato the whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate those good souls whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to crafty politicians indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body except those few who are not much pleased with professions of supernatural virtue who know of what stuff such professions are made for what purposes they are designed and in what they are sure constantly to end many innocent gentlemen who had been talking prose all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter began at last to open their eyes upon their own merits and to attribute their not having been lords of the treasury and lords of trade many years before merely to the prevalence of party and to the ministerial power which had frustrated the good intentions of the court in favor of their abilities now was the time to unlock the sealed fountain of royal bounty which had been infamously monopolized and huckstered and to let it flow at large upon the whole people the time was come to restore royalty to its original splendour mettre le roy horse de page became a sort of watchword and it was constantly in the mouths of all the runners of the court that nothing could preserve the balance of the constitution from being overturned by the rabble or by a faction of the nobility but to free the sovereign effectually from that ministerial tyranny under which the royal dignity had been oppressed in the person of his majestys grandfather  these were some of the many artifices used to reconcile the people to the great change which was made in the persons who composed the ministry and the still greater which was made and avowed in its constitution as to individuals other methods were employed with them in order so thoroughly to disunite every party and even every family that no concert order or effect might appear in any future opposition and in this manner an administration without connection with the people or with one another was first put in possession of government what good consequences followed from it we have all seen whether with regard to virtue public or private to the ease and happiness of the sovereign or to the real strength of government but as so much stress was then laid on the necessity of this new project it will not be amiss to take a view of the effects of this royal servitude and vile durance which was so deplored in the reign of the late monarch and was so carefully to be avoided in the reign of his successor  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  kings kings will be tyrants from policy when subjects are rebels from principle  ibid  king of great britain crown of england hereditary see kings men princes ministers cabinet double revolution society etc there is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of europe were at a remote period elective with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice but whatever kings might have been here or elsewhere a thousand years ago or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of england or france may have begun the king of great britain is at this day king by a fixed rule of succession according to the laws of his country and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty are performed by him as they are performed he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the revolution society who have not a single vote for a king amongst them either individually or collectively though i make no doubt they would soon erect themselves into an electoral college if things were ripe to give effect to their claim his majestys heirs and successors each in his time and order will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his majesty has succeeded to that he wears  whatever may be the success of evasion in explaining away the gross error of fact which supposes that his majesty though he holds it in concurrence with the wishes owes his crown to the choice of his people yet nothing can evade their full explicit declaration concerning the principle of a right in the people to choose which right is directly maintained and tenaciously adhered to all the oblique insinuations concerning election bottom in this proposition and are referable to it lest the foundation of the kings exclusive legal title should pass for a mere rant of adulatory freedom the political divine dr price proceeds dogmatically to assert p    discourse on the love of our country  that by the principles of the revolution the people of england have acquired three fundamental rights all which with him compose one system and lie together in one short sentence namely that we have acquired a right   to choose our own governors   to cashier them for misconduct   to frame a government for ourselves this new and hitherto unheard of bill of rights though made in the name of the whole people belongs to those gentlemen revolution society and their faction only the body of the people of england have no share in it they utterly disclaim it they will resist the practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes they are bound to do so by the laws of their country made at the time of that very revolution which is appealed to in favor of the fictitious rights claimed by the society which abuses its name  these gentlemen of the old jewry in all their reasonings on the revolution of      have a revolution which happened in england about forty years before and the late french revolution so much before their eyes and in their hearts that they are constantly confounding all the three together it is necessary that we should separate what they confound we must recall their erring fancies to the acts of the revolution which we revere for the discovery of its true principles if the principles of the revolution of      are any where to be found it is in the statute called the declaration of right in that most wise sober and considerate declaration drawn up by great lawyers and great statesmen and not by warm and inexperienced enthusiasts not one word is said nor one suggestion made of a general right to choose our own governors to cashier them for misconduct and to form a government for ourselves  this declaration of right the act of the  st of william and mary sess   chapter   is the cornerstone of our constitution as reinforced explained improved and in its fundamental principles for ever settled it is called an act for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and for settling the succession of the crown you will observe that these rights and this succession are declared in one body and bound indissolubly together  a few years after this period a second opportunity offered for asserting a right of election to the crown on the prospect of a total failure of issue from king william and from the princess afterward queen anne the consideration of the settlement of the crown and of a further security for the liberties of the people again came before the legislature did they this second time make any provision for legalizing the crown on the spurious revolution principles of the old jewry no they followed the principles which prevailed in the declaration of right indicating with more precision the persons who were to inherit in the protestant line  this act also incorporated by the same policy our liberties and an hereditary succession in the same act instead of a right to choose our own governors they declared that the succession in that line the protestant line drawn from james the first was absolutely necessary for the peace quiet and security of the realm and that it was equally urgent on them to maintain a certainty in the succession thereof to which the subjects may safely have recourse for their protection both these acts in which are heard the unerring unambiguous oracles of revolution policy instead of countenancing the delusive gipsey predictions of a right to choose our governors prove to a demonstration how totally adverse the wisdom of the nation was from turning a case of necessity into a rule of law  unquestionably there was at the revolution in the person of king william a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a regular hereditary succession but it is against all genuine principles of jurisprudence to draw a principle from a law made in a special case and regarding an individual person privilegium non transit in exemplum if ever there was a time favorable for establishing the principle that a king of popular choice was the only legal king without all doubt it was at the revolution its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time there is no person so completely ignorant of our history as not to know that the majority in parliament of both parties were so little disposed to any thing resembling that principle that at first they were determined to place the vacant crown not on the head of the prince of orange but on that of his wife mary daughter of king james the eldest born of the issue of that king which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his it would be to repeat a very trite story to recall to your memory all those circumstances which demonstrated that their accepting king william was not properly a choice but to all those who did not wish in effect to recall king james or to deluge their country in blood and again to bring their religion laws and liberties into the peril they had just escaped it was an act of necessity in the strictest moral sense in which necessity can be taken  in the very act in which for a time and in a single case parliament departed from the strict order of inheritance in favor of a prince who though not next was however very near in the line of succession it is curious to observe how lord summers who drew the bill called the declaration of right has comported himself on that delicate occasion it is curious to observe with what address this temporary solution of continuity is kept from the eye whilst all that could be found in this act of necessity to countenance the idea of an hereditary succession is brought forward and fostered and made the most of by this great man and by the legislature who followed him quitting the dry imperative style of an act of parliament he makes the lords and commons fall to a pious legislative ejaculation and declare that they consider it as a mavelous providence and merciful goodness of god to this nation to preserve their said majestys royal persons most happily to reign over us on the throne of their ancestors for which from the bottom of their hearts they return their humblest thanks and praises the legislature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the first of queen elizabeth chap  d and of that of james the first chap  st both acts strongly declaratory of the inheritable nature of the crown and in many parts they follow with a nearly literal precision the words and even the form of thanksgiving which is found in these old declaratory statutes  the two houses in the act of king william did not thank god that they had found a fair opportunity to assert a right to choose their own governors much less to make an election the only lawful title to the crown their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of it as much as possible was by them considered as a providential escape they threw a politic wellwrought veil over every circumstance tending to weaken the rights which in the meliorated order of succession they meant to perpetuate or which might furnish a precedent for any future departure from what they had then settled for ever accordingly that they might not relax the nerves of their monarchy and that they might preserve a close conformity to the practice of their ancestors as it appeared in the declaratory statutes of queen mary  st mary sess   chapter   and queen elizabeth in the next clause they vest by recognition in their majestys all the legal prerogatives of the crown declaring that in them they are most fully rightfully and entirely invested incorporated united and annexed in the clause which follows for preventing questions by reason of any pretended titles to the crown they declare observing also in this the traditionary language along with the traditionary policy of the nation and repeating as from a rubric the language of the preceding acts of elizabeth and james that on the preserving a certainty in the succession thereof the unity peace and tranquillity of this nation does under god wholly depend  they knew that a doubtful title of succession would but too much resemble an election and that an election would be utterly destructive of the unity peace and tranquillity of this nation which they thought to be considerations of some moment to provide for these objects and therefore to exclude for ever the old jewry doctrine of a right to choose our own governors they follow with a clause containing a most solemn pledge taken from the preceding act of queen elizabeth as solemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favor of an hereditary succession and as solemn a renunciation as could be made of the principles by this society imputed to them the lords spiritual and temporal and commons do in the name of all the people aforesaid most humbly and faithfully submit themselves their heirs and posterities for ever and do faithfully promise that they will stand to maintain and defend their said majestys and also the limitation of the crown herein specified and contained to the utmost of their powers etc etc  so far is it from being true that we acquired a right by the revolution to elect our kings that if we had possessed it before the english nation did at that time most solemnly renounce and abdicate it for themselves and for all their posterity for ever these gentlemen may value themselves as much as they please on their whig principles but i never desire to be thought a better whig than lord summers or to understand the principles of the revolution better than those by whom it was brought about or to read in the declaration of right any mysteries unknown to those whose penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances and in our hearts the words and spirit of that immortal law  it is true that aided with the powers derived from force and opportunity the nation was at that time in some sense free to take what course it pleased for filling the throne but only free to do so upon the same grounds on which they might have wholly abolished their monarchy and every other part of their constitution however they did not think such bold changes within their commission it is indeed difficult perhaps impossible to give limits to the mere abstract competence of the supreme power such as was exercised by parliament at that time but the limits of a moral competence subjecting even in powers more indisputably sovereign occasional will to permanent reason and to the steady maxims of faith justice and fixed fundamental policy are perfectly intelligible and perfectly binding upon those who exercise any authority under any name or under any title in the state the house of lords for instance is not morally competent to dissolve the house of commons no nor even to dissolve itself nor to abdicate if it would its portion in the legislature of the kingdom though a king may abdicate for his own person he cannot abdicate for the monarchy by as strong or by a stronger reason the house of commons cannot renounce its share of authority the engagement and pact of society which generally goes by the name of the constitution forbids such invasion and such surrender the constituent parts of a state are obliged to hold their public faith with each other and with all those who derive any serious interest under their engagements as much as the whole state is bound to keep its faith with separate communities otherwise competence and power would soon be confounded and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force on this principle the succession of the crown has always been what it now is an hereditary succession by law in the old line it was a succession by the common law in the new by the statute law operating on the principles of the common law not changing the substance but regulating the mode and describing the persons both these descriptions of law are of the same force and are derived from an equal authority emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the state communi sponsione reipublicae and as such are equally binding on king and people too as long as the terms are observed and they continue the same body politic  it is far from impossible to reconcile if we do not suffer ourselves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphysic sophistry the use both of a fixed rule and an occasional deviation the sacredness of an hereditary principle of succession in our government with a power of change in its application in cases of extreme emergency even in that extremity if we take the measure of our rights by our exercise of them at the revolution the change is to be confined to the peccant part only to the part which produced the necessary deviation and even then it is to be effected without a decomposition of the whole civil and political mass for the purpose of originating a new civil order out of the first elements of society  a state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation without such means it might even risk the loss of that part of the constitution which it wished the most religiously to preserve the two principles of conservation and correction operated strongly at the two critical periods of the restoration and revolution when england found itself without a king at both those periods the nation had lost the bond of union in their ancient edifice they did not however dissolve the whole fabric on the contrary in both cases they regenerated the deficient part of the old constitution through the parts which were not impaired they kept these old parts exactly as they were that the part recovered might be suited to them they acted by the ancient organized states in the shape of their old organization and not by the organic moleculoe of a disbanded people at no time perhaps did the sovereign legislature manifest a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of british constitutional policy than at the time of the revolution when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary succession the crown was carried somewhat out of the line in which it had before moved but the new line was derived from the same stock it was still a line of hereditary descent still an hereditary descent in the same blood though an hereditary descent qualified with protestantism when the legislature altered the direction but kept the principle they showed that they held it inviolable  on this principle the law of inheritance had admitted some amendment in the old time and long before the era of the revolution some time after the conquest great questions arose upon the legal principles of hereditary descent it became a matter of doubt whether the heir per capita or the heir per stirpes was to succeed but whether the heir per capita gave way when the heirdom per stirpes took place or the catholic heir when the protestant was preferred the inheritable principle survived with a sort of immortality through all transmigrations  multosque per annos slat fortuna domus et avi numerantur avorum this is the spirit of our constitution not only in its settled course but in all its revolutions whoever came in or however he came in whether he obtained the crown by law or by force the hereditary succession was either continued or adopted  the gentlemen of the society for revolutions see nothing in that of      but the deviation from the constitution and they take the deviation from the principle for the principle they have little regard to the obvious consequences of their doctrine though they must see that it leaves positive authority in very few of the positive institutions of this country when such an unwarrantable maxim is once established that no throne is lawful but the elective no one act of the princes who preceded their era of fictitious election can be valid do these theorists mean to imitate some of their predecessors who dragged the bodies of our ancient sovereigns out of the quiet of their tombs do they mean to attaint and disable backwards all the kings that have reigned before the revolution and consequently to stain the throne of england with the blot of a continual usurpation do they mean to invalidate annul or to call into question together with the titles of the whole line of our kings that great body of our statute law which passed under those whom they treat as usurpers to annul laws of inestimable value to our liberties  of as great value at least as any which have passed at or since the period of the revolution if kings who did not owe their crown to the choice of their people had no title to make laws what will become of the statute de tullagio non concedendo  of the petition of right  of the act of habeas corpus do these new doctors of the rights of men presume to assert that king james the second who came to the crown as next of blood according to the rules of a then unqualified succession was not to all intents and purposes a lawful king of england before he had done any of those acts which were justly construed into an abdication of his crown if he was not much trouble in parliament might have been saved at the period these gentlemen commemorate but king james was a bad king with a good title and not an usurper the princes who succeeded according to the act of parliament which settled the crown on the electress sophia and on her descendants being protestants came in as much by a title of inheritance as king james did he came in according to the law as it stood at his accession to the crown and the princes of the house of brunswick came to the inheritance of the crown not by election but by the law as it stood at their several accessions of protestant descent and inheritance as i hope i have shown sufficiently  the law by which this royal family is specifically destined to the succession is the act of the   th and   th of king william the terms of this act bind us and our heirs and our posterity to them their heirs and their posterity the declaration of right had bound us to the heirs of king william and queen mary it therefore secures both an hereditary crown and an hereditary allegiance on what ground except the constitutional policy of forming an establishment to secure that kind of succession which is to preclude a choice of the people for ever could the legislature have fastidiously rejected the fair and abundant choice which our own country presented to them and searched in strange lands for a foreign princess from whose womb the line of our future rulers were to derive their title to govern millions of men through a series of ages  the princess sophia was named in the act of settlement of the   th and   th of king william for a stock and root of inheritance to our kings and not for her merits as a temporary administratrix of a power which she might not and in fact did not herself ever exercise she was adopted for one reason and for one only because says the act the most excellent princess sophia electress and duchess dowager of hanover is daughter of the most excellent princess elizabeth late queen of bohemia daughter of our late sovereign lord king james the first of happy memory and is hereby declared to be the next in succession in the protestant line etc etc and the crown shall continue to the heirs of her body being protestants this limitation was made by parliament that through the princess sophia an inheritable line not only was to be continued in future but what they thought very material that through her it was to be connected with the old stock of inheritance in king james the first in order that the monarchy might preserve an unbroken unity through all ages and might be preserved with safety to our religion in the old approved mode by descent in which if our liberties had been once endangered they had often through all storms and struggles of prerogative and privilege been preserved they did well no experience hrs taught us that in any other course or method than that of an hereditary crown our liberties can be regularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our hereditary right an irregular convulsive movement may be necessary to throw off an irregular convulsive disease but the course of succession is the healthy habit of the british constitution was it that the legislature wanted at the act for the limitation of the crown in the hanoverian line drawn through the female descendants of james the first a due sense of the inconveniences of having two or three or possibly more foreigners in succession to the british throne no  they had a due sense of the evils which might happen from such foreign rule and more than a due sense of them but a more decisive proof cannot be given of the full conviction of the british nation that the principles of the revolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their pleasure and without any attention to the ancient fundamental principles of our government than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary protestant succession in the old line with all the dangers and all the inconveniences of its being a foreign line full before their eyes and operating with the utmost force upon their minds  reflections on the
