one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight  one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight  a dialogue something like horace  by mr pope  london printed for t cooper at the globe in paternosterrow price one shilling  one thousand seven hundred and thirty eight dialogue a not twice a twelvemonth you appear in print and when it comes the court see nothing in it you grow correct that once with rapture writ and are besides too moral for a wit decay of parts alas we all must feel  why now this moment dont i see you steal it is all from horace did not horace say lord fanny spun a thousand lines a day and long before you in much better meter laugh at those fools who put their trust in peter but horace sir was delicate was nice bubo observes he lashed no sort of vice horace would say sir billy served the crown blunt could do business h  ggins knew the town sir george of some slight gallantries suspect in reverend s  n note a small neglect and own the spaniard did a waggish thing who cropped our ears and sent them to the king his sly polite insinuating style could please at court and made augustus smile an artful manager that crept between his friends and shame and was a kind of screen omne vafer vitium ridenti flaccus amico tangit and admissus circum praecordia ludit   but faith your very friends will soon be sore patriots there are who wish you would jest no more  and where is the glory twill be only thought the great man never offered you a groat go see sir robert   b see sir robert  hum  and never laugh  for all my life to come seen him i have but in his happier hour of social pleasure illexchangd for power would he oblige me let me only find he thinks one poet of no venal kind come come at all i laugh he laughs no doubt the only difference is i dare laugh out  a why yes with scripture still you may be free a horselaugh if you please at honesty a joke on jekyl or some odd old whig who never changed his principle or wig a patriot is a fool in every age whom all lord chamberlains allow the stage these nothing hurts they keep their fashion still and wear their strange old virtue as they will if any ask you who is the man so near his prince that writes in verse and has his ear why answer lyttelton and i will engage the worthy youth shall never be in a rage but were his verses vile his whisper base you would quickly find him in lord fannys case aegysthus verres hurt not honest fleury but well may put some statesmen in a fury laugh then at any but at fools or foes these you but anger and you mend not those laugh at your friends and if your friends are sore so much the better you may laugh the more to vice and folly to confine the jest sets half the world god knows against the rest did not the sneer of more impartial men at sense and virtue balance all again judicious wits spread wide the ridicule and charitably comfort knave and fool  b dear sir forgive the prejudice of youth adieu distinction satire warmth and truth come harmless characters that no one hit come henleys oratory osborns wit the honey dropping from ty  ls tongue the flowers of bub  ton the flow of y  ng the gracious dew of pulpit eloquence and all the wellwhipt cream of courtly sense that first was h  vys f  s next and then the s  tes and then h  vys once again o come that easy ciceronian style so latin yet so english all the while as though the pride of middleton and bland all boys may read and girls may understand then might i sing without the least offense and all i sung should be the nations sense so  satire is no more  i feel it die  no gazeteer more innocent than i and let a godsname every fool and knave be graced through life and flattered in his grave  a why so if satire know its time and place you still may lash the greatest  in disgrace for merit will by turns forsake them all would you know when exactly when they fall but let all satire in all changes spare immortal s  k and grave de  re silent and soft as saints remove to heaven all ties dissolved and every sin forgiven these may some gentle ministerial wing receive and place for ever near a king there where no passion pride or shame transport lulled with the sweet nepenthe of a court there where no fathers brothers friends disgrace once break their rest or stir them from their place but past the sense of human miseries all tears are wiped for ever from all eyes no cheek is known to blush no heart to throb save when they lose a question or a job  b good heaven forbid that i should blast their glory who know how like whigministers to tory and when three sovreigns died could scarce be vexed considring what a gracious prince was next have i in silent wonder seen such things as pride in slaves and avarice in kings and at a peer or peeress shall i fret who starves a mother or forswears a debt virtue i grant you is an empty boast but shall the dignity of vice be lost ye gods shall cibbers son without rebuke swear like a lord or rich outwhore a duke a favrites porter with his master vie be bribed as often and as often lie is it for w  rd or peter paltry things to pay their debts or keep their faith like kings if author of a book entitled the oracles of reon blount destroyed himself he played the man and so may thou illustrious passeran but shall a printer weary of his life learn from their books to hang himself and wife this this my friend i cannot will not bear vice thus abused demands a nations care this calls the church to deprecate our sin and hurls the thunder of the laws on gin let humble foster if he will excel ten metropolitans in preaching well a simple quaker or a quakers wife outdo l  d  ffe in doctrine  yea in life let lowborn allen with an awkward shame do good by stealth and blush to find it fame virtue may choose the high or low degree it is just alike to virtue and to me dwell in a monk or light upon a king she is still the same beloved contented thing vice is undone if she forgets her birth and stoops from angels to the dregs of earth but it is the fall degrades her to a whore let greatness own her and she is mean no more her birth her beauty crowds and courts confess chaste matrons praise her and grave bishops bless in golden chains the willing world she draws and hers the gospel is and hers the laws mounts the tribunal lifts her scarlet head and sees pale virtue carted in her stead lo at the wheels of her triumphal car old englands genius rough with many a scar dragged in the dust his arms hang idly round his flag inverted trails along the ground our youth all livryd over with foreign gold before her dance behind her crawl the old see thronging millions to the pagod run and offer country parent wife or son hear her black trumpet through the land proclaim that not to be corrupted is the shame in soldier churchman patriot man in power it is avarice all ambition is no more see all our nobles begging to be slaves see all our fools aspiring to be knaves the wit of cheats the courage of a whore are what ten thousand envy and adore all all look up with reverential awe on crimes that escape or triumph over the law while truth worth wisdom daily we decry  nothing is sacred now but villainy yet
