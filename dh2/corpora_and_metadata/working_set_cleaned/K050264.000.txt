an answer to a question that no body thinks of viz but what if the queen should die  london printed for j baker at the black boy in paternoster row      price six pence  an answer to a question etc that we are to have a peace or that the peace is made what sort of peace or how it has been brought about these are questions the world begins to have done with they have been so much so often and to so little purpose banded about and tossed like a shuttlecock from one party to another the parties themselves begin to want breath to rail and throw scandal roper and ridpath like two tom t  men have thrown nightdirt at one another so long and gropd into so many jakess up to their elbows to find it that they stink now in the nostrils of their own party they are become perfectly nauseous to read the nation is surfeited of them and the people begin to be tired with ill using one another would any tolerable face appear upon things we might expect the people would be inclined to be easy and were the eyes of some great men open they may see this was the opportunity they never had before to make the nation easy and themselves safe the main thing which agitates the minds of men now is the protestant succession and the pretender much pains have been taken on both sides to amuse the world about this remaining dispute one side to make us believe it is safe and the other to convince us it is in danger neither side has been able to expatiate upon the part they affirm those who say the protestant succession is secure have not yet shown us any step taken since these new transactions for its particular security those who say it is in danger have not so clearly determined even among themselves from what particular head of public management that danger chiefly proceeds both these uncertainties serve to perplex us and to leave the thing more undetermined than consists with the public ease of the peoples minds to contribute something to that ease and bring those whose place it is to consider of ways to make the people easy in this case this work is made public possibly the question propounded may not meet with a categorical answer but this is certain it shall show you more directly what is the chief question which the substance of things before us is like to turn upon and to which all our questions seem to tend were the great difficulty of the succession brought to a narrow compass though we might spend fewer words about it we should sooner come to a direct answer before i come to the great and chief question upon which this affair so much seems to turn it seems needful to put the previous question upon which so much debate has been among us and let that be examined this previous question is this is there any real danger of the protestant succession is there any danger that the pretender shall be brought in upon us is there any danger of popery and tyranny by restoring the son as they call him of abdicated king james this is the previous question as we may now call it it is well known that there are some people among us who are so far from allowing that there is any such danger as the said question mentions that they will have it be a token of disaffection to the government to put the question and are for loading whoever shall offer to start such a question with characters and patrymarks odious to good men such as incendiary promoter of discontents raiser of faction divider of the people and the like names which the writer of these sheets at the same time both contemns and abhors he cannot see that he is any enemy to the queen in inquiring as diligently as possible whether there are any attempts to depose her or dangerous prospects of bringing in the hated rival of her glory and dominion it is so far from that that it is apparently the duty of every true subject of her majesty to inquire seriously whether the public peace the queens safety her throne or her person is in any danger from the wicked design of her and her peoples enemies wherefore and for the joint concern every protestant britain has in this thing i shall make no difficulty plainly and seriously to state and to answer this previous question  viz whether there is any danger of the protestant succession from the present measures and from the present people concerned i am not ignorant of what has been said by some to prove that the present ministry cannot be suspected of having any view to the pretender in any of their measures the best reason which i have seen given upon that subject is that it is not their interest and that as we have not found them fools that are blind to their own interest that either do not understand or pursue it this we find handled sundry ways by sundry authors and very much insisted upon as a foundation sor us to build upon we shall give our thoughts upon it with plainness and without fear or favor good manners requires we should speak of the ministry with all due regard to their character and persons this is a tract designed to inquire seriously of a weighty and essential not a trifling thing which requires but a trifling examination nor shall it be handled here with satyr and scurrility we approve neither of the flatteries of one side or the insultings of the other we shall readily and most willingly join with those who are of opinion that it is not the interest of the ministry to be for the pretender and that the ministry are not blind to or careless of their own interest and consequently that the ministry cannot be for the pretender this i hope may be called a direct answer when i say cannot i must not be understood potentially that they have no moral capacity but they cannot without such inconsistencies contradictions and improbable things happening in which render it highly irrational so much us to suppose it of them to shut the door against any possibility of cavil it may be needful also to take it with us as we go what we mean by the words be for the pretender and this can be no otherwise understood than to have a design however remote and upon whatever views to bring him in to possess the throne of these kingdoms the matter then being laid down thus as sincerely and plainly as possible we come to the question point blank and think it our duty to say with the greatest sincerity that we do not believe the ministry are in any kind or with any prospect near or remote acting for or with a design or view to bring in the pretender having granted this we must however to prevent any breaking in by way of cavil on one hand or triumph on the other subjoyn immediately that we do not in the least grant by this that the protestant succession is in no danger even from several of the measures now taken in the world it is far from any reflection upon the ministry to say that however they may act upon a right sincere principle for the protestant succession in all they do which as above we profess to believe yet that many of the tools they make use of are of another make and have no edge to cut any other way no thoughts to move them toward any other end no other center which they can have any tendency to that the pretenders interest is the magnet which draws them by its secret influence to point to him as their pole that they have their aim at his establishment here and own it to be their aim and as they are not shy to prosess it among themselves so their conduct in many things makes it sufficiently public this is not meant as any reflection upon the ministry for making use of such men the late ministry did the same and every ministry will and must employ men sometimes not as they always join with them in their politic principles but as either the men are found useful in their several employments or as the ministry may be under other circumstances which makes it necessary to them to employ them nor as the review well enough observed does it follow that because the ministry have employed or joined with jacobites in the public affairs that therefore they must have done it with a jacobite principle but let the ministry employ these men by what necessity or upon what occasion they will though it may not follow that the ministry are therefore for the pretender yet it does not also follow that there is no danger of the protestant succession from the employing those sort of people for what if the queen should die  the ministry it is hoped are established in the interest of their queen and country and therefore it has been argued that supposing the ministry had the pretender in their eye yet that it is irrational to suggest that they can have any such view during the life of her present majesty nay even those professed jacobites who we spoke of just now cannot be so ungrateful to think of deposing the queen who has been so bountiful so kind so exceeding good to them as in several cases to suffer them to be brought into the management of her own affairs when by their character they might have been thought dangerous even to her person thus winning and engaging them by her bounty and the confidence that has been placed in them not to attempt any thing to her prejudice without the most monstrous ingratitude without flying in the face of all that sense of honor and obligation which it is possible for men of common sense to entertain and it can hradly be thought that even papists themselves under the highest possessions of their religious zeal can conquer the native aversions they must have to such abominable ingratitude or to think of bringing in the pretender upon this protestant nation even while the queen shall be on the throne but though this may and some doubt that also tie up their hands during the queens life yet they themselves give us but small reason to expect any thing from them afterward and it will be hard to find any body to vouch for them then these very jacobites papists and professed enemies to the revolution may be supposed upon these pretentions to be quiet and offer no violence to the present establishment while her majesty has the possession and while that life lasts to which they are so much indebted for her royal goodness and clemency but what would they do if the queen should die  come we next to the french king we are told that not the french king only but even the whole french nation are wonderfully forward to acknowledge the obligation they are under to the justice and favor which they have received from her majesty in the putting an end to the war a war which lay heavy upon them and threatened the very name of the french nation with ruin and much more threatened the glory of the french court and of their great monarch with an entire overthrow a total eclipse a war which by their own confession it was impossible for them long to have supported the expenses of and which by the great superiority of the allies became dreadful to them and that every campaign more than other a war which they were in such pain to see the end of that they tried all the powers and courts in christendom who were the least neutral to engage a mediation in order to a treaty and all in vain and a war which if her majesty had not inclined to put an end to must have ended perhaps to the disadvantage and confusion of both france and spain if not of all christendom the obligations the french are under for the bringing this war to so just and honorable a conclusion are not at all concealed nay the freuch themselves have not been backward to make them public the declarations made by the freuch king of his sincerity in the overtures made for a general peace the protestations of his being resolved to enter into an entire confidence and a league offensive and defensive with the queens majesty for the preservation of the peace of christendom his recognition of her majestys just right to the crown his entering into articles to preserve the union acknowledging the ninth electorate in favor of the house of hanover and joining in the great affair of the protestant succession as these all convince the world of the necessity his affairs were reduced to and the great advantages accruing to him by a peace so they seem to be so many arguments against our fears of the french entering into any engagements against the crown of britain much less any against the possession of the queen during her life not that the honor and sincerity of the king of france is a foundation fit for her majesty or her people to have any dependence upon and the fraction of former treaties by that court when the glory of that monarch or his particular views of things has dictated such opportunity to him as he thought fit to close with are due cautions to us all not to have any dependence of that kind but the state of his affairs and the condition the war has reduced him to may give us some ground to think our selves safe on that side he knows what power he has taken off from his enemies in making peace with her majesty he knows very well with what loss he sits down how his affairs are weakened and what need he has to take breath after so terrible a war besides the flame such an action would kindle again in europe how it would animate this whole british nation against him in such a manner and endanger bringing in a new war and perhaps a new confederacy upon him so violently and that before he would be in a condition to match them that no one can reasonably suppose the french king will run the hazard of it and these things may tend to make some people easier than ordinary in the affair of the succession believing that the french king stands in too much need of the favor of the queen of great britain whose power it well behooves him to keep in friendship with him and whose nation he will be very cautious of provoking a third time as he has already done twice to his fatal experience all these things we say may seem pretty well to assure us that nothing is to be feared on that side so long as her majesty lives to sit upon the british throne but all leaves our grand question unanswered and though we may argue strongly for the french kings conduct while the present reign continues yet few will say what he will do if the queen should die  nay we may even mention the pretender himself if he has any about him whose councils are fit to be depended upon and can direct him to make a wise and prudent judgment of his own affairs if he acts by any scope of policy and can take his measures with any foresight most easy it is for them to see that it must be in vain for him to think of making any attempt in britain during the life of the queen or to expect to despose her majesty and set himself up the french power upon which he has already in vain depended as it has not hitherto been able to serve him or his father but that their exile has continued now above twenty four years so much less can he be able to assist him now while he has been brought as it were to kneel to the british court to put an end for him to this cruel destructive war the reason is just spoken to  viz that this would be to rekindle that flame which he has gotten so lately quenched and which cost him so much art so much management so much submission to the allies to endeavor the quenching of before to attack the queen of great britain now in behalf of the pretender would not only be in the highest degree ungrateful perfidious and dishonorable but would for ever make the british court as well as the whole nation his violent and implacable enemies but would also involve him again in a new war with all europe who would very gladly fall in again with britain to pull down more effectually the french power which has so long been a terror to its neighbors so that the pretender can expect no help from the king of france as to what the pope the spaniard and a few petty popish powers who might pretend upon a religious prospect to assist him and with whose aid and the assistance of his party here he may think fit to hazard an attempt here for the crown it is evident and his own friends will agree in it that while the queen lives it is nonscence and ridiculous for them to attempt it that it would immediately arm the whole nation against them as one man and in humane probability it would like as his supposed father was served at the revolution be the ruin of his whole interest and blow him at once quite out of the nation i believe that there are very few who alarm themselves much with the fears of the pretender from the apprehension of his own strength from abroad or from his own party and friends at home here were they once sure that he should receive no assistance from the king of france if then the king of france cannot be reasonably supposed either to be inclined or be in a conditon to appear for him or act in his behalf during the life of the queen neither can the pretender say some unless he is resolved to ruin all his friends and at last to ruin himself make any attempt of that kind during her majestys life but what if the queen should die  having then viewed the several points of the nations compass whence our danger of jacobite plots and projects against the protestant succession may be expected to come let us now enquire a little of the state of the nation that we make a right estimate of our condition and may know what to trust to in cases of difficulty as they lie before us in doing this as well to avoid giving offense to the people now in power as to the entering into the quarrels which engage the present contending parties in this divided nation we shall allow however some may think fit to question it the main debate and grant this for the present as a fundamental  viz that we are in no danger of the pretender during this queens reign or during this ministrys administration under her majesty and avoiding all contention of that kind shall allow our condition to be safe in every article as we go along for so long as the queen lives referring the observation of things in every head to those who can answer the main question in our title  viz but what if the queen should die  first of all it may be noticed that the present safety of this nation whether we respect liberty religion property or public safety and prosperity depends upon this one fundamental  viz that alluding reverently to that text of scripture we are all built upon the foundation of the late revolution established law and right being the chief cornerstone by this it is that her majesty is made our queen the entail of the crown being reserved in the remainder to her majesty in the act of settlement made at the filling up the vacant throne and by all those subsequent acts which her majestys title was confirmed by during the life of the late king this revolution is that upon which the liberties and religion of this nation were rebuilt after the conflagration that was made of them in the calamitous times of king charles ii and king james ii and from hence to the love of liberty which is found almost to be naturally placed in the hearts of true britains and upon the view whereof they have acted all along in the late war and in all their transactions at home has obtained the title of a revolution principle noting this then as above that her majesty is our queen by virtue of the revolution and that during her reign that establishment alone must be the foundation of all her administration this must effectually secure us against any apprehension that the persons acting under her majesty can act in behalf of the pretender during her majestys life for that they must immediately overthrow the throne turn the queen out of it and renounce the revolution upon which her majestys possession is established as the revolution therefore is the base upon which the throne of her majestys possession is established so her majesty and all that act under her are obliged to act upon the foot of the said revolution even will they nil they or else they sink immediately out of rightful power to act at all her majestys title would fall to the ground their own commissions would from that hour be void they must declare their royal mistress and benefactress a subject to the pretender and all her pretenses of rightful possession injurious and an usurpation these things being so plain that he that runs may read them seem to stop all our mouths from so much as any suggestion that any body can attempt to bring in the pretender upon us during the the life of her present majesty but what if the queen should die  subsequent to the revolution many essential things are formed by our parliaments and government for the public good on the foundation of which much of the present peace of the nation is founded and while the said revolution foundation stands fast there is good ground to believe those essential points shall be preserved if then we are satisfied that the revolution principle shall subsist as long as the queen lives then for so long we may have good ground to believe we shall enjoy all those advantages and benefits which we received from the said revolution but still when we look back upon those dear privileges the obtaining of which has cost so much money and the maintaining of which has cost so much blood we must with a deep sigh reflect upon the precarious circumstances of the nation whose best privileges hang uncertain upon the nice and tender thread of royal mortality and say we are happy while these last and these may last while her majesty shall live but what if the queen should die  let us descend to some other particulars of those blessings which we do enjoy purely as the effect of the revolution and examine in what posture we stand with respect to them and what assurance we have of their continuance and first as to toleration this was the greatest and first blessing the nation felt after the immediate settlement of the crown which was established by virtue of the revolution engagement mentioned in the prince of oranges declaration the design of this law as it was to give liberty for the worship of god to such dissenters as could not conform to the church of england and to give ease to tender consciences so as by the law it self is expressed it was to ease the minds of their majestys subjects and to give general quiet to the nation whose peace had been frequently disturbed by the violence of persecution we have seen frequent assurances given of the inviolable preservation of this toleration by her majesty from the throne in her speeches to the parliament and during her majestys reign we have great reason to hope the quiet of the poor people shall not be broken by either repealing that law or invading the intent and meaning of it while it remains in force and there is a great many reasons to hope that the present ministry are so far convinced of the necessity of the said toleration in order to preserve the peace and the common neighborhood of people that they can have no thought of breaking in upon it or any way making the people who enjoy it uneasy nay the rather we believe this because the ferment such a breach would put the whole nation into is not the safest condition the government can be in upon any account and as the ministry cannot be supposed to desire to give uneasiness and provocation to the commons but rather to keep them easi and quiet and prevent the enemies  the present management from having any handle to take hold of to fomen distractions and disturbances among the people it cannot be thought that the will push at the toleration so as to deprive the people of so considerable  thing but after the present happy  blishment shall have received such a fa blow as that will be of the queen death and when popish pretenders and french influencies shall prevail it may well be expected then that not toleration of dissenters only but even of the whole protestant religion may be in danger to be lost so that however secure we are of the free enjoyment of liberty of religion during the queens life we may be very well allowed to ask this question with respect to not toleration only but the church of england also  viz what will become of them if the queen should die  from toleration in england come we to the constitution of religious affairs in scotland and here we have different views from what the case in england affords us the powerful interest of jacobitism if it may be said to be formidable any where is so there the enemies of the revolution are all the implacable enemies of the church establishment there nay many thousands are the declared enemies of the revolution and of the queens being upon the throne from a mere implacable aversion to the presbyterian kirk which is erected and established by that very revolution which has set the queen upon the throne the union which has yet farther established that prebeterian kirk is for that reason the aversion of the same people as it is the aversion of the jacobites by being a further confirmation of the hannover succession and a further fixing the queen upon the throne now as it is sure that as before while the queen lives and the revolution influence carries its usual force in the kingdoms now united the presbyterian kirk must and will remain and all the little encroachments which have been made upon the kirk as it may be observed though they have created uneasiness enough yet they still seem to suppose that the establishment it self cannot be overthrown the union and the revolution settlement remain in scotland and must remain as is said while the queen lives we can have no apprehensions of them the reasons are given above and as we said before we are to take them for granted in this discourse to avoid other cavils while then the revolution and the union are to be the foundation of the administration in scotland the presbyterian established church government there must also remain as the only legal kirk constitution and so long we can entertain no fears of any thing on that account but what if the queen should die  from such religious concerns as effect presbyterians and other sectaries or dissenters as we call them let us take a look at the remote danger of the church of england we have had a great deal of distraction in the time of the late ministry about the danger of the church and as it appears by the memorial of the church of england published in those times and reprinted since by the sermons of dr sacheverell and the eminent speeches at his trial that danger was more especially suggested to come from the increase of dissenters here the ministry of the whiggs and the establishing presbyterianism in the north of britain these things being in a great measure now overthrown by the late change of the ministry and the new methods taken in the management of the public affairs the people who were then supposed to aim at overthrowing the ministry of those whiggs are pleased to assure us of the safety and flourishing condition of the church now more than ever while the other party taking up the like cry of the danger of the church tell us that now a real visible appearace of danger to the church is before us and that not only to the church of england as such but even to the whole interest and safety of the protestant religion in britain that this danger is imminent and unavoidable from the great growth and increase of popery and professed jacobitism in the nation this indeed they give but too great demonstrations of from the spreading of popish agents among us whose professed employment it is to amuse and impose upon the poor country people as well in matters of jacobitism as of religion and the great success these emissaries of satan have obtained in several parts of britain but especially in the north now though we cannot but acknowledge but that much of this alarm is justly grounded and that the endeavors of popish and jacobite agents and emissaries in diverse parts of britian are too apparently successful yet as wise men could never see into the reality of such danger as was by some people pretended to be impending over the church in the time of the late ministry so neither can we allow that popery is so evidently at the door at this time as that we should be apprehensive of having the church of england immediately transversd and the protestant religion in britain and one great reason for this opinion is that her majesty who is a zealous professor of the protestant religion and has been bred up in the bosom of the church of england is so rooted in principle and had declared from her very infancy such horror and aversion to popery that it cannot enter into any true protestant thoughts to apprehend any thing of that kind while her majesty lives but lord have mercy upon us what if the queen should die  from religious matters come we next to consider civil interest liberties privileges properties the great article that in the late revolution went always coupled in the nations negative with that of religion as if they were woven together and was always cried upon by the mob in one breath  viz no popery no slavery the first of these concerns our civil interest such as the public credit by the occasions of a long and expensive war and to prevent levying severe taxes for the carrying on the war such as would be grievous to trade oppressive to the poor and difficult to be paid the parliament for the ease of the subjects thought fit rather to lay funds of interest to raise money upon by way of loan establishing those interests payable as annuities and annual payments for the benefit of those who advanced their money for the public service and to make these things current that the public credit might be sacred and the people be made free to advance their money all possible assurances of parliament have been given that the payments of interests and annuities shall be kept punctually and exactly according to the acts of parliament that no misapplicaons of the money shall be made or converting the money received upon one to make good the deficiency of the other and hitherto the injunctions of that kind have been exactly observed and the payments punctually made which we call the credit of the nation at the first of the late change when the new ministry began to act the fright the people were put in upon the suggestion of some that all the parliamentary funds should be wiped off with a sponge was very considerable and the credit of those funds sunk exceedingly with but the bare apprehension of such a blow the sums being infinitely great and the number of indigent families being incredibly many whose whole substance lay in those securities and whose bread depended upon those interests being punctually paid but wiser men saw quickly there was no ground for those fears that the new ministry stood upon a foot that could no more be supported without the public credit than those that went before them that especially while they were under a necessity of borrowing further sums they behoved to secure the punctual paying of the old and by making the people entirely easy not only take from them the apprehensions they were under of losing what they lent already but make them forward and willing to advance more to this purpose they not only endeavored to give the people all possible satisfaction that their money was safe and that the funds laid by the parliament in the former ministry should be kept sacred and the payments punctually made but took care to obtain parliamentary securities by real funds to be settled for the payment of those debts contracted by the former ministry and for which no provision was made before this was the establishment of a fund for payment of the interests of the navy debt ordnance victualling transport etc to the vallue of seven or eight millions which is the substance of what we now call the south sea stock by this means the public credit which it was suggested would receive such a blow at the change as that it should never recover again and that it would be impossible for the new ministry to raise any needful sums of money for the carrying on the war or for the public occasions recovered it self so as that the government has ever since found it easy to borrow what ever sums they thought fit to demand in the same manner as before now that these loans are safe no man that weighs the circumstances of the ministry and government and the circumstances of the people can doubt the first being in a constant necessity of supporting the public credit for the carrying on public affairs on any sudden emergency that may happen and being liable to the resentment of parliament if any open infraction should be made upon the funds which touches so nearly the honor of the parliaments and the interest of most of the best families in the nation while this is the case we think it is not rational to believe that any ministry will venture to attack parliamentary credit in such a manner and this will eminently be the case as long as her majesty sits on the throne nor can a thing so barefacdly tyrannical and arbitrary and above all dishonourble and unjust be suggested as possible to be attempted in the reign of so just and conscientious a prince so that we may be very willing to allow that there is not the least danger of the public faith being broken the public credit lost the public funds stopped or the money being misapplyd no cheat no sponge while her majesty but alas for us what if the queen should die  from this piece of civil right come we to those things we call liberties and privileges these may indeed be joined in some respects but as we are engaged in speaking particularly to such points wherein our present dangers do or do not appear it is proper to mention them apart privileges may be distinguished here from liberties as they respect affairs of trade corporations parliaments and legislature etc liberty as they respect laws establishments declared right and such like as to the first from the revolution to this time they have not only been confirmed which we had before but many privileges added to the people some of which are essential to the wellbeing of the kingdom all the quo warrantos against corporation privileges the high commission court against the churchs privileges extending prerogative in detriment of the subjects natural right and many such things which were fatal to the privileges of this protestant nation were laid aside and received their just condemnation in the revolution and not so only but the privileges obtained since the revolation by consent of parliament are very considerable such as the toleration to this part of britain and the establishment of the church of scotland for the north part in matters of religion such as the triennial election of parliaments in civil affairs such as the several corporations granted upon really useful foundations in trade as the bank company etc and such like these and many more which may be named and which these are named only as heads of are secured to us by law and those laws yet again made sure to us by the honor and veracity of her majesty and as long as her majestys life is spared to these nations we have great reason to believe we shall rather increase than lose our privileges but what if the queen should die  our liberties which come next in order may be summed up in what we call legal and native right or such as by the natural consequence of a free nation and a just government or such as by mutual assent and consent of sovereign and subject are become the legal right of the latter these needless to be enumerated here are summed up into one or are expressly enacted by statute law and thereby become fundamental to the constitution these receive no wound but one of these two ways either by open infraction and contempt of right or by dispensing arbitrary power both of which by the many assurances from the throne by the constant jealousies of parliaments and the full liberty they have more of late than ever taken to examine into and censure breaches of the laws we are very well assured shall not be attempted in her majestys time nay on the contrary the superiority and influence of parliaments over and upon the management of public matters nay even their influences upon the royal majesty of the sovereign has been such and has in such a manner insensibly increased of late that the like has never been known or practiced in this nation for some ages before we see her majesty declines extending her perogative either to the detriment of her subjects in cases civil or religious and wherein it might be so extended nay when even the parliament have desired her to extend it so that we have a great satisfaction in the safety of our established liberties and that no tyrannical arbitrary invasions of right shall be made during her majestys reign but what if the queen should die  in like manner for our properties our estates inheritance lands goods lives liberties etc these are effectually secured by laws of the land and the sovereign in this counrty having no right but by law to any part of the subjects estate causes that estate to be called property the kings and queens of britain are monarchs limited to act by the laws when they cease to rule by law the constitution is broken and they become tyrants and arbitrary despotick invaders of right this is declared by the revolution wherein the right of the subject are openly not set down only but claimed demanded at what justice required should be granted to them and as what the sovereign as aforesaid has no right no pretense no just authority to take or detain from him this is the great capital and fundamental article of magnacharta and the foundation upon which all the laws subsequent and consequential to magnacharta have been made  no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseized of his freehold or liberties or free customs or be outlawed or exiled or otherwise destroyed nor we will not pass upon him nor condemn him but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land magnacharta cap xxix the words are plain and direct and as to the subject we are now upon they require no comment no explication whatever they do as to pleading in law the proof of the subjects right to the free possession of his own property is also the less needful to enlarge upon here because it is acknowledged in full and express terms by the sovereign as well in practice as in expression her majesty adhering strictly to this as a rule has from the beginning of her reign made it her golden rule to govern according to law nor while the establishment of the crown it self is built upon the legal constitution of this nation can it be otherwise here that prince that governs here and not by law may be said rather to oppress than to govern rather to overruled than to rule over his people now it cannot without great and unjustifyable violence to her majestys just government be suggested that we are in any danger of oppression during the righteous administration of her majestys reign the queen raises no money without act of parliament keeps up no standing army in time of peace disseizes no man of his property or estate but every man sits in safety under his own vine and his fig tree and we doubt not but we shall do as long as her majesty lives but what if the queen should die  possibly cavils may rise in the mouths of those whose conduct this nice question may seem to affect that this is a question unfit to be asked and questionless such people will have much to say upon that subject as that it is a factious question a question needless to be answered and impertinent therefore to be asked that it is a question which respects things remote and serves only to fill the heads of the people with fears and jealousies that it is a question to which no direct answer can be given and which suggests strange surmises and amuses people about they know not what and is of no use but to make people uneasy without cause  as there is no objection which is material enough to make but is material enough to answer so this although there is nothing of substance in it may introduce something in its answer of substance enough to consider it is therefore most necessary to convince the considering reader of the usefulness and necessity of putting this question and then likewise the usefulness and necessity of putting this question now at this time and if it appear to be both a needful question it self and a seasonable question as to time the rest of the cavils against it will deserve the less regard that it is a needful question seems justified more abundantly from a very great example to wit the practice of the whole nation in settling the succession to the crown this i take to be nothing else but this the queen having no issue of her body and the pretender to the crown being expelled by law included in his fathers disastrous flight and abdication when the parliament came to consider of the state of the nation as to government as it now stands that king william being lately dead and her majesty with universal joy of her people being recievd as queen the safety and the lasting happiness of the nation is so far secured but what if the queen should die  the introduction to all the acts of parliaments for settling the crown implies thus much and speaks directly this language  viz to make the nation safe and easy in case the queen should die nor are any of those acts of parliament impeached of faction or impertinencies much less of needless blaming the people and filling their heads with fears and jealousies if this example of the parliament is not enough justifying to this enquiry the well known truth upon which that example of parliament is grounded is sufficient to justify it  viz that we all known the queen must die none say this with more concern and regret than those who are forwardest to put this question as being of the opinion abovesaid that we are effectually secured against the pretender and against all the terrifying consequences of the frenchifyd govournours during her majestys life but this is evident the queen is mortal though crowned with all that flattering courtiers can bring together to make her appear great glorious famous or what you please yet the queen yea the queen her self is mortal and must die it is true kings and queens are called gods but this respects their sacred power nothing supposing and immortallity attending their persons for they all die like other men and their dust knows no distinction in the grave since then it is most certain that the queen must die and our safety and happiness in this nation depends so much upon the stability of our liberties religion and aforesaid dependencies after her majestys life shall end it cannot be a question offensive to any who has any concern in the public good to enquire into what shall be the state of our condition or the posture of our affairs when the queen shall die but this is not all neither as the queen is mortal and we are assured she must die so we are none of us certain as to be able to know when or how soon that disaster may happen at what time or in what manner this then as it may be remote and not a long time god of his infinite mercy grant it may be long first and not before this difficult question we are upon be effectually and satisfactorily answered to the nation so on the other side it may be near none of us know how near the fatal blow may befall us soon and sooner far than we may be ready for to day it may come while the cavilling reader is objecting against our putting this question and calling it unreasonable and needless while the word is in thy very mouth may thou hear the fatal melancholy news the queens dead news that must one time or other be heard the word will certainly come some time or other to be spoken in the present sense and to be sure in the time they are spoken in how can any one then say that it is improper to ask what shall be our case what shall we do or what shall be done with us if the queen should die  but we have an other melancholy incident which attends the queens mortality and which makes this question more than ordinarily seasonable to be asked at this time and that is that not only the queen is mortal and she must die and the time uncertain so that she may die even to day before to morrow or in a very little space of time but her life is under gods providence at the mercy of papists and jacobites people who the one by their principles and the other by the circumstances of their party are more than ordinarily to be apprehended for their bloody designs against her majesty and against the whole nation nay there seems more reason to be apprehensive of the dangerous attempts of these desperate people at this time than ever even from the very reasons which are given all along in this work for our being safe in our privileges our religious and civil rights during her majestys life it would be mispending your time prove to that the papists and jacobite parties in this nation however they may as we have said be under ties and obligations of honor interest and gratitude etc not to make attempt upon us during the queens life yet that they are more encouraged at this time than ever they were to hope and believe that when the queen shall die their turn stands next this we say we believe is lost labor to speak of the said people the popish and tory party will freely own and oppose it they all take their obligations to the queen to end with her majestys life the french king however in honor and gratitude he may think himself bound to encourage the pretender to insult her majestys dominions while the queen with whom he personally is engaged by treaty shall remain alive will think himself fully at liberty from those obligations when the queen shall die if we are misinformed of the french affairs and of the notions they have in france of these things they are generally no otherwise understood then that the king of france is engaged by the peace now in view not to disturb her majestys possession during her reign and life but that then the pretenders right is to be received every where the pretender himself howsoever as abovesaid he may despair of his success in attempting to take possession during the queens life will not fail to assume new hopes at her majestys death so much then of the hopes of popery and french power so much of the interest of the pretender depending upon the single thread of life of a mortal person and we being well assured that they look upon her majesty only as the incumbent in a living or tenant for life in an estate what is more natural than in this case for us to apprehend danger to the life of the queen especially to such people who are known not to make much consciencies of murdering princes with whom the king killing doctrine is so universally received and who were so often detected of villanious practices and plots against the life of queen elizabeth her majestys famous predecessor and that upon the same foundation  viz the queen of scots being the popish pretender to the crown what can we expect from the same party and men acting from the same principles but the same practices it is known that the queen by course of nature may live many years and these people have many reasons to be impatient of so much delay they know that many accidents may intervene to make the circumstances of the nation at the time of the queens death less favorable to their interests than they are now they may have fewer friends as well in power as out of power by length of time and the like these and such as these considerations may excite vilanious and murtherous practices against the precious life of our sovereign god protect her majesty from them but while all these considerations so naturally offer themselves to us it seems most rational needful seasonable and just that we should be asking and answering this great question what if the queen should die  thus far we have only asked the question it self and showed our reasons or endeavored to justify the reasonablness of the enquiry it follows that we make some brief essay as an answer to the question this may be done many ways but the design of this tract is rather to put the question into your thought than to put an answer into your mouths the several answers which may be given to this important question may not be proper for a public print and some may not be fit so much as to be spoken the question is not without its uses whether it be answered or no if the nation be sufficiently awakened but to ask the question among themselves they will be brought by thinking of the thing to answer it one to another in a short space the people of britain want only to be showed what imminent danger they are in in case of the queens decease how much their safety and felicity depends upon the life of her majesty and what a state of confusion distress and all sorts of dreadful calamities they will fall into at her majestys death if something be not done to settle them before her death and if they are not during her majestys life secured from the power of france and the danger of the pretender  finis
