cecilia or memoirs of an heiress  by the author of evelina  in five volumes  vol iv  london printed for t pain and son at the mewsgate and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxii  cecilia book vii chapter i a renovation cecilia was accompanied by her maid in the chaise and her own servant and one of mrs delviles attended her on horseback  the quietness of her dejection was soon interrupted by a loud cry among the men of home home home she then looked out of one of the windows and perceived fidel running after the carriage and barking at the servants who were all endeavoring to send him back  touched by this proof of the animals gratitude for her attention to him and conscious she had herself occasioned his masters leaving him the scheme of lady honoria occurred to her and she almost wished to put it in execution but this was the thought of a moment and motioning him with her hand to go back she desired mrs delviles man to return with him immediately and commit him to the care of somebody in the castle  this little incident however trifling was the most important of her journey for she arrived at the house of mrs charlton without meeting any other  the sight of that lady gave her a sensation of pleasure to which she had long been a stranger pleasure pure unmixed unaffected and unrestrained it revived all her early affection and with it something resembling at least her early tranquillity again she was in the house where it had once been undisturbed again she enjoyed the society which was once all she had wished and again saw the same scene the same faces and same prospects she had beheld while her heart was all devoted to her friends  mrs charlton though old and infirm preserved an understanding which whenever unbiassed by her affections was sure to direct her unerringly but the extreme softness of her temper frequently misled her judgment by making it at the pleasure either of misfortune or of artifice always yield to compassion and pliant to entreaty where her counsel and opinion were demanded they were certain to reflect honor on her capacity and discernment but where her assistance or her pity were supplicated her purse and her tears were immediately bestowed and in her zeal to alleviate distress she forgot if the object were deserving her solicitude and stopped not to consider propriety or discretion if happiness however momentary were in her power to grant  this generous foible was however kept somewhat in subjection by the watchfulness of two granddaughters who fearing the injury they might themselves receive from it failed not to point out both its inconvenience and its danger  these ladies were daughters of a deceased and only son of mrs charlton they were single and lived with their grandmother whose fortune which was considerable they expected to share between them and they waited with eagerness for the moment of appropriation narrowminded and rapacious they wished to monopolize whatever she possessed and thought themselves aggrieved by her smallest donations their chief employment was to keep from her all objects of distress and in this though they could not succeed they at least confined her liberality to such as resembled themselves since neither the spirited could brook nor the delicate support the checks and rebuffs from the granddaughters which followed the gifts of mrs charlton cecilia of all her acquaintance was the only one whose intimacy they encouraged for they knew her fortune made her superior to any mercenary views and they received from her themselves more civilities than they paid  mrs charlton loved cecilia with an excess of fondness that not only took place of the love she bore her other friends but to which even her regard for the miss charltons was inferior and feeble cecilia when a child had reverenced her as a mother and grateful for her tenderness and care had afterward cherished her as a friend the revival of this early connection delighted them both it was balm to the wounded mind of cecilia it was renovation to the existence of mrs charlton  early the next morning she wrote a card to mr monckton and lady margaret acquainting them with her return into suffolk and desiring to know when she might pay her respects to her ladyship she received from the old lady a verbal answer when she pleased but mr monckton came instantly himself to mrs charltons  his astonishment his rapture at this unexpected incident were almost boundless he thought it a sudden turn of fortune in his own favor and concluded now she had escaped the danger of delvile castle the road was short and certain that led to his own security  her satisfaction in the meeting was as sincere though not so animated as his own but this similarity in their feelings was of short duration for when he enquired into what had passed at the castle with the reasons of her quitting it the pain she felt in giving even a cursory and evasive account was opposed on his part by the warmest delight in hearing it he could not obtain from her the particulars of what had happened but the reluctance with which she spoke the air of mortification with which she heard his questions and the evident displeasure which was mingled in her chagrin when he forced her to mention delvile were all proofs the most indisputable and satisfactory that they had either parted without any explanation or with one by which cecilia had been hurt and offended  he now readily concluded that since the fiery trial he had most apprehended was over and she had quitted in anger the asylum she had sought in extacy delvile himself did not covet the alliance which since they were separated was never likely to take place he had therefore little difficulty in promising all success to himself  she was once more upon the spot where she had regarded him as the first of men he knew that during her absence no one had settled in the neighborhood who had any pretensions to dispute with him that preeminence he should again have access to her at pleasure and so sanguine grew his hopes that he almost began to rejoice even in the partiality to delvile that had hitherto been his terror from believing it would give her for a time that sullen distaste of all other connections to which those who at once are delicate and fervent are commonly led by early disappointment his whole solicitude therefore now was to preserve her esteem to seek her confidence and to regain whatever by absence might be lost of the ascendant over her mind which her respect for his knowledge and capacity had for many years given him fortune at this time seemed to prosper all his views and by a stroke the most sudden and unexpected to render more rational his hopes and his plans than he had himself been able to effect by the utmost craft of worldly wisdom  the day following cecilia in mrs charltons chaise waited upon lady margaret she was received by miss bennet her companion with the most fawning courtesy but when conducted to the lady of the house she saw herself so evidently unwelcome that she even regretted the civility which had prompted her visit  she found with her nobody but mr morris who was the only young man that could persuade himself to endure her company in the absence of her husband but who in common with most young men who are assiduous in their attendance upon old ladies doubted not but he ensured himself a handsome legacy for his trouble  almost the first speech which her ladyship made was so you are not married yet i find if mr monckton had been a real friend he would have taken care to have seen for some establishment for you  i was by no means cried cecilia with spirit either in so much haste or distress as to require from mr monckton any such exertion of his friendship  maam cried morris what a terrible night we had of it at vauxhall poor harrel i was really excessively sorry for him i had not courage to see you or mrs harrel after it but as soon as i heard you were in st jamesssquare i tried to wait upon you for really going to mr harrels again would have been quite too dismal i would rather have run a mile by the side of a racehorse  there is no occasion for any apology said cecilia for i was very little disposed either to see or think of visitors  so i thought maam answered he with quickness and really that made me the less alert in finding you out however maam next winter i shall be excessively happy to make up for the deficiency besides i shall be much obliged to you to introduce me to mr delvile for i have a great desire to be acquainted with him  mr delvile thought cecilia would be but too proud to hear it however she merely answered that she had no present prospect of spending any time at mr delviles next winter  true maam true cried he now i recollect you become your own mistress between this and then and so i suppose you will naturally choose a house of your own which will be much more eligible  i dont think that said lady margaret i never saw any thing eligible come of young womens having houses of their own she will do a much better thing to marry and have some proper person to take care of her  nothing more right maam returned he a young lady in a house by herself must be subject to a thousand dangers what sort of place maam has mr delvile got in the country i hear he has a good deal of ground there and a large house  it is an old castle sir and situated in a park  that must be terribly forlorn i dare say maam you were very happy to return into suffolk  i did not find it forlorn i was very well satisfied with it  why indeed upon second thoughts i dont much wonder an old castle in a large park must make a very romantic appearance something noble in it i dare say  aye cried lady margaret they said you were to become mistress of it and marry mr delviles son and i cannot for my own part see any objection to it  i am told of so many strange reports said cecilia and all to myself so unaccountable that i begin now to hear of them without much wonder  that is a charming young man i believe said morris i had the pleasure once or twice of meeting him at poor harrels and he seemed mighty agreeable is not he so maam  yes  i believe so  nay i dont mean to speak of him as any thing very extraordinary cried morris imagining her hesitation proceeded from dislike i merely meant as the world goes  in a common sort of way  here they were joined by mr monckton and some gentlemen who were on a visit at his house for his anxiety was not of a sort to lead him to solitude nor his disposition to make him deny himself any kind of enjoyment which he had power to attain a general conversation ensued which lasted till cecilia ended her visit mr monckton then took her hand to lead her to the chaise but told her in their way out of some alterations in his grounds which he desired to show her his view of detaining her was to gather what she thought of her reception and whether she had yet any suspicions of the jealousy of lady margaret well knowing from the delicacy of her character that if once she became acquainted with it she would scrupulously avoid all intercourse with him from the fear of increasing her uneasiness  he began therefore with talking of the pleasure which lady margaret took in the plantations and of his hope that cecilia would often favor her by visiting them without waiting to have her visits returned as she was entitled by her infirmities to particular indulgencies he was continuing in this strain receiving from cecilia hardly any answer when suddenly from behind a thick laurel bush jumpt up mr morris who had run out of the house by a shorter cut and planted himself there to surprise them  so ho cried he with a loud laugh i have caught you this will be a fine anecdote for lady margaret i vow i will tell her  mr monckton never off his guard readily answered aye prithee do morris but dont omit to relate also what we said of yourself  of me cried he with some eagerness why you never mentioned me  o that will not pass i assure you we shall tell another tale at table by and by and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of listeners upon you in its full force  well i will be hanged if i know what you mean  why you will not pretend you did not hear miss beverley say you were the truest ouran outang or manmonkey she ever knew  no indeed that i did not  no  nor how much she admired your dexterity in escaping being horsewhipt three times a day for your incurable impudence  not a word on it horsewhipt  miss beverley pray did you say any such thing  ay cried monckton again and not only horse whipped but horse ponded for she thought when one had heated the other might cool you and then you might be fitted again for your native woods for she insists upon it you was brought from africa and are not yet half tamed  o lord cried morris amazed i should not have suspected miss beverley would have talked so  and do you suspect she did now cried cecilia  pho pho cried monckton coolly why he heard it himself the whole time and so shall all our party by and bye if i can but remember to mention it  cecilia then returned to the chaise leaving mr monckton to settle the matter with his credulous guest as he pleased for supposing he was merely gratifying a love of sport or taking this method of checking the general forwardness of the young man she forebore any interference that might mar his intention  but mr monckton loved not to be rallied concerning cecilia though he was indifferent to all that could be said to him of any other woman he meant therefore to intimidate morris from renewing the subject and he succeeded to his wish poor morris whose watching and whose speech were the mere blunders of chance made without the slightest suspicion of mr moncktons designs now apprehended some scheme to render himself ridiculous and though he did not believe cecilia had made use of such expressions he fancied mr monckton meant to turn the laugh against him and determined therefore to say nothing that might remind him of what had passed  mr monckton had at this time admitted him to his house merely from an expectation of finding more amusement in his blundering and giddiness than he was capable during his anxiety concerning cecilia of receiving from conversation of an higher sort  the character of morris was indeed particularly adapted for the entertainment of a large house in the country eager for sport and always ready for enterprise willing to oblige yet tormented with no delicacy about offending the first to promote mischief for any other and the last to be offended when exposed to it himself gay thoughtless and volatile  a happy composition of levity and good humor  cecilia however in quitting the house determined not to visit it again very speedily for she was extremely disgusted with lady margaret though she suspected no particular motives of enmity against which she was guarded alike by her own unsuspicious innocence and by an high esteem of mr monckton which she firmly believed he returned with equal honesty of undesigning friendship  her next excursion was to visit mrs harrel she found that unhappy lady a prey to all the misery of unoccupied solitude torn from whatever had to her made existence seem valuable her mind was as listless as her person was inactive and she was at a loss how to employ even a moment of the day she had now neither a party to form nor an entertainment to plan company to arrange nor dress to consider and these with visits and public places had filled all her time since her marriage which as it had happened very early in her life had merely taken place of girlish amusements masters and governesses  this helplessness of insipidity however though naturally the effect of a mind devoid of all genuine resources was dignified by herself with the appellation of sorrow nor was this merely a screen to the world unused to investigate her feelings or examine her heart the general compassion she met for the loss of her husband persuaded her that indeed she lamented his destiny though had no change in her life been caused by his suicide she would scarcely when the first shock was over have thought of it again  she received cecilia with great pleasure and with still greater heard the renewal of her promises to fit up a room for her in her house as soon as she came of age a period which now was hardly a month distant  far greater however as well as infinitely purer was the joy which her presence bestowed upon mr arnott she saw it herself with a sensation of regret not only at the constant passion which occasioned it but even at her own inability to participate in or reward it for with him an alliance would meet with no opposition his character was amiable his situation in life unexceptionable he loved her with the tenderest affection and no pride she well knew would interfere to overpower it yet in return to grant him her love she felt as utterly impossible as to refuse him her esteem and the superior attractions of delvile of which neither displeasure nor mortification could rob him shut up her heart for the present more firmly than ever as mr monckton had well imagined to all other assailants  yet she by no means weakly gave way to repining or regret her suspense was at an end her hopes and her fears were subsided into certainty delvile in quitting her had acquainted her that he left her for ever and even though not indeed with much steadiness had prayed for her happiness in union with some other she held it therefore as essential to her character as to her peace to manifest equal fortitude in subduing her partiality she forebore to hint to mrs charlton what had passed that the subject might never be started allowed herself no time for dangerous recollection strolled in her old walks and renewed her old acquaintance and by a vigorous exertion of active wisdom doubted not completing before long the subjection of her unfortunate tenderness nor was her task so difficult as she had feared resolution in such cases may act the office of time and anticipate by reason and selfdenial what that much less nobly effects through forgetfulness and inconstancy  chap ii a visit one week only however had yet tried the perseverance of cecilia when while she was working with mrs charlton in her dressing room her maid hastily entered it and with a smile that seemed announcing welcome news said lord maam here is fidel and at the same moment she was followed by the dog who jumpt upon cecilia in a transport of delight  good heaven cried she all amazement who has brought him whence does he come  a country man brought him maam but he only put him in and would not stay a minute  but whom did he enquire for  who saw him  what did he say  he saw ralph maam  ralph then was instantly called and these questions being repeated he said maam it was a man i never saw before but he only bid me take care to deliver the dog into your own hands and said you would have a letter about him soon and then went away i wanted him to stay till i came up stairs but he was off at once  cecilia quite confounded by this account could make neither comment nor answer but as soon as the servants had left the room mrs charlton entreated to know to whom the dog had belonged convinced by her extreme agitation that something interesting and uncommon must relate to him  this was no time for disguise astonishment and confusion bereft cecilia of all power to attempt it and after a very few evasions she briefly communicated her situation with respect to delvile his leaving her his motives and his mothers evident concurrence for these were all so connected with her knowledge of fidel that she led to them unavoidably in telling what she knew of him  very little penetration was requisite to gather from her manner all that was united in her narrative of her own feelings and disappointment in the course of this affair and mrs charlton who had hitherto believed the whole world at her disposal and that she continued single from no reason but her own difficulty of choice was utterly amazed to find that any man existed who could withstand the united allurements of so much beauty sweetness and fortune she felt herself sometimes inclined to hate and at other times to pity him yet concluded that her own extreme coldness was the real cause of his flight and warmly blamed a reserve which had thus ruined her happiness  cecilia was in the extremest perplexity and distress to conjecture the meaning of so unaccountable a present and so strange a message delvile she knew had desired the dog might follow him to bristol his mother always pleased to oblige him would now less than ever neglect any opportunity she could not therefore doubt that she had sent or taken him thither and thence according to all appearances he must now come but was it likely delvile would take such a liberty was it probable when so lately he had almost exhorted her to forget him he would even wish to present her with such a remembrance of himself and what was the letter she was bid to expect whence and from whom was it to come  all was inexplicable the only thing she could surmise with any semblance of probability was that the whole was some frolic of lady honoria pemberton who had persuaded delvile to send her the dog and perhaps assured him she had herself requested to have him  provoked by this suggestion her first thought was instantly having him conveyed to the castle but uncertain what the whole affair meant and hoping some explanation in the letter she was promised she determined to wait till it came or at least till she heard from mrs delvile before she took any measures herself in the business mutual accounts of their safe arrivals at bristol and in suffolk had already passed between them and she expected very soon to have further intelligence though she was now by the whole behavior of mrs delvile convinced she wished not again to have her an inmate of her house and that the rest of her minority might pass without opposition in the house of mrs charlton  day after day however passed and yet she heard nothing more a week a fortnight elapsed and still no letter came she now concluded the promise was a deception and repented that she had waited a moment with any such expectation her peace during this time was greatly disturbed this present made her fear she was thought meanly of by mr delvile the silence of his mother gave her apprehensions for his health and her own irresolution how to act kept her in perpetual inquietude she tried in vain to behave as if this incident had not happened her mind was uneasy and the same actions produced not the same effects when she now worked or read the sight of fidel by her side distracted her attention when she walked it was the same for fidel always followed her and though in visiting her old acquaintance she forbore to let him accompany her she was secretly planning the whole time the contents of some letter which she expected to meet with on returning to mrs charltons  those gentlemen in the country who during the lifetime of the dean had paid their addresses to cecilia again waited upon her at mrs charltons and renewed their proposals they had now however still less chance of success and their dismission was brief and decisive  among these came mr biddulph and to him cecilia was involuntarily most civil because she knew him to be the friend of delvile yet his conversation increased the uneasiness of her suspense for after speaking of the family in general which she had left he enquired more particularly concerning delvile and then added i am indeed greatly grieved to find by all the accounts i receive of him that he is now in a very bad state of health  this speech gave her fresh subject for apprehension and in proportion as the silence of mrs delvile grew more alarming her regard for her favorite fidel became more partial the affectionate animal seemed to mourn the loss of his master and while sometimes she indulged herself in fancifully telling him her fears she imagined she read in his countenance the faithfullest sympathy  one week of her minority was now all that remained and she was soon wholly occupied in preparations for coming of age she purposed taking possession of a large house that had belonged to her uncle which was situated only three miles from that of mrs charlton and she employed herself in giving orders for fitting it up and in hearing complaints and promising indulgencies to various of her tenants  at this time while she was at breakfast one morning a letter arrived from mrs delvile she apologized for not writing sooner but added that various family occurrences which had robbed her of all leisure might easily be imagined when she acquainted her that mortimer had determined upon again going abroad they were all she said returned to delvilecastle but mentioned nothing either of the health of her son or of her own regret and filled up the rest of her letter with general news and expressions of kindness though in a postscript was inferted we have lost our poor fidel  cecilia was still meditating upon this letter by which her perplexity how to act was rather increased than diminished when to her great surprise lady honoria pemberton was announced she hastily begged one of the miss charltons to convey fidel out of sight from a dread of her raillery should she at last be unconcerned in the transaction and then went to receive her  lady honoria who was with her governess gave a brief history of her quitting delvilecastle and said she was now going with her father to visit a noble family in norsolk but she had obtained his permission to leave him at the inn where they had slept in order to make a short excursion to bury for the pleasure of seeing miss beverley  and therefore she continued i can stay but half an hour so you must give me some account of yourself as fast as possible  what account does your ladyship require  why who you live with here and who are your companions and what you do with yourself  why i live with mrs charlton and for companions i have at least a score here are her two granddaughters and mrs and miss    pho pho interrupted lady honoria but i dont mean such humdrum companions as those you will tell me next i suppose of the parson and his wife and three daughters with all their cousins and aunts i hate those sort of people what i desire to hear of is who are your particular favorites and whether you take long walks here as you used to do at the castle and who you have to accompany you and then looking at her very archly she added a pretty little dog now i should think would be vastly agreeable in such a place as this  ah miss beverley you have not left off that trick of coloring i see  if i color now said cecilia fully convinced of the justnefs of her suspicions i think it must be for your ladyship not myself for if i am not much mistaken either in person or by proxy a blush from lady honoria pemberton would not just now be wholly out of season  lord cried she how like that is to a speech of mrs delviles she has taught you exactly her manner of talking but do you know i am informed you have got fidel with you here o fie miss beverley what will papa and mamma say when they find you have taken away poor little masters plaything  and o fie lady honoria what shall i say when i find you guilty of this mischievous frolic i must beg however since you have gone thus far that you will proceed a little farther and send back the dog to the person from whom you received him  no not i manage him all your own way if you choose to accept dogs from gentlemen you know it is your affair and not mine  if you really will not return him yourself you must at least pardon me should you hear that i do in your ladyships name  lady honoria for some time only laughed and rallied without coming to any explanation but when she had exhausted all the sport she could make she frankly owned that she had herself ordered the dog to be privately stolen and then sent a man with him to mrs charltons  but you know she continued i really owed you a spite for being so illnatured as to run away after sending me to call mortimer to comfort and take leave of you  do you dream lady honoria when did i send you  why you know you looked as if you wished it and that was the same thing but really it made me appear excessively silly when i had forced him to come back with me and told him you were waiting for him  to see nothing of you at all and not be able to find or trace you he took it all for my own invention  and was it not your own invention  why that is nothing to the purpose i wanted him to believe you sent me for i knew else he would not come  your ladyship was a great deal too good  why now suppose i had brought you together what possible harm could have happened from it it would merely have given each of you some notion of a fever and ague for first you would both have been hot and then you would both have been cold and then you would both have turned red and then you would both have turned white and then you would both have pretended to simper at the trick and then there would have been an end of it  this is a very easy way of settling it all cried cecilia laughing however you must be content to abide by your own theft for you cannot in conscience expect i should take it upon myself  you are terribly ungrateful i see said her ladyship for all the trouble and contrivance and expense i have been at merely to oblige you while the whole time poor mortimer i dare say has had his sweet pet advertised in all the newspapers and cried in every market town in the kingdom by the way if you do send him back i would advise you to let your man demand the reward that has been offered for him which may serve in part of payment for his traveling expenses  cecilia could only shake her head and recollect mrs delviles expression that her levity was incorrigible  o if you had seen she continued how sheepish mortimer looked when i told him you were dying to see him before he set off he colored so  just as you do now  but i think youre vastly alike  i fear then cried cecilia not very angry at this speech there is but little chance your ladyship should like either of us  o yes i do i like odd people of all things  odd people and in what are we so very odd  o in a thousand things youre so good you know and so grave and so squeamish  squeamish how  why you know you never laugh at the old folks and never fly at your servants nor smoke people before their faces and are so civil to all the old fograms you would make one imagine you liked nobody so well by the way i could do no good with my little lord derford he pretended to find out i was only laughing at him and so he minded nothing i told him i dare say however his father made the detection for i am sure he had not wit enough to discover it himself  cecilia then very seriously began to entreat that she would return the dog herself and confess her frolic remonstrating in strong terms upon the mischievous tendency and consequences of such inconsiderate flights  well cried she rising this is all vastly true but i have no time to hear any more of it just now besides it is only forestalling my next lecture from mrs delvile for you talk so much alike that it is really very perplexing to me to remember which is which  she then hurried away protesting she had already outstayed her fathers patience and declaring the delay of another minute would occasion half a dozen expresses to know whether she was gone toward scotland or flanders  this visit however was both pleasant and consolatory to cecilia who was now relieved from her suspense and revived in her spirits by the intelligence that delvile had no share in sending her a present which from him would have been humiliating and impertinent she regretted indeed that she had not instantly returned it to the castle which she was now convinced was the measure she ought to have pursued but to make all possible reparation she determined that her own servant should set out with him the next morning to bristol and take a letter to mrs delvile to explain what had happened since to conceal it from any delicacy to lady honoria would be to expose herself to suspicions the most mortifying for which that gay and careless young lady would never thank her  she gave orders therefore to her servant to get ready for the journey  when she communicated these little transactions to mrs charlton that kindhearted old lady who knew her fondness for fidel advised her not yet to part with him but merely to acquaint mrs delvile where he was and what lady honoria had done and by leaving to herself the care of settling his restoration to give her at least an opportunity of offering him to her acceptance  cecilia however would listen to no such proposal she saw the firmness of delvile in his resolution to avoid her and knew that policy as well as propriety made it necessary she should part with what she could only retain to remind her of one whom she now most wished to forget  chap iii an incident the spirits of cecilia however internally failed her she considered her separation from delvile to be now in all probability for life since she saw that no struggle either of interest inclination or health could bend him from his purpose his mother too seemed to regard his name and his existence as equally valuable and the scruples of his father she was certain would be still more insurmountable her own pride excited by theirs made her indeed with more anger than sorrow see this general consent to abandon her but pride and anger both failed when she considered the situation of his health sorrow there took the lead and admitted no partner it represented him to her not only as lost to herself but to the world and so sad grew her reflections and so heavy her heart that to avoid from mrs charlton observations which pained her she stole into a summer house in the garden the moment she had done tea declining any companion but her affectionate fidel  her tenderness and her sorrow found here a romantic consolation in complaining to him of the absence of his master his voluntary exile and her fears for his health calling upon him to participate in her sorrow and lamenting that even this little relief would soon be denied her and that in losing fidel no vestige of mortimer but in her own breast would remain go then dear fidel she cried carry back to your master all that nourishes his remembrance bid him not love you the less for having some time belonged to cecilia but never may his proud heart be fed with the vain glory of knowing how fondly for his sake she has cherished you go dear fidel guard him by night and follow him by day serve him with zeal and love him with fidelity  oh that his health were invincible as his pride  there alone is he vulnerable    here fidel with a loud barking suddenly sprang away from her and as she turned her eyes toward the door to see what had thus startled him she beheld standing there as if immovable young delvile himself  her astonishment at this sight almost bereft her of her understanding it appeared to her supernatural and she rather believed it was his ghost than himself fixed in mute wonder she stood still though terrified her eyes almost bursting from their sockets to be satisfied if what they saw was real  delvile too was some time speechless he looked not at her indeed with any doubt of her existence but as if what he had heard was to him as amazing as to her what she saw at length however tormented by the dog who jumpt up to him licked his hands and by his rapturous joy forced himself into notice he was moved to return his caresses saying yes dear fidel you have a claim indeed to my attention and with the fondest gratitude will i cherish you ever  at the sound of his voice cecilia again began to breathe and delvile having quieted the dog now entered the summer house saying as he advanced is this possible  am i not in a dream  good god is it indeed possible  the consternation of doubt and astonishment which had seized every faculty of cecilia now changed into certainty that delvile indeed was present all her recollection returned as she listened to this question and the wild rambling of fancy with which she had incautiously indulged her sorrow rushing suddenly upon her mind she felt herself wholly overpowered by consciousness and shame and sunk almost fainting upon a windowseat  delvile instantly flew to her penetrated with gratitude and filled with wonder and delight which however internally combated by sensations less pleasant were too potent for control and he poured forth at her feet the most passionate acknowledgments  cecilia surprised affected and trembling with a thousand emotions endeavored to break from him and rise but eagerly detaining her no loveliest miss beverley he cried not thus must we now part this moment only have i discovered what a treasure i was leaving and but for fidel i had quitted it in ignorance for ever  indeed cried cecilia in the extremest agitation indeed you may believe me fidel is here quite by accident  lady honoria took him away  i knew nothing of the matter  she stole him she sent him she did every thing herself  o kind lady honoria cried delviie more and more delighted how shall i ever thank her  and did she also tell you to caress and to cherish him  to talk to him of his master    o heaven interrupted cecilia in an agony of mortification and shame to what has my unguarded folly reduced me then again endeavoring to break from him leave me mr delvile she cried leave me or let me pass  never can i see you more  never bear you again in my sight  come dear fidel cried he still detaining her come and plead for your master come and ask in his name who now has a proud heart whose pride now is invincible  oh go cried cecilia looking away from him while she spoke repeat not those hateful words if you wish me not to detest myself eternally  everlovely miss beverley cried he more seriously why this resentment why all this causeless distress has not my heart long since been known to you have you not witnessed its sufferings and been assured of its tenderness why then this untimely reserve this unabating coldness oh why try to rob me of the felicity you have inadvertently given me and to sour the happiness of a moment that recompenses such exquisite misery  oh mr delvile cried she impatiently though half softened was this honorable or right to steal upon me thus privately  to listen to me thus secretly    you blame me cried he too soon your own friend mrs charlton permitted me to come hither in search of you  then indeed when i heard the sound of your voice  when i heard that voice talk of fidel  of his master    oh stop stop cried she i cannot support the recollection there is no punishment indeed which my own indiscretion does not merit  but i shall have sufficient in the bitterness of selfreproach  why will you talk thus my beloved miss beverley what have you done  what let me ask have i done that such infinite disgrace and depression should follow this little sensibility to a passion so fervent does it not render you more dear to me than ever does it not add new life new vigor to the devotion by which i am bound to you  no no cried the mortified cecilia who from the moment she found herself betrayed believed herself to be lost far other is the effect it will have and the same mad folly by which i am ruined in my own esteem will ruin me in yours  i cannot endure to think of it  why will you persist in detaining me  you have filled me with anguish and mortification  you have taught me the bitterest of lessons that of hating and contemning myself  good heaven cried he much hurt what strange apprehensions thus terrify you are you with me less safe than with yourself is it my honor you doubt is it my integrity you fear surely i cannot be so little known to you and to make protestations now would but give a new alarm to a delicacy already too agitated  else would i tell you that more sacred than my life will i hold what i have heard that the words just now graven on my heart shall remain there to eternity unseen and that higher than ever not only in my love but my esteem is the beautiful speaker    ah no cried cecilia with a sigh that at least is impossible for lower than ever is she sunk from deserving it  no cried he with fervor she is raised she is exalted i find her more excellent and perfect than i had even dared believe her i discover new virtues in the spring of every action i see what i took for indifference was dignity i perceive what i imagined the most rigid insensibility was nobleness was propriety was true greatness of mind  cecilia was somewhat appeased by this speech and after a little hesitation she said with a half smile must i thank you for this goodnature in seeking to reconcile me with myself  or shall i quarrel with you for flattery in giving me praise you can so little think i merit  ah cried he were i to praise as i think of you were my language permitted to accord with my opinion of your worth you would not then simply call me a flatterer you would tell me i was an idolator and fear at least for my principles if not for my understanding  i shall have but little right however said cecilia again rising to arraign your understanding while i act as if bereft of my own now at least let me pass indeed you will greatly displease me by any further opposition  will you suffer me then to see you early tomorrow morning  no sir nor the next morning nor the morning after that this meeting has been wrong another would be worse in this i have accusation enough for folly  in another the charge would be far more heavy  does miss beverley then cried he gravely think me capable of desiring to see her for mere selfish gratification of intending to trifle either with her time or her feelings no the conference i desire will be important and decisive this night i snall devote solely to deliberation tomorrow shall be given to action without some thinking i dare venture at no plan  i presume not to communicate to you the various interests that divide me but the result of them all i can take no denial to your hearing  cecilia who felt when thus stated the justice of his request now opposed it no longer but insisted upon his instantly departing  true cried he i must go  the longer i stay the more i am fascinated and the weaker are those reasoning powers of which i now want the strongest exertion he then repeated his professions of eternal regard besought her not to regret the happiness she had given him and after disobeying her injunctions of going till she was seriously displeased he only stayed to obtain her pardon and permission to be early the next morning and then though still slowly and reluctantly he left her  scarce was cecilia again alone but the whole of what had passed seemed a vision of her imagination that delvile should be at bury that he should visit her at mrs charltons surprise her by herself and discover her most secret thoughts appeared so strange and so incredible that occupied rather by wonder than thinking she continued almost motionless in the place where he had left her till mrs charlton sent to request that she would return to the house she then enquired if any body was with her and being answered in the negative obeyed the summons  mrs charlton with a smile of much meaning hoped she had had a pleasant walk but cecilia seriously remonstrated on the dangerous imprudence she had committed in suffering her to be so unguardedly surprised mrs charlton however more anxious for her future and solid happiness than for her present apprehensions and delicacy repented not the step she had taken and when she gathered from cecilia the substance of what had past unmindful of the expostulations which accompanied it she thought with exultation that the sudden meeting she had permitted would now by making known to each their mutual affection determine them to defer no longer a union upon which their mutual peace of mind so much depended and cecilia finding she had been thus betrayed designedly not inadvertently could hardly reproach her zeal though she lamented its indiscretion  she then asked by what means he had obtained admission and made himself known and heard that he had enquired at the door for miss beverley and having sent in his name was shown into the parlour where mrs charlton much pleased with his appearance had suddenly conceived the little plan which she had executed of contriving a surprise for cecilia from which she rationally expected the very consequences that ensued though the immediate means she had not conjectured  the account was still unsatisfactory to cecilia who could frame to herself no possible reason for a visit so extraordinary and so totally inconsistent with his declarations and resolutions  this however was a matter of but little moment compared with the other subjects to which the interview had given rise delvile upon whom so long though secretly her dearest hopes of happiness had rested was now become acquainted with his power and knew himself the master of her destiny he had quitted her avowedly to decide what it should be since his present subject of deliberation included her fate in his own the next morning he was to call and acquaint her with his decree not doubting her concurrence which ever way he resolved  a subjection so undue and which she could not but consider as disgraceful both shocked and afflicted her and the reflection that the man who of all men she preferred was acquainted with her preference yet hesitated whether to accept or abandon her mortified and provoked her alternately occupied her thoughts the whole night and kept her from peace and from rest  chap iv a proposition early the next morning delvile again made his appearance cecilia who was at breakfast with mrs and miss charltons received him with the most painful confusion and he was evidently himself in a state of the utmost pertubation mrs charlton made a pretense almost immediately for sending away both her granddaughters and then without taking the trouble of devising one for herself arose and followed them though cecilia made sundry signs of solicitation that she would stay  finding herself now alone with him she hastily and without knowing what she said cried how is mrs delvile sir is she still at bristol  at bristol no have you never heard she is returned to delvilecastle  o true  i meant delvilecastle  but i hope she found some benefit from the waters  she had not i believe any occasion to try them  cecilia ashamed of these two following mistakes colored high but ventured not again to speak and delvile who seemed big with something he feared to utter arose and walked for a few instants about the room after which exclaiming aloud how vain is every plan which passes the present hour he advanced to cecilia who pretended to be looking at some work and seating himself next her when we parted yesterday he cried i presumed to say one night alone should be given to deliberation  and today this very day to action  but i forgot that though in deliberating i had only myself to consult in acting i was not so independent and that when my own doubts were satisfied and my own resolutions taken other doubts and other resolutions must be considered by which my purposed proceedings might be retarded might perhaps be wholly prevented  he paused but cecilia unable to conjecture to what he was leading made not any answer  upon you madam he continued all that is good or evil of my future life as far as relates to its happiness or misery will from this very hour almost solely depend yet much as i rely upon your goodness and superior as i know you to trifling or affectation what i now come to propose  to petition  to entreat  i cannot summon courage to mention from a dread of alarming you  what next thought cecilia trembling at this introduction is preparing for me does he mean to ask me to solicit mrs delviles consent or from myself must he receive commands that we should never meet more  is miss beverley cried he determined not to speak to me is she bent upon silence only to intimidate me indeed if she knew how greatly i respect her she would honor me with more confidence  when sir cried she do you mean to make your tour  never cried he with fervor unless banished by you never  no loveliest miss beverley i can now quit you no more fortune beauty worth and sweetness i had power to relinquish and severe as was the task i compelled myself to perform it  but when to these i find joined so attractive a softness  a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly gentle  no sweetest miss beverley i can quit you no more and then seizing her hand with yet greater energy he went on i here he cried offer you my vows i here own you sole arbitress of my sat i give you not merely the possession of my heart  that indeed i had no power to withold from you  but i give you the direction of my conduct i entreat you to become my counselor and guide will miss beverley accept such an office will she deign to listen to such a prayer  yes cried cecilia involuntarily delighted to find that such was the result of his nights deliberation i am most ready to give you my counsel which i now do  that you set off for the continent tomorrow morning  o how malicious cried he half laughing yet not so immediately do i even request your counsel something must first be done to qualify you for giving it penetration skill and understanding however amply you possess them are not sufficient to fit you for the charge something still more is requisite you must be invested with fuller powers you must have a right less disputable and a title that not alone inclination not even judgment alone must sanctify  but which law must enforce and rites the most solemn support  i think then said cecilia deeply blushing i must be content to forbear giving any counsel at all if the qualifications for it are so difficult of acquirement  resent not my presumption cried he my beloved miss beverley but let the severity of my recent sufferings palliate my present temerity for where affliction has been deep and serious causeless and unnecessary misery will find little encouragement and mine has been serious indeed sweetly then permit me in proportion to its bitterness to rejoice in the soft reverse which now flatters me with its approach  cecilia abashed and uneasy uncertain of what was to follow and unwilling to speak till more assured paused and then abruptly exclaimed i am afraid mrs charlton is waiting for me and would have hurried away but delvile almost forcibly preventing her compelled her to stay and after a short conversation on his side the most impassioned and on hers the most confused obtained from her what indeed after the surprise of the preceding evening she could but ill deny a frank confirmation of his power over her heart and an ingenuous though reluctant acknowledgment how long he had possessed it  this confession made as affairs now stood wholly in opposition to her judgment was torn from her by an impetuous urgency which she had not presence of mind to resist and with which delvile when particularly animated had long been accustomed to overpower all opposition the joy with which he heard it though but little mixed with wonder was as violent as the eagerness with which he had sought it yet it was not of long duration a sudden and most painful recollection presently quelled it and even in the midst of his rapturous acknowledgements seemed to strike him to the heart  cecilia soon perceiving both in his countenance and manner an alteration that shocked her bitterly repented an avowal she could never recall and looked aghast with expectation and dread  delvile who with quickness saw a change of expression in her of which in himself he was unconscious exclaimed with much emotion oh how transient is human felicity how rapidly fly those rare and exquisite moments in which it is perfect ah sweetest miss beverley what words shall i find to soften what i have now to reveal to tell you that after goodness candor generosity such as yours a request a supplication remains yet to be uttered that banishes me if refused from your presence for ever  cecilia extremely dismayed desired to know what it was an evident dread of offending her kept him some time from proceeding but at length after repeatedly expressing his fears of her disapprobation and a repugnance even on his own part to the very measure he was obliged to urge he acknowledged that all his hopes of being ever united to her rested upon obtaining her consent to an immediate and secret marriage  cecilia thunderstruck by this declaraation remained for a few instants too much confounded to speak but when he was beginning an explanatory apology she started up and glowing with indignation said i had flattered myself sir that both my character and my conduct independent of my situation in life would have exempted me at all times from a proposal which i shall ever think myself degraded by having heard  and then she was again going but delvile still preventing her said i knew too well how much you would be alarmed and such was my dread of your displeasure that it had power even to embitter the happiness i sought with so much earnestness and to render your condescension insufficient to ensure it yet wonder not at my scheme wild as it may appear it is the result of deliberation and censurable as it may seem it springs not from unworthy motives  whatever may be your motives with respect to yourself sir said cecilia with respect to me they must certainly be disgraceful i will not therefore listen to them  you wrong me cruelly cried he with warmth and a moments reflection must tell you that however distinct may be our honor or our disgrace in every other instance in that by which we should be united they must inevitably be the same and far sooner would i voluntarily relinquish you than be myself accessory to tainting that delicacy of which the unsullied purity has been the chief source of my admiration  why then cried cecilia reproachfully have you mentioned to me such a project  circumstances the most singular and necessity the most unavoidable he answered should alone have ever tempted me to form it no longer ago than yesterday morning i believed myself incapaple of even wishing it but extraordinary situations call for extraordinary resolutions and in private as well as public life palliate at least extraordinary actions alas the proposal which so much offends you is my final resource it is the sole barrier between myself and perpetual misery  the only expedient in my power to save me from eternally parting with you  for i am now cruelly compelled to confess that my family i am certain will never consent to our union  neither then sir cried cecilia with great spirit will i the disdain i may meet with i pretend not to retort but wilfully to encounter were meanly to deserve it i will enter into no family in opposition to its wishes i will consent to no alliance that may expose me to indignity nothing is so contagious as contempt  the example of your friends might work powerfully upon yourself and who shall dare assure me you would not catch the infection   i dare assure you cried he hasty you may perhaps think me and somewhat impetuous i cannot deny myself but believe me not of so wretched a character as to be capable in any affair of moment of fickleness or caprice  but what sir is my security to the contrary have you not this moment avowed that but yesterday you held in abhorrence the very plan that today you propose and may you not tomorrow resume again the same opinion  cruel miss beverley how unjust is this inference if yesterday i disapproved what today i recommend a little recollection must surely tell you why and that not my opinion but my situation is changed  the conscious cecilia here turned away her head too certain he alluded to the discovery of her partiality  have you not yourself he continued witnessed the steadiness of my mind have you not beheld me fly when i had power to pursue and avoid when i had opportunity to seek you after witnessing my constancy upon such trying occasions is it equitable is it right to suspect me of wavering  but what cried she was the constancy which brought you into suffolk  when all occasion was over for our meeting any more when you told me you were going abroad and took leave of me forever  where then was your steadiness in this unnecessary journey  have a care cried he half smiling and taking a letter from his pocket have a care upon this point how you provoke me to show my justification  ah cried cecilia blushing it is some trick of lady honoria  no upon my honor the authority is less doubtful i believe i should hardly else have regarded it  cecilia much alarmed held out her hand for the letter and looking first at the end was much astonished to see the name of biddulph she then cast her eye over the beginning and when she saw her own name read the following paragraph  miss beverley as you doubtless know is returned into suffolk every body here saw her with the utmost surprise from the moment i had heard of her residence in delvilecastle i had given her up for lost but upon her unexpected appearance among us again i was weak enough once more to make trial of her heart i soon found however that the pain of a second rejection you might have spared me and that though she had quitted delvilecastle she had not for nothing entered it at the sound of your name she blushes at the mention of your illness she turns pale and the dog you have given her which i recollected immediately is her darling companion oh happy delvile yet so lovely a conquest you abandon    cecilia could read no more the letter dropped from her hand to find herself thus by her own emotions betrayed made her instantly conclude she was universally discovered and turning sick at the supposition all her spirit forsook her and she burst into tears  good heaven cried delvile extremely shocked what has thus affected you can the jealous surmises of an apprehensive rival    do not talk to me interrupted she impatiently and do not detain me  i am extremely disturbed  i wish to be alone  i beg i even entreat you would leave me  i will go i will obey you in every thing cried he eagerly tell me but when i may return and when you will suffer me to explain to you all the motives of my proposal  never never cried she with earnestness i am sufficiently lowered already but never will i intrude myself into a family that disdains me  disdains no you are revered in it who could disdain you that fatal clause alone    well well pray leave me indeed i cannot hear you i am unfit for argument and all reasoning now is nothing less than cruelty  i am gone cried he this moment i would not even wish to take advantage of your agitation in order to work upon your sensibility my desire is not to surprise but to reconcile you to my plan what is it i seek in miss beverley an heiress no as such she has seen i could resist her nor yet the light trifler of a spring or two neglected when no longer a novelty no no  it is a companion for ever it is a solace for every care it is a bosom friend through every period of life that i seek in miss beverley her esteem therefore to me is as precious as her affection for how can i hope her friendship in the winter of my days if their brighter and gayer season is darkened by doubts of my integrity all shall be clear and explicit no latent cause of uneasiness shall disturb our future quiet we will now be sincere that hereafter we may be easy and sweetly in unclouded felicity time shall glide away imperceptibly and we will make an interest with each other in the gaiety of youth to bear with the infirmities of age and alleviate them by kindness and sympathy and then shall my soothing cecilia    o say no more interrupted she foftened in her own despite by a plan so consonant to her wishes what language is this how improper for you to use or me to hear  she then very earnestly insisted upon his going and after a thousand times taking leave and returning promising obedience yet pursuing his own way he at length said if she would consent to receive a letter from him he would endeavor to commit what he had to communicate to paper since their mutual agitation made him unable to explain himself with clearness and rather hurt his cause than assisted it by leaving all his arguments unfinished and obscure  another dispute now arose cecilia protesting she would receive no letter and hear nothing upon the subject and delvile impetuously declaring he would submit to no award without being first heard at length he conquered and at length he departed  cecilia then felt her whole heart sink within her at the unhappiness of her situation she considered herself now condemned to refuse delvile herself as the only condition upon which he even solicited her favor neither the strictness of her principles nor the delicacy of her mind would suffer her to accept her displeasure at the proposal had been wholly unaffected and she regarded it as an injury to her character ever to have received it yet that delviles pride of heart should give way to his passion that he should love her with so much fondness as to relinquish for her the ambitious schemes of his family and even that darling name which so lately seemed annexed to his existence were circumstances to which she was not insensible and proofs of tenderness and regard which she had thought incompatible with the general spirit of his disposition yet however by these she was gratified she resolved never to comply with so humiliating a measure but to wait the consent of his friends or renounce him for ever  chap v a letter as soon as mrs charlton was acquainted with the departure of young delvile she returned to cecilia impatient to be informed what had passed the narration she heard both hurt and astonished her that cecilia the heiress of such a fortune the possessor of so much beauty descended of a worthy family and formed and educated to grace a noble one should be rejected by people to whom her wealth would be most useful and only in secret have their alliance proposed to her she deemed an indignity that called for nothing but resentment and approved and enforced the resolution of her young friend to resist all solicitations which mr and mrs delvile did not second themselves  about two hours after delvile was gone his letter arrived cecilia opened it with trepidation and read as follows  to miss beverley september  0      what could be the apprehensions the suspicions of miss beverley when so earnestly she prohibited my writing from a temper so unguarded as mine could she fear any subtlety of doctrine is my character so little known to her that she can think me capable of craft or duplicity had i even the desire i have neither the address nor the patience to practice them no loveliest miss beverley though sometimes by vehemence i may incautiously offend by sophistry believe me i never shall injure my ambition as i have told you is to convince not beguile and my arguments shall be simple as my professions shall be sincere  yet how again may i venture to mention a proposal which so lately almost before you had heard you rejected suffer me however to assure you it resulted neither from insensibility to your delicacy nor to my own duty i made it on the contrary with that reluctance and timidity which were given me by an apprehension that both seemed to be offended by it  but alas already i have said what with grief i must repeat i have no resource no alternative between receiving the honor of your hand in secret or foregoing you forever  you will wonder you may well wonder at such a declaration and again that severe renunciation with which you wounded me will tremble on your lips  oh there let it stop nor let the air again be agitated with sounds so discordant  in that cruel and heartbreaking moment when i tore myself from you at delvilecastle i confessed to you the reason of my flight and i determined to see you no more i named not to you then my family the potency of my own objections against daring to solicit your favor rendering theirs immaterial my own are now wholly removed  but theirs remain in full force  my father descended of a race which though decaying in wealth is unsubdued in pride considers himself as the guardian of the honor of his house to which he holds the name of his ancestors inseparably annexed my mother born of the same family and bred to the same ideas has strengthened this opinion by giving it the sanction of her own  such being their sentiments you will not madam be surprised that their only son the sole inheritor of their fortune and sole object of their expectations should early have admitted the same indeed almost the first lesson i was taught was that of reverencing the family from which i am descended and the name to which i am born i was bid consider myself as its only remaining support and sedulously instructed neither to act nor think but with a view to its aggrandizement and dignity  thus unchecked by ourselves and uncontrouled by the world this haughty selfimportance acquired by time a strength and by mutual encouragement a firmness which miss beverley alone could possibly i believe have shaken what therefore was my secret alarm when first i was conscious of the force of her attractions and found my mind wholly occupied with admiration of her excellencies all that pride could demand and all to which ambition could aspire all that happiness could covet or the most scrupulous delicacy exact in her i found united and while my heart was enslaved by her charms my understanding exulted in its fetters  yet to forfeit my name to give up forever a family which upon me rested its latest expectations  honor i thought forbad it propriety and manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice the renunciation of my birthright seemed a desertion of the post in which i was stationed i forebore therefore even in my wishes to solicit your favor and vigorously determined to fly you as dangerous to my peace because unattainable without dishonor  such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time i received biddulphs letter in three days i was to leave england my father with much persuasion had consented to my departure my mother who penetrated into my motives had never opposed it but how great was the change wrought upon my mind by reading that letter my steadiness forsook me my resolution wavered yet i thought him deceived and attributed his suspicions to jealousy but still fidel i knew was missing  and to hear he was your darling companion  was it possible to quit england in a state of such uncertainty to be harrassed in distant climates with conjectures i might then never satisfy no i told my friends i must visit biddulph before i left the kingdom and promising to return to them in three or four days i hastily set out for suffolk and rested not till i arrived at mrs charltons  what a scene there awaited me to behold the loved mistress of my heart the opposed yet resistless object of my fondest admiration caressing an animal she knew to be mine mourning over him his masters ill health and sweetly recommending to him fidelity  ah forgive the retrospection i will dwell on it no longer little indeed had i imagined with what softness the dignity of miss beverley was blended though always conscious that her virtues her attractions and her excellencies would reflect luster upon the highest station to which human grandeur could raise her and would still be more exalted than her rank though that were the most eminent upon earth  and had there been a thousand and ten thousand obstacles to oppose my addressing her vigourously and undauntedly would i have combated with them all in preference to yielding to this single objection  let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you but rather let it serve to convince you of the sincerity of what follows various as are the calamities of life which may render me miserable you only among even its chosen felicities have power to make me happy fame honors wealth ambition were insufficient without you all chance of internal peace and every softer hope is now centered in your favor and to lose you from whatever cause ensures me wretchedness unmitigated  with respect therefore to myself the die is finally cast and the conflict between bosom felicity and family pride is deliberately over this name which so vainly i have cherished and so painfully supported i now find inadequate to recompense me for the sacrifice which its preservation requires i part with it i own with regret that the surrender is necessary yet is it rather an imaginary than an actual evil and though a deep wound to pride no offense to morality  thus have i laid open to you my whole heart confessed my perplexities acknowledged my vainglory and exposed with equal sincerity the sources of my doubts and the motives of my decision but now indeed how to proceed i know not the difficulties which are yet to encounter i fear to enumerate and the petition i have to urge i have scarce courage to mention  my family mistaking ambition for honor and rank for dignity have long planned a splendid connection for me to which though my invariable repugnance has stopped any advances their wishes and their views immovably adhere i am but too certain they will now listen to no other i dread therefore to make a trial where i despair of success i know not how to risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command  in a situation so desperate what then remains must i make an application with a certainty of rejection and then mock all authority by acting in defiance of it or harder task yet relinquish my dearest hopes when no longer persuaded of their impropriety ah sweetest miss beverley end the struggle at once my happiness my peace are wholly in your power for the moment of our union secures them for life  it may seem to you strange that i should thus purpose to brave the friends whom i venture not to entreat but from my knowledge of their characters and sentiments i am certain i have no other resource their favorite principles were too early imbibed to be now at this late season eradicated slaves that we all are to habits and dupes to appearances jealous guardians of our pride to which our comfort is sacrificed and even our virtue made subservient what conviction can be offered by reason to notions that exist but by prejudice they have been cherished too long for rhetoric to remove them they can only be expelled by allpowerful necessity life is indeed too brief and success to precarious to trust in any case where happiness is concerned the extirpation of deeprooted and darling opinions to the slowworking influence of argument and disquisition  yet bigoted as they are to rank and family they adore miss beverley and though their consent to the forfeiture of their name might forever be denied when once they beheld her the head and ornament of their house her elegance and accomplishments joined to the splendor of her fortune would speedily make them forget the plans which now wholly absorb them their sense of honor is in nothing inferior to their sense of high birth your condescension therefore would be felt by them in its fullest force and though during their first surprise they might be irritated against their son they would make it the study of their lives that the lady who for him had done so much should never through their means repine for herself  with regard to settlements the privacy of our union would not affect them one confident we must unavoidably trust and i would deposit in the hands of whatever person you would name a bond by which i would engage myself to settle both your fortune and my own according to the arbitration of our mutual friends  the time for secrecy though painful would be short and even from the altar if you desired it i would hasten to delvilecastle not one of my friends should you see till they waited upon you themselves to solicit your presence at their house till our residence elsewhere was fixed  oh loveliest cecilia from a dream of a hapiness so sweet awaken me not from a plan of felicity so attractive turn not away if one part of it is unpleasant reject not therefore all and since without some drawback no earthly bliss is attainable do not by a refinement too scrupulous for the short period of our existence deny yourself that delight which your benevolence will afford you in snatching from the pangs of unavailing regret and misery the gratefullest of men in the  humblest and most devoted of your servants mortimer delvile   cecilia read and reread this letter but with a perturbation of mind that made her little able to weigh its contents paragraph by paragraph her sentiments varied and her determination was changed the earnestness of his supplication now softened her into compliance the ackowledged pride of his family now irritated her into resentment and the confession of his own regret now sickened her into despondence she meant in an immediate answer to have written a final dismission but though proof against his entreaties because not convinced by his arguments there was something in the conclusion of his letter that staggered her resolution  those scruples and that refinement against which he warned her she herself thought might be overstrained and to gratify unnecessary punctilio the short period of existence be rendered causelessly unhappy he had truly said that their union would be no offense to morality and with respect merely to pride why should that be spared he knew he possessed her heart she had long been certain of his her character had early gained the affection of his mother and the essential service which an income such as here is must do the family would soon be felt too powerfully to make her connection with it regretted  these reflections were so pleasant she knew not how to discard them and the consciousness that her secret was betrayed not only to himself but to mr biddulph lord ernolf lady honoria pemberton and mrs delvile gave them additional force by making it probable she was yet more widely suspected  but still her delicacy and her principles revolted against a conduct of which the secrecy seemed to imply the impropriety how shall i meet mrs delvile cried she after an action so clandestine how after praise such as she has bestowed upon me bear the severity of her eye when she thinks i have seduced from her the obedience of her son a son who is the sole solace and first hope of her existence whose virtues make all her happiness and whose filial piety is her only glory  and well may she glory in a son such as delvile nobly has he exerted himself in situations the most difficult his family and his ideas of honor he has preferred to his peace and health he has fulfilled with spirit and integrity the various the conflicting duties of life even now perhaps in his present application he may merely think himself bound by knowing me no longer free and his generous sensibility to the weakness he has discovered without any of the conviction to which he pretends may have occasioned this proposal  a suggestion so mortifying again changed her determination and the tears of henrietta belfield with the letter which she had surprised in her hand recurring to her memory all her thoughts turned once more upon rejecting him forever  in this fluctuating state of mind she found writing impracticable while uncertain what to wish to decide was impossible she disdained coquetry she was superior to trifling the candor and openness of delvile had merited all her sincerity and therefore while any doubt remained with herself she held it unworthy her character to tell him she had none  mrs charlton upon reading the letter became again the advocate of delvile the frankness with which he had stated his difficulties assured her of his probity and by explaining his former conduct satisfied her with the rectitude of his future intentions do not therefore my dear child cried she become the parent of your own misery by refusing him he deserves you alike from his principles and his affection and the task would both be long and melancholy to disengage him from your heart i see not however the least occasion for the disgrace of a private marriage i know not any family to which you would not be an honor and those who feel not your merit are little worth pleasing let mr delvile therefore apply openly to his friends and if they refuse their consent be their prejudices their reward you are freed from all obligations where caprice only can raise objections and you may then in the face of the world vindicate your choice  the wishes of cecilia accorded with this advice though the general tenor of delviles letter gave her little reason to expect he would follow it  chap vi a discussion the day past away and cecilia had yet written no answer the evening came and her resolution was still unfixed delvile at length was again announced and though she dreaded trusting herself to his entreaties the necessity of hastening some decision deterred her from refusing to see him  mrs charlton was with her when he entered the room he attempted at first some general conversation though the anxiety of his mind was strongly pictured upon his face cecilia endeavored also to talk upon common topics though her evident embarrassment spoke the absence of her thoughts  delvile at length unable any longer to bear suspense turned to mrs charlton and said you are probably acquainted madam with the purport of the letter i had the honor of sending to miss beverley this morning  yes sir answered the old lady and you need desire little more than that her opinion of it may be as favorable as mine  delvile bowed and thanked her and looking at cecilia to whom he ventured not to speak he perceived in her countenance a mixture of dejection and confusion that told him whatever might be her opinion it had by no means increased her happiness  but why sir said mrs charlton should you be thus sure of the disapprobation of your friends had you not better hear what they have to say  i know madam what they have to say returned he for their language and their principles have been invariable from my birth to apply to them therefore for a concession which i am certain they will not grant were only a cruel device to lay all my misery to their account  and if they are so perverse they deserve from you nothing better said mrs charlton speak to them however you will then have done your duty and if they are obstinately unjust you will have acquired a right to act for yourself  to mock their authority answered delvile would be more offensive than to oppose it to solicit their approbation and then act in defiance of it might justly provoke their indignation  no if at last i am reduced to appeal to them by their decision i must abide  to this mrs charlton could make no answer and in a few minutes she left the room  and is such also said delvile the opinion of miss beverley has she doomed me to be wretched and does she wish that doom to be signed by my nearest friends  if your friends sir said cecilia are so undoubtedly inflexible it were madness upon any plan to risk their displeasure  to entreaty he answered they will be inflexible but not to forgiveness my father though haughty dearly even passionately loves me my mother though highspirited is just noble and generous she is indeed the most exalted of women and her power over my mind i am unaccustomed to resist miss beverley alone seems born to be her daughter    no no interrupted cecilia as her daughter she rejects me  she loves she adores you cried he warmly and were i not certain she feels your excellencies as they ought to be felt my veneration for you both should even yet spare you my present supplication but you would become i am certain the first blessing of her life in you she would behold all the felicity of her son  his restoration to health to his country to his friends  o sir cried cecilia with emotion how deep a trench of real misery do you sink in order to raise this pile of fancied happiness but i will not be responsible for your offending such a mother scarcely can you honor her yourself more than i do and i here declare most solemnly    o stop interrupted delvile and resolve not till you have heard me would you were she no more were my father also no more would you yet persist in refusing me  why should you ask me said cecilia blushing you would then be your own agent and perhaps    she hesitated and delvile vehemently exclaimed oh make me not a monster force me not to desire the death of the very beings by whom i live weaken not the bonds of affection by which they are endeared to me and compel me not to wish them no more as the sole barriers to my happiness  heaven forbid cried cecilia could i believe you so impious i should suffer little indeed in desiring your eternal absence  why then only upon their extinction must i rest my hope of your favor  cecilia staggered and distressed by this question could make no answer delvile perceiving her embarrassment redoubled his urgency and before she had power to recollect herself she had almost consented to his plan when henrietta belfield rushing into her memory she hastily exclaimed one doubt there is which i know not how to mention but ought to have cleared up  you are acquainted with  you remember miss belfield  certainly but what of miss belfield that can raise a doubt in the mind of miss beverley  cecilia colored and was silent  is it possible continued he you could ever for an instant suppose  but i cannot even name a supposition so foreign to all possibility  she is surely very amiable  yes answered he she is innocent gentle and engaging and i heartily wish she were in a better situation  did you ever occasionally or by any accident correspond with her  never in my life  and were not your visits to the brother sometimes    have a care interrupted he laughing lest i reverse the question and ask if your visits to the sister were not sometimes for the brother but what does this mean could miss beverley imagine that after knowing her the charms of miss belfield could put me in any danger  cecilia bound in delicacy and friendship not to betray the tender and trusting henrietta and internally satisfied of his innocence by his frankness evaded any answer and would now have done with the subject but delvile eager wholly to exculpate himself though by no means displeased at an enquiry which showed so much interest in his affections continued his explanation  miss belfield has i grant an attraction in the simplicity of her manners which charms by its singularity her heart too seems all purity and her temper all softness i have not you find been blind to her merit on the contrary i have both admired and pitied her but far indeed is she removed from all chance of rivalry in my heart a character such as hers for a while is irresistably alluring but when its novelty is over simplicity uninformed becomes wearisome and softness without dignity is too indiscriminate to give delight we sigh for entertainment when cloyed by mere sweetness and heavily drags on the load of life when the companion of our social hours wants spirit intelligence and cultivation with miss beverley all these    talk not of all these cried cecilia when one single obstacle has power to render them valueless  but now cried he that obstacle is surmounted  surmounted only for a moment for even in your letter this morning you confess the regret with which it fills you  and why should i deceive you why pretend to think with pleasure or even with indifference of an obstacle which has had thus long the power to make me miserable but where is happiness without allay is perfect bliss the condition of humanity oh if we refuse to taste it till in its last state of refinement how shall the cup of evil be ever from our lips  how indeed said cecilia with a sigh the regret i believe will remain eternally upon your mind and she perhaps who should cause might soon be taught to partake of it  o miss beverley how have i merited this severity did i make my proposals lightly did i suffer my eagerness to conquer my reason have i not on the contrary been steady and considerate neither biassed by passion nor betrayed by tenderness  and yet in what said cecilia consists this boasted steadiness i perceived it indeed at delvilecastle but here    the pride of heart which supported me there cried he will support me no longer what sustained my firmness but your apparent severity what enabled me to fly you but your invariable coldness the rigor with which i trampled upon my feelings i thought fortitude and spirit  but i knew not then the pitying sympathy of cecilia  o that you knew it not yet cried she blushing before that fatal accident you thought of me i believe in a manner far more honorable  impossible differently i thought of you but never better never so well as now i then represented you all lovely in beauty all perfect in goodness and virtue but it was virtue in its highest majesty not as now blended with the softest sensibility  alas said cecilia how the portrait is faded  no it is but more from the life it is the sublimity of an angel mingled with all that is attractive in woman but who is the friend we may venture to trust to whom may i give my bond and from whom may i receive a treasure which for the rest of my life will constitute all its felicity  where can i cried cecilia find a friend who in this critical moment will instruct me how to act  you will find one answered he in your own bosom ask but yourself this plain question will any virtue be offended by your honoring me with your hand  yes duty will be offended since it is contrary to the will of your parents  but is there no time for emancipation am not i of an age to choose for myself the partner of my life will not you in a few days be the uncontrolled mistress of your actions are we not both independent your ample fortune all your own and the estates of my father so entailed they must unavoidably be mine  and are these said cecilia considerations to set us free from our duty  no but they are circumstances to relieve us from slavery let me not offend you if i am still more explicit when no law human or divine can be injured by our union when one motive of pride is all that can be opposed to a thousand motives of convenience and happiness why should we both be made unhappy merely lest that pride should lose its gratification  this question which so often and so angrily she had revolved in her own mind again silenced her and delvile with the eagerness of approaching success redoubled his solicitations  be mine he cried sweetest cecilia and all will go well to refer me to my friends is effectually to banish me forever spare me then the unavailing task and save me from the resistless entreaties of a mother whose every desire i have held sacred whose wish has been my law and whose commands i have implicitly invariably obeyed oh generously save me from the dreadful alternative of wounding her maternal heart by a preremptory refusal or of torturing my own with pangs to which it is unequal by an extorted obedience  alas cried cecilia how utterly impossible i can relieve you  and why once mine irrevocably mine    no that would but irritate  and irritate past hope of pardon  indeed you are mistaken to your merit they are far from insensible and your fortune is just what they wish trust me therefore when i assure you that their displeasure which both respect and justice will guard them from ever showing you will soon die wholly away i speak not merely from my hopes in judging my own friends i consider human nature in general inevitable evils are ever best supported it is suspense it is hope that make the food of misery certainty is always endured because known to be past amendment and felt to give defiance to struggling  and can you cried cecilia with reasoning so desperate be satisfied  in a situation so extraordinary as ours answered he there is no other the voice of the world at large will be all in our favor our union neither injures our fortunes nor taints our morality with the character of each the other is satisfied and both must be alike exculpated from mercenary views of interest or romantic contempt of poverty what right have we then to repine at an objection which however potent is single surely none oh if wholly unchecked were the happiness i now have in view if no foul storm sometimes lowered over the prospect and for a moment obscured its brightness how could my heart find room for joy so superlative the whole world might rise against me as the first man in it who had nothing left to wish  cecilia whose own hopes aided this reasoning found not much to oppose to it and with little more of entreaty and still less of argument delvile at length obtained her consent to his plan fearfully indeed and with unfeigned reluctance she gave it but it was the only alternative with a separation forever to which she held not the necessity adequate to the pain  the thanks of delvile were as vehement as had been his entreaties which yet however were not at an end the concession she had made was imperfect unless its performance were immediate and he now endeavored to prevail with her to be his before the expiration of a week  here however his task ceased to be difficult cecilia as ingenuous by nature as she was honorable from principle having once brought her mind to consent to his proposal sought not by studied difficulties to enhance the value of her compliance the great point resolved upon she held all else of too little importance for a contest  mrs charlton was now called in and acquainted with the result of their conference her approbation by no means followed the scheme of privacy yet she was too much rejoiced in seeing her young friend near the period of her long suspense and uneasiness to oppose any plan which might forward their termination  delvile then again begged to know what male confident might be entrusted with their project  mr monckton immediately occurred to cecilia though the certainty of his ill will to the cause made all application to him disagreeable but his long and steady friendship for her his readiness to counsel and assist her and the promises she had occasionally made not to act without his advice all concurred to persuade her that in a matter of such importance she owed to him her confidence and should be culpable to proceed without it upon him therefore she fixed yet finding in herself a repugnance insuperable to acquainting him with her situation she agreed that delvile who instantly proposed to be her messenger should open to him the affair and prepare him for their meeting  delvile then rapid in thought and fertile in expedients with a celerity and vigor which bore down all objections arranged the whole conduct of the business to avoid suspicion he determined instantly to quit her and as soon as he had executed his commission with mr monckton to hasten to london that the necessary preparations for their marriage might be made with dispatch and secresy he purposed also to find out mr belfield that he might draw up the bond with which he meant to entrust mr monckton this measure cecilia would have opposed but he refused to listen to her mrs charlton herself though her age and infirmities had long confined her to her own house gratified cecilia upon this critical occasion with consenting to accompany her to the altar mr monckton was depended upon for giving her away and a church in london was the place appointed for the performance of the ceremony in three days the principal difficulties to the union would be removed by cecilias coming of age and in five days it was agreed they should actually meet in town the moment they were married delvile promised to set off for the castle while in another chaise cecilia returned to mrs charltons  this settled he conjured her to be punctual and earnestly recommending himself to her fidelity and affection he bid her adieu  chap vii a retrospection left now to herself sensations unfelt before filled the heart of cecilia all that had passed for a while appeared a dream her ideas were indistinct her memory was confused her faculties seemed all out of order and she had but an imperfect consciousness either of the transaction in which she had just been engaged or of the promise she had bound herself to fulfill even truth from imagination she scarcely could separate all was darkness and doubt inquietude and disorder  but when at length her recollection more clearly returned and her situation appeared to her such as it really was divested alike of false terrors or delusive expectations she found herself still further removed from tranquillity  hitherto though no stranger to sorrow which the sickness and early loss of her friends had first taught her to feel and which the subsequent anxiety of her own heart had since instructed her to bear she had yet invariably possessed the consolation of selfapproving reflections but the step she was now about to take all her principles opposed it terrified her as undutiful it shocked her as clandestine and scarce was delvile out of sight before she regretted her consent to it as the loss of her selfesteem and believed even if a reconciliation took place the remembrance of a wilful fault would still follow her blemish in her own eyes the character she had hoped to support and be a constant allay to her happiness by telling her how unworthily she had obtained it  where frailty has never been voluntary nor error stubborn where the pride of early integrity is unsubdued and the first purity of innocence is inviolate how fearfully delicate how tremblingly alive is the conscience of man strange that what in its first state is so tender can in its last become so callous  compared with the general lot of human misery cecilia had suffered nothing but compared with the exaltation of ideal happiness she had suffered much willingly however would she again have borne all that had distressed her experienced the same painful suspense endured the same melancholy parting and gone through the same cruel task of combating inclination with reason to have relieved her virtuous mind from the newborn and intolerable terror of conscientious reproaches  the equity of her notions permitted her not from the earnestness of delviles entreaties to draw any palliation for her consent to his proposal she was conscious that but for her own too great facility those entreaties would have been ineffectual since she well knew how little from any other of her admirers they would have availed  but chiefly her affliction and repentance hung upon mrs delvile whom she loved reverenced and honored whom she dreaded to offend and whom she well knew expected from her even exemplary virtue her praises her partiality her confidence in her character which hitherto had been her pride she now only recollected with shame and with sadness the terror of the first interview never ceased to be present to her she shrunk even in imagination from her wrathdarting eye she felt stung by pointed satire and subdued by cold contempt  yet to disappoint delvile so late by forfeiting a promise so positively accorded to trifle with a man who to her had been uniformly candid to waver when her word was engaged and retract when he thought himself secure  honor justice and shame told her the time was now past  and yet is not this cried she placing nominal before actual evil is it not studying appearance at the expense of reality if agreeing to wrong is criminal is not performing it worse if repentance for ill actions calls for mercy has not repentance for ill intentions a yet higher claim  and what reproaches from delvile can be so bitter as my own what separation what sorrow what possible calamity can hang upon my mind with such heaviness as the sense of committing voluntary evil  this thought so much affected her that conquering all regret either for delvile or herself she resolved to write to him instantly and acquaint him of the alteration in her sentiments  this however after having so deeply engaged herself was by no means easy and many letters were begun but not one of them was finished when a sudden recollection obliged her to give over the attempt  for she knew not whither to direct to him  in the haste with which their plan had been formed and settled it had never once occurred to them that any occasion for writing was likely to happen delvile indeed knew that her address would still be the same and with regard to his own as his journey to london was to be secret he purposed not having any fixed habitation on the day of their marriage and not before they had appointed to meet at the house of mrs roberts in fetterlane whence they were instantly to proceed to the church  she might still indeed enclose a letter for him in one to mrs hill to be delivered to him on the destined morning when he called to claim her but to fail him at the last moment when mr belfield would have drawn up the bond when a license was procured the clergyman waiting to perform the ceremony and delvile without a suspicion but that the next moment would unite them for ever seemed extending prudence into treachery and power into tyranny delvile had done nothing to merit such treatment he had practiced no deceit he had been guilty of no perfidy he had opened to her his whole heart and after showing it without any disguise the option had been all her own to accept or refuse him  a ray of joy now broke its way through the gloom of her apprehensions ah cried she i have not then any means to recede an unprovoked breach of promise at the very moment destined for its performance would but vary the mode of acting wrong without approaching nearer to acting right  this idea for a while not merely calmed but delighted her to be the wife of delvile seemed now a matter of necessity and she soothed herself with believing that to struggle against it were vain  the next morning during breakfast mr monckton arrived  not greater though winged with joy had been the expedition of delvile to open to him his plan than was his own though only goaded by desperation to make some effort with cecilia for rendering it abortive nor could all his selfdenial the command which he held over his passions nor the rigor with which his feelings were made subservient to his interest in this sudden hour of trial avail to preserve his equanimity the refinements of hypocrisy and the arts of insinuation offered advantages too distant and exacted attentions too subtle for a moment so alarming those arts and those attentions he had already for many years practiced with an address the most masterly and a diligence the most indefatigable success had of late seemed to follow his toils the increasing infirmities of his wife the disappointment and retirement of cecilia uniting to promise him a conclusion equally speedy and happy when now by a sudden and unexpected stroke the sweet solace of his future cares the longprojected recompense of his past sufferings was to be snatched from him forever and by one who compared with himself was but the acquaintance of a day  almost wholly off his guard from the surprise and horror of this apprehension he entered the room with such an air of haste and perturbation that mrs charlton and her granddaughters demanded what was the matter  i am come he answered abruptly yet endeavoring to recollect himself to speak with miss beverley upon business of some importance  my dear then said mrs charlton you had better go with mr monckton into your dressing room  cecilia deeply blushing arose and led the way slowly however she proceeded though urged by mr monckton to make speed certain of his disapprobation and but doubtfully relieved from her own she dreaded a conference which on his side she foresaw would be all exhortation and reproof and on hers all timidity and shame  good god cried he miss beverley what is this you have done bound yourself to marry a man who despises who scorns who refuses to own you  shocked by this opening she started but could make no answer  see you not he continued the indignity which is offered you does the loose the flimsy veil with which it is covered hide it from your understanding or disguise it from your delicacy  i thought not  i meant not said she more and more confounded to submit to any indignity though my pride in an exigence so peculiar may give way for a while to convenience  to convenience repeated he to contempt to derision to insolence   o mr monckton interrupted cecilia make not use of such expressions they are too cruel for me to hear and if i thought they were just would make me miserable for life  you are deceived grossly deceived replied he if you doubt their truth for a moment they are not indeed even decently concealed from you they are glaring as the day and wilful blindness can alone obscure them  i am sorry sir said cecilia whose confusion at a charge so rough began now to give way to anger if this is your opinion and i am sorry too for the liberty i have taken in troubling you upon such a subject  an apology so full of displeasure instantly taught mr monckton the error he was committing and checking therefore the violence of those emotions to which his sudden and desperate disappointment gave rise and which betrayed him into reproaches so unskilful he endeavored to recover his accustomed equanimity and assuming an air of friendly openness said let me not offend you my dear miss beverley by a freedom which results merely from a solicitude to serve you and which the length and intimacy of our acquaintance had i hoped long since authorized i know not how to see you on the brink of destruction without speaking yet if you are averse to my sincerity i will curb it and have done  no do not have done cried she much softened your sincerity does me nothing but honor and hitherto i am sure it has done me nothing but good perhaps i deserve your utmost censure i feared it indeed before you came and ought therefore to have better prepared myself for meeting with it  this speech completed mr moncktons selfvictory it showed him not only the impropriety of his turbulence but gave him room to hope that a mildness more crafty would have better success  you cannot but be certain he answered that my zeal proceeds wholly from a desire to be of use to you my knowledge of the world might possibly i thought assist your inexperience and the disinterestedness of my regard might enable me to see and to point out the dangers to which you are exposed from artifice and duplicity in those who have other purposes to answer than what simply belong to your welfare  neither artifice nor duplicity cried cecilia jealous for the honor of delvile have been practiced against me argument and not persuasion determined me and if i have done wrong  those who prompted me have erred as unwittingly as myself  you are too generous to perceive the difference or you would find nothing less alike if however my plainness will not offend you before it is quite too late i will point out to you a few of the evils  for there are some i cannot even mention which at this instant do not merely threaten but await you  cecilia started at this terrifying offer and afraid to accept yet ashamed to refuse it hung back irresolute  i see said mr monckton after a pause of some continuance your determination admits no appeal the consequence must indeed be all your own but i am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of its seriousness hereafter you will wish perhaps that the friend of your earliest youth had been permitted to advise you at present you only think him officious and impertinent and therefore he can do nothing you will be so likely to approve as quitting you i wish you then greater happiness than seems prepared to follow you and a counselor more prosperous in offering his assistance  he would then have taken his leave but cecilia called out oh mr monckton do you then give me up  not unless you wish it  alas i know not what to wish except indeed the restoration of that security from selfblame which till yesterday even in the midst of disappointment quieted and consoled me  are you then sensible you have gone wrong yet resolute not to turn back  could i tell could i see cried she with energy which way i ought to turn not a moment would i hesitate how to act my heart should have no power my happiness no choice  i would recover my own esteem by any sacrifice that could be made  what then can possibly be your doubt to be as you were yesterday what is wanting but your own inclination  every thing is wanting right honor firmness all by which the just are bound and all which the conscientious hold sacred  these scruples are merely romantic your own good sense had it fairer play would contemn them but it is warped at present by prejudice and prepossession  no indeed cried she coloring at the charge i may have entered too precipitately into an engagement i ought to have avoided but it is weakness of judgment not of heart that disables me from retrieving my error  yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you nor which way you may escape from it  yes sir cried she trembling i am now ready to hear both  briefly then i will tell you it will lead you into a family of which every individual will disdain you it will make you inmate of an house of which no other inmate will associate with you you will be insulted as an inferior and reproached as an intruder your birth will be a subject of ridicule and your whole race only named with derision and while the elders of the proud castle treat you with open contempt the man for whom you suffer will not dare to support you  impossible impossible cried cecilia with the most angry emotion this whole representation is exaggerated and the latter part is utterly without foundation  the latter part said mr monckton is of all other least disputable the man who now dares not own will then never venture to defend you on the contrary to make peace for himself he will be the first to neglect you the ruined estates of his ancestors will be repaired by your fortune while the name which you carry into his family will be constantly resented as an injury you will thus be plundered though you are scorned and told to consider yourself honored that they condescend to make use of you nor here rests the evil of a forced connection with so much arrogance  even your children should you have any will be educated to despise you  dreadful and horrible cried cecilia  i can hear no more  oh mr monckton what a prospect have you opened to my view  fly from it then while it is yet in your power  when two paths are before you choose not that which leads to destruction send instantly after delvile and tell him you have recovered your senses  i would long since have sent  i wanted not a representation such as this  but i know not how to direct to him nor whither he is gone  all art and baseness to prevent your recantation  no sir no cried she with quickness whatever may be the truth of your painting in general all that concerns    ashamed of the vindication she intended which yet in her own mind was firm and animated she stopped and left the sentence unfinished  in what place were you to meet said mr monckton you can at least send to him there  we were only to have met answered she in much confusion at the last moment  and that would be too late  it would be too  i could not without some previous notice break a promise which i gave without any restriction  is this your only objection  it is but it is one which i cannot conquer  then you would give up this illboding connection but from notions of delicacy with regard to the time  indeed i meant it before you came   i then will obviate this objection give me but the commission either verbally or in writing and i will undertake to find him out and deliver it before night  cecilia little expecting this offer turned extremely pale and after pausing some moments said in a faultering voice what then sir is your advice in what manner    i will say to him all that is necessary trust the matter with me  no  he deserves at least an apology from myself  though how to make it    she stopped she hesitated she went out of the room for pen and ink she returned without them and the agitation of her mind every instant increasing she begged him in a faint voice to excuse her while she consulted with mrs charlton and promising to wait upon him again was hurrying away  mr monckton however saw too great danger in so much emotion to trust her out of his sight he told her therefore that she would only increase her perplexity without reaping any advantage by an application to mrs charlton and that if she was really sincere in wishing to recede there was not a moment to be lost and delvile should immediately be pursued  cecilia sensible of the truth of this speech and once more recollecting the unaffected earnestness with which but an hour or two before she had herself desired to renounce this engagement now summoned her utmost courage to her aid and after a short but painful struggle determined to act consistently with her professions and her character and by one great and final effort to conclude all her doubts and try to silence even her regret by completing the triumph of fortitude over inclination  she called therefore for pen and ink and without venturing herself from the room wrote the following letter  to mortimer delvile esquire accuse me not of caprice and pardon my irresolution when you find me shrinking with terror from the promise i have made and no longer either able or willing to perform it the reproaches of your family i should very ill endure but the reproaches of my own heart for an action i can neither approve nor defend would be still more oppressive with such a weight upon the mind length of life would be burdensome with a sensation of guilt early death would be terrific these being my notions of the engagement into which we have entered you cannot wonder and you have still less reason to repine that i dare not fulfill it alas where would be your chance of happiness with one who in the very act of becoming yours would forfeit her own  i blush at this tardy recantation and i grieve at the disappointment it may occasion you but i have yielded to the exhortations of an inward monitor who is never to be neglected with impunity consult him yourself and i shall need no other advocate  adieu and may all felicity attend you if to hear of the almost total privation of mine will mitigate the resentment with which you will probably read this letter it may be mitigated but too easily yet my consent to a clandestine action shall never be repeated and though i confess to you i am not happy i solemnly declare my resolution is unalterable a little reflection will tell you i am right though a great deal of lenity may scarce suffice to make you pardon my being right no sooner  c b   this letter which with trembling haste resulting from a fear of her own steadiness she folded and sealed mr monckton from the same apprehension yet more eagerly received and scarce waiting to bid her good morning mounted his horse and pursued his way to london  cecilia returned to mrs charlton to acquaint her with what had passed and notwithstanding the sorrow she felt in apparently injuring the man whom in the whole world she most wished to oblige she yet found a satisfaction in the sacrifice she had made that recompensed her for much of her sufferings and soothed her into something like tranquillity the true power of virtue she had scarce experienced before for she found it a resource against the cruellest dejection and a supporter in the bitterest disappointment  chap viii an embarrassment the day passed on without any intelligence the next day also passed in the same manner and on the third which was her birthday cecilia became of age  the preparations which had long been making among her tenants to celebrate this event cecilia appeared to take some share and endeavored to find some pleasure in she gave a public dinner to all who were willing to partake of it she promised redress to those who complained of hard usage she pardoned many debts and distributed money food and clothing to the poor these benevolent occupations made time seem less heavy and while they freed her from solitude diverted her suspense she still however continued at the house of mrs charlton the workmen having disappointed her in finishing her own  but in defiance of her utmost exertion toward the evening of this day the uneasiness of her uncertainty grew almost intolerable the next morning she had promised delvile to set out for london and he expected the morning after to claim her for his wife yet mr monckton neither sent nor came and she knew not if her letter was delivered or if still he was unprepared for the disappointment by which he was awaited a secret regret for the unhappiness she must occasion him which silently yet powerfully reproached her stole fast upon her mind and poisoned its tranquillity for though her opinion was invariable in holding his proposal to be wrong she thought too highly of his character to believe he would have made it but from a mistaken notion it was right she painted him therefore to herself as glowing with indignation accusing her of inconsistency and perhaps suspecting her of coquetry and imputing her change of conduct to motives the most trifling and narrow till with resentment and disdain he drove her wholly from his thoughts  in a few minutes however the picture was reversed delvile no more appeared storming nor unreasonable his face wore an aspect of sorrow and his brow was clouded with disappointment he forebore to reproach her but the look which her imagination delineated was more piercing than words of severest import  these images pusued and tormented her drew tears from her eyes and loaded her heart with anguish yet when she recollected that her conduct had had in view an higher motive than pleasing delvile she felt that it ought to offer her an higher satisfaction she tried therefore to revive her spirits by reflecting upon her integrity and refused all indulgence to this enervating sadness beyond what the weakness of human nature demands as some relief to its sufferings upon every fresh attack of misery  a conduct such as this was the best antidote against affliction whose arrows are never with so little difficulty repelled as when they light upon a conscience which no selfreproach has laid bare to their malignancy  before six oclock the next morning her maid came to her bedside with the following letter which she told her had been brought by an express  to miss beverley may this letter with one only from delvilecastle be the last that miss beverley may ever receive  yet sweet to me as is that hope i write in the utmost uneasiness i have just heard that a gentleman whom by the description that is given of him i imagine is mr monckton has been in search of me with a letter which he was anxious to deliver immediately  perhaps this letter is from miss beverley perhaps it contains directions which ought instantly to be followed could i divine what they are with what eagerness would i study to anticipate their execution it will not i hope be too late to receive them on saturday when her power over my actions will be confirmed and when every wish she will communicate shall be gratefully joyfully and with delight fulfilled  i have sought belfield in vain he has left lord vannelt and no one knows whither he is gone i have been obliged therefore to trust a stranger to draw up the bond but he is a man of good character and the time of secresy will be too short to put his discretion in much danger tomorrow friday i shall spend solely in endeavoring to discover mr monckton i have leisure sufficient for the search since so prosperous has been my diligence that every thing is prepared  i have seen some lodgings in pall mall which i think are commodious and will suit you send a servant therefore before you to secure them if upon your arrival i should venture to meet you there be not i beseech you offended or alarmed i shall take every possible precaution neither to be known nor seen and i will stay with you only three minutes the messenger who carries this is ignorant from whom it comes for i fear his repeating my name among your servants and he could scarce return to me with an answer before you will yourself be in town yes loveliest cecilia at the very moment you receive this letter the chaise will i flatter myself be at the door which is to bring to me a treasure that will enrich every future hour of my life and oh as to me it will be exhaustless may but its sweet dispenser experience some share of the happiness she bestows and then what save her own purity will be so perfect so unsullied as the felicity of her  m d   the perturbation of cecilia upon reading this letter was unspeakable mr monckton she found had been wholly unsuccessful all her heroism had answered no purpose and the transaction was as backward as before she had exerted it  she was now therefore called upon to think and act entirely for herself her opinion was still the same nor did her resolution waver yet how to put it in execution she could not discern  to write to him was impossible since she was ignorant where he was to be found to disappoint him at the last moment she could not resolve since such a conduct appeared to her unfeeling and unjustifiable for a few instants she thought of having him waited for at night in london with a letter but the danger of entrusting any one with such a commission and the uncertainty of finding him should he disguise himself made the success of this scheme too precarious for trial  one expedient alone occurred to her which though she felt to be hazardous she believed was without an alternative this was no other than hastening to london herself consenting to the interview he had proposed in pall mall and then by strongly stating her objections and confessing the grief they occasioned her to pique at once his generosity and his pride upon releasing her himself from the engagement into which he had entered  she had no time to deliberate her plan therefore was decided almost as soon as formed and every moment being precious she was obliged to awaken mrs charlton and communicate to her at once the letter from delvile and the new resolution she had taken  mrs charlton having no object in view but the happiness of her young friend with a facility that looked not for objections and scarce saw them when presented agreed to the expedition and kindly consented to accompany her to london for cecilia however concerned to hurry and fatigue her was too anxious for the sanction of her presence to hesitate in soliciting it  a chaise therefore was ordered and with posthorses for speed and two servants on horseback the moment mrs charlton was ready they set out on their journey  scarce had they proceeded two miles on their way when they were met by mr monckton who was hastening to their house  amazed and alarmed at a sight so unexpected he stopped the chaise to enquire whither they was going  cecilia without answering asked if her letter had yet been received  i could not said mr monckton deliver it to a man who was not to be found i was this moment coming to acquaint how vainly i had sought him but still that your journey is unnecessary unless voluntary since i have left it at the house where you told me you should meet tomorrow morning and where he must then unavoidably receive it  indeed sir cried cecilia tomorrow morning will be too late  in conscience in justice and even in decency too late i must therefore go to town yet i go not believe me in opposition to your injunctions but to enable myself without treachery or dishonor to fulfill them  mr monckton aghast and confounded made not any answer till cecilia gave orders to the postilion to drive on he then hastily called to stop him and began the warmest expostulations but cecilia firm when she believed herself right though wavering when fearful she was wrong told him it was now too late to change her plan and repeating her orders to the postilion left him to his own reflections grieved herself to reject his counsel yet too intently occupied by her own affairs and designs to think long of any other  chap ix a torment at  they stopped for dinner mrs charlton being too much fatigued to go on without some rest though the haste of cecilia to meet delvile time enough for new arranging their affairs made her regret every moment that was spent upon the road  their meal was not long and they were returning to their chaise when they were suddenly encountered by mr morris who was just alighted from his horse  he congratulated himself upon the happiness of meeting them with the air of a man who nothing doubted that happiness being mutual then hastening to speak of the grove i could hardly he cried get away my friend monckton will not know what to do without me for lady margaret poor old soul is in a shocking bad way indeed there is hardly any staying in the room with her her breathing is just like the grunting of a hog she cannot possibly last long for she is quite upon her last legs and trumbles about so when she walks alone one would swear she was drunk  if you take infirmity said mrs charlton who was now helped into the chaise for intoxication you must suppose no old person sober  vastly well said maam cried he i really forgot your being an old lady yourself or i should not have made the observation however as to poor lady margaret she may do as well as ever by and bye for she has an excellent constitution and i suppose she has been hardly any better than she is now these forty years for i remember when i was quite a boy hearing her called a limping old puddle  well well discuss this matter if you please said cecilia some other time and ordered the postilion to drive on but before they came to their next stage morris having changed his horse joined them and rode on by their side begging them to observe what haste he had made on purpose to have the pleasure of escorting them  this forwardness was very offensive to mrs charlton whose years and character had long procured her more deference and respect but cecilia anxious only to hasten her journey was indifferent to every thing save what retarded it  at the same inn they both again changed horses and he still continued riding with them and occasionally talking till they were within twenty miles of london when a disturbance upon the road exciting his curiosity he hastily rode away from them to enquire into its cause  upon coming up to the place whence it proceeded they saw a party of gentlemen on horseback surrounding a chaise which had been just overturned and while the confusion in the road obliged the postilion to stop cecilia heard a ladys voice exclaiming i declare i dare say i am killed and instantly recollecting miss larolles the fear of discovery and delay made her desire the man to drive on with all speed he was preparing to obey her but morris gallopping after them called out miss beverley one of the ladies that has been overturned is an acquaintance of yours i used to see her with you at mrs harrels  did you said cecilia much disconcerted i hope she is not hurt  no not at all but the lady with her is bruised to death will not you come and see her  i am too much in haste at present  and i can do them no good but mrs charlton i am sure will spare her servant if he can be of any use  o but the young lady wants to speak to you she is coming up to the chaise as fast as ever she can  and how should she know me cried cecilia with much surprise i am sure she could not see me  o i told her answered morris with a nod of selfapprobation for what he had done i told her it was you for i knew i could soon overtake you  displeasure at this officiousness was unavailing for looking out of the window she perceived miss larolles followed by half her party not three paces from the chaise  o my dear creature she called out what a terrible accident i assure you i am so monstrously frightened you have no idea it is the luckiest thing in the world that you were going this way never any thing happened so excessively provoking you have no notion what a fall we have had it is horrid shocking i assure you how have you been all this time you cannot conceive how glad i am to see you  and to which will miss beverley answer first cried a voice which announced mr gosport the joy or the sorrow for so adroitly are they blended that a common auditor could with difficulty decide whether condolence or congratulation should have the precedence  how can you be so excessive horrid cried miss larolles to talk of congratulation when ones in such a shocking panic that one does not know if ones dead or alive  dead then for any wager returned he if we may judge by your stillness  i desire now you will not begin joking cried she for i assure you it is an excessive serious affair i was never so rejoiced in my life as when i found i was not killed i have been so squeezed you have no notion i thought for a full hour i had broke both my arms  and my heart at the same time said mr gosport i hope you did not imagine that the least fragile of the three  all our hearts give me leave to add said captain aresby  just then advancing all our hearts must have been abimes by the indisposition of miss larolles had not their doom been fortunately revoked by the sight of miss beverley  well this is excessive odd cried miss larolles that every body should run away so from poor mrs mears she will be so affronted you have no idea i thought captain aresby you would have stayed to take care of her  i will run and fee how she is myself cried morris and away he gallopped  really maam said the captain i am quite au desespoir to have failed in any of my devoirs but i make it a principle to be a mere looker on upon these occasions lest i should be so unhappy as to commit any fauxpas by too much empressement  an admirable caution said mr gosport and to so ardent a temper a necessary check  cecilia whom the surprise and vexation of so unseasonable a meeting when she particularly wished to have escaped all notice had hitherto kept in painful silence began now to recover some presence of mind and making her compliments to miss larolles and mr gosport with a slight bow to the captain she apologized for hurrying away but told them she had an engagement in london which could not be deferred and was then giving orders to the postilion to drive on when morris returning full speed called out the poor ladys so bad she is not able to stir a step she cannot put a foot to the ground and she says she is quite black and blue so i told her i was sure miss beverley would not refuse to make room for her in her chaise till the other can be put to rights and she says she shall take it as a great favor here postilion a little more to the right come ladies and gentlemen get out of the way  this impertinence however extraordinary cecilia could not oppose for mrs charlton ever compassionate and complying where there was any appearance of distress instantly seconded the proposal the chaise therefore was turned back and she was obliged to offer a place in it to mrs mears who though more frightened than hurt readily accepted it notwithstanding to make way for her without incommoding mrs charlton she was forced to get out herself  she failed not however to desire that all possible expedition might be used in refitting the other chaise for their reception and all the gentlemen but one dismounted their horses in order to assist or seem to assist in getting it ready  this only unconcerned spectator in the midst of the apparent general bustle was mr meadows who viewed all that passed without troubling himself to interfere and with an air of the most evident carelessness whether matters went well or went ill  miss larolles now returning to the scene of action suddenly screamed out o dear where is my little dog i never thought of him i declare i love him better than any thing in the world i would not have him hurt for an hundred thousand pounds lord where is he  crushed or suffocated in the overturn no doubt said mr gosport but as you must have been his executioner what softer death could he die if you will yourself inflict the punishment i will submit to the same fate  lord how you love to plague one cried she and then enquired among the servants what was become of her dog the poor little animal forgotten by its mistress and disregarded by all others was now discovered by its yelping and soon found to have been the most material sufferer by the overturn one of its fore legs being broken  could screams or lamentations reproaches to the servants or complaints against the destinies have abated his pain or made a callus of the fracture but short would have been the duration of his misery for neither words were saved nor lungs were spared the very air was rent with cries and all present were upbraided as if accomplices in the disaster  the postilion at length interrupted this vociferation with news that the chaise was again fit for use and cecilia eager to be gone finding him little regarded repeated what he said to miss larolles  the chaise cried she why you dont suppose i will ever get into that horrid chaise any more i do assure you i would not upon any account  not get into it said cecilia for what purpose then have we all waited till it was ready  o i declare i would not go in it for forty thousand worlds i would rather walk to an inn if it is a hundred and fifty miles off  but as it happens said mr gosport to be only seven miles i fancy you will condescend to ride  seven miles lord how shocking you frighten me so you have no idea poor mrs mears she will have to go quite alone i dare say the chaise will be down fifty times by the way ten to one but she breaks her neck only conceive how horrid i assure you i am excessive glad i am out of it  very friendly indeed said mr gosport mrs mears then may break her bones at her leisure  mrs mears however when applied to professed an equal aversion to the carriage in which she had been so unfortunate and declared she would rather walk than return to it though one of her ancles was already so swelled that she could hardly stand  why then the best way ladies cried morris with the look of a man happy in vanquishing all difficulties will be for mrs charlton and that poor lady with the bruises to go together in that sound chaise and then for us gentlemen to escort this young lady and miss beverley on foot till we all come to the next inn miss beverley i know is an excellent walker for i have heard mr monckton say so  cecilia though in the utmost consternation at a proposal which must so long retard a journey she had so many reasons to wish hastened knew not how either in decency or humanity to oppose it and the fear of raising suspicion from a consciousness how much there was to suspect forced her to curb her impatience and reduced her even to repeat the offer which morris had made though she could scarce look at him for anger at his unseasonable forwardness  no voice dissenting the troop began to be formed the foot consisted of the two young ladies and mr gosport who alighted to walk with cecilia the cavalry of mr meadows the captain and morris who walked their horses a foot pace while the rest of the party rode on with the chaise as attendants upon mrs mears  just before they set off mr meadows riding negligently up to the carriage exerted himself so far as to say to mrs mears are you hurt maam and at the same instant seeming to recollect cecilia he turned about and yawning while he touched his hat said o how do you do maam and then without waiting an answer to either of his questions flapped it over his eyes and joined the cavalcade though without appearing to have any consciousness that he belonged to it  cecilia would most gladly have used the rejected chaise herself but could not make such a proposal to mrs charlton who was past the age and the courage for even any appearance of enterprise upon enquiry however she had the satisfaction to hear that the distance to the next stage was but two miles though multiplied to seven by the malice of mr gosport  miss larolles carried her little dog in her arms declaring she would never more ust him a moment away from her she acquainted cecilia that she had been for some time upon a visit to mrs mears who with the rest of the party had taken her to see  house and gardens where they had made an early dinner from which they were just returning home when the chaise broke down  she then proceeded with her usual volubility to relate the little nothings that had passed since the winter flying from subject to subject with no meaning but to be heard and no wish but to talk ever rapid in speech though minute in detail this loquacity met not with any interruption save now and then a sarcastic remark from mr gosport for cecilia was too much occupied by her own affairs to answer or listen to such uninteresting discourse  her silence however was at length forcibly broken mr gosport taking advantage of the first moment miss larolles stopped for breath said pray what carries you to town miss beverley at this time of the year  cecilia whose thoughts had been wholly employed upon what would pass at her approaching meeting with delvile was so entirely unprepared for this question that she could make to it no manner of answer till mr gosport in a tone of some surprise repeated it and then not without hesitation she said i have some business sir in london  pray how long have you been in the country  business have you cried he struck by her evasion and pray what can you and business have in common  more than you may imagine answered she with greater steadiness and perhaps before long i may even have enough to teach me the enjoyment of leisure  why you dont pretend to play my lady notable and become your own steward  and what can i do better  what why seek one ready made to take the trouble off your hands there are such creatures to be found i promise you beasts of burden who will freely undertake the management of your estate for no other reward than the trifling one of possessing it can you no where meet with such an animal  i dont know answered she laughing i have not been looking out  and have none such made application to you  why no  i believe not  fie fie no registeroffice keeper has been pestered with more claimants you know they assault you by dozens  you must pardon me indeed i know not any such thing  you know then why they do not and that is much the same  i may conjecture why at least the place i suppose is not worth the service  no no the place they conclude is already seized and the feesimple of the estate is the heart of the owner is it not so  the heart of the owner answered she a little confused may indeed be simple but not perhaps so easily seized as you imagine  have you then wisely saved it from a storm by a generous surrender you have been indeed in an excellent school for the study both of attack and defense delvilecastle is a fortress which even in ruins proves its strength by its antiquity and it teaches also an admirable lesson by displaying the dangerous the infallible power of time which defies all might and undermines all strength which breaks down every barrier and shows nothing endurable but itself then looking at her with an arch earnestness i think he added you made a long visit there did this observation never occur to you did you never perceive never feel rather the insidious properties of time  yes certainly answered she alarmed at the very mention of delvilecastle yet affecting to understand literally what was said metaphorieally the havoc of time upon the place could not fail striking me  and was its havoc said he yet more archly merely external is all within safe sound and firm and did the length of your residence show its power by no new mischief  doubtless not answered she with the same pretended ignorance the place is not in so desperate a condition as to exhibit any visible marks of decay in the course of three or four months  and do you not know cried he that the place to which i allude may receive a mischief in as many minutes which double the number of years cannot rectify the internal parts of a building are not less vulnerable to accident than its outside and though the evil may more easily be concealed it will with greater difficulty be remedied many a fair structure have i seen which like that now before me looking with much significance at cecilia has to the eye seemed perfect in all its parts and unhurt either by time or casualty while within some lurking evil some latent injury has secretly worked its way into the very heart of the edifice where it has consumed its strength and laid waste its powers till sinking deeper and deeper it has sapped its very foundation before the superstructure has exhibited any token of danger is such an accident among the things you hold to be possible  your language said she coloring very high is so florid that i must own it renders your meaning rather obscure  shall i illustrate it by an example suppose during your abode in delvilecastle    no no interrupted she with involuntary quickness why should i trouble you to make illustrations  o pray my dear creature cried miss larolles how is mrs harrel i was never so sorry for any body in my life i quite forgot to ask after her  ay poor harrel cried morris he was a great loss to his friends i had just begun to have a regard for him we were growing extremely intimate poor fellow he really gave most excellent dinners  harrel suddenly exclaimed mr meadows who seemed just then to first hear what was going forward who was he  o as goodnatured a fellow as ever i knew in my life answered morris he was never out of humor he was drinking and singing and dancing to the very last moment dont you remember him sir that night at vauxhall  mr meadows made not any answer but rode languidly on  morris ever more flippant than sagacious called out i really believe the gentlemans deaf he will not so much as say umph and hay now but i will give him such a hallow in his ears as shall make him hear me whether he will or no sir i say bawling aloud have you forgot that night at vauxhall  mr meadows starting at being thus shouted at looked toward morris with some surprise and said were you so obliging sir as to speak to me  lord yes sir said morris amazed i thought you had asked something about mr harrel so i just made an answer to it  that is all  sir you are very good returned he slightly bowing and then looking another way as if thoroughly satisfied with what had passed  but i say sir resuined morris dont you remember how mr harrel    mr who sir  mr harrel sir was not you just now asking me who he was  o ay true cried meadows in a tone of extreme we weariness i am much obliged to you pray give my respects to him and touching his hat he was riding away but the astonished morris called out your respects to him why lord sir dont you know he is dead  dead  who sir  why mr harrel sir  harrel  o very true cried meadows with a face of sudden recollection he shot himself i think or was knocked down or something of that sort i remember it perfectly  o pray cried miss larolles dont let us talk about it it is the cruellest thing i ever knew in my life i assure you i was so shocked i thought i should never have got the better of it i remember the next night at ranelagh i could talk of nothing else i dare say i told it to  00 people i assure you i was tired to death only conceive how distressing  an excellent method cried mr gosport to drive it out of your own head by driving it into the heads of your neighbors but were you not afraid by such an ebullition of pathos to burst as many hearts as you had auditors  o i assure you cried she every body was so excessive shocked you have no notion one heard of nothing else all the world was raving mad about it  really yes cried the captain the subject was obsede upon one partout there was scarce any breathing for it it poured from all directions i must confess i was aneanti with it to a degree  but the most shocking thing in nature cried miss larolles was going to the sale i never missed a single day one used to meet the whole world there and every body was so sorry you cannot conceive it was quite horrid i assure you i never suffered so much before it made me so unhappy you cannot imagine  that i am most ready to grant said mr gosport be the powers of imagination ever so excentric  sir robert floyer and mr marriot continued miss larolles have behaved so ill you have no idea for they have done nothing ever since but say how monstrously mr harrel had cheated them and how they lost such immense sums by him  only conceive how illnatured  and they complain cried morris that old mr delvile used them worse for that when they had been defrauded of all that money on purpose to pay their addresses to miss beverley he would never let them see her but all of a sudden took her off into the country on purpose to marry her to his own son  the cheeks of cecilia now glowed with the deepest blushes but finding by a general silence that she was expected to make some answer she said with what unconcern she could assume they were very much mistaken mr delvile had no such view  indeed cried mr gosport again perceiving her change of countenance and is it possible you have actually escaped a siege while every body concluded you taken by assault pray where is young delvile at present  i dont  i cannot tell sir  is it long since you have seen him  it is two months answered she with yet more hesitation since i was at delvilecastle  o but cried morris did not you see him while he was in suffolk i believe indeed he is there now for it was only yesterday i heard of his coming down by a gentleman who called upon lady margaret and told us he had seen a stranger a day or two ago at mrs charltons door and when he asked who he was they told him his name was delvile and said he was on a visit at mr biddulphs  cecilia was quite confounded by this speech to have it known that delvile had visited her was in itself alarming but to have her own equivocation thus glaringly exposed was infinitely more dangerous the just suspicions to which it must give rise filled her with dread and the palpable evasion in which she had been discovered overwhelmed her with confusion  so you had forgotton said mr gosport looking at her with much archness that you had seen him within the two months but no wonder for where is the lady who having so many admirers can be at the trouble to remember which of them she saw last or who being so accustomed to adulation can hold it worth while to enquire whence it comes a thousand mr delviles are to miss beverley but as one used from them all to the same tale she regards them not individually as lovers but collectively as men and to gather even from herself which she is most inclined to favor she must probably desire like portia in the merchant of venice that their names may be run over one by one before she can distinctly tell which is which  the gallant gaiety of this speech was some relief to cecilia who was beginning a laughing reply when morris called out that man looks as if he was upon the scout and raising her eyes she perceived a man on horseback who though much muffled up his hat flapped and a handkerchief held to his mouth and chin she instantly by his air and figure recognized to be delvile  in much consternation at this sight she forgot what she meant to say and dropping her eyes walked silently on mr gosport attentive to her motions looked from her to the horseman and after a short examination said i think i have seen that man before have you miss beverley me  no  answered she i believe not  i hardly indeed see him now   i have i am pretty sure said morris and if i could see his face i dare say i should recollect him  he seems very willing to know if he can recollect any of us said mr gosport and if i am not mistaken he sees much better than he is seen  he was now come up to them and though a glance sufficed to discover the object of his search the sight of the party with which she was surrounded made him not care stop or speak to her and therefore clapping spurs to his horse he gallopped past them  see cried morris looking after him how he turns round to examine us i wonder who he is  perhaps some highwayman cried miss larolles i assure you i am in a prodigious fright i should hate to be robbed so you cannot think  i was going to make much the same conjecture said mr gosport and if i am not greatly deceived that man is a robber of no common sort what think you miss beverley can you discern a thief in disguise  no indeed i pretend to no such extraordinary knowledge  that is true for all that you pretend is extraordinary ignorance  i have a good mind said morris to ride after him and see what he is about  what for exclaimed cecilia greatly alarmed there can certainly be no occasion  no pray dont cried miss larolles for i assure you if he should come back to rob us i should die upon the spot nothing could be so disagreeable i should scream so you have no idea  morris then gave up the proposal and they walked quietly on but cecilia was extremely disturbed by this accident she readily conjectured that impatient for her arrival delvile had ridden that way to see what had retarded her and she was sensible that nothing could be so desirable as an immediate explanation of the motive of her journey such a meeting therefore had she been alone was just what she could have wished though thus unluckily encompassed it only added to her anxiety  involuntarily however she quickened her pace through her eagerness to be relieved from so troublesome a party but miss larolles who was in no such haste protested she could not keep up with her saying you dont consider that i have got this sweet little dog to carry and he is such a shocking plague to me you have no notion only conceive what a weight he is  pray maam cried morris let me take him for you i will be very careful of him i promise you and you need not be afraid to trust me for i understand more about dogs than about any thing  miss larolles after many fond caresses being really weary consented and morris placed the little animal before him on horseback but while this matter was adjusting and miss larolles was giving directions how she would have it held morris exclaimed look look that man is coming back he is certainly watching us there now he is going off again  i suppose he saw me remarking him  i dare say he is laying in wait to rob us said miss larolles so when we turn off the high road to go to mrs mears i suppose he will come gallopping after us it is excessive horrid i assure you  it is a petrifying thing said the captain that one must always be degoute by some wretched being or other of this sort but pray be not deranged i will ride after him if you please and do mon possible to get rid of him  indeed i wish you would answered miss larolles for i assure you he has put such shocking notions into my head it is quite disagreeable  i shall make it a principle said the captain to have the honor of obeying you and was riding off when cecilia in great agitation called out why should you go sir  he is not in our way  pray let him alone  for what purpose should you pursue him  i hope said mr gosport for the purpose of making him join our company to some part of which i fancy he would be no very intolerable addition  this speech again silenced cecilia who perceived with the utmost confusion that both delvile and herself were undoubtedly suspected by mr gosport if not already actually betrayed to him she was obliged therefore to let the matter take its course though quite sick with apprehension lest a full discovery should follow the projected pursuit  the captain who wanted not courage however deeply in vanity and affectation he had buried common sense stood suspended upon the request of cecilia that he would not go and with a shrug of distress said give me leave to own i am parfaitment in a state the most accablant in the world nothing could give me greater pleasure than to profit of the occasion to accommodate either of these ladies but as they proceed upon different principles i am indecide to a degree which way to turn myself  put it to the vote then said morris the two ladies have both spoke now then for the gentleman come sir to mr gosport what say you  o fetch the culprit back by all means answered he and then let us all insist upon his opening his cause by telling us in what he has offended us for there is no part of his business i believe with which we are less acquainted  well said morris i am for asking him a few questions too so is the captain so every body has spoke but you sir addressing himself to mr meadows so now sir let us hear your opinion  mr meadows appearing wholly inattentive rode on why sir i say cried morris louder we are all waiting for your vote pray what is the gentlemans name it is duced hard to make him hear one  his name is meadows said miss larolles in a low voice and i assure you sometimes he will not hear people by the hour together he is so excessive absent you have no notion one day he made me so mad that i could not help crying and mr sawyer was standing by the whole time and i assure you i believe he laughed at me only conceive how distressing  may be said morris its out of bashfulness perhaps he thinks we shall cut him up  bashfulness repeated miss larolles lord you dont conceive the thing at all why he is at the very head of the ton there is nothing in the world so fashionable as taking no notice of things and never seeing people and saying nothing at all and never hearing a word and not knowing ones own acquaintance all the ton people do so and i assure you as to mr meadows he is so exccessively courted by every body that if he does but say a syllable he thinks it such an immense favor you have no idea  this account however little alluring in itself of his celebrity was yet sufficient to make morris covet his further acquaintance for morris was ever attentive to turn his pleasure to his profit and never negligent of his interest but when ignorant how to pursue it he returned therefore to the charge though by no means with the same freedom he had begun it and lowering his voice to a tone of respect and submission he said pray sir may we take the liberty to ask your advice whether we shall go on or take a turn back  mr meadows made not any answer but when morris was going to repeat his question without appearing even to know that he was near him he abruptly said to miss larolles pray what is become of mrs mears i dont see her amongst us  lord mr meadows exclaimed she how can you be so odd dont you remember she went on in a chaise to the inn  o ay true cried he i protest i had quite forgot it i beg your pardon indeed yes i recollect now  she fell off her horse  her horse why you know she was in her chaise  her chaise was it  ay true so it was poor thing  i am glad she was not hurt  not hurt why she is so excessively bruised she cant stir a step only conceive what a memory you have got  i am most extremely sorry for her indeed cried he again stretching himself and yawning poor soul  i hope she will not die do you think she will  die repeated miss larolles with a scream lord how shocking you are really enough to frighten one to hear you  but sir said morris i wish you would be so kind as to give us your vote the man will else be gone so far we shant be able to overtake him  though i do really believe that is the very fellow coming back to peep at us again  i am ennuye to a degree cried the captain he is certainly set upon us as a spy and i must really beg leave to enquire of him upon what principle he incommodes us  and instantly he rode after him  and so will i too cried morris following  miss larolles screamed after him to give her first her little dog but with a schoolboys eagerness to be foremost he gallopped on without heeding her  the uneasiness of cecilia now increased every moment the discovery of delvile seemed unavoidable and his impatient and indiscreet watchfulness must have rendered the motives of his disguise but too glaring all she had left to hope was arriving at the inn before the detection was announced and at least saving herself the cruel mortification of hearing the raillery which would follow it  even this however was not allowed her miss larolles whom she had no means to quit hardly stirred another step from her anxiety for her dog and the earnestness of her curiosity about the stranger she loitered stopped now to talk and now to listen and was scarce moved a yard from the spot where she had been left when the captain and morris returned  we could not for our lives overtake the fellow said morris he was well mounted i promise you and i will warrant he knows what he is about for he turned off so short at a place where there were two narrow lanes that we could not make out wh way he went  cecilia relieved and delighted by this unexpected escape now recovered her composure and was content to saunter on without repining  but though we could not seize his person said the captain we have debarrassed ourselves tout a fait from his pursuit i hope therefore miss larolles will make a revoke of her apprehensions  the answer to this was nothing but a loud scream with an exclamation lord where is my dog  your dog cried morris looking aghast good stars i never thought of him  how excessive barbarous cried miss larolles you have killed him i dare say only think how shocking i had rather have seen any body served so in the world i shall never forgive it i assure you  lord maam said morris how can you suppose i have killed him poor pretty creature i am sure i liked him prodigiously i cannot think for my life where he can be but i have a notion he must have dropped down some where while i happened to be on the full gallop i will go ok him however for we went at such a rate that i never missed him  away again rode morris  i am abime to the greatest degree said the captain that the poor little sweet fellow should be lost if i had thought him in any danger i would have made it a principle to have had a regard to his person myself will you give me leave maam to have the honor of seeking him partout  o i wish you would with all my heart for i assure you if i dont find him i shall think it so excessive distressing you cannot conceive  the captain touched his hat and was gone  these repeated impediments almost robbed cecilia of all patience yet her total inability of resistance obliged her to submit and compelled her to go stop or turn according to their own motions  new if mr meadows had the least goodnature in the world said miss larolles he would offer to help us but he is so excessive odd that i believe if we were all of us to fall down and break our necks he would be so absent he would hardly take the trouble to ask us how we did  why in so desperate a case said mr gosport the trouble would be rather superfluous however dont repine that one of the cavaliers stays with us by way of guard lest your friend the spy should take us by surprise while our troop is dispersed  o lord cried miss larolles now you put it in my head i dare say that wretch has got my dog only think how horrid  i saw plainly said mr gosport looking significantly at cecilia that he was feloniously inclined though i must confess i took him not for a dogstealer  miss larolles then running up to mr meadows called out i have a prodigious immense favor to ask of you mr meadows  maam cried mr meadows with his usual start  it is only to know whether if that horrid creature should come back you could not just ride up to him and shoot him before he gets to us now will you promise me to do it  you are vastly good said he with a vacant smile what a charming evening do you love the country  yes vastly only i am so monstrously tired i can hardly stir a step do you like it  the country o no i detest it dusty hedges and chirping sparrows it is amazing to me any body can exist upon such terms  i assure you cried miss larolles i am quite of your opinion i hate the country so you have no notion i wish with all my heart it was all under ground i declare when i first go into it for the summer i cry so you cannot think i like nothing but london  dont you  london repeated mr meadows o melancholy the sink of all vice and depravity streets without light houses without air neighborhood without society talkers without listeners  it is astonishing any rational being can endure to be so miserably immured  lord mr meadows cried she angrily i believe you would have one live no where  true very true maam said he yawning one really lives no where one does but vegetate and wish it all at an end dont you find it so maam  me no indeed i assure you i like living of all things whenever i am ill i am in such a fright you have no idea i always think i am going to die and it puts me so out of spirits you cannot think does not it you too  here mr meadows looking another way began to whistle  lord cried miss larolles how excessive distressing to ask one questions and then never hear what one answers  here the captain returned alone and miss larolles flying to meet him demanded where was her dog  i have the malheur to assure you answered he that i never was more aneanti in my life the pretty little fellow has broke another leg  miss larolles in a passion of grief then declared she was certain that morris had maimed him thus on purpose and desired to know where the vile wretch was  he was so much discomposed at the incident replied the captain that he rode instantly another way i took up the pretty fellow therefore myself and have done mon possible not to derange him  the unfortunate little animal was then delivered to miss larolles and after much lamentation they at length continued their walk and without further adventure arrived at the inn  book viii chapter i an interruption but here instead of finding as she expected mrs charlton and fresh horses in readiness cecilia saw neither chaise nor preparation mrs charlton was quietly seated in a parlour and drinking tea with mrs mears  vexed and disappointed she ordered horses immediately to the chaise and entreated mrs charlton to lose no more time but the various delays which had already retarded them had made it now so late that it was impossible to get into london by daylight and mrs charlton not having courage to be upon the road after dark had settled to sleep at the inn and purposed not to proceed till the next morning  half distracted at this new difficulty cecilia begged to speak with her alone and then represented in the most earnest manner the absolute necessity there was for her being in london that night every thing said she depends upon it and the whole purpose of my journey will otherwise be lost for mr delvile will else think himself extremely ill used and to make him reparation i may be compelled to submit to almost whatever terms he shall propose  mrs charlton kind and yielding withstood not this entreaty which cecilia made with infinite pain to herself from the reluctance she felt to pursuing her own interest and inclination in opposition to those of her worthy old friend but as she was now circumstanced she considered the immediate prosecution of her journey as her only resource against first irritating delvile by an abrupt disappointment and appeasing him next by a concession which would make that disappointment end in nothing  the chaise was soon ready and mrs charlton and cecilia were rising to take leave of the company when a man and horse gallopped full speed into the innyard and in less than a minute morris bounced into the room  ladies and gentlemen cried he quite out of breath with haste i have got some news for you i have just sound out who that person is that has been watching us  cecilia starting at this most unwelcome intelligence would now have run into the chaise without hearing him proceed but mrs charlton who knew neither whom nor what he meant involuntarily stopped and cecilia whose arm she leant upon was compelled to stay  every one else eagerly desired to know who he was  why i will tell you said he how i found him out i was thinking in my own mind what i could possibly do to make amends for that unlucky accident about the dog and just then i spied the very man that had made me drop him so i thought at least i would find out who he was i rode up to him so quick that he could not get away from me though i saw plainly it was the thing he meant but still he kept himself muffled up just as he did before not so snug thought i my friend i shall have you yet it is a fine evening sir says i but he took no notice so then i came more to the point sir says i i think i have had the pleasure of seeing you though i quite forget where still he made no answer if you have no objection sir says i i shall be glad to ride with you for the nights coming on and we have neither of us a servant but then without a word speaking he rode on the quicker however i jogged by his side as fast as he and said pray sir did you know any thing of that company you were looking at so hard just now and at this he could hold out no longer he turned to me in a most fierce passion and said pray sir dont be troublesome and then he got off for when i found by his voice who he was i let him alone  cecilia who could bear to hear no more again hastened mrs charlton who now moved on but morris stepping between them both and the door said now do pray miss beverley guess who it was  no indeed i cannot said she in the utmost confusion nor have i any time to hear come dear madam we shall be very late indeed  o but i must tell you before you go  why it was young mr delvile the same that i saw with you one night at the pantheon and that i used to meet last spring at mr harrels  mr delvile repeated every one very strange he should not speak  pray maam continued morris is it not the same gentleman that was at mr biddulphs  cecilia half dead with shame and vexation stammered out no no  i believe not  i cannot tell  i have not a moment to spare  and then at last got mrs charlton out of the room and into the chaise but thither before she could drive off she was followed by mr gosport who gravely came to offer his advice that she would immediately lodge an information at the public office in bowstreet that a very suspicious looking man had been observed loitering in those parts who appeared to harbor most dangerous designs against her person and property  cecilia was too much confounded to rally or reply and mr gosport returned to his party with his speech unanswered  the rest of the journey was without any new casualty for late as it was they escaped being robbed but neither robbers nor new casualties were wanting to make it unpleasant to cecilia the incidents which had already happened sufficed for that purpose and the consciousness of being so generally betrayed added to the delay of her recantation prepared her for nothing but mortifications to herself and conflicts with delvile the most bitter and severe  it was near ten oclock before they arrived in pall mall the house to which delvile had given directions was easily found and the servant sent forward had prepared the people of it for their reception  in the cruellest anxiety and trepidation cecilia then counted every moment till delvile came she planned an apology for her conduct with all the address of which she was mistress and determined to bear his disappointment and indignation with firmness yet the part she had to act was both hard and artificial she sighed to have it over and repined she must have it at all  the instant there was a knock at the door she flew out upon the stairs to listen and hearing his wellknown voice enquiring for the ladies who had just taken the lodgings she ran back to mrs charlton saying ah madam assist me i entreat for now must i merit or forfeit your esteem forever  can you pardon cried delvile as he entered the room an intrusion which was not in our bond but how could i wait till tomorrow when i knew you were in town tonight  he then made his compliments to mrs charlton and after enquiring how she had borne her journey turned again to cecilia whose uneasy sensations he saw but too plainly in her countenance are you angry cried he anxiously that i have ventured to come hither to night  no answered she struggling with all her feelings for composure what we wish is easily excused and i am glad to see you to night because otherwise    she hesitated and delvile little imagining why thanked her in the warmest terms for her condescension he then related how he had been tormented by morris enquired why mr monckton had not accompanied her and what could possibly have induced her to make her journey so late or with so large a party to be walking upon the high road instead of hastening to london  i wonder not answered she more steadily at your surprise though i have now no time to lessen it you have never i find received my letter  no cried he much struck by her manner was it to forbid our meeting till tomorrow  tomorrow she repeated expressively no it was to forbid    here the door was suddenly opened and morris burst into the room  the dismay and astonishment of delvile at sight of him could only be equalled by the confusion and consternation of cecilia but morris perceiving neither abruptly called out miss beverley i quite beg your pardon for coming so late but you must know   then stopping short upon seeing delvile good lord he exclaimed if here is not our gentleman spy why sir you have not spared the spur i left you gallopping off quite another way  however that may be sir cried delvile equally enraged at the interruption and the observation you did not i presume wait upon miss beverley to talk of me  no sir answered he lightly for i had told her all about you at the inn did not i miss beverley did not i tell you i was sure it was mr delvile that was dodging us about so though i believe sir you thought i had not found you out  and pray young man said mrs charlton much offended by this familiar intrusion how did you find us out  why maam by the luckiest accident in the world just as i was riding into town i met the returned chaise that brought you and i knew the postilion very well as i go that road pretty often so by the merest chance in the world i saw him by the light of the moon and then he told me where he had set you down  and pray sir again asked mrs charlton what was your reason for making the enquiry  why maam i had a little favor to ask of miss beverley that made me think i would take the liberty to call  and was this time of night sir she returned the only one you could choose for that purpose  why maam i will tell you how that was i did not mean to have called till tomorrow morning but as i was willing to know if the postilion had given me a right direction i knocked one soft little knock at the door thinking you might be gone to bed after your journey merely to ask if it was the right house but when the servant told me there was a gentleman with you already i thought there would be no harm in just stepping for a moment up stairs  and what sir said cecilia whom mingled shame and vexation had hitherto kept silent is your business with me  why maam i only just called to give you a direction to a most excellent dogdoctor as we call him that lives at the corner of    a dogdoctor sir repeated cecilia and what have i to do with any such direction  why you must know maam i have been in the greatest concern imaginable about that accident which happened to me with the poor little dog and so    what little dog sir cried delvile who now began to conclude he was not sober do you know what you are talking of  yes sir for it was that very little dog you made me drop out of my arms by which means he broke his other leg   i made you drop him cried delvile angrily i believe sir you had much better call some other time it does not appear to me that you are in a proper situation for remaining here at present  sir i shall be gone in an instant answered morris i merely wanted to beg the favor of miss beverley to tell that young lady that owned the dog that if she will carry him to this man i am sure he will make a cure of him  come sir said delvile convinced now of his inebriety if you please we will walk away together  i dont mean to take you away sir said morris looking very significantly for i suppose you have not rode so hard to go so soon but as to me i will only write the direction and be off  delvile amazed and irritated at so many following specimens of ignorant assurance would not in his present eagerness have scrupled turning him out of the house had he not thought it imprudent upon such an occasion to quarrel with him and improper at so late an hour to be left behind he therefore only while he was writing the direction told cecilia in a low voice that he would get rid of him and return in an instant  they then went together leaving cecilia in an agony of distress surpassing all she had hitherto experienced ah mrs charlton she cried what refuge have i now from ridicule or perhaps disgrace mr delvile has been detected watching me in disguise he has been discovered at this late hour meeting me in private the story will reach his family with all the hyperbole of exaggeration  how will his noble mother disdain me how cruelly shall i sink before the severity of her eye  mrs charlton tried to comfort her but the effort was vain and she spent her time in the bitterest repining till eleven oclock delviles not returning then added wonder to her sadness and the impropriety of his returning at all so late grew every instant more glaring  at last though in great disturbance and evidently much ruffled in his temper he came i feared he cried i had passed the time for admittance and the torture i have suffered from being detained has almost driven me wild i have been in misery to see you again  your looks your manner  the letter you talk of  all have filled me with alarm and though i know not what it is i have to dread i find it impossible to rest a moment without some explanation tell me then why you seem thus strange and thus depressed tell me what that letter was to forbid tell me any thing and every thing but that you repent your condescension  that letter said cecilia would have explained to you all i scarce know how to communicate its contents yet i hope you will hear with patience what i acknowledge i have resolved upon only from necessity that letter was to tell you that tomorrow we must not meet  it was to prepare you indeed for our meeting perhaps never more  gracious heaven exclaimed he starting what is it you mean  that i have made a promise too rash to be kept that you must pardon me if late as it is i retract since i am convinced it was wrong and must be wretched in performing it  confounded and dismayed for a moment he continued silent and then passionately called out who has been with you to defame me in your opinion who has barbarously wronged my character since i left you last monday mr monckton received me coldly  has he injured me in your esteem tell tell me but to whom i owe this change that my vindication if it restores not your favor may at least make you cease to blush that once i was honored with some share of it  it wants not to be restored said cecilia with much softness since it has never been alienated be satisfied that i think of you as i thought when we last parted and generously forbear to reproach me when i assure you i am actuated by principles which you ought not to disapprove  and are you then unchanged cried he more gently and is your esteem for me still    i thought it justice to say so once cried she hastily interrupting him but exact from me nothing more it is too late for us now to talk any longer tomorrow you may find my letter at mrs robertss and that short as it is contains my resolution and its cause  never cried he vehemently can i quit you without knowing it i would not linger till tomorrow in this suspense to be master of the universe  i have told it you sir already whatever is clandestine carries a consciousness of evil and so repugnant do i find it to my disposition and opinions that till you give me back the promise i so unworthily made i must be a stranger to peace because at war with my own actions and myself  recover then your peace cried delvile with much emotion for i here acquit you of all promise  to fetter to compel you were too inhuman to afford me any happiness yet hear me dispassionately hear me and deliberate a moment before you resolve upon my exile your scruples i am not now going combat i grieve that they are so powerful but i have no new arguments with which to oppose them all i have to say is that it is now too late for a retreat to satisfy them  true sir and far too true yet is it always best to do right however tardily always better to repent than to grow callous in wrong  suffer not however your delicacy for my family to make you forget what is due to yourself as well as to me the fear of shocking you led me just now to conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention the honor i have had in view is already known to many and in a very short time there are none will be ignorant of it that impudent young man morris had the effrontery to rally me upon my passion for you and though i reproved him with great asperity he followed me into a coffeehouse whither i went merely to avoid him there i forced myself to stay till i saw him engaged with a newspaper and then through various private streets and alleys i returned hither but judge my indignation when the moment i knocked at the door i perceived him again at my side  did he then see you come in  i angrily demanded what he meant by thus pursuing me he very submissively begged my pardon and said he had had a notion i should come back and had therefore only followed me to see if he was right i hesitated for an instant whether to chastise or confide in him but believing a few hours would make his impertinence immaterial i did neither  the door opened and i came in  he stopped but cecilia was too much shocked to answer him  now then said he weigh your objections against the consequences which must follow it is discovered i attended you in town it will be presumed i had your permission for such attendance to separate therefore now will be to no purpose with respect to that delicacy which makes you wish it it will be food for conjecture for enquiry for wonder almost while both our names are remembered and while to me it will bring the keenest misery in the severity of my disappointment it will cast over your own conduct a veil of mystery and obscurity wholly subversive of that unclouded openness that fair transparent ingenuousness by which it has hitherto been distinguished  alas then said she how dreadfully have i erred that whatever path i now take must lead me wrong  you overwhelm me with grief cried delvile by finding you thus distressed when i had hoped  oh cruel cecilia how different to this did i hope to have met you  all your doubts settled all your fears removed your mind perfectly composed and ready unreluctantly to ratify the promise with so much sweetness accorded me  where now are those hopes  where now    why will you not begone cried cecilia uneasily indeed it is too late to stay  tell me first cried he with great energy and let good mrs charlton speak too  ought not every objection to our union however potent to give way without further hesitation to the certainty that our intending it must become public who that hears of our meeting in london at such a season in such circumstances and at such hours    and why cried cecilia angrily do you mention them and yet stay  i must speak now answered he with quickness or lose forever all that is dear to me and add to the misery of that loss the heartpiercing reflection of having injured her whom of all the world i most love most value and most revere  and how injured cried cecilia half alarmed and half displeased surely i must strangely have lived to fear now the voice of calumny  if any one has ever returned he so lived as to dare defy it miss beverley is she but though safe by the established purity of your character from calumny there are other and scarce less invidious attacks from which no one is exempt and of which the refinement the sensibility of your mind will render you but the more susceptible ridicule has shafts and impertinence has arrows which though against innocence they may be levelled in vain have always the power of wounding tranquillity  struck with a truth which she could not controvert cecilia sighed deeply but spoke not  mr delvile is right said mrs charlton and though your plan my dear cecilia was certainly virtuous and proper when you set out from bury the purpose of your journey must now be made so public that it will no longer be judicious nor rational  delvile poured forth his warmest thanks for this friendly interposition and then strengthened by such an advocate reurged all his arguments with redoubled hope and spirit  cecilia disturbed uncertain comfortless could frame her mind to no resolution she walked about the room deliberated  determined  wavered and deliberated again delvile then grew more urgent and represented so strongly the various mortifications which must follow so tardy a renunciation of their intentions that terrified and perplexed and fearing the breach of their union would now be more injurious to her than its ratification she ceased all opposition to his arguments and uttered no words but of solicitation that he would leave her  i will cried he i will begone this very moment tell me but first you will think of what i have said and refer me not to your letter but deign yourself to pronounce my doom when you have considered if it may not be softened  to this she tacitly consented and elated with fresh rising hope he recommended his cause to the patronage of mrs charlton and then taking leave of cecilia i go he said though i have yet a thousand things to propose and to supplicate and though still in a suspense that my temper knows ill how to endure but i should rather be rendered miserable than happy in merely overpowering your reason by entreaty i leave you therefore to your own reflections yet remember  and refuse not to remember with some compunction that all chance all possibility of earthly happiness for me depends upon your decision  he then tore himself away  cecilia shocked at the fatigue she had occasioned her good old friend now compelled her to go to rest and dedicated the remaining part of the night to uninterrupted deliberation  it seemed once more in her power to be mistress of her destiny but the very liberty of choice she had so much coveted now attained appeared the most heavy of calamities since uncertain even what she ought to do she rather wished to be drawn than to lead rather desired to be guided than to guide she was to be responsible not only to the world but to herself for the whole of this momentous transaction and the terror of leaving either dissatisfied made independence burdensome and unlimited power a grievance  the happiness or misery which awaited her resolution were but secondary considerations in the present state of her mind her consent to a clandestine action she lamented as an eternal blot to her character and the undoubted publication of that consent as equally injurious to her fame neither retracting nor fulfilling her engagement could now retrieve what was past and in the bitterness of regret for the error she had committed she thought happiness unattainable for the remainder of her life  in this gloomy despondence passed the night her eyes never closed her determination never formed morning however came and upon something to fix was indespensable  she now therefore finally employed herself in briefly comparing the good with the evil of giving delvile wholly up or becoming his forever  in accepting him she was exposed to all the displeasure of his relations and which affected her most to the indignant severity of his mother but not another obstacle could be found that seemed of any weight to oppose him  in refusing him she was liable to the derision of the world to sneers from strangers and remonstrances from her friends to becoming a topic for ridicule if not for slander and an object of curiosity if not of contempt  the ills therefore that threatened her marriage though most afflicting were least disgraceful and those which awaited its breach if less serious were more mortifying  at length after weighing every circumstance as well as her perturbed spirits would permit she concluded that so late to reject him must bring misery without any alleviation while accepting him though followed by wrath and reproach left some opening for future hope and some prospect of better days  to fulfill therefore her engagement was her final resolution  chap ii an event scarce less unhappy in her decision than in her uncertainty and every way dissatisfied with her situation her views and herself cecilia was still so distressed and uncomfortable when delvile called the next morning that he could not discover what her determination had been and fearfully enquired his doom with hardly any hope of finding favor  but cecilia was above affectation and a stranger to art i would not sir she said keep you an instant in suspense when i am no longer in suspense myself i may have appeared trifling but i have been nothing less and you would readily exculpate me of caprice if half the distress of my irresolution was known to you even now when i hesitate no more my mind is so ill at ease that i could neither wonder nor be displeased should you hesitate in your turn  you hesitate no more cried he almost breathless at the sound of those words and is it possible  oh my cecilia  is it possible your resolution is in my favor  alas cried she how little is your reason to rejoice a dejected and melancholy gift is all you can receive  ere i take it then cried he in a voice that spoke joy pain and fear all at once in commotion tell me if your reluctance has its origin in me that i may rather even yet relinquish you than merely owe your hand to the selfishness of persecution  your pride said she half smiling has some right to be alarmed though i meant not to alarm it no it is with myself only i am at variance with my own weakness and want of judgment that i quarrel  in you i have all the reliance that the highest opinion of your honor and integrity can give me  this was enough for the warm heart of delvile not only to restore peace but to awaken rapture he was almost as wild with delight as he had before been with apprehension and poured forth his acknowledgements with so much fervor of gratitude that cecilia imperceptibly grew reconciled to herself and before she missed her dejection participated in his contentment  she quitted him as soon as she had power to acquaint mrs charlton with what had passed and assist in preparing her to accompany them to the altar while delvile flew to his new acquaintance mr singleton the lawyer to request him to supply the place of mr monckton in giving her away  all was now hastened with the utmost expedition and to avoid observation they agreed to meet at the church their desire of secresy however potent never urging them to wish the ceremony should be performed in a place less awful  when the chairs however came which were to carry the two ladies thither cecilia trembled and hung back the greatness of her undertaking the hazard of all her future happiness the disgraceful secresy of her conduct the expected reproaches of mrs delvile and the boldness and indelicacy of the step she was about to take all so forcibly struck and so painfully wounded her that the moment she was summoned to set out she again lost her resolution and regretting the hour that ever delvile was known to her she sunk into a chair and gave up her whole soul to anguish and sorrow  the good mrs charlton tried in vain to console her a sudden horror against herself had now seized her spirits which exhausted by long struggles could rally no more  in this situation she was at length surprised by delvile whose uneasy astonishment that she had failed in her appointment was only to be equalled by that with which he was struck at the sight of her tears he demanded the cause with the utmost tenderness and apprehension cecilia for some time could not speak and then with a deep sigh ah she cried mr delvile how weak are we all when unsupported by our own esteem how feeble how inconsistent how changeable when our courage has any foundation but duty  delvile much relieved by finding her sadness fprung not from any new affliction gently reproached her breach of promise and earnestly entreated her to repair it the clergyman cried he is waiting i have left him with mr singleton in the vestry no new objections have started and no new obstacles have intervened why then torment ourselves with discussing again the old ones which we have already considered till every possible argument upon them is exhausted tranquilize i conjure you your agitated spirits and if the truest tenderness the most animated esteem and the gratefullest admiration can soften your future cares and ensure your future peace every anniversary of this day will recompense my cecilia for every pang she now suffers  cecilia half soothed and half ashamed finding she had in fact nothing new to say or to object compelled herself to rise and penetrated by his solicitations endeavored to compose her mind and promised to follow him  he would not trust her however from his sight but seizing the very instant of her renewed consent he dismissed the chairs and ordering a hackneycoach preferred any risk to that of her again wavering and insisted upon accompanying her in it himself  cecilia had now scarce time to breathe before she found herself at the porch of  church delvile hurried her out of the carriage and then offered his arm to mrs charlton not a word was spoken by any of the party till they went into the vestry where delvile ordered cecilia a glass of water and having hastily made his compliments to the clergyman gave her hand to mr singleton who led her to the altar  the ceremony was now begun and cecilia finding herself past all power of retracting soon called her thoughts from wishing it and turned her whole attention to the awful service to which though she listened with reverence her full satisfaction in the object of her vows made her listen without terror but when the priest came to that solemn adjuration if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together a conscious tear stole into her eye and a sigh escaped from delvile that went to her heart but when the priest concluded the exhortation with let him now speak or else hereafter forever hold his peace a female voice at some distance called out in shrill accents i do  the ceremony was instantly stopped the astonished priest immediately shut up the book to regard the intended bride and bridegroom delvile started with amazement to see whence the sound proceeded and cecilia aghast and struck with horror faintly shriekt and caught hold of mrs charlton  the consternation was general and general was the silence though all of one accord turned round toward the place whence the voice issued a female form at the same moment was seen rushing from a pew who glided out of the church with the quickness of lightning  not a word was yet uttered every one seeming rooted to the spot on which he stood and regarding in mute wonder the place this form had crossed  delvile at length exclaimed what can this mean  did you not know the woman sir said the clergyman  no sir i did not even see her  nor you madam said he addressing cecilia  no sir she answered in a voice that scarce articulated the two syllables and changing color so frequently that delvile apprehensive she would faint flew to her calling out let me support you  she turned from him hastily and still holding by mrs charlton moved away from the altar  whither cried delvile fearfully following her whither are you going  she made not any answer but still though tottering as much from emotion as mrs charlton from infirmity she walked on  why did you stop the ceremony sir cried delvile impatiently speaking to the clergyman  no ceremony sir he returned could proceed with such an interruption  it has been wholly accidental cried he for we neither of us know the woman who could not have any right or authority for the prohibition then yet more anxiously pursuing cecilia why he continued do you thus move off  why leave the ceremony unfinished  mrs charlton what is it you are about  cecilia i beseech you return and let the service go on  cecilia making a motion with her hand to forbid his following her still silently proceeded though drawing along with equal difficulty mrs charlton and herself  this is insupportable cried delvile with vehemence turn i conjure you  my cecilia  my wife  why is it you thus abandon me  turn i implore you and receive my eternal vows  mrs charlton bring her back  cecilia you must not go    he now attempted to take her hand but shrinking from his touch in an emphatic but low voice she said yes sir i must  an interdiction such as this  for the world could i not brave it  she then made an effort to somewhat quicken her pace  where cried delvile half frantic where is this infamous woman this wretch who has thus wantonly destroyed me  and he rushed out of the church in pursuit of her  the clergyman and mr singleton who had hitherto been wondering spectators came now to offer their assistance to cecilia she declined any help for herself but gladly accepted their services for mrs charlton who thunderstruck by all that had past seemed almost robbed of her faculties mr singleton proposed calling a hackney coach she consented and they stopped for it at the church porch  the clergyman now began to enquire of the pewopener what she knew of the woman who she was and how she had got into the church she knew of her she answered nothing but that she had come in to early prayers and she supposed she had hid herself in a pew when they were over as she had thought the church entirely empty  an hackney coach now drew up and while the gentlemen were assisting mrs charlton into it delvile returned  i have pursued and enquired cried he in vain i can neither discover nor hear of her  but what is all this whither are you going  what does this coach do here  mrs charlton why do you get into it  cecilia what are you doing  cecilia turned away from him in silence the shock she had received took from her all power of speech while amazement and terror deprived her even of relief from tears she believed delvile to blame though she knew not in what but the obscurity of her fears served only to render them more dreadful  she was now getting into the coach herself but delvile who could neither brook her displeasure nor endure her departure forcibly caught her hand and called out you are mine you are my wife  i will part with you no more and go whithersoever you will i will follow and claim you  stop me not cried she impatiently though faintly i am sick i am ill already  if you detain me any longer i shall be unable to support myself  oh then rest on me cried he still holding her rest but upon me till the ceremony is over  you will drive me to despair and to madness if you leave me in this barbarous manner  a crowd now began to gather and the words bride and bridegroom reached the ears of cecilia who half dead with shame with fear and with distress hastily said you are determined to make me miserable and snatching away her hand which delvile at those words could no longer hold she threw herself into the carriage  delvile however jumped in after her and with an air of authority ordered the coachman to pall mall and then drew up the glasses with a look of fierceness at the mob  cecilia had neither spirits nor power to resist him yet offended by his violence and shocked to be thus publicly pursued by him her looks spoke a resentment far more mortifying than any verbal reproach  inhuman cecilia cried he passionately to desert me at the very altar  to cast me off at the instant the most sacred rites were uniting us  and then thus to look at me  to treat me with this disdain at a time of such distraction  to scorn me thus injuriously at the moment you unjustly abandon me    to how dreadful a scene said cecilia recovering from her consternation have you exposed me to what shame what indignity what irreparable disgrace  oh heaven cried he with horror if any crime any offense of mine has occasioned this fatal blow the whole world holds not a wretch so culpable as myself nor one who will sooner allow the justice of your rigor my veneration for you has ever equalled my affection and could i think it was through me you have suffered any indignity i should soon abhor myself as you seem to abhor me but what is it i have done how have i thus incensed you by what action by what guilt have i incurred this displeasure  whence cried she came that voice which still vibrates in my ear the prohibition could not be on my account since none to whom i am known have either right or interest in even wishing it  what an inference is this over me then do you conclude this woman had any power  here they stopped at the lodgings delvile handed both the ladies out cecilia eager to avoid his importunities and dreadfully disturbed hastily past him and ran up stairs but mrs charlton refused not his arm on which she lent till they reached the drawing room  cecilia then rang the bell for her servant and gave orders that a postchaise might be sent for immediately  delvile now felt offended in his turn but suppressing his vehemence he gravely and quietly said determined as you are to leave me indifferent to my peace and incredulous of my word deign at least before we part to be more explicit in your accusation and tell me if indeed it is possible you can suspect that the wretch who broke off the ceremony had ever from me received provocation for such an action  i know not what to suspect said cecilia where every thing is thus involved in obscurity but i must own i should have some difficulty to think those words the effect of chance or to credit that their speaker was concealed without design  you are right then madam cried he resentfully to discard me to treat me with contempt to banish me without repugnance since i see you believe me capable of duplicity and imagine i am better informed in this affair than i appear to be you have said i shall make you miserable  no madam no your happiness and misery depend not upon one you hold so worthless  on whatever they depend said cecilia i am too little at ease for discussion i would no more be daring than superstitious but none of our proceedings have prospered and since their privacy has always been contrary both to my judgment and my principles i know not how to repine at a failure i cannot think unmerited mrs charlton our chaise is coming you will be ready i hope to set off in it directly  delvile too angry to trust himself to speak now walked about the room and endeavored to calm himself but so little was his success that though silent till the chaise was announced when he heard that dreaded sound and saw cecilia steady in her purpose of departing he was so much shocked and afflicted that clasping his hands in a transport of passion and grief he exclaimed this then cecilia is your faith this is the felicity you bid me hope this is the recompense of my sufferings and the performance of your engagement  cecilia struck by these reproaches turned back but while she hesitated how to answer them he went on you are insensible to my misery and impenetrable to my entreaties a secret enemy has had power to make me odious in your sight though for her enmity i can assign no cause though even her existence was this morning unknown to me ever ready to abandon and most willing to condemn me you have more confidence in a vague conjecture than in all you have observed of the whole tenor of my character without knowing why you are disposed to believe me criminal without deigning to say wherefore you are eager to banish me your presence yet scarce could a consciousness of guilt itself wound me so forcibly so keenly as your suspecting i am guilty  again then cried cecilia shall i subject myself to a scene of such disgrace and horror no never  the punishment of my error shall at least secure its reformation yet if i merit your reproaches i deserve not your regard cease therefore to profess any for me or make them no more  show but to them cried he the smallest sensibility show but for me the most distant concern and i will try to bear my disappointment without murmuring and submit to your decrees as to those from which there is no appeal but to wound without deigning even to look at what you destroy  to shoot at random those arrows that are pointed with poison  to see them fasten on the heart and corrode its vital functions yet look on without compunction or turn away with cold disdain  oh where is the candor i thought lodged in cecilia where the justice the equity i believed a part of herself  after all that has past said cecilia sensibly touched by his distress i expected not these complaints nor that from me any assurances would be wanted yet if it will quiet your mind if it will better reconcile you to our separation    oh fatal prelude interrupted he what on earth can quiet my mind that leads to our separation  give to me no condescension with any such view  preserve your indifference persevere in your coldness triumph still in your power of inspiring those feelings you can never return  all every thing is more supportable than to talk of our separation  yet how cried she parted torn asunder as we have been how is it now to be avoided  trust in my honor show me but the confidence which i will venture to say i deserve and then will that union no longer be impeded which in future i am certain will never be repented  good heaven what a request faith so implicity would be frenzy  you doubt then my integrity you suspect    indeed i do not yet in a case of such importance what ought to guide me but my own reason my own conscience my own sense of right pain me not therefore with reproaches distress me no more with entreaties when i solemnly declare that no earthly consideration shall ever again make me promise you my hand while the terror of mrs delviles displeasure has possession of my heart and now adieu  you give me then up  be patient i beseech you and attempt not to follow me it is a step i cannot permit  not follow you and who has power to prevent me   i have sir if to incur my endless resentment is of any consequence to you  she then with an air of determined steadiness moved on mrs charlton assisted by the servants being already upon the stairs  o tyranny cried he what submission is it you exact  may i not even enquire into the dreadful mystery of this morning  yes certainly  and may i not acquaint you with it should it be discovered  i shall not be sorry to hear it adieu  she was now half way down the stairs when losing all forbearance he hastily flew after her and endeavoring to stop her called out if you do not hate and detest me  if i am not loathsome and abhorrent to you o quit me not thus insensibly  cecilia my beloved cecilia  speak to me at least one word of less severity look at me once more and tell me we part not forever  cecilia then turned round and while a starting tear showed her sympathetic distress said why will you thus oppress me with entreaties i ought not to gratify  have i not accompanied you to the altar  and can you doubt what i have thought of you   have thought  oh cecilia  is it then all over  pray suffer me to go quietly and fear not i shall go too happily suppress your own feelings rather than seek to awaken mine alas there is little occasion  oh mr delvile were our connection opposed by no duty and repugnant to no friends were it attended by no impropriety and carried on with no necessity of disguise  you would not thus charge me with indifference you would not suspect me of insensibility  oh no the choice of my heart would then be its glory and all i now blush to feel i should openly and with pride acknowledge  she then hurried to the chaise delvile pursuing her with thanks and blessings and gratefully assuring her as he handed her into it that he would obey all her injunctions and not even attempt to see her till he could bring her some intelligence concerning the mornings transaction  the chaise then drove off  chap iii a consternation the journey was melancholy and tedious mrs charlton extremely fatigued by the unusual hurry and exercise both of mind and body which she had lately gone through was obliged to travel very slowly and to lie upon the road cecilia however was in no haste to proceed she was going to no one she wished to see she was wholly without expectation of meeting with any thing that could give her pleasure the unfortunate expedition in which she had been engaged left her now nothing but regret and only promised her in future sorrow and mortification  mrs charlton after her return home still continued ill and cecilia who constantly attended her had the additional affliction of imputing her indisposition to herself every thing she thought conspired to punish the error she had committed her proceedings were discovered though her motives were unknown the delvile family could not fail to hear of her enterprise and while they attributed it to her temerity they would exult in its failure but chiefly hung upon her mind the unaccountable prohibition of her marriage whence that could proceed she was wholly without ability to divine yet her surmizes were not more fruitless than various at one moment she imagined it some frolic of morris at another some perfidy of monckton and at another an idle and unmeaning trick of some stranger to them all but none of these suppositions carried with them any air of probability morris even if he had watched their motions and pursued them to the church which his inquisitive impertinence made by no means impossible could yet hardly have had either time or opportunity to engage any woman in so extraordinary an undertaking mr monckton however averse to the connection she considered as a man of too much honor to break it off in a manner so alarming and disgraceful and mischief so wanton in any stranger seemed to require a share of unfeeling effrontery which could fall to the lot of so few as to make this suggestion unnatural and incredible  sometimes she imagined that delvile might formerly have been affianced to some woman who having accidentally discovered his intentions took this desperate method of rendering them abortive but this was a shortlived thought and speedily gave way to her esteem for his general character and her confidence in the firmness of his probity  all therefore was dark and mysterious conjecture was baffled and meditation was useless her opinions were unfixed and her heart was miserable she could only be steady in believing delvile as unhappy as herself and only find consolation in believing him also as blameless  three days passed thus without incident or intelligence her time wholly occupied in attending mrs charlton her thoughts all engrossed upon her own situation but upon the fourth day she was informed that a lady was in the parlour who desired to speak with her  she presently went down stairs  and upon entering the room perceived mrs delvile  seized with astonishment and fear she stopped short and looking aghast held by the door robbed of all power to receive so unexpected and unwelcome a visitor by an internal sensation of guilt mingled with a dread of discovery and reproach  mrs delvile addressing her with the coldest politeness said i fear i have surprised you i am sorry i had not time to acquaint you of my intention to wait upon you  cecilia then moving from the door faintly answered i cannot madam but be honored by your notice whenever you are pleased to confer it  they then sat down mrs delvile preserving an air the most formal and distant and cecilia half sinking with apprehensive dismay  after a short and illboding silence i mean not said mrs delvile to embarrass or distress you i will not therefore keep you in suspense of the purport of my visit i come not to make enquiries i come not to put your sincerity to any trial nor to torture your delicacy i dispense with all explanation for i have not one doubt to solve i know what has passed i know that my son loves you  not all her secret alarm nor all the perturbation of her fears had taught cecilia to expect so direct an attack nor enabled her to bear the shock of it with any composure she could not speak she could not look at mrs delvile she arose and walked to the window without knowing what she was doing  here however her distress was not likely to diminish for the first sight she saw was fidel who barked and jumped up at the window to lick her hands  good god fidel here exclaimed mrs delvile amazed  cecilia totally overpowered covered her glowing face with both her hands and sunk into a chair  mrs delvile for a few minutes was silent and then following her said imagine not i am making any discovery nor suspect me of any design to develop your sentiments that mortimer could love in vain i never believed that miss beverley possessing so much merit could be blind to it in another i never thought possible i mean not therefore to solicit any account or explanation but merely to beg your patience while i talk to you myself and your permission to speak to you with openness and truth  cecilia though relieved by this calmness from all apprehension of reproach found in her manner a coldness that convinced her of the loss of her affection and in the introduction to her business a solemnity that assured her what she should decree would be unalterable she uncovered her face to show her respectful attention but she could not raise it up and could not utter a word  mrs delvile then seated herself next her and gravely continued her discourse  miss beverley however little acquainted with the state of our family affairs can scarcely have been uninformed that a fortune such as hers seems almost all that family can desire nor can she have failed to observe that her merit and accomplishments have no where been more felt and admired the choice therefore of mortimer she could not doubt would have our sanction and when she honored his proposals with her favor she might naturally conclude she gave happiness and pleasure to all his friends  cecilia superior to accepting a palliation of which she selt herself undeserving now lifted up her head and forcing herself to speak said no madam i will not deceive you for i have never been deceived myself i presumed not to expect your approbation  though in missing it i have for ever lost my own  has mortimer then cried she with eagerness been strictly honorable has he neither beguiled nor betrayed you  no madam said she blushing i have nothing to reproach him with  then he is indeed my son cried mrs delvile with emotion had he been treacherous to you while disobedient to us i had indisputably renounced him  cecilia who now seemed the only culprit felt herself in a state of humiliation not to be borne she collected therefore all her courage and said i have cleared mr delvile permit me madam now to say something for myself  certainly you cannot oblige me more than by speaking without disguise  it is not in the hope of regaining your good opinion  that i see is lost  but merely    no not lost said mrs delvile but if once it was yet higher the fault was my own in indulging an expectation of perfection to which human nature is perhaps unequal  ah then thought cecilia all is over the contempt i so much feared is incurred and though it may be softened it can never be removed  speak then and with sincerity she continued all you wish me to hear and then grant me your attention in return to the purpose of my present journey  i have little madam answered the depressed cecilia to say you tell me you already know all that has past i will not therefore pretend to take any merit from revealing it i will only add that my consent to this transaction has made me miserable almost from the moment i gave it that i meant and wished to retract as soon as reflection pointed out to me my error and that circumstances the most perverse not blindness to propriety nor stubbornness in wrong led me to make at last that fatal attempt of which the recollection to my last hour must fill me with regret and shame  i wonder not said mrs delvile that in a situation where delicacy was so much less requisite than courage miss beverley should feel herself distressed and unhappy a mind such as hers could never err with impunity and it is solely from a certainty of her innate sense of right that i venture to wait upon her now and that i have any hope to influence her upon whose influence alone our whole family must in future depend shall i now proceed or is there any thing you wish to say first  no madam nothing  hear me then i beg of you with no predetermination to disregard me but with an equitable resolution to attend to reason and a candor that leaves an opening to conviction not easy indeed is such a task to a mind preoccupied with an intention to be guided by the dictates of inclination    you wrong me indeed madam interrupted cecilia greatly hurt my mind harbors no such intention it has no desire but to be guided by duty it is wretched with a consciousness of having failed in it i pine i sicken to recover my own good opinion i should then no longer feel unworthy of yours and whether or not i might be able to regain it i should at least lose this cruel depression that now sinks me in your presence  to regain it said mrs delvile were to exercise but half your power which at this moment enables you if such is your wish to make me think of you more highly than one human being ever thought of another do you condescend to hold this worth your while  cecilia started at the question her heart beat quick with struggling passions she saw the sacrifice which was to be required and her pride her affronted pride arose high to anticipate the rejection but the design was combated by her affections which opposed the indignant rashness and told her that one hasty speech might separate her from delvile for ever when this painful conflict was over of which mrs delvile patiently waited the issue she answered with much hesitation to regain your good opinion madam greatly truly as i value it  is what i now scarcely dare hope  say not so cried she since if you hope you cannot miss it i purpose to point out to you the means to recover it and to tell you how greatly i shall think myself your debtor if you refuse not to employ them  she stopped but cecilia hung back fearful of her own strength she dared venture at no professions yet how either to support or dispute her compliance she dreaded to think  i come to you then mrs delvile solemnly resumed in the name of mr delvile and in the name of our whole family a family as ancient as it is honorable as honorable as it is ancient consider me as its representative and hear in me its common voice common opinion and common address  my son the supporter of our house the sole guardian of its name and the heir of our united fortunes has selected you we know for the lady of his choice and so fondly has fixed upon you his affections that he is ready to relinquish us all in preference to subduing them to yourself alone then can we apply and i come to you    o hold madam hold interrupted cecilia whose courage now revived from resentment i know what you would say you come to tell me of your disdain you come to reproach my presumption and to kill me with your contempt there is little occasion for such a step i am depressed i am selfcondemned already spare me therefore this insupportable humiliation wound me not with your scorn oppress me not with your superiority i aim at no competition i attempt no vindication i acknowledge my own littleness as readily as you can despise it and nothing but indignity could urge me to defend it  believe me said mrs delvile i meant not to hurt or offend you and i am sorry if i have appeared to you either arrogant or assuming the peculiar and perilous situation of my family has perhaps betrayed me into offensive expressions and made me guilty myself of an ostentation which in others has often disgusted me ill indeed can we any of us bear the test of experiment when tried upon those subjects which call forth our particular propensities we may strive to be disinterested we may struggle to be impartial but self will still predominate still show us the imperfection of our natures and the narrowness of our souls yet acquit me i beg of any intentional insolence and imagine not that in speaking highly of my own family i mean to depreciate yours on the contrary i know it to be respectable i know too that were it the lowest in the kingdom the first might envy it that it gave birth to such a daughter  cecilia somewhat soothed by this speech begged her pardon for having interrupted her and she proceeded  to your family then i assure you whatever may be the pride of our own you being its offspring we would not object with your merit we are all well acquainted your character has our highest esteem and your fortune exceeds even our most sanguine desires strange at once and afflicting that not all these requisites for the satisfaction of prudence nor all these allurements for the gratification of happiness can suffice to fulfill or to silence the claims of either there are yet other demands to which we must attend demands which ancestry and blood call upon us aloud to ratify such claimants are not to be neglected with impunity they assert their rights with the authority of prescription they forbid us alike either to bend to inclination or stoop to interest and from generation to generation their injuries will call out for redress should their noble and long unsullied name be voluntarily consigned to oblivion  cecilia extremely struck by these words scarce wondered since so strong and so established were her opinions that the obstacle to her marriage though but one should be considered as insuperable  not therefore to your name are we averse she continued but simply to our own more partial to sink that indeed in any other were base and unworthy  what then must be the shock of my disappointment should mortimer delvile the darling of my hopes the last survivor of his house in whose birth i rejoiced as the promise of its support in whose accomplishments i gloried as the revival of its luster  should he should my son be the first to abandon it to give up the name he seemed born to make live and to cause in effect its utter annihilation  oh how should i know my son when an alien to his family how bear to think i had cherished in my bosom the betrayer of its dearest interests the destroyer of its very existence  cecilia scarce more afflicted than offended now hastily answered not for me madam shall he commit this crime not on my account shall he be reprobated by his family think of him therefore no more with any reference to me for i would not be the cause of unworthiness or guilt in him to be mistress of the universe  nobly said cried mrs delvile her eyes sparkling with joy and her cheeks glowing with pleasure now again do i know miss beverley now again see the refined the excellent young woman whose virtues taught me to expect the renunciation even of her own happiness when found to be incompatible with her duty  cecilia now trembled and turned pale she scarce knew herself what she had said but she found by mrs delviles construction of her words they had been regarded as her final relinquishing of her son she ardently wished to quit the room before she was called upon to confirm the sentence but she had not courage to make the effort nor to rise speak or move  i grieve indeed continued mrs delvile whose coldness and austerity were changed into mildness and compassion at the necessity i have been under to draw from you a concurrence so painful but no other resource was in my power my influence with mortimer whatever it may be i have not any right to try without obtaining your previous consent since i regard him myself as bound to you in honor and only to be released by your own virtuous desire i will leave you however for my presence i see is oppressive to you farewell and when you can forgive me i think you will  i have nothing madam said cecilia coldly to forgive you have only asserted your own dignity and i have nobody to blame but myself for having given you occasion  alas cried mrs delvile if worth and nobleness of soul on your part if esteem and tenderest affection on mine were all which that dignity which offends you requires how should i crave the blessing of such a daughter how rejoice in joining my son to excellence so like his own and ensuring his happiness while i stimulated his virtue  do not talk to me of affection madam said cecilia turning away from her whatever you had for me is past  even your esteem is gone  you may pity me indeed but your pity is mixed with contempt and i am not so abject as to find comfort from exciting it  o little cried mrs delvile looking at her with the utmost tenderness little do you see the state of my heart for never have you appeared to me so worthy as at this moment in tearing you from my son i partake all the wretchedness i give but your own sense of duty must something plead for the strictness with which i act up to mine  she then moved toward the door  is your carriage madam said cecilia struggling to disguise her inward anguish under an appearance of sullenness in waiting  mrs delvile then came back and holding out her hand while her eyes glistened with tears said to part from you thus frigidly while my heart so warmly admires you is almost more than i can endure oh gentlest cecilia condemn not a mother who is impelled to this severity who performing what she holds to be her duty thinks the office her bitterest misfortune who foresees in the rage of her husband and the resistance of her son all the misery of domestic contention and who can only secure the honor of her family by destroying its peace  you will not then give me your hand    cecilia who had affected not to see that she waited for it now coldly put it out distantly courtesying and seeking to preserve her steadiness by avoiding to speak mrs delvile took it and as she repeated her adieu affectionately pressed it to her lips cecilia starting and breathing short from increasing yet smothered agitation called out why why this condescension  pray  i entreat you madam    heaven bless you my love said mrs delvile dropping a tear upon the hand she still held heaven bless you and restore the tranquillity you so nobly deserve  ah madam cried cecilia vainly striving to repress any longer the tears which now forced their way down her cheeks why will you break my heart with this kindness why will you still compel me to love  when now i almost wish to hate you    no hate me not said mrs delvile kissing from her cheeks the tears that watered them hate me not sweetest cecilia though in wounding your gentle bosom i am almost detestable to myself even the cruel scene which awaits me with my son will not more deeply afflict me but adieu  i must now prepare for him  she then left the room but cecilia whose pride had no power to resist this tenderness ran hastily after her saying shall i not see you again madam  you shall yourself decide answered she if my coming will not give you more pain than pleasure i will wait upon you whenever you please  cecilia sighed and paused she knew not what to desire yet rather wished any thing to be done than quietly to sit down to uninterrupted reflection  shall i postpone quitting this place continued mrs delvile till tomorrow morning and will you admit me this afternoon should i call upon you again  i should be sorry said she still hesitating to detain you    you will rejoice me cried mrs delvile by bearing me in your sight  and she then went into her carriage  cecilia unfitted to attend her old friend and unequal to the task of explaining to her the cruel scene in which she had just been engaged then hastened to her own apartment her hitherto stifled emotions broke forth in tears and repinings her fate was finally determined and its determination was not more unhappy than humiliating she was openly rejected by the family whose alliance she was known to wish she was compelled to refuse the man of her choice though satisfied his affections were her own a misery so peculiar she found hard to support and almost bursting with conflicting passions her heart alternately swelled from offended pride and sunk from disappointed tenderness  chap iv a perturbation cecilia was still in this tempestuous state when a message was brought her that a gentleman was below stairs who begged to have the honor of seeing her she concluded he was delvile and the thought of meeting him merely to communicate what must so bitterly afflict him redoubled her distress and she went down in an agony of perturbation and sorrow  he met her at the door where before he could speak mr delvile she cried in a hurrying manner why will you come why will you thus insist upon seeing me in defiance of every obstacle and in contempt of my prohibition  good heavens cried he amazed whence this reproach did you not permit me to wait upon you with the result of my enquiries had i not your consent  but why do you look thus disturbed  your eyes are red  you have been weeping  oh my cecilia have i any share in your sorrow  those tears which never flow weakly tell me have they  has one of them been shed upon my account  and what cried she has been the result of your enquiries  speak quick for i wish to know  and in another instant i must be gone  how strange cried the astonished delvile is this language how strange are these looks what new has come to pass has any fresh calamity happened is there yet some evil which i do not expect  why will you not answer first cried she when i have spoken you will perhaps be less willing  you terrify you shock you amaze me what dreadful blow awaits me for what horror are you preparing me  that which i have just experienced and which tore you from me even at the foot of the altar still remains inexplicable still continues to be involved in darkness and mystery for the wretch who separated us i have never been able to discover  have you procured then no intelligence  no none though since we parted i have never rested a moment  make then no further enquiry for now all explanation would be useless that we were parted we know though why we cannot tell but that again we shall ever meet    she stopped her streaming eyes cast upwards and a deep sigh bursting from her heart  oh what cried delvile endeavoring to take her hand which she hastily withdrew from him what does this mean loveliest dearest cecilia my betrothed my affianced wife why flow those tears which agony only can wring from you why refuse me that hand which so lately was the pledge of your faith am i not the same delvile to whom so few days since you gave it why will you not open to him your heart why thus distrust his honor and repulse his tenderness oh why giving him such exquisite misery refuse him the smallest consolation  what consolation cried the weeping cecilia can i give alas it is not perhaps you who most want it    here the door was opened by one of the miss charltons who came into the room with a message from her grandmother requesting to see cecilia cecilia ashamed of being thus surprised with delvile and in tears waited not either to make any excuse to him or any answer to miss charlton but instantly hurried out of the room  not however to her old friend whom now less than ever she could meet but to her own apartment where a very short indulgence of grief was succeeded by the severest examination of her own conduct  a retrospection of this sort rarely brings much subject of exultation when made with the rigid sincerity of secret impartiality so much stronger is our reason than our virtue so much higher our sense of duty than our performance  all she had done she now repented all she had said she disapproved her conduct seldom equal to her notions of right was now infinitely below them and the reproaches of her judgment made her forget for a while the afflictions which had misled it  the sorrow to which she had openly given way in the presence of delvile though their total separation but the moment before had been finally decreed she considered as a weak effusion of tenderness injurious to delicacy and censurable by propriety his power over my heart cried she it were now indeed too late to conceal but his power over my understanding it is time to cancel i am not to be his  my own voice has ratified the renunciation and since i made it to his mother it must never without her consent be invalidated honor therefore to her and regard for myself equally command me to fly him till i cease to be thus affected by his sight  when delvile therefore sent up an entreaty that he might be again admitted into her presence she returned for answer that she was not well and could not see any body  he then left the house and in a few minutes she received the following note from him  to miss beverley you drive me from you cecilia tortured with suspense and distracted with apprehension  you drive me from you certain of my misery yet leaving me to bear it as i may i would call you unfeeling but that i saw you were unhappy i would reproach you with tyranny but that your eyes when you quitted me were swolen with weeping i go therefore i obey the harsh mandate since my absence is your desire and i will shut myself up at biddulphs till i receive your commands yet disdain not to reflect that every instant will seem endless while cecilia must appear to me unjust or wound my very soul by the recollection of her in sorrow  mortimer delvile   the mixture of fondness and resentment with which this letter was dictated marked so strongly the sufferings and disordered state of the writer that all the softness of cecilia returned when she perused it and left her not a wish but to lessen his inquietude by assurances of unalterable regard yet she determined not to trust herself in his sight certain they could only meet to grieve over each other and conscious that a participation of sorrow would but prove a reciprocation of tenderness calling therefore upon her duty to resist her inclination she resolved to commit the whole affair to the will of mrs delvile to whom though under no promise she now considered herself responsible desirous however to shorten the period of delviles uncertainty she would not wait till the time she had appointed to see his mother but wrote the following note to hasten their meeting  to the hon mrs delvile madam your son is now at bury shall i acquaint him of your arrival or will you announce it yourself inform me of your desire and i will endeavor to fulfill it as my own agent i regard myself no longer if as yours i can give pleasure or be of service i shall gladly receive your commands i have the honor to be  madam your most obedient servant cecilia beverley   when she had sent off this letter her heart was more at ease because reconciled with her conscience she had sacrificed the son she had resigned herself to the mother it now only remained to heal her wounded pride by suffering the sacrifice with dignity and to recover her tranquillity in virtue by making the resignation without repining  her reflections too growing clearer as the mist of passion was dispersed she recollected with confusion her cold and sullen behavior to mrs delvile that lady had but done what she had believed was her duty and that duty was no more than she had been taught to expect from her in the beginning of her visit and while doubtful of its success she had indeed been austere but the moment victory appeared in view she became tender affectionate and gentle her justice therefore condemned the resentment to which she had given way and she fortified her mind for the interview which was to follow by an earnest desire to make reparation both to mrs delvile and herself for that which was past  in this resolution she was not a little strengthened by seriously considering with herself the great abatement to all her possible happiness which must have been made by the humiliating circumstance of forcing herself into a family which held all connection with her as disgraceful she desired not to be the wife even of delvile upon such terms for the more she esteemed and admired him the more anxious she became for his honor and the less could she endure being regarded herself as the occasion of its diminution  now therefore her plan of conduct settled with calmer spirits though a heavy heart she attended upon mrs charlton but fearing to lose the steadiness she had just acquired before it should be called upon if she trusted herself to relate the decision which had been made she besought her for the present to dispense with the account and then forced herself into conversation upon less interesting subjects  this prudence had its proper effect and with tolerable tranquillity she heard mrs delvile again announced and waited upon her in the parlour with an air of composure  not so did mrs delvile receive her she was all eagerness and emotion she flew to her the moment she appeared and throwing her arms around her warmly exclaimed oh charming girl saver of our family preserver of our honor how poor are words to express my admiration how inadequate are thanks in return for such obligations as i owe you  you owe me none madam said cecilia suppressing a sigh on my side will be all the obligation if you can pardon the petulance of my behavior this morning  call not by so harsh a name answered mrs delvile the keenness of a sensibility by which you have yourself alone been the sufferer you have had a trial the most severe and however able to sustain it was impossible you should not feel it that you should give up any man whose friends solicit not your alliance your mind is too delicate to make wonderful but your generosity in submitting unasked the arrangement of that resignation to those for whose interest it is made and your high sense of honor in holding yourself accountable to me though under no tie and bound by no promise mark a greatness of mind which calls for reverence rather than thanks and which i never can praise half so much as i admire  cecilia who received this applause but as a confirmation of her rejection thanked her only by courtsying and mrs delvile having seated herself next her continued her speech  my son you have the goodness to tell me is here  have you seen him  yes madam answered she blushing but hardly for a moment  and he knows not of my arrival  no  i believe he certainly does not  sad then is the trial which awaits him and heavy for me the office i must perform do you expect to see him again  no  yes  perhaps  indeed i hardly    she stammered and mrs delvile taking her hand said tell me miss beverley why should you see him again  cecilia was thunderstruck by this question and coloring yet more deeply looked down but could not answer  consider continued mrs delvile the purpose of any further meeting your union is impossible you have nobly consented to relinquish all thoughts of it why then tear your own heart and torture his by an intercourse which seems nothing but an illjudged invitation to fruitless and unavailing sorrow  cecilia was still silent the truth of the expostulation her reason acknowledged but to assent to its consequence her whole heart refused  the ungenerous triumph of little female vanity said mrs delvile is far i am sure from your mind of which the enlargement and liberality will rather find consolation from lessening than from imbittering his sufferings speak to me then and tell me honestly judiciously heartily tell me  will it not be wiser and more right to avoid rather than seek an object which can only give birth to regret an interview which can excite no sensations but of misery and sadness  cecilia then turned pale she endeavored to speak but could not she wished to comply  yet to think she had seen him for the last time to remember how abruptly she had parted from him and to fear she had treated him unkindly  these were obstacles which opposed her concurrence though both judgment and propriety demanded it  can you then said mrs delvile after a pause can you wish to see mortimer merely to behold his grief can you desire he should see you only to sharpen his affliction at your loss  o no cried cecilia to whom this reproof restored speech and resolution i am not so despicable i am not i hope so unworthy  i will be ruled by you wholly i will commit to you every thing  yet once perhaps  no more    ah my dear miss beverley to meet confessedly for once  what were that but planting a dagger in the heart of mortimer what were it but infusing poison into your own  if you think so madam said she i had better  i will certainly   she sighed stammered and stopped  hear me cried mrs delvile and rather let me try to convince than persuade you were there any possibility by argument by reflection or even by accident to remove the obstacles to our connection then would it be well to meet for then might discussion turn to account and an interchange of sentiments be productive of some happy expedient but here    she hesitated and cecilia shocked and ashamed turned away her face and cried i know madam what you would say  here all is over and therefore    yet suffer me interrupted she to be explicit since we speak upon this matter now for the last time here then i say where not one doubt remains where all is finally though not happily decided what can an interview produce mischief of every sort pain horror and repining to mortimer you may think it would be kind and grant it to his prayers as an alleviation of his misery mistaken notion nothing could so greatly augment it all his passions would be raised all his prudence would be extinguished his soul would be torn with resentment and regret and force only would part him from you when previously he knew that parting was to be eternal to yourself    talk not madam of me cried the unhappy cecilia what you say of your son is sufficient and i will yield    yet hear me proceeded she and believe me not so unjust as to consider him alone you also would be an equal though a less stormy sufferer you fancy at this moment that once more to meet him would soothe your uneasiness and that to take of him a farewell would soften the pain of the separation how false such reasoning how dangerous such consolation acquainted ere you meet that you were to meet him no more your heart would be all softness and grief and at the very moment when tenderness should be banished from your intercourse it would bear down all opposition of judgment spirit and dignity you would hang upon every word because every word would seem the last every look every expression would be rivetted in your memory and his image in this parting distress would be painted upon your mind in colors that would eat into its peace and perhaps never be erased  enough enough said cecilia i will not see him  i will not even desire it  is this compliance or conviction is what i have said true or only terrifying  both both i believe indeed the conflict would have overpowered me  i see you are right  and i thank you madam for saving me from a scene i might so cruelly have rued  oh daughter of my mind cried mrs delvile rising and embracing her noble generous yet gentle cecilia what tie what connection could make you more dear to me who is there like you who half so excellent so open to reason so ingenuous in error so rational so just so feeling yet so wise  you are very good said cecilia with a forced serenity and i am thankful that your resentment for the past obstructs not your lenity for the present  alas my love how shall i resent the past when i ought myself to have foreseen this calamity and i should have foreseen it had i not been informed you were engaged and upon your engagement built our security else had i been more alarmed for my own admiration would have bid me look forward to my sons you were just indeed the woman he had least chance to resist you were precisely the character to seize his very soul to a softness the most fatally alluring you join a dignity which rescues from their own contempt even the most humble of your admirers you seem born to have all the world wish your exaltation and no part of it murmur at your superiority were any obstacle but this insuperable one in the way should nobles nay should princes offer their daughters to my election i would reject without murmuring the most magnificent proposals and take in triumph to my heart my sons nobler choice  oh madam cried cecilia talk not to me thus  speak not such flattering words  ah rather scorn and upbraid me tell me you despise my character my family and my connections  load load me with contempt but do not thus torture me with approbation  pardon me sweetest girl if i have awakened those emotions you so wisely seek to subdue may my son but emulate your example and my pride in his virtue shall be the solace of my affliction for his misfortunes  she then tenderly embraced her and abruptly took her leave  cecilia had now acted her part and acted it to her own satisfaction but the curtain dropped when mrs delvile left the house nature resumed her rights and the sorrow of her heart was no longer disguised or repressed some faint ray of hope had till now broke through the gloomiest cloud of her misery and secretly flattered her that its dispersion was possible though distant but that ray was extinct that hope was no more she had solemnly promised to banish delvile her sight and his mother had absolutely declared that even the subject had been discussed for the last time  mrs charlton impatient of some explanation of the mornings transactions soon sent again to beg cecilia would come to her cecilia reluctantly obeyed for she feared increasing her indisposition by the intelligence she had to communicate she struggled therefore to appear to her with tolerable calmness and in briefly relating what had passed forbore to mingle with the narrative her own feelings and unhappiness  mrs charlton heard the account with the utmost concern she accused mrs delvile of severity and even of cruelty she lamented the strange accident by which the marriage ceremony had been stopped and regretted that it had not again been begun as the only means to have rendered ineffectual the present fatal interposition  but the grief of cecilia however violent induced her not to join in this regret she mourned only the obstacle which had occasioned the separation and not the incident which had merely interrupted the ceremony convinced by the conversations in which she had just been engaged of mrs delviles inflexibility she rather rejoiced than repined that she had put it to no nearer trial sorrow was all she felt for her mind was too liberal to harbor resentment against a conduct which she saw was dictated by a sense of right and too ductile and too affectionate to remain unmoved by the personal kindness which had softened the rejection and the many marks of esteem and regard which had shown her it was lamented though considered as indispensable  how and by whom this affair had been betrayed to mrs delvile she knew not but the discovery was nothing less than surprising since by various unfortunate accidents it was known to so many and since in the horror and confusion of the mysterious prohibition to the marriage neither delvile nor herself had thought of even attempting to give any caution to the witnesses of that scene not to make it known an attempt however which must almost necessarily have been unavailing as the incident was too extraordinary and too singular to have any chance of suppression  during this conversation one of the servants came to inform cecilia that a man was below to enquire if there was no answer to the note he had brought in the forenoon  cecilia greatly distressed knew not upon what to resolve that the patience of delvile should be exhausted she did not indeed wonder and to relieve his anxiety was now almost her only wish she would therefore instantly have written to him confessed her sympathy in his sufferings and besought him to endure with fortitude an evil which was no longer to be withstood but she was uncertain whether he was yet acquainted with the journey of his mother to bury and having agreed to commit to her the whole management of the affair she feared it would be dishonorable to take any step in it without her concurrence she returned therefore a message that she had yet no answer ready  in a very few minutes delvile called himself and sent up an earnest request for permission to see her  here at least she had no perplexity an interview she had given her positive word to refuse and therefore without a moments hesitation she bid the servant inform him she was particularly engaged and sorry it was not in her power to see any company  in the greatest perturbation he left the house and immediately wrote to her the following lines  to miss beverley i entreat you to see me if only for an instant i entreat i implore you to see me mrs charlton may be present  all the world if you wish it may be present  but deny me not admission i supplicate i conjure you  i will call in an hour in that time you may have finished your present engagement i will otherwise wait longer and call again you will not i think turn me from your door and till i have seen you i can only live in its vicinity  m d   the man who brought this note waited not for any answer  cecilia read it in an agony of mind inexpressible she saw by its style how much delvile was irritated and her knowledge of his temper made her certain his irritation proceeded from believing himself illused she ardently wished to appease and to quiet him and regretted the necessity of appearing obdurate and unfeeling even more at that moment than the separation itself to a mind priding in its purity and animated in its affections few sensations can excite keener misery than those by which an apprehension is raised of being thought worthless or ungrateful by the objects of our chosen regard to be deprived of their society is less bitter to be robbed of our own tranquillity by any other means is less afflicting  yet to this it was necessary to submit or incur the only penalty which to such a mind would be more severe selfreproach she had promised to be governed by mrs delvile she had nothing therefore to do but obey her  yet to turn as he expressed himself from the door a man who but for an incident the most incomprehensible would now have been sole master of herself and her actions seemed so unkind and so tyrannical that she could not endure to be within hearing of his repulse she begged therefore the use of mrs charltons carriage and determined to make a visit to mrs harrel till delvile and his mother had wholly quitted bury she was not indeed quite satisfied in going to the house of mr arnott but she had no time to weigh objections and knew not any other place to which still greater might not be started  she wrote a short letter to mrs delvile acquainting her with her purpose and its reason and repeating her assurances that she would be guided by her implicitly and then embracing mrs charlton whom she left to the care of her granddaughters she got into a chaise accompanied only by her maid and one man and horse and ordered the postilion to drive to mr arnotts  chap v a cottage the evening was already far advanced and before she arrived at the end of her little journey it was quite dark when they came within a mile of mr arnotts house the postilion in turning too suddenly from the turnpike to the crossroad overset the carriage the accident however occasioned no other mischief than delaying their proceeding and cecilia and her maid were helped out of the chaise unhurt the servants assisted by a man who was walking upon the road began lifting it up and cecilia too busy within to be attentive to what passed without disregarded what went forward till she heard her footman call for help she then hastily advanced to enquire what was the matter and found that the passenger who had lent his aid had by working in the dark unfortunately slipped his foot under one of the wheels and so much hurt it that without great pain he could not put it to the ground  cecilia immediately desired that the sufferer might be carried to his own home in the chaise while she and the maid walked on to mr arnotts attended by her servant on horseback  this little incident proved of singular service to her upon first entering the house mrs harrel was at supper with her brother and hearing the voice of cecilia in the hall hastened with the extremest surprise to enquire what had occasioned so late a visit followed by mr arnott whose amazement was accompanied with a thousand other sensations too powerful for speech cecilia unprepared with any excuse instantly related the adventure she had met with on the road which quieted their curiosity by turning their attention to her personal safety they ordered a room to be prepared for her entreated her to go to rest with all speed and postpone any further account till the next day with this request she most gladly complied happy to be spared the embarrasment of enquiry and rejoiced to be relieved from the fatigue of conversation  her night was restless and miserable to know how delvile would bear her flight was never a moment from her thoughts and to hear whether he would obey or oppose his mother was her incessant wish she was fixed however to be faithful in refusing to see him and at least to suffer nothing new from her own enterprise or fault  early in the morning mrs harrel came to see her she was eager to learn why after invitations repeatedly refused she was thus suddenly arrived without any and she was still more eager to talk of herself and relate the weary life she led thus shut up in the country and confined to the society of her brother  cecilia evaded giving any immediate answer to her questions and mrs harrel happy in an opportunity to rehearse her own complaints soon forgot that she had asked any and in a very short time was perfectly though imperceptibly contented to be herself the only subject upon which they conversed  but not such was the selfishness of mr arnott and cecilia when she went down to breakfast perceived with the utmost concern that he had passed a night as sleepless as her own a visit so sudden so unexpected and so unaccountable from an object that no discouragement could make him think of with indifference had been a subject to him of conjecture and wonder that had revived all the hopes and the fears which had lately though still unextinguished lain dormant the enquiries however which his sister had given up he ventured not to renew and thought himself but too happy in her presence whatever might be the cause of her visit  he perceived however immediately the sadness that hung upon her mind and his own was redoubled by the sight mrs harrel also saw that she looked ill but attributed it to the fatigue and fright of the preceding evening well knowing that a similar accident would have made her ill herself or fancy that she was so  during breakfast cecilia sent for the postilion to enquire of him how the man had fared whose goodnatured assistance in their distress had been so unfortunate to himself he answered that he had turned out to be a day labourer who lived about half a mile off and then partly to gratify her own humanity and partly to find any other employment for herself and friends than uninteresting conversation she proposed that they should all walk to the poor mans habitation and offer him some amends for the injury he had received this was readily assented to and the postilion directed them whither to go  the place was a cottage situated upon a common they entered it without ceremony and found a clean looking woman at work  cecilia enquired for her husband and was told that he was gone out to daylabour  i am very glad to hear it returned she i hope then he has got the better of the accident he met with last night  it was not him madam said the woman met with the accident it was john  there he is working in the garden  to the garden then they all went and saw him upon the ground weeding  the moment they approached he arose and without speaking began to limp for he could hardly walk away  i am sorry master said cecilia that you are so much hurt have you had any thing put to your foot  the man made no answer but still turned away from her a glance however of his eye which the next instant he fixed upon the ground startled her she moved round to look at him again  and perceived mr belfield  good god she exclaimed but seeing him still retreat she recollected in a moment how little he would be obliged to her for betraying him and suffering him to go on turned back to her party and led the way again into the house  as soon as the first emotion of her surprise was over she enquired how long john had belonged to this cottage and what was his way of life  the woman answered he had only been with them a week and that he went out to daylabour with her husband  cecilia then finding their stay kept him from his employment and willing to save him the distress of being seen by mr arnott or mrs harrel proposed their returning home she grieved most sincerely at beholding in so melancholy an occupation a young man of such talents and abilities she wished much to assist him and began considering by what means it might be done when as they were walking from the cottage a voice at some distance called out madam miss beverley and looking round to her utter amazement she saw belfield endeavoring to follow her  she instantly stopped and he advanced his hat in his hand and his whole air indicating he sought not to be disguised  surprised at this sudden change of behavior she then stepped forward to meet him accompanied by her friends but when they came up to each other she checked her desire of speaking to leave him fully at liberty to make himself known or keep concealed  he bowed with a look of assumed gaiety and ease but the deep scarlet that tinged his whole face manifested his internal confusion and in a voice that attempted to sound lively though its tremulous accents betrayed uneasiness and distress he exclaimed with a forced smile is it possible miss beverley can deign to notice a poor miserable daylabourer such as i am how will she be justified in the beau monde when even the sight of such a wretch ought to fill her with horror henceforth let hystericks be blown to the winds and let nerves be discarded from the female vocabulary since a lady so young and fair can stand this shock without hartshorn or fainting  i am happy answered cecilia to find your spirits so good yet my own i must confess are not raised by seeing you in this strange situation  my spirits cried he with an air of defiance never were they better never so good as at this moment strange as seems my situation it is all that i wish i have found out at last the true secret of happiness that secret which so long i pursued in vain but which always eluded my grasp till the instant of despair arrived when slackening my pace i gave it up as a phantom go from me i cried i will be cheated no more thou airy bubble thou fleeting shadow i will live no longer in thy sight since thy beams dazzle without warming me mankind seems only composed as matter for thy experiments and i will quit the whole race that thy delusions may be presented to me no more  this romantic flight which startled even cecilia though acquainted with his character gave to mrs harrel and mr arnott the utmost surprise his appearance and the account they had just heard of him having by no means prepared them for such sentiments or such language  is then this great secret of happiness said cecilia nothing at last but total seclusion from the world  no madam answered he it is labor with independence  cecilia now wished much to ask some explanation of his affairs but was doubtful whether he would gratify her before mrs harrel and mr arnott and hurt to keep him standing though he leant upon a stick she told him therefore she would at present detain him no longer but endeavor again to see him before she quitted her friends  mr arnott then interfered and desired his sister would entreat miss beverley to invite whom she pleased to his house  cecilia thanked him and instantly asked belfield to call upon her in the afternoon  no madam no cried he i have done with visits and society i will not so soon break through a system with much difficulty formed when all my future tranquillity depends upon adhering to it the worthlessness of mankind has disgusted me with the world and my resolution in quitting it shall be immovable as its baseness  i must not venture then said cecilia to enquire    enquire madam interrupted he with quickness what you please there is nothing i will not answer to you  to this lady to this gentleman to any and to every body what can i wish to conceal where i have nothing to gain or to lose when first indeed i saw you i involuntarily shrunk a weak shame for a moment seized me i felt fallen and debased and i wished to avoid you but a little recollection brought me back to my senses and where cried i is the disgrace of exercising for my subsistence the strength with which i am endued and why should i blush to lead the life which uncorrupted nature first prescribed to man  well then said cecilia more and more interested to hear him if you will not visit us will you at least permit us to return with you to some place where you can be seated  i will with pleasure cried he go to any place where you may be seated yourselves but for me i have ceased to regard accommodation or inconvenience  they then all went back to the cottage which was now empty the woman being out at work  will you then sir said cecilia give me leave to enquire whether lord vannelt is acquainted with your retirement and if it will not much surprise and disappoint him  lord vannelt cried he haughtily has no right to be surprised i would have quitted his house if no other not even this cottage had a roof to afford me shelter  i am sorry indeed to hear it said cecilia i had hoped he would have known your value and merited your regard  illusage answered he is as hard to relate as to be endured there is commonly something pitiful in a complaint and though oppression in a general sense provokes the wrath of mankind the investigation of its minuter circumstances excites nothing but derision those who give the offense by the worthy few may be hated but those who receive it by the world at large will be despised conscious of this i disdained making any appeal myself the only sufferer i had a right to be the only judge and shaking off the base trammels of interest and subjection i quitted the house in silent indignation not choosing to remonstrate where i desired not to be reconciled  and was there no mode of life said cecilia to adopt but living with lord vannelt or giving up the whole world  i weighed every thing maturely answered he before i made my determination and i found it so much the most eligible that i am certain i can never repent it i had friends who would with pleasure have presented me to some other nobleman but my whole heart revolted against leading that kind of life and i would not therefore idly rove from one great man to another adding ill will to disgrace and pursuing hope in defiance of common sense no when i quitted lord vannelt i resolved to give up patronage for ever  i retired to private lodgings to deliberate what next could be done i had lived in many ways i had been unfortunate or imprudent in all the law i had tried but its rudiments were tedious and disgusting the army too but there found my mind more fatigued with indolence than my body with action general dissipation had then its turn but the expense to which it led was ruinous and selfreproach baffled pleasure while i pursued it i have even  yes there are few things i have left untried  i have even  for why now disguise it    he stopped and colored but in a quicker voice presently proceeded  trade also has had its share in my experiments for that in truth i was originally destined  but my education had ill suited me to such a destination and the traders first maxim i reversed in lavishing when i ought to have accumulated  what then remained for me to run over again the same irksome round i had not patience and to attempt any thing new i was unqualified money i had none my friends i could bear to burden no longer a fortnight i lingered in wretched irresolution  a simple accident at the end of it happily settled me i was walking one morning in hyde park forming a thousand plans for my future life but quarrelling with them all when a gentleman met me on horseback from whom at my lord vannelts i had received particular civilities i looked another way not to be seen by him and the change in my dress since i left his lordships made me easily pass unnoticed he had rode on however but a few yards before by some accident or mismanagement he had a fall from his horse forgetting all my caution i flew instantly to his assistance he was bruised but not otherwise hurt i helped him up and he leant upon my arm in my haste of enquiring how he had fared i called him by his name he knew me but looked surprised at my appearance he was speaking to me however with kindness when seeing some gentlemen of his acquaintance gallopping up to him he hastily disengaged himself from me and instantly beginning to recount to them what had happened he sedulously looked another way and joining his new companions walked off without taking further notice of me for a moment i was almost tempted to trouble him to come back but a little recollection told me how ill he deserved my resentment and bid me transfer it for the future from the pitiful individual to the worthless community  here finished my deliberation the disgust to the world which i had already conceived this little incident confirmed i i saw it was only made for the great and the rich  poor therefore and low what had i to do in it i determined to quit it for ever and to end every disappointment by crushing every hope  i wrote to lord vannelt to send my trunks to my mother i wrote to my mother that i was well and would soon let her hear more i then paid off my lodgings and shaking the dust from my feet bid a long adieu to london and committing my route to chance strole on into the country without knowing or caring which way  my first thought was simply to seek retirement and to depend for my future repose upon nothing but a total seclusion from society but my slow method of traveling gave me time for reflection and reflection soon showed me the error of this notion  guilt cried i may indeed be avoided by solitude but will misery will regret will deep dejection of mind no they will follow more assiduously than ever for what is there to oppose them where neither business occupies the time nor hope the imagination where the past has left nothing but resentment and the future opens only to a dismal uninteresting void no stranger to life i knew human nature could not exist on such terms still less a stranger to books i respected the voice of wisdom and experience in the first of moalists and most enlightened of men dr johnson and reading the letter of cowley i saw the vanity and absurdity of panting after solitude life of cowley p      i sought not therefore a cell but since i purposed to live for myself i determined for myself also to think servility of imitation has ever been as much my scorn as servility of dependence i resolved therefore to strike out something new and no more to retire as every other man had retired than to linger in the world as every other man had lingered  the result of all you now fee i found out this cottage and took up my abode in it i am here out of the way of all society yet avoid the great evil of retreat having nothing to do i am constantly not capriciously employed and the exercise which benefits my health imperceptibly raises my spirits in despite of adversity i am removed from all temptation i have scarce even the power to do wrong i have no object for ambition for repining i have no time  i have found out i repeat the true secret of happiness labor with independence  he stopped and cecilia who had listened to this narrative with a mixture of compassion admiration and censure was too much struck with its singularity to be readily able to answer it her curiosity to hear him had sprung wholly from her desire to assist him and she had expected from his story to gather some hint upon which her services might be offered but none had occurred he professed himself fully satisfied with his situation and though reason and probability contradicted the profession she could not venture to dispute it with any delicacy or prudence  she thanked him therefore for his relation with many apologies for the trouble she had given him and added i must not express my concern for misfortunes which you seem to regard as conducive to your contentment nor remonstrate at the step you have taken since you have been led to it by choice not necessity but yet you must pardon me if i cannot help hoping i shall some time see you happier according to the common however vulgar ideas of the rest of the world  no never never i am sick of mankind not from theory but experience and the precautions i have taken against mental fatigue will secure me from repentance or any desire of change for it is not the active but the indolent who weary it is not the temperate but the pampered who are capricious  is your sister sir acquainted with this change in your fortune and opinions  poor girl no she and her unhappy mother have borne but too long with my enterprises and misfortunes even yet they would sacrifice whatever they possess to enable me to play once more the game so often lost but i will not abuse their affection nor suffer them again to be slaves to my caprices nor dupes to their own delusive expectations i have sent them word i am happy i have not yet told them how or where i fear much the affliction of their disappointment and for a while shall conceal from them my situation which they would fancy was disgraceful and grieve at as cruel  and is it not cruel said cecilia is labor indeed so sweet and can you seriously derive happiness from what all others consider as misery  not sweet answered he in itself but sweet most sweet and salutary in its effects when i work i forget all the world my projects for the future my disappointments from the past mental fatigue is overpowered by personal i toil till i require rest and that rest which nature not luxury demands leads not to idle meditation but to sound heavy necessary sleep i awake the next morning to the same thoughtexiling business work again till my powers are exhausted and am relieved again at night by the same healthrecruiting insensibility  and if this cried cecilia is the life of happiness why have we so many complaints of the sufferings of the poor and why so eternally do we hear of their hardships and distress  they have known no other life they are strangers therefore to the felicity of their lot had they mingled in the world fed high their fancy with hope and looked forward with expectation of enjoyment had they been courted by the great and offered with profusion adulation for their abilities yet even when starving been offered nothing else  had they seen an attentive circle wait all its entertainment from their powers yet found themselves forgotten as soon as out of sight and perceived themselves avoided when no longer buffoons  oh had they known and felt provocations such as these how gladly would their resentful spirits turn from the whole unfeeling race and how would they respect that noble and manly labor which at once disentangles them from such subjugating snares and enables them to fly the ingratitude they abhor without the contrast of vice virtue unloved may be lovely without the experience of misery happiness is simply a dull privation of evil  and are you so content cried cecilia with your present situation as even to think it offers you reparation for your past sufferings  content repeated he with energy o more than content i am proud of my present situation i glory in showing to the world i glory still more in showing to myself that those whom i cannot but despise i will not scruple to defy and that where i have been treated unworthily i will scorn to be obliged  but will you pardon me said cecilia should i ask again why in quitting lord vannelt you concluded no one else worthy a trial  because it was less my lord vannelt madam than my own situation that disgusted me for though i liked not his behavior i found him a man too generally esteemed to flatter myself better usage would await me in merely changing my abode while my station was the same i believe indeed he never meant to offend me but i was offended the more that he should think me an object to receive indignity without knowing it to have had this pointed out to him would have been at once mortifying and vain for delicacy like taste can only partially be taught and will always be superficial and erring where it is not innate those wrongs which though too trifling to resent are too humiliating to be borne speech can convey no idea of the soul must feel or the understanding can never comprehend them  but surely said cecilia though people of refinement are rare they yet exist why then remove yourself from the possibility of meeting with them  must i run about the nation cried he proclaiming my distress and describing my temper telling the world that though dependent i demand respect as well as assistance and publishing to mankind that though poor i will accept no gifts if offered with contumely who will listen to such an account who will care for my misfortunes but as they may humble me to his service who will hear my mortifications but to say i deserve them what has the world to do with my feelings and peculiarities i know it too well to think calamity will soften it i need no new lessons to instruct me that to conquer affliction is more wise than to relate it  unfortunate as you have been said cecilia i cannot wonder at your asperity but yet it is surely no more than justice to acknowledge that hardheartedness to distress is by no means the fault of the present times on the contrary it is scarce sooner made known then every one is ready to contribute to its relief  and how contribute cried he by a paltry donation of money yes the man whose only want is a few guineas may indeed obtain them but he who asks kindness and protection whose oppressed spirit calls for consolation even more than his ruined fortune for repair how is his struggling foul if superior to his fate to brook the ostentation of patronage and the insolence of condescension yes yes the world will save the poor beggar who is starving but the fallen wretch who will not cringe for his support may consume in his own wretchedness without pity and without help  cecilia now saw that the wound his sensibility had received was too painful for argument and too recent immediately to be healed she forbore therefore to detain him any longer but expressing her best wishes without venturing to hint at her services she arose and they all took their leave  belfield hastening as they went to return to the garden where looking over the hedge as they passed they saw him employed again in weeding with the eagerness of a man who pursues his savourite occupation  cecilia half forgot her own anxieties and sadness in the concern which she felt for this unfortunate and extraordinary young man she wished much to devise some means for drawing him from a life of such hardship and obscurity but what to a man thus jealous in honor thus scrupulous in delicacy could she propose without more risk of offense than probability of obliging his account had indeed convinced her how much he stood in need of assistance but it had shown her no less how fastidious he would be in receiving it  nor was she wholly without fear that an earnest solicitude to serve him his youth talents and striking manners considered might occasion even in himself a misconstruction of her motives such as she already had given birth to in his forward and partial mother  the present therefore all circumstances weighed seemed no season for her liberality which she yet resolved to exert the first moment it was unopposed by propriety  chap vi a contest the rest of the day was passed in discussing this adventure but in the evening cecilias interest in it was all sunk by the reception of the following letter from mrs delvile  to miss beverley i grieve to interrupt the tranquillity of a retirement so judiciously chosen and i lament the necessity of again calling to trial the virtue of which the exertion though so captivating is so painful but alas my excellent young friend we came not hither to enjoy but to suffer and happy only are those whose sufferings have neither by folly been sought nor by guilt been merited but arising merely from the imperfection of humanity have been resisted with fortitude or endured with patience  i am informed of your virtuous steadiness which corresponds with my expectations while it excites my respect all further conflict i had hoped to have saved you and to the triumph of your goodness i had trusted for the recovery of your peace but mortimer has disappointed me and our work is still unfinished  he avers that he is solemnly engaged to you and in pleading to me his honor he silences both expostulation and authority from your own words alone will he acknowledge his dismission and notwithstanding my reluctance to impose upon you this task i cannot silence or quiet him without making the request  for a purpose such as this can you then admit us can you bear with your own lips to confirm the irrevocable decision you will feel i am sure for the unfortunate mortimer and it was earnestly my desire to spare you the sight of his affliction yet such is my confidence in your prudence that since i find him bent upon seeing you i am not without hope that from witnessing the greatness of your mind the interview may rather calm than inflame him  this proposal you will take into consideration and if you are able upon such terms to again meet my son we will wait upon you together where and when you will appoint but if the gentleness of your nature will make the effort too severe for you scruple not to decline it for mortimer when he knows your pleasure will submit to it as he ought  adieu most amiable and but too lovely cecilia whatever you determine be sure of my concurrence for nobly have you earned and ever must you retain the esteem the affection and the gratitude of  augusta delvile   alas cried cecilia when shall i be at rest when cease to be persecuted by new conflicts oh why must i so often so cruelly though so reluctantly reject and reprove the man who of all men i wish to accept and to please  but yet though repining at this hard necessity she hesitated not a moment in complying with mrs delviles request and immediately sent an answer that she would meet her the next morning at mrs charltons  she then returned to the parlour and apologized to mrs harrel and mr arnott for the abruptness of her visit and the suddenness of her departure mr arnott heard her in silent dejection and mrs harrel used all the persuasion in her power to prevail with her to stay her presence being some relief to her solitude but finding it ineffectual she earnestly pressed her to hasten her entrance into her own house that their absence might be shortened and their meeting more sprightly  cecilia passed the night in planning her behavior for the next day she found how much was expected from her by mrs delvile who had even exhorted her to decline the interview if doubtful of her own strength delviles firmness in insisting the refusal should come directly from herself surprised gratified and perplexed her in turn she had imagined that from the moment of the discovery he would implicitly have submitted to the award of a parent at once so reverenced and so beloved and how he had summoned courage to contend with her she could not conjecture yet that courage and that contention astonished not more than they soothed her since from her knowledge of his filial tenderness she considered them as the most indubitable proofs she had yet received of the fervor and constancy of his regard for her but would he when she had ratified the decision of his mother forbear all further struggle and for ever yield up all pretensions to her this was the point upon which her uncertainty turned and the ruling subject of her thoughts and meditation  to be steady however herself be his conduct what it might was invariably her intention and was all her ambition yet earnestly she wished the meeting over for she dreaded to see the sorrow of delvile and she dreaded still more the susceptibility of her own heart  the next morning to her great concern mr arnott was waiting in the hall when she came down stairs and so much grieved at her departure that he handed her to the chaise without being able to speak to her and hardly heard her thanks and compliments but by recollection after she was gone  she arrived at mrs charltons very early and found her old friend in the same state she had left her she communicated to her the purpose of her return and begged she would keep her grand daughters up stairs that the conference in the parlour might be uninterrupted and unheard  she then made a forced and hasty breakfast and went down to be ready to receive them the came not till eleven oclock and the time of her waiting was passed in agonies of expectation  at length they were announced and at length they entered the room  cecilia with her utmost efforts for courage could hardly stand to receive them they came in together but mrs delvile advancing before her son and endeavoring so to stand as to intercept his view of her with the hope that in a few instants her emotion would be less visible said in the most soothing accents what honor miss beverley does us by permitting this visit i should have been sorry to have left suffolk without the satisfaction of again seeing you and my son sensible of the high respect he owes you was most unwilling to be gone before he had paid you his devoirs  cecilia courtsied but depressed by the cruel task which awaited her had no power to speak and mrs delvile finding she still trembled made her sit down and drew a chair next to her  mean while delvile with an emotion far more violent because wholly unrestrained waited impatiently till the ceremonial of the reception was over and then approaching cecilia in a voice of perturbation and resentment said in this presence at least i hope i may be heard though my letters have been unanswered my visits refused though inexorably you have flown me    mortimer interrupted mrs delvile forget not that what i have told you is irrevocable you now meet miss beverley for no other purpose than to give and to receive a mutual release of all tie or engagement with each other  pardon me madam cried he this is a condition to which i have never assented i come not to release but to claim her i am hers and hers wholly i protest it in the face of the world the time therefore is now past for the sacrifice which you demand since scarce are you more my mother than i consider her as my wife  cecilia amazed at this dauntless declaration now almost lost her fear in her surprise while mrs delvile with an air calm though displeased answered this is not a point to be at present discussed and i had hoped you knew better what was due to your auditors i only consented to this interview as a mark of your respect for miss beverley to whom in propriety it belongs to break off this unfortunate connection  cecilia who at this call could no longer be silent now gathered fortitude to say whatever tie or obligation may be supposed to depend upon me i have already relinquished and i am now ready to declare    that you wholly give me up interrupted delvile is that what you would say  oh how have i offended you how have i merited a displeasure that can draw upon me such a sentence  answer speak to me cecilia what is it i have done  nothing sir said cecilia confounded at this language in the presence of his mother you have done nothing  but yet    yet what  have you conceived to me an aversion has any dreadful and horrible antipathy succeeded to your esteem  tell tell me without disguise do you hate do you abhor me  cecilia sighed and turned away her head and mrs delvile indignantly exclaimed what madness and absurdity i scarce know you under the influence of such irrational violence why will you interrupt miss beverley in the only speech you ought to hear from her why at once oppress her and irritate me by words of more passion than reason go on charming girl finish what so wisely so judiciously you were beginning and then you shall be released from this turbulent persecution  no madam she must not go on cried delvile if she does not utterly abhor me i will not suffer her to go on  pardon pardon me cecilia but your too exquisite delicacy is betraying not only my happiness but your own once more therefore i conjure you to hear me and then if deliberately and unbiassed you renounce me i will never more distress you by resisting your decree  cecilia abashed and changing color was silent and he proceeded  all that has past between us the vows i have offered you of faith constancy and affection the consent i obtained from you to be legally mine the bond of settlement i have had drawn up and the high honor you conferred upon me in suffering me to lead you to the altar  all these particulars are already known to so many that the least reflection must convince you they will soon be concealed from none tell me then if your own fame pleads not for me and if the scruples which lead you to refuse by taking another direction will not with much more propriety urge nay enjoin you to accept me  you hesitate at least  o miss beverley i see in that hesitation    nothing nothing cried she hastily and checking her rising irresolution there is nothing for you to see but that every way i now turn i have rendered myself miserable  mortimer said mrs delvile seized with terror as she penetrated into the mental yielding of cecilia you have now spoken to miss beverley and unwilling as i am to obtrude upon her our difference of sentiment it is necessary since she has heard you that i also should claim her attention  first let her speak cried delvile who in her apparent wavering built new hopes first let her answer what she has already deigned to listen to  no first let her hear cried mrs delvile for so only can she judge what answer will reflect upon her most honor  then solemnly turning to cecilia she continued you see here miss beverley a young man who passionately adores you and who forgets in his adoration friends family and connections the opinions in which he has been educated the honor of his house his own former views and all his primitive sense of duty both public and private  a passion built on such a defalcation of principle renders him unworthy your acceptance and not more ignoble for him would be a union which would blot his name from the injured stock whence he sprung than indelicate for you who upon such terms ought to despise him  heavens madam exclaimed delvile what a speech  o never cried cecilia rising may i hear such another indeed madam there is no occasion to probe me so deeply for i would not now enter your family for all that the whole world could offer me  at length then madam cried delvile turning reproachfully to his mother are you satisfied is your purpose now answered and is the dagger you have transfixed in my heart sunk deep enough to appease you  o could i draw it out cried mrs delvile and leave upon it no stain of ignominy with what joy should my own bosom receive it to heal the wound i have most compulsatorily inflicted  were this excellent young creature portionless i would not hesitate in giving my consent every claim of interest would be overbalanced by her virtues and i would not grieve to see you poor where so conscious you were happy but here to concede would annihilate every hope with which hitherto i have looked up to my son  let us now then madam said cecilia break up this conference i have spoken i have heard the decree is past and therefore    you are indeed an angel cried mrs delvile rising and embracing her and never can i reproach my son with what has past when i consider for what an object the sacrifice was planned you cannot be unhappy you have purchased peace by the exercise of virtue and the close of every day will bring to you a reward in the sweets of a selfapproving mind  but we will part since you think it right i do wrong to occasion any delay  no we will not part cried delvile with increasing vehemence if you force me madam from her you will drive me to distraction what is there in this world that can offer me a recompense and what can pride even to the proudest afford as an equivalent her perfections you acknowledge her greatness of mind is like your own she has generously given me her heart  oh sacred and fascinating charge shall i after such a deposite consent to an eternal separation repeal repeal your sentence my cecilia let us live to ourselves and our consciences and leave the vain prejudices of the world to those who can be paid by them for the loss of all besides  is this conflict then said mrs delvile to last forever oh end it mortimer finish it and make me happy she is just and will forgive you she is nobleminded and will honor you fly then at this critical moment for in flight alone is your safety and then will your father see the son of his hopes and then shall the fond blessings of your idolizing mother soothe all your affliction and soften all your regret  oh madam cried delvile for mercy for humanity forbear this cruel supplication  nay more than supplication you have my commands commands you have never yet disputed and misery tenfold misery will follow their disobedience hear me mortimer for i speak prophetically i know your heart i know it to be formed for rectitude and duty or destined by their neglect to repentance and horror  delvile struck by these words turned suddenly from them both and in gloomy despondence walked to the other end of the room mrs delvile perceived the moment of her power and determined to pursue the blow taking therefore the hand of cecilia while her eyes sparkled with the animation of reviving hope see she cried pointing to her son see if i am deceived can he bear even the suggestion of future contrition think you when it falls upon him he will support it better no he will sink under it and you pure as you are of mind and steadfast in principle what would your chance be of happiness with a man who never erring till he knew you could never look at you without regret be his fondness what it might  oh madam cried the greatly shocked cecilia let him then see me no more  take take him all to yourself forgive console him i will not have the misery of involving him in repentance nor of incurring the reproaches of the mother he so much reverences  exalted creature cried mrs delvile tenderness such as this would confer honor upon a monarch then calling out exultingly to her son see she added how great a woman can act when stimulated by generosity and a just sense of duty follow then at least the example you ought to have led and deserve my esteem and love or be content to forego them  and can i only deserve them said delvile in a tone of the deepest anguish by a compliance to which not merely my happiness but my reason must be sacrificed what honor do i injure that is not factitious what evil threatens our union that is not imaginary in the general commerce of the world it may be right to yield to its prejudices but in matters of serious importance it is weakness to be shackled by scruples so frivolous and it is cowardly to be governed by the customs we condemn religion and the laws of our country should then alone be consulted and where those are neither opposed nor infringed we should hold ourselves superior to all other considerations  mistaken notions said mrs delvile and how long do you flatter yourself this independent happiness would endure how long could you live contented by mere selfgratification in defiance of the censure of mankind the renunciation of your family and the curses of your father  the curses of my father repeated he starting and shuddering o no he could never be so barbarous  he could said she steadily nor do i doubt but he would if now however you are affected by the prospect of his disclaiming you think but what you will feel when first forbid to appear before either of us and think of your remorse for involving miss beverley in such disgrace  o speak not such words cried he with agonizing earnestness to disgrace her  to be banished by you  present not i conjure you such scenes to my imagination  yet would they be unavoidable continued she nor have i said to you all blinded as you now are by passion your nobler feelings are only obscured not extirpated think then how they will all rise in revenge of your insulted dignity when your name becomes a stranger to your ears and you are first saluted by one so meanly adopted    hold hold madam interrupted he this is more than i can bear  heavens still continued she disregarding his entreaty what in the universe can pay you for that first moment of indignity think of it well ere you proceed and anticipate your sensations lest the shock should wholly overcome you how will the blood of your wronged ancestors rise into you guilty cheeks and how will your heart throb with secret shame and reproach when wished joy upon your marriage by the name of mr beverley  delvile stung to the soul attempted not any answer but walked about the room in the utmost disorder of mind cecilia would have retired but feared irritating him to some extravagance and mrs delvile looking after him added for myself i would still see for i should pity your wife  but never would i behold my son when sunk into an object of compassion  it shall not be cried he in a transport of rage cease cease to distract me  be content madam  you have conquered  then you are my son cried she rapturously embracing him now i know again my mortimer now i see the fair promise of his upright youth and the flattering completion of my maternal expectations  cecilia finding all thus concluded desired nothing so much as to congratulate them on their reconciliation but having only said let me too   her voice failed her she stopped short and hoping she had been unheard would have glided out of the room  but delvile penetrated and tortured yet delighted at this sensibility broke from his mother and seizing her hand exclaimed oh miss beverley if you are not happy    i am i am cried she with quickness let me pass  and think no more of me  that voice  those looks   cried he still holding her they speak not serenity  oh if i have injured your peace  if that heart which pure as angels deserves to be as sacred from sorrow through my means or for my sake suffers any diminution of tranquillity    none none interrupted she with precipitation  i know well cried he your greatness of soul and if this dreadful sacrifice gives lasting torture only to myself  if of your returning happiness i could be assured  i would struggle to bear it  you may be assured of it cried she with reviving dignity i have no right to expect escaping all calamity but while i share the common lot i will submit to it without repining  heaven then bless and hovering angels watch you cried he and letting go her hand he ran hastily out of the room  oh virtue how bright is thy triumph exclaimed mrs delvile flying up to cecilia and folding her in her arms noble incomparable young creature i knew not that so much worth was compatible with human frailty  but the heroism of cecilia in losing its object lost its force she sighed she could not speak tears gushed into her eyes and kissing mrs delviles hand with a look that showed her inability to converse with her she hastened though scarce able to support herself away with intention to shut herself up in her own apartment and mrs delvile who perceived that her utmost fortitude was exhausted opposed not her going and wisely forebore to increase her emotion by following her even with her blessings  but when she came into the hall she started and could proceed no further for there she beheld delvile who in too great agony to be seen had stopped to recover some composure before he quitted the house  at the first sound of an opening door he was hastily escaping but perceiving cecilia and discerning her situation he more hastily turned back saying is it possible  to me were you coming  she shook her head and made a motion with her hand to say no and would then have gone on  you are weeping cried he you are pale  oh miss beverley is this your happiness  i am very well   cried she not knowing what she answered i am quite well  pray go  i am very   her words died away inarticulated  oh what a voice is that exclaimed he it pierces my very soul  mrs delvile now came to the parlour door and looked aghast at the situation in which she saw them cecilia again moved on and reached the stairs but tottered and was obliged to cling to the banisters  o suffer me to support you cried he you are not able to stand  whither is it you would go  any where  i dont know   answered she in faltering accents but if you would leave me i should be well  and turning from him she walked again toward the parlour finding by her shaking frame the impossibility of getting unaided up the stairs  give me your hand my love said mrs delvile cruelly alarmed by this return and the moment they reentered the parlour she said impatiently to her son mortimer why are you not gone  he heard her not however his whole attention was upon cecilia who sinking into a chair hid her face against mrs delvile but reviving in a few moments and blushing at the weakness she had betrayed she raised her head and with an assumed serenity said i am better  much better  i was rather sick  but it is over and now if you will excuse me i will go to my own room  she then arose but her knees trembled and her head was giddy and again seating herself she forced a faint smile and said perhaps i had better keep quiet  can i bear this cried delvile no it shakes all my resolution  loveliest and most beloved cecilia forgive my rash declaration which i here retract and forswear and which no false pride no worthless vanity shall again surprise from me  raise then your eyes    hotheaded young man interrupted mrs delvile with an air of haughty displeasure if you cannot be rational at least be silent miss beverley we will both leave him  shame and her own earnestness now restored some strength to cecilia who read with terror in the looks of mrs delvile the passions with which she was agitated and instantly obeyed her by rising but her son who inherited a portion of her own spirit rushed between them both and the door and exclaimed stay madam stay i cannot let you go i see your intention i see your dreadful purpose you will work upon the feelings of miss beverley you will extort from her a promise to see me no more  oppose not my passing cried mrs delvile whose voice face and manner spoke the increasing disturbance of her soul i have but too long talked to you in vain i must now take some better method for the security of the honor of my family  this moment appeared to delvile decisive and casting off in desperation all timidity and restraint he suddenly sprang forward and snatching the hand of cecilia from his mother he exclaimed i cannot i will not give her up  nor now madam nor ever  i protest it most solemnly i affirm it by my best hopes i swear it by all that i hold sacred  grief and horror next to frenzy at a disappointment thus unexpected and thus peremptory rose in the face of mrs delvile who striking her hand upon her forehead cried my brain is on fire and rushed out of the room  cecilia had now no difficulty to disengage herself from delvile who shocked at the exclamation and confounded by the sudden departure of his mother hastened eagerly to pursue her she had only flown into the next parlour but upon following her thither what was his dread and his alarm when he saw her extended upon the floor her face hands and neck all covered with blood great heaven he exclaimed prostrating himself by her side what is it you have done  where are you wounded  what direful curse have you denounced against your son  not able to speak she angrily shook her head and indignantly made a motion with her hand that commanded him from her sight  cecilia who had followed though half dead with terror had yet the presence of mind to ring the bell a servant came immediately and delvile starting up from his mother ordered him to fetch the first surgeon or physician he could find  the alarm now brought the rest of the servants into the room and mrs delvile suffered herself to be raised from the ground and seated in a chair she was still silent but showed a disgust to any assistance from her son that made him deliver her into the hands of the servants while in speechless agony he only looked on and watched her  neither did cecilia though forgetting her own sorrow and no longer sensible of personal weakness venture to approach her uncertain what had happened she yet considered herself as the ultimate cause of this dreadful scene and feared to risk the effect of the smallest additional emotion  the servant returned with a surgeon in a few minutes cecilia unable to wait and hear what he would say glided hastily out of the room and delvile in still greater agitation followed her quick into the next parlour but having eagerly advanced to speak to her he turned precipitately about and hurrying into the hall walked in hasty steps up and down it without courage to enquire what was passing  at length the surgeon came out delvile flew to him and stopped him but could ask no question his countenance however rendered words unnecessary the surgeon understood him and said the lady will do very well she has burst a blood vessel but i think it will be of no consequence she must be kept quiet and easy and upon no account suffered to talk or to use any exertion  delvile now let him go and flew himself into a corner to return thanks to heaven that the evil however great was less than he had at first apprehended he then went into the parlour to cecilia eagerly calling out heaven be praised my mother has not voluntarily cursed me  o now then cried cecilia once more make her bless you the violence of her agitation has already almost destroyed her and her frame is too weak for this struggle of contending passions  go to her then and calm the tumult of her spirits by acquiescing wholly in her will and being to her again the son she thinks she has lost  alas said he in a tone of the deepest dejection i have been preparing myself for that purpose and waited but your commands to finally determine me  let us both go to her instantly said cecilia the least delay may be fatal  she now led the way and approaching mrs delvile who faint and weak was seated upon an arm chair and resting her head upon the shoulder of a maid servant said lean dearest madam upon me and speak not but hear us  she then took the place of the maid and desired her and the other servants to go out of the room delvile advanced but his mothers eye recovering at his sight its wanted fire darted upon him a glance of such displeasure that shuddering with the apprehension of inflaming again those passions which threatened her destruction he hastily sunk on one knee and abruptly exclaimed look at me with less abhorrence for i come but to resign myself to your will  mine also cried cecilia that will shall be you need not speak it we know it and here solemnly we promise that we will separate for ever  revive then my mother said delvile rely upon our plighted honors and think only of your health for your son will never more offend you  mrs delvile much surprised and strongly affected held out her hand to him with a look of mingled compassion and obligation and dropping her head upon the bosom of cecilia who with her other arm she pressed toward her she burst into an agony of tears  go go sir said cecilia cruelly alarmed you have said all that is necessary leave mrs delvile now and she will be more composed  delvile instantly obeyed and then his mother whose mouth still continued to fill with blood though it gushed not from her with the violence it had begun was prevailed upon by the prayers of cecilia to consent to be conveyed into her room and as her immediate removal to another house might be dangerous she complied also though very reluctantly with her urgent entreaties that she would take entire possession of it till the next day  this point gained cecilia left her to communicate what had past to mrs charlton but was told by one of the servants that mr delvile begged first to speak with her in the next room  she hesitated for a moment whether to grant this request but recollecting it was right to acquaint him with his mothers intention of staying all night she went to him  how indulgent you are cried he in a melancholy voice as she opened the door i am now going post to dr lyster whom i shall entreat to come hither instantly but i am fearful of again disturbing my mother and must therefore rely upon you to acquaint her what is become of me  most certainly i have begged her to remain here to night and i hope i shall prevail with her to continue with me till dr lysters arrival after which she will doubtless be guided either in staying longer or removing elsewhere by his advice  you are all goodness said he with a deep sigh and how i shall support  but i mean not to return hither at least not to this house  unless indeed dr lysters account should be alarming i leave my mother therefore to your kindness and only hope only entreat that your own health  your own peace of mind  neither by attendance upon her  by anxiety  by pity for her son    he stopped and seemed gasping for breath cecilia turned from him to hide her emotion and he proceeded with a rapidity of speech that showed his terror of continuing with her any longer and his struggle with himself to be gone the promise you have made in both our names to my mother i shall hold myself bound to observe i see indeed that her reason or her life would fall the sacrifice of further opposition of myself therefore it is no longer time to think  i take of you no leave  i cannot yet i would fain tell you the high reverence  but it is better to say nothing    much better cried cecilia with a forced and faint smile lose not therefore an instant but hasten to this good dr lyster  i will answered he going to the door but there stopping and turning round one thing i should yet he added wish to say  i have been impetuous violent unreasonable  with shame and with regret i recollect how impetuous and how unreasonable i have persecuted where i ought in silence to have submitted i have reproached where i ought in candor to have approved and in the vehemence with which i have pursued you i have censured that very dignity of conduct which has been the basis of my admiration my esteem my devotion but never can i forget and never without fresh wonder remember the sweetness with which you have borne with me even when most i offended you for this impatience this violence this inconsistency i now most sincerely beg your pardon and if before i go you could so far condescend as to pronounce my forgiveness with a lighter heart i think i should quit you  do not talk of forgiveness said cecilia you have never offended me i always knew  always was sure  always imputed   she stopped unable to proceed  deeply penetrated by her apparent distress he with difficulty restrained himself from falling at her feet but after a moments pause and recollection he said i understand the generous indulgence you have shown me an indulgence i shall ever revere and ever grieve to have abused i ask you not to remember me  far far happier do i wish you than such a remembrance could make you but i will pain the humanity of your disposition no longer you will tell my mother  but no matter  heaven preserve you my angelic cecilia  miss beverley i mean  heaven guide protect and bless you and should i see you no more should this be the last sad moment    he paused but presently recovering himself added may i hear at least of your tranquillity for that alone can have any chance to quiet or repress the anguish i feel here  he then abruptly retreated and ran out of the house  cecilia for a while remained almost stupefied with sorrow she forgot mrs delvile she forgot mrs charlton she forgot her own design of apologizing to one or assisting the other she continued in the posture in which he had left her quite without motion and almost without sensibility  chap vii a message from this lethargy of sadness cecilia was soon however awakened by the return of the surgeon who had brought with him a physician to consult upon mrs delviles situation terror for the mother once more drove the son from her thoughts and she waited with the most apprehensive impatience to hear the result of the consultation the physician declined giving any positive opinion but having written a prescription only repeated the injunction of the surgeon that she should be kept extremely quiet and on no account be suffered to talk  cecilia though shocked and frighened at the occasion was yet by no means sorry at an order which thus precluded all conversation unfitted for it by her own misery she was glad to be relieved from all necessity of imposing upon herself the irksome task of finding subjects for discourse to which she was wholly indifferent while obliged with sedulity to avoid those by which alone her mind was occupied  the worthy mrs charlton heard the events of the morning with the utmost concern but charged her granddaughters to assist her young friend in doing the honors of her house to mrs delvile while she ordered another apartment to be prepared for cecilia to whom she administered all the consolation her friendly zeal could suggest  cecilia however unhappy had too just a way of thinking to indulge in selfish grief where occasion called her to action for the benefit of others scarce a moment therefore now did she allow to sorrow and herself but assiduously bestowed the whole of her time upon her two sick friends dividing her attention according to their own desire or convenience without consulting or regarding any choice of her own choice indeed she had none she loved mrs charlton she revered mrs delvile the warmest wish with which her heart glowed was the recovery of both but too deep was her affliction to receive pleasure from either  two days passed thus during which the constancy of her attendance which at another time would have fatigued her proved the only relief she was capable of receiving mrs delvile was evidently affected by her vigilant tenderness but seemed equally desirous with herself to make use of the prohibition to speech as an excuse for uninterrupted silence she enquired not even after her son though the eagerness of her look toward the door whenever it was opened showed either a hope or an apprehension that he might enter cecilia wished to tell her whither he was gone but dreaded trusting her voice with his name and their silence after a while seemed so much by mutual consent that she had soon as little courage as she had inclination to break it  the arrival of dr lyster gave her much satisfaction for upon him rested her hopes of mrs delviles reestablishment he sent for her down stairs to enquire whether he was expected and hearing that he was not desired her to announce him as the smallest emotion might do mischief  she returned up stairs and after a short preparation said your favorite dr lyster madam is come and i shall be much the happier for having you under his care  dr lyster cried she who sent for him  i believe  i fancy  mr delvile fetched him  my son  is he here then  no  he went the moment he left you for dr lyster  and dr lyster is come by himself  does he write to you  no indeed  he writes not  he comes not  dearest madam be satisfied he will do neither to me ever more  exemplary young man cried she in a voice hardly audible how great is his loss  unhappy mortimer  illfated and illrewarded  she sighed and said no more but this short conversation the only one which had passed between them since her illness agitated her so much that dr lyster who now came up stairs found her in a state of trembling and weakness that both alarmed and surprised him cecilia glad of an opportunity to be gone left the room and sent by dr lysters desire for the physician and surgeon who had already attended  after they had been some time with their patient they retired to a consultation and when it was over dr lyster waited upon cecilia in the parlour and assured her he had no apprehension of danger for mrs delvile though for another week he added i would have her continue your patient as she is not yet fit to be removed but pray mind that she is kept quiet let nobody go near her not even her own son by the way he is waiting for me at the inn so i will just speak again to his mother and be gone  cecilia was well pleased by this accidental information to learn both the anxiety of delvile for his mother and the steadiness of his forbearance for himself when dr lyster came down stairs again i shall stay he said till tomorrow but i hope she will be able in another week to get to bristol in the mean time i shall leave her i see with an excellent nurse but my good young lady in your care of her dont neglect yourself i am not quite pleased with your looks though it is but an old fashioned speech to tell you so  what have you been doing to yourself  nothing said she a little embarrassed but had you not better have some tea  why yes i think i had  but what shall i do with my young man  cecilia understood the hint but colored and made no answer  he is waiting for me he continued at the inn however i never yet knew the young man i would prefer to a young woman so if you will give me some tea here i shall certainly jilt him  cecilia instantly rang the bell and ordered tea  well now said he remember the sin of this breach of appointment lies wholly at your door i shall tell him you laid violent hands on me and if that is not enough to excuse me i shall desire he will try whether he could be more of a stoic with you himself  i think i must unorder the tea said she with what gaiety she could assume if i am to be responsible for any mischief from your drinking it  no no you shall not be off now but pray would it be quite out of rule for you to send and ask him to come to us  why i believe  i think   said she stammering it is very likely he may be engaged  well well i dont mean to propose any violent incongruity you must excuse my blundering i understand but little of the etiquette of young ladies it is a science too intricate to be learned without more study than we plodding men of business can well spare time for however when i have done writing prescriptions i will set about reading them provided you will be my instructress  cecilia though ashamed of a charge in which prudery and affectation were implied was compelled to submit to it as either to send for delvile or explain her objections was equally impossible the miss charltons therefore joined them and they went to tea  just as they had done a note was delivered to dr lyster see here cried he when he had read it what a fine thing it is to be a young man why now mr mortimer understands as much of all this etiquette as you ladies do yourselves for he only writes a note even to ask how his mother does  he then put it into cecilias hand  to dr lyster tell me my dear sir how you have found my mother i am uneasy at your long stay and engaged with my friend biddulph or i should have followed you in person  m d   so you see continued the doctor i need not do penance for engaging myself to you when this young gentleman can find such good entertainment for himself  cecilia who well knew the honorable motive of delviles engagement with difficulty forbore speaking in his vindication dr lyster immediately began an answer but before he had finished it called out now as i am told you are a very good young woman i think you can do no less than assist me to punish this gay spark for playing the macaroni when he aught to visit his sick mother  cecilia much hurt for delvile and much confused for herself looked abashed but knew not what to answer  my scheme continued the doctor is to tell him that as he has found one engagement for tea he may find another for supper but that as to me i am better disposed of for you insist upon keeping me to yourself come what says etiquette may i treat myself with this puff  certainly said cecilia endeavoring to look pleased if you will favor us with your company miss charltons and myself will think the puffing should rather be ours than yours  that then said the doctor will not answer my purpose for i mean the puff to be my own or how do i punish him so suppose i tell him i shall not only sup with three young ladies but be invited to a tete a tete with one of them into the bargain  the young ladies only laughed and the dr finished his note and sent it away and then turning gayly to cecilia come he said why dont you give me this invitation surely you dont mean to make me guilty of perjury  cecilia but little disposed for pleasantry would gladly now have dropped the subject but dr lyster turning to the miss charltons said young ladies i call you both to witness if this is not very bad usage this young woman has connived at my writing a downright falsehood and all the time took me in to believe it was a truth the only way i can think of to cure her of such frolics is for both of you to leave us together and so make her keep her word whether she will or no  the miss charltons took the hint and went away while cecilia who had not at all suspected he meant seriously to speak with her remained extremely perplexed to think what he had to say  mrs delvile cried he continuing the same air of easy good humor though i allowed her not to speak to me above twenty words took up near ten of them to tell me that you had behaved to her like an angel why so she ought cried i what else was she sent for here to look so like one i charged her therefore to take all that as a thing of course and to prove that i really think what i say i am now going to make a trial of you that if you are any thing less will induce you to order some of your men to drive me into the street the truth is i have had a little commission given me which in the first place i know not how to introduce and which in the second as far as i can judge appears to be absolutely superfluous  cecilia now felt uneasy and alarmed and begged him to explain himself he then dropped the levity with which he had begun the discourse and after a grave yet gentle preparation expressive of his unwillingness to distress her and his firm persuasion of her uncommon worthiness he acquainted her that he was no stranger to her situation with respect to the delvile family  good god cried she blushing and much amazed and who    i knew it said he from the moment i attended mr mortimer in his illness at delvilecastle he could not conceal from me that the seat of his disorder was his mind and i could not know that without readily conjecturing the cause when i saw who was his fathers guest and when i knew what was his fathers character he found he was betrayed to me and upon my advising a journey he understood me properly his openness to counsel and the manly firmness with which he behaved in quitting you made me hope the danger was blown over but last week when i was at the castle where i have for some time attended mr delvile who has had a severe fit of the gout i found him in an agitation of spirits that made me apprehend it would be thrown into his stomach i desired mrs delvile to use her influence to calm him but she was herself in still greater emotion and acquainting me she was obliged to leave him desired i would spend with him every moment in my power i have therefore almost lived at the castle during her absence and in the course of our many conversations he has acknowledged to me the uneasiness under which he labored from the intelligence concerning his son which he had just received  cecilia wished here to enquire how received and from whom but had not the courage and therefore he proceeded  i was still with the father when mr mortimer arrived post at my house to fetch me hither i was sent for home he informed me of his errand without disguise for he knew i was well acquainted with the original secret whence all the evil arose i told him my distress in what manner to leave his father and he was extremely shocked himself when acquainted with his situation we agreed that it would be vain to conceal from him the indisposition of mrs delvile which the delay of her return and a thousand other accidents might in some unfortunate way make known to him he commissioned me therefore to break it to him that he might consent to my journey and at the same time to quiet his own mind by assuring him all he had apprehended was wholly at an end  he stopped and looked to see how cecilia bore these words  it is all at an end sir said she with firmness but i have not yet heard your commission what and from whom is that  i am thoroughly satisfied it is unnecessary he answered since the young man can but submit and you can but give him up  but still if there is a message it is fit i should hear it  if you choose it so it is i told mr delvile whither i was coming and i repeated to him his sons assurances he was relieved but not satisfied he would not see him and gave me for him a prohibition of extreme severity  and to you he bid me say    from him then is my message cried cecilia half frightened and much disappointed  yes said he understanding her immediately for the son after giving me his first account had the wisdom and forbearance not once to mention you  i am very glad said she with a mixture of admiration and regret to hear it but what sir said mr delvile  he bid me tell you that either he or you must see his son never more  it was indeed unnecessary cried she coloring with resentment to send me such a message i meant not to see him again he meant not to desire it i return him however no answer and i will make him no promise to mrs delvile alone i hold myself bound to him send what messages he may i shall always hold myself free but believe me dr lyster if with his name his son had inherited his character his desire of our separation would be feeble and trifling compared with my own  i am sorry my good young lady said he to have given you this disturbance yet i admire your spirit and doubt not but it will enable you to forget any little disappointment you may have suffered and what after all have you to regret mortimer delvile is indeed a young man that any woman might wish to attach but every woman cannot have him and you of all women have least reason to repine in missing him for scarcely is there another man you may not choose or reject at your pleasure  little as was the consolation cecilia could draw from this speech she was sensible it became not her situation to make complaints and therefore to end the conversation she proposed calling in the miss charltons  no no said he i must step up again to mrs delvile and then begone tomorrow morning i shall but call to see how she is and leave some directions and set off mr mortimer delvile accompanies me back but he means to return hither in a week in order to travel with his mother to bristol mean time i purpose to bring about a reconciliation between him and his father whose prejudices are more intractable than any mans i ever met with  it will be strange indeed said cecilia should a reconciliation now be difficult  true but it is long since he was young himself and the softer affections he never was acquainted with and only regards them in his son as derogatory to his whole race however if there were not some few such men there would hardly be a family in the kingdom that could count a great grandfather i am not i must own of his humor myself but i think it rather peculiarly stranger than peculiarly worse than most other peoples and how for example was that of your uncle a whit the better he was just as fond of his name as if like mr delvile he could trace it from the time of the saxons  cecilia strongly felt the truth of this observation but not choosing to discuss it made not any answer and dr lyster after a few goodnatured apologies both for his friends the delviles and himself went up stairs  what continual disturbance cried she when left alone keeps me thus forever from rest no sooner is one wound closed but another is opened mortification constantly succeeds distress and when my heart is spared my pride is attacked that not a moment of tranquillity may ever be allowed me had the lowest of women won the affections of mr delvile could his father with less delicacy or less decency have acquainted her with his inflexible disapprobation to send with so little ceremony a message so contemptuous and so preremptory  but perhaps it is better for had he too like mrs delvile joined kindness with rejection i might still more keenly have felt the perverseness of my destiny  chap vii a parting the next morning dr lyster called early and having visited mrs delvile and again met the two gentlemen of the faculty in whose care she was to remain he took his leave but not without contriving first to speak a few words to cecilia in private in which he charged her to be careful of her health and reanimate her spirits dont suppose said he that because i am a friend of the delvile family i am either blind to your merits or to their foibles far from it but then why should they interfere with one another let them keep their prejudices which though different are not worse than their neighbors and do you retain your excellencies and draw from them the happiness which they ought to give you people reason and refine themselves into a thousand miseries by choosing to settle that they can only be contented one way whereas there are fifty ways if they would but look about them that would commonly do as well  i believe indeed you are right answered cecilia and i thank you for the admonition i will do what i can toward studying your scheme of philosophy and it is always one step to amendment to be convinced that we want it  you are a sensible and charming girl said dr lyster and mr delvile should he find a daughterinlaw descended in a right line from egbert first king of all england will not be so well off as if he had satisfied himself with you however the old gentleman has a fair right after all to be pleased his own way and let us blame him how we will we shall find upon sifting it is for no other reason but because his humor happens to clash with our own  that indeed said cecilia smiling is a truth incontrovertable and a truth to which for the future i will endeavor to give more weight but will you permit me now to ask one question  can you tell me from whom how or when the intelligence which has caused all this disturbance    she hesitated but comprehending her readily he answered how they got at it i never heard for i never thought it worth while to enquire as it is so generally known that nobody i meet with seems ignorant of it  this was another and a cruel shock to cecilia and dr lyster peceiving it again attempted to comfort her that the affair is somewhat spread said he is now not to be helped and therefore little worth thinking of every body will agree that the choice of both does honor to both and nobody need be ashamed to be successor to either whenever the course of things leads mr mortimer and yourself to make another election he wisely intends to go abroad and will not return till he is his own man again and as to you my good young lady what after a short time given to vexation need interrupt your happiness you have the whole world before you with youth fortune talents beauty and independence drive therefore from your head this unlucky affair and remember there can hardly be a family in the kingdom this one excepted that will not rejoice in a connection with you  he then goodhumouredly shook hands with her and went into his chaise  cecilia though not slow in remarking the ease and philosophy with which every one can argue upon the calamities and moralize upon the misconduct of others had still the candor and good sense to see that there was reason in what he urged and to resolve upon making the best use in her power of the hints for consolation she might draw from his discourse  during the following week she devoted herself almost wholly to mrs delvile sharing with the maid whom she had brought with her from the castle the fatigue of nursing her and leaving to the miss charltons the chief care of their grandmother for mrs delvile appeared every hour more sensible of her attention and more desirous of her presence and though neither of them spoke each was endeared to the other by the tender offices of friendship which were paid and received  when this week was expired dr lyster was prevailed upon to return again to bury in order to travel himself with mrs delvile to bristol well cried he taking cecilia by the first opportunity aside how are you have you studied my scheme of philosophy as you promised me  o yes said she and made i flatter myself no little proficiency  you are a good girl cried he a very extraordinary girl i am sure you are and upon my honor i pity poor mortimer with all my soul but he is a noble young fellow and behaves with a courage and spirit that does me good to behold to have obtained you he would have moved heaven and earth but finding you out of his reach he submits to his fate like a man  cecilias eyes glistened at this speech yes said she he long since said it is suspense it is hope that make the misery of life  for there the passions have all power and reason has none but when evils are irremediable and we have neither resources to plan nor castlebuilding to delude us we find time for the cultivation of philosophy and flatter ourselves perhaps that we have found inclination  why you have considered this matter very deeply said he but i must not have you give way to these serious reflections thought after all has a cruel spite against happiness i would have you therefore keep as much as you conveniently can out of its company run about and divert yourself it is all you have for it the true art of happiness in this most whimsical world seems nothing more nor less than this  let those who have leisure find employment and those who have business find leisure  he then told her that mr delvile senior was much better and no longer confined to his room and that he had had the pleasure of seeing an entire reconciliation take place between him and his son of whom he was more fond and more proud than any other father in the universe  think of him however my dear young lady he continued no more for the matter i see is desperate you must pardon my being a little officious when i confess to you i could not help proposing to the old gentleman an expedient of my own for as i could not drive you out of my head i employed myself in thinking what might be done by way of accommodation now my scheme was really a very good one only when people are prejudiced all reasoning is thrown away upon them i proposed sinking both your names since they are so at variance with one another and so adopting a third by means of a title but mr delvile angrily declared that though such a scheme might do very well for the needy lord ernolf a peer of twenty years his own noble ancestors should never by his consent forfeit a name which so many centuries had rendered honorable his son mortimer he added must inevitably inherit the title of his grandfather his uncle being old and unmarried but yet he would rather see him a beggar than lose his dearest hope that delvile lord delvile would descend both name and title from generation to generation unsullied and uninterrupted  i am sorry indeed said cecilia that such a proposal was made and i earnestly entreat that none of any sort may be repeated  well well said he i would not for the world do any mischief but who would not have supposed such a proposal would have done good  mr mortimer he then added is to meet us at  for he would not he said come again to this place upon such terms as he was here last week for the whole worth of the kings dominions  the carriage was now ready and mrs delvile was prepared to depart cecilia approached to take leave of her but dr lyster following said no talking no thanking no compliments of any sort i shall carry off my patient without permitting one civil speech and for all the rudeness i make her guilty of i am willing to be responsible  cecilia would then have retreated but mrs delvile holding out both her hands said to every thing else dr lyster i am content to submit but were i to die while uttering the words i cannot leave this inestimable creature without first saying how much i love her how i honor and how i thank her without entreating her to be careful of her health and conjuring her to complete the greatness of her conduct by not suffering her spirits to sink from the exertion of her virtue and now my love god bless you  she then embraced her and went on cecilia at a motion of dr lysters forbearing to follow her  and thus cried she when they were gone thus ends all my connection with this family which it seems as if i was only to have known for the purpose of affording a new proof of the insufficiency of situation to constitute happiness who looks not upon mine as the perfection of human felicity  and so perhaps it is for it may be that felicity and humanity are never permitted to come nearer  and thus in philosophic sadness by reasoning upon the universality of misery she restrained at least all violence of sorrow though her spirits were dejected and her heart was heavy  but the next day brought with it some comfort that a little lightened her sadness mrs charlton almost wholly recovered was able to go down stairs and cecilia had at least the satisfaction of seeing an happy conclusion to an illness of which with the utmost concern and regret she considered herself as the cause she attended her with the most unremitting assiduity and being really very thankful endeavored to appear happy and slattered herself that by continual effort the appearance in a short time would become reality  mrs charlton retired early and cecilia accompanied her up stairs and while she was with her was informed that mr monckton was in the parlour  the various afflicting and uncommon scenes in which she had been engaged since she last saw him had almost wholly driven him from her remembrance or when at any time he recurred to it it was only to attribute the discontinuance of his visits to the offense she had given hm in refusing to follow his advice by relinquishing her london expedition  full therefore of the mortifying transactions which had passed since their parting and fearful of his enquiries into disgraces he had nearly foretold she heard him announced with chagrin and waited upon him in the most painful confusion  far different were the feelings of mr monckton he read in her countenance the dejection of disappointment which impressed upon his heart the vivacity of hope her evident shame was to him secret triumph her illconcealed sorrow revived all his expectations  she hastily began a conversation by mentioning her debt to him and apologizing for not paying it the moment she was of age he knew but too well how her time had been occupied and assured her the delay was wholly immaterial  he then led to an enquiry into the present situation of her affairs but unable to endure a disquisition which could only be productive of censure and mortification she hastily stopped it exclaiming ask me not i entreat you sir any detail of what has passed  the event has brought me sufferings that may well make blame dispensed with  i acknowledge all your wisdom i am sensible of my own error but the affair is wholly dropped and the unhappy connection i was forming is broken off forever  little now was mr moncktons effort in repressing his further curiosity and he started other subjects with readiness gaiety and address he mentioned mrs charlton for whom he had not the smallest regard he talked to her of mrs harrel whose very existence was indifferent to him and he spoke of their common acquaintance in the country for not one of whom he would have grieved if assured of meeting no more his powers of conversation were enlivened by his hopes and his exhilarated spirits made all subjects seem happy to him a weight was removed from his mind which had nearly borne down even his remotest hopes the object of his eager pursuit seemed still within his reach and the rival into whose power he had so lately almost beheld her delivered was totally renounced and no longer to be dreaded a revolution such as this raised expectations more sanguine than ever and in quitting the house he exultingly considered himself released from every obstacle to his views  till just as he arrived home he recollected his wife  chap viii a tale a week passed during which cecilia however sad spent her time as usual with the family denying to herself all voluntary indulgence of grief and forbearing to seek consolation from solitude or relief from tears she never named delvile she begged mrs charlton never to mention him she called to her aid the account she had received from dr lyster of his firmness and endeavored by an emulous ambition to fortify her mind from the weakness of depression and regret  this week a week of struggle with all her feelings was just elapsed when she received by the post the following letter from mrs delvile  to miss beverley bristol oct    my sweet young friend will not i hope be sorry to hear of my safe arrival at this place to me every account of her health and welfare will ever be the intelligence i shall most covet to receive yet i mean not to ask for it in return to chance i will trust for information and i only write now to say i shall write no more  too much for thanks is what i owe you and what i think of you is beyond all power of expression do not then wish me ill ill as i have seemed to merit of you for my own heart is almost broken by the tyranny i have been compelled to practice upon yours  and now let me bid a long adieu to you my admirable cecilia you shall not be tormented with a useless correspondence which can only awaken painful recollections or give rise to yet more painful new anxieties fervently will i pray for the restoration of your happiness to which nothing can so greatly contribute as that wise that uniform command so feminine yet so dignified you maintain over your passions which often i have admired though never so feelingly as at this conscious moment when my own health is the sacrifice of emotions most fatally unrestrained  send to me no answer even if you have the sweetness to wish it every new proof of the generosity of your nature is to me but a new wound forget us therefore wholly  alas you have only known us for sorrow  forget us dear and invaluable cecilia though ever as you have nobly deserved must you be fondly and gratefully remembered by  augusta delvile   the attempted philosophy and labored resignation of cecilia this letter destroyed the struggle was over the apathy was at an end and she burst into an agony of tears which finding the vent they had long sought now flowed unchecked down her cheeks sad monitors of the weakness of reason opposed to the anguish of sorrow  a letter at once so caressing yet so absolute forced its way to her heart in spite of the fortitude she had flattered herself was its guard in giving up delvile she was satisfied of the propriety of seeing him no more and convinced that even to talk of him would be folly and imprudence but to be told that for the future they must remain strangers to the existence of each other  there seemed in this a hardship a rigor that was insupportable  oh what cried she is human nature in its best state how imperfect that a woman such as this so noble in character so elevated in sentiment with heroism to sacrifice to her sense of duty the happiness of a son whom with joy she would die to serve can herself be thus governed by prejudice thus enslaved thus subdued by opinion yet never even when miserable unjust or irrational her grief was unmixed with anger and her tears streamed not from resentment but affliction the situation of mrs delvile however different she considered to be as wretched as her own she read therefore with sadness but not bitterness her farewell and received not with disdain but with gratitude her sympathy yet though her indignation was not irritated her sufferings were doubled by a farewell so kind yet so despotic a sympathy so affectionate yet so hopeless  in this first indulgence of grief which she had granted to her disappointment she was soon interrupted by a summons down stairs to a gentleman  unfit and unwilling to be seen she begged that he might leave his name and appoint a time for calling again  her maid brought for answer that he believed his name was unknown to her and desired to see her now unless she was employed in some matter of moment  she then put up her letter and went into the parlour and there to her infinite amazement beheld mr albany  how little sir she cried did i expect this pleasure  this pleasure repeated he do you call it  what strange abuse of words what causeless trifling with honesty is language of no purpose but to wound the ear with untruths is the gift of speech only granted us to pervert the use of understanding i can give you no pleasure i have no power to give it any one you can give none to me  the whole world could not invest you with the means  well sir said cecilia who had little spirit to defend herself i will not vindicate the expression but of this i will unfeignedly assure you i am at least as glad to see you just now as i should be to see any body  your eyes cried he are red your voice is inarticulate  young rich and attractive the world at your feet that world yet untried and its falsehood unknown how have you thus found means to anticipate misery which way have you uncovered the cauldron of human woes fatal and early anticipation that cover once removed can never be replaced those woes those boiling woes will pour out upon you continually and only when your heart ceases to beat will their ebullition cease to torture you  alas cried cecilia shuddering how cruel yet how true  why went you cried he to the cauldron it came not to you misery seeks not man but man misery he walks out in the sun but stops not for a cloud confident he pursues his way till the storm which gathering he might have avoided bursts over his devoted head scared and amazed he repents his temerity he calls but it is then too late he runs but it is thunder which follows him such is the presumption of man such at once is the arrogance and shailowness of his nature and thou simple and blind have thou too followed whither fancy has led thee unheeding that thy career was too vehement for tranquillity nor missing that lovely companion of youths early innocence till adventurous and unthinking thou have lost her for ever  in the present weak state of cecilias spirits this attack was too much for her and the tears she had just and with difficulty restrained again forced their way down her cheeks as she answered it is but too true  i have lost her for ever  poor thing said he while the rigor of his countenance was softened into the gentlest commiseration so young  looking too so innocent  it is hard  and is nothing left thee no small remaining hope to cheat humanely cheat thy yet not wholly extinguished credulity  cecilia wept without answering  let me not said he waste my compassion upon nothing compassion is with me no effusion of affectation tell me then if thou deservest it or if thy misfortunes are imaginary and thy grief is factitious  factitious repeated she good heaven  answer me then these questions in which i shall comprise the only calamities for which sorrow has no control or none from human motives tell me then have you lost by death the friend of your bosom  no  is your fortune dissipated by extravagance and your power of relieving the distressed at an end  no the power and the will are i hope equally undiminished  o then unhappy girl have you been guilty of some vice and hangs remorse thus heavy on your conscience  no no thank heaven to that misery at least i am a stranger  his countenance now again resumed its severity and in the sternest manner whence then he said these tears and what is this caprice you dignify with the name of sorrow  strange wantonness of indolence and luxury perverse repining of ungrateful plenitude  oh had thou known what i have suffered    could i lessen what you have suffered said cecilia i should sincerely rejoice but heavy indeed must be your affliction if mine in its comparison deserves to be styled caprice  caprice repeated he it is joy it is extacy compared with mine  thou have not in licentiousness wasted thy inheritance thou have not by remorse barred each avenue to enjoyment nor yet has the cold grave seized the beloved of thy soul  neither said cecilia i hope are the evils you have yourself sustained so irremediable  yes i have borne them all  have borne i bear them still i shall bear them while i breathe i may rue them perhaps yet longer  good god cried cecilia shrinking what a world is this how full of woe and wickedness  yet thou too can complain cried he though happy in lifes only blessing innocence thou too can murmur though stranger to deaths only terror sin oh yet if thy sorrow is unpolluted with guilt be regardless of all else and rejoice in thy destiny  but who cried she deeply sighing shall teach me such a lesson of joy when all within rises to oppose it  i cried he will teach it thee for i will tell thee my own sad story then will thou find how much happier is thy lot then will thou raise thy head in thankful triumph  o no triumph comes not so lightly yet if you will venture to trust me with some account of yourself i shall be glad to hear it and much obliged by the communication  i will he answered whatever i may suffer to awaken thee from this dream of fancied sorrow i will open all my wounds and thou shall probe them with fresh shame  no indeed cried cecilia with quickness i will not hear you if the relation will be so painful  upon me this humanity is lost said he since punishment and penitence alone give me comfort i will tell thee therefore my crimes that thou may know thy own felicity lest ignorant it means nothing but innocence thou should lose it unconscious of its value listen then to me and learn what misery is guilt is alone the basis of lasting unhappiness  guilt is the basis of mine and therefore i am a wretch for ever  cecilia would again have declined hearing him but he refused to be spared and as her curiosity had long been excited to know something of his history and the motives of his extraordinary conduct she was glad to have it satisfied and gave him the utmost attention  i will not speak to you of my family said he historical accuracy would little answer to either of us i am a native of the west indies and i was early sent hither to be educated while i was yet at the university i saw i adored and i pursued the fairest flower that ever put forth its sweet buds the softest heart that ever was broken by illusage she was poor and unprotected the daughter of a villager she was untaught and unpretending the child of simplicity but fifteen summers had she bloomed and her heart was an easy conquest yet once made mine it resisted all allurement to infidelity my fellow students attacked her she was assaulted by all the arts of seduction flattery bribery supplication all were employed yet all failed she was wholly my own and with sincerity so attractive i determined to marry her in defiance of all worldly objections  the sudden death of my father called me hastily to jamaica i feared leaving this treasure unguarded yet in decency could neither marry nor take her directly i pledged my faith therefore to return to her as soon as i had settled my affairs and i left to a bosom friend the inspection of her conduct in my absence  to leave her was madness  to trust in man was madness  oh haful race how has the world been abhorrent to me since that time i have loathed the light of the sun i have shrunk from the commerce of my fellow creatures the voice of man i have detested his sight i have abominated  but oh more than all should i be abominated myself  when i came to my fortune intoxicated with sudden power i forgot this fair blossom i revelled in licentiousness and vice and left it exposed and forlorn riot succeeded riot till a fever incurred by my own intemperance first gave me time to think then was she revenged for then first remorse was my portion her image was brought back to my mind with frantic fondness and bitterest contrition the moment i recovered i returned to england i flew to claim her  but she was lost no one knew whither she was gone the wretch i had trusted pretended to know least of all yet after a furious search i traced her to a cottage where he had concealed her himself  when she saw me she screamed and would have flown i stopped her and told her i came faithfully and honorably to make her my wife  her own faith and honor though sullied were not extinguished for she instantly acknowledged the fatal tale of her undoing  did i recompense this ingenuousness this unexampled this beautiful sacrifice to intuitive integrity yes with my curses  i loaded her with execrations i reviled her in language the most opprobrious i insulted her even for her confession i invoked all evil upon her from the bottom of my heart  she knelt at my feet she implored my forgiveness and compassion she wept with the bitterness of despair  and yet i spurned her from me  spurned  let me not hide my shame i barbarously struck her  nor single was the blow  it was doubled it was reiterated  oh wretch unyielding and unpitying where shall hereafter be clemency for thee  so fair a form so young a culprit so infamously seduced so humbly penitent  in this miserable condition helpless and deplorable mangled by these savage hands and reviled by this inhuman tongue i left her in search of the villain who had destroyed her but cowardly as treacherous he had absconded repenting my fury i hastened to her again the fierceness of my cruelty shamed me when i grew calmer the softness of her sorrow melted me upon recollection i returned therefore to soothe her  but again she was gone terrified with expectation of insult she hid herself from all my enquiries i wandered in search of her two long years to no purpose regardless of my affairs and of all things but that pursuit at length i thought i saw her  in london alone and walking in the streets at midnight  i fearfully followed her  and followed her into an house of infamy  the wretches by whom she was surrounded were noisy and drinking they heeded me little  but she saw and knew me at once she did not speak nor did i  but in two moments she fainted and fell  yet did i not help her the people took their own measures to recover her and when she was again able to stand would have removed her to another apartment  i then went forward and forcing them away from her with all the strength of desperation i turned to the unhappy sinner who to chance only seemed to leave what became of her and cried from this scene of vice and horror let me yet rescue you you look still unfit for such society trust yourself therefore to me i seized her hand i drew i almost dragged her away she trembled she could scarce totter but neither consented nor refused neither shed a tear nor spoke a word and her countenance presented a picture of affright amazement and horror  i took her to a house in the country each of us silent the whole way i gave her an apartment and a female attendant and ordered for her every convenience i could suggest i stayed myself in the same house but distracted with remorse for the guilt and ruin into which i had terrified her i could not bear her sight  in a few days her maid assured me the the life she led must destroy her that she would taste nothing but bread and water never spoke and never slept  alarmed by this account i flew into her apartment pride and resentment gave way to pity and fondness and i besought her to take comfort i spoke however to a statue she replied not nor seemed to hear me i then humbled myself to her as in the days of her innocence and first power supplicating her notice entreating even her commiseration all was to no purpose she neither received nor repulsed me and was alike inattentive to exhortation and to prayer  whole hours did i spend at her feet vowing never to arise till she spoke to me  all all in vain she seemed deaf mute insensible her face unmoved a settled despair fixed in her eyes  those eyes that had never looked at me but with dovelike softness and campliance  she sat constantly in one chair she never changed her dress no persuasions could prevail with her to lie down and at meals she just swallowed so much dry bread as might save her from dying for want of food  what was the distraction of my soul to find her bent upon this course to her last hour  quick came that hour but never will it be forgotten rapidly it was gone but eternally it will be remembered  when she felt herself expiring she acknowledged she had made a vow upon entering the house to live speechless and motionless as a penance for her offenses  i kept her loved corpse till my own senses failed me  it was then only torn from me  and i have lost all recollection of three years of my existence  cecilia shuddered at this hint yet was not surprised by it mr gosport had acquainted her he had been formerly confined and his flightiness wildness florid language and extraordinary way of life had long led her to suspect his reason had been impaired  the scene to which my memory first leads me back he continued is visiting her grave solemnly upon it i returned her vow though not by one of equal severity to her poor remains did i pledge myself that the day should never pass in which i would receive nourishment nor the night come in which i would take rest till i had done or zealously attempted to do some service to a fellow creature  for this purpose have i wandered from city to city from the town to the country and from the rich to the poor i go into every house where i can gain admittance i admonish all who will hear me i shame even those who will not i seek the distressed wherever they are hid i follow the prosperous to beg a mite to serve them i look for the dissipated in public where amidst their licentiousness i check them i pursue the unhappy in private where i counsel and endeavor to assist them my own power is small my relations during my sufferings limiting me to an annuity but there is no one i scruple to solicit and by zeal i supply ability  oh life of hardship and penance laborious toilsome and restless but i have merited no better and i will not repine at it i have vowed that i will endure it and i will not be forsworn  one indulgence alone from time to time i allow myself  it is music which has power to delight me even to rapture it quiets all anxiety it carries me out of myself i forget through it every calamity even the bitterest anguish  now then that thou have heard me tell me have thou cause of sorrow  alas cried cecilia this indeed is a picture of misery to make my lot seem all happiness  art thou thus open to conviction cried he mildly and do thou not fly the voice of truth for truth and reproof are one  no i would rather seek it i feel myself wretched however inadequate may be the cause i wish to be more resigned and if you can instruct me how i shall thankfully attend to you  oh yet uncorrupted creature cried he with joy will i be thy monitor  joy long untasted many have i wished to serve all hitherto have rejected my offices too honest to flatter them they had not the fortitude to listen to me too low to advance them they had not the virtue to bear with me you alone have i yet found pure enough not to fear inspection and good enough to wish to be better yet words alone will not content me i must also have deeds nor will your purse however readily opened suffice you must give to me also your time and your thoughts for money sent by others to others only will afford relief to lighten your own cares you must distribute it yourself  you shall find me said she a docile pupil and most glad to be instructed how my existence may be useful  happy then cried he was the hour that brought me to this county yet not in search of you did i come but of the mutable and illfated belfield erring yet ingenious young man what a lesson to the vanity of talents to the gaiety the brilliancy of wit is the sight of that green fallen plant not sapless by age nor withered by disease but destroyed by want of pruning and bending breaking by its own luxuriance  and where sir is he now  laboring wilfully in the field with those who labor compulsatorily such are we all by nature discontented perverse and changeable though all have not courage to appear so and few like belfield are worth watching when they do he told me he was happy i knew it could not be but his employment was innoffensive and i left him without reproach in this neighborhood i heard of you and found your name was coupled with praise i came to see if you deserved it i have seen and am satisfied  you are not then very difficult for i have yet done nothing how are we to begin these operations you propose you have awakened me by them to an expectation of pleasure which nothing else i believe could just now have given me  we will work cried he together till not a woe shall remain upon your mind the blessings of the fatherless the prayers of little children shall heal all your wounds with balm of sweetest fragrance when sad they shall cheer when complaining they shall soothe you we will go to their roofless houses and see them repaired we will exclude from their dwellings the inclemency of the weather we will clothe them from cold we will rescue them from hunger the cries of distress shall be changed to notes of joy your heart shall be enraptured mine too shall revive  oh whither am i wandering i am painting an elysium and while i idly speak some fainting object dies for want of succor farewell i will fly to the abodes of wretchedness and come to you tomorrow to render them the abodes of happiness  he then went away  this singular visit was for cecilia most fortunately timed it almost surprised her out of her peculiar grief by the view which it opened to her of general calamity wild flighty and imaginative as were his language and his counsels their morality was striking and their benevolence was affecting taught by him to compare her state with that of at least half her species she began more heartily to weigh what was left with what was withdrawn and found the balance in her favor the plan he had presented to her of good works was consonant to her character and inclinations and the active charity in which he proposed to engage her reanimated her fallen hopes though to far different subjects from those which had depressed them any scheme of worldly happiness would have sickened and disgusted her but her mind was just in the situation to be impressed with elevated piety and to adopt any design in which virtue humoured melancholy  chap ix a shock cecilia passed the rest of the day in fanciful projects of benesicence she determined to wander with her romantic new ally whithersoever he would lead her and to spare neither fortune time nor trouble in seeking and relieving the distressed not all her attempted philosophy had calmed her mind like this plan in merely refusing indulgence to grief she had only locked it up in her heart where eternally struggling for vent she was almost overpowered by restraining it but now her affliction had no longer her whole faculties to itself the hope of doing good the pleasure of easing pain the intention of devoting her time to the service of the unhappy once more delighted her imagination  that source of promissory enjoyment which though often obstructed is never in youth exhausted  she would not give mrs charlton the unnecessary pain of hearing the letter with which she had been so much affected but she told her of the visit of albany and pleased her with the account of their scheme  at night with less sadness than usual she retired to rest in her sleep she bestowed riches and poured plenty upon the land she humbled the oppressor she exalted the oppressed slaves were raised to dignities captives restored to liberty beggars saw smiling abundance and wretchedness was banished the world from a cloud in which she was supported by angels cecilia beheld these wonders and while enjoying the glorious illusion she was awakened by her maid with news that mrs charlton was dying  she started up and undressed was running to her apartment  when the maid calling to stop her confessed she was already dead  she had made her exit in the night but the time was not exactly known her own maid who slept in the room with her going early to her bedside to enquire how she did found her cold and motionless and could only conclude that a paralytic stroke had taken her off  happily and in good time had cecilia been somewhat recruited by one night of refreshing slumbers and flattering dreams for the shock she now received promised her not soon another  she lost in mrs charlton a friend whom nearly from her infancy she had considered as a mother and by whom she had been cherished with tenderness almost unequalled she was not a woman of bright parts or much cultivation but her heart was excellent and her disposition was amiable cecilia had known her longer than her memory could look back though the earliest circumstances she could trace were kindnesses received from her since she had entered into life and found the difficulty of the part she had to act to this worthy old lady alone had she unbosomed her secret cares though little assisted by her counsel she was always certain of her sympathy and while her own superior judgment directed her conduct she had the relief of communicating her schemes and weighing her perplexities with a friend to whom nothing that concerned her was indifferent and whose greatest wish and chief pleasure was the enjoyment of her conversation  if left to herself in the present period of her life mrs charlton had certainly not been the friend of her choice the delicacy of her mind and the refinement of her ideas had now rendered her sastidious and she would have looked out for elegancies and talents to which mrs charlton had no pretensions but those who live in the country have little power of selection confined to a small circle they must be content with what it offers and however they may idolize extraordinary merit when they meet with it they must not regard it as essential to friendship for in their circumscribed rotation whatever may be their discontent they can make but little change  such had been the situation to which mrs charlton and mrs harrel owed the friendship of cecilia greatly their superior in understanding and intelligence had the candidates for her favor been more numerous the election had not fallen upon either of them but she became known to both before discrimination made her difficult and when her enlightened mind discerned their deficiencies they had already an interest in her affections which made her see them with lenity and though sometimes perhaps conscious she should not have chosen them from many she adhered to them with sincerity and would have changed them for none  mrs harrel however too weak for similar sentiments forgot her when out of sight and by the time they met again was insensible to every thing but show and dissipation cecilia shocked and surprised first grieved from disappointed affection and then lost that affection in angry contempt but her fondness for mrs charlton had never known abatement as the kindness which had excited it had never known allay she had loved her first from childish gratitude but that love strengthened and confirmed by confidential intercourse was now as sincere and affectionate as if it had originated from sympathetic admiration her loss therefore was felt with the utmost severity and neither seeing nor knowing any means of replacing it she considered it as irreparable and mourned it with bitterness  when the first surprise of this cruel stroke was somewhat lessened she sent an express to mr monckton with the news and entreated to see him immediately he came without delay and she begged his counsel what step she ought herself to take in consequence of this event her own house was still unprepared for her she had of late neglected to hasten the workmen and almost forgotten her intention of entering it it was necessary however to change her abode immediately she was no longer in the house of mrs charlton but of her granddaughters and coheiresses each of whom she disliked and upon neither of whom she had any claim  mr monckton then with the quickness of a man who utters a thought at the very moment of its projection mentioned a scheme upon which during his whole ride he had been ruminating which was that she would instantly remove to his house and remain there till settled to her satisfaction  cecilia objected her little right of surprising lady margaret but without waiting to discuss it lest new objections should arise he quitted her to fetch himself from her ladyship an invitation he meant to insist upon her sending  cecilia though heartily disliking this plan knew not at present what better to adopt and thought any thing preferable to to going again to mrs harrel since that only could be done by feeding the anxiety of mr arnott  mr monckton soon returned with a message of his own fabrication for his lady though obliged to receive whom he pleased took care to guard inviolate the independence of speech sullenly persevering in refusing to say any thing or perversely saying only what he least wished to hear  cecilia then took a hasty leave of miss charltons who little affected by what they had lost and eager to examine what they had gained parted from her gladly and with a heavy heart and weeping eyes borrowed for the last time the carriage of her late worthy old friend and forever quitting her hospitable house sorrowfully set out for the grove  end of the fourth volume
