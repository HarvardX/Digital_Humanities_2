an essay on man  an essay on man being the first book of ethic epistles  to henry st john l bolingbroke  gnothi seayton      london printed by john wright for lawton gilliver mdccxxxiv  the design having proposed to write some pieces on human life and manners such as to use my lord bacons expression come home to mens business and bosoms i thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering man in the abstract his nature and his state since to prove any moral duty to enforce any moral precept or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in and what is the proper end and purpose of its being  the science of human nature is like all other sciences reduced to a few clear points there are not many certain truths in this world it is therefore in the anatomy of the mind as in that of the body more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large open and perceptible parts than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels as will for ever escape our observation the disputes are all upon these last and i will venture to say they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of morality if i could flatter my self that this essay has any merit it is in steering betwixt doctrines seemingly opposite in passing over terms utterly unintelligible and in forming out of all a temperate yet not inconsistent and a short yet not imperfect system of ethics  this i might have done in prose but i chose verse and even rhyme for two reasons the one will appear obvious that principles maxims or precepts so written both strike the reader more strongly at first and are more easily retained by him afterward the other may seem odd but is true i found i could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself and nothing is more certain than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness i was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail without becoming dry and tedious or more poetically without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament without wandering from the precision or breaking the chain of reasoning if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them i freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity  what is now published is only to be considered as a general map of man marking out no more than the greater parts their extent their limits and their connection but leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow consequently these epistles in their progress will become less dry and more susceptible of poetical ornament i am here only opening the fountains and clearing the passage to deduce the rivers to follow them in their course and to observe their effects will be a task more agreeable      the contents of the first book epistle i of the nature and state of man with respect to the universe of man in the abstract we can judge only with regard to our own system being ignorant of the relations of systems and things ver    etc to    man is not therefore to be deemed imperfect but a being suited to his place and rank in the creation agreeable to the general order of things and conformable to ends and relations to him unknown    etc it is partly upon this ignorance of future events and partly upon the hope of a future state that all his happiness in the present depends    etc his pride in aiming at more knowledge and pretending to more perfection the cause of his error and misery  0      the impiety of putting himself in the place of god and judging of the fitness or unfitness perfection or imperfection justice or injustice of his dispensations  0  to   0 the absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the creation or expecting that perfection in the moral world which is not in the natural     to     the unreasonableness of his complaints against providence while on the one hand he demands the perfections of the angels on the other the bodily qualifications of the brutes     that the gift of reason alone countervails all the latter and that to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable     to     that throughout the whole visible world an universal order and gradation in these is observed which causes a subordination of creature to creature and of all creatures of man the gradations of sense instinct thought reflection reason     to     how much farther this order and subordination of living creatures may extend above and below us     were any part of this broken not that part only but the whole connected creation must be destroyed the extravagance madness and pride of such a desire     etc consequently the absolute submission due to providence both as to our present and future state     etc  epistle ii of the nature and state of man with respect to himself as an individual the business of man not to pry into god but to study himself his middle nature his powers and frailties and the limits of his capacity ver   to    his two principles selflove and reason    both necessary    selflove the stronger and why    their end the same    the passions and their use    to   0 the predominant passion and its force     to   0 its necessity in directing men to different purposes     etc its providential use in fixing our principle and ascertaining our virtue     virtue and vice joined in our mixed nature the limits near yet the things separate and evident what is the office of reason     etc how odious vice in itself and how we deceive our selves into it  0  that however the ends of providence and general good are answered in our passions and imperfections   0 etc how usefully these are distributed to all orders of men     how useful they are to society     and to the individuals     in every state and in every age of life     to the end  epistle iii of the nature and state of man with respect to society the whole universe one system of society ver   etc nothing is made wholly for itself nor yet wholly for another    the happiness of animals mutual    reason or instinct operate alike to the good of each individual    reason or instinct operate to society in all animals  0  how far society carried by instinct     how much farther by reason     of that which is called the state of nature     reason instructed by instinct in the invention of arts   0 and in the forms of society   0 origin of political societies     origin of manarchy     patriarchal government     origin of true religion and government from the same principle of love     etc origin of superstition and tyranny from the same principle of fear     etc the influence of selflove operating to the social and public good     restoration of true religion and government on their first principle     mixed government     various forms of each and the true end of all  0  etc  epistle iv of the nature and state of man with respect to happiness happiness ill defined by the philosophers ver    that it is the end of all men and attainable by all    god governs by general not particular laws intends happiness to be equal and to be so it must be social since all particular happiness depends on general    as it is necessary for order and the peace and welfare of society that external goods should be unequal happiness is not made to consist in these    but notwithstanding that inequality the balance of happiness among mankind is kept even by providence by the two passions of hope and fear    what the happiness of individuals is as far as is consistent with the constitution of this world    that the good man has here the advantage  0 the error of imputing to virtue what are only the calamities of nature or of fortune    the folly of expecting that god should alter his general laws in favor of particulars     that we are not judges who are good but that whoever they are they must be happiest   0 etc that external goods are not the proper rewards often inconsistent with or destructive of virtue     but that even these can make no man happy without virtue instanced in riches     honors     birth  0  greatness     fame     superior talents     with pictures of human infelicity in men possessed of them all     etc that virtue only constitutes a happiness whose object is universal     and whose prospect eternal     the perfection of which consists in a conformity to the order of providence here and in a resignation to it here and hereafter     or in other words in love of god and charity to all men etc to the end   nil admirari  wk pfsc   epistle i awake my st john leave all meaner things to low ambition and the pride of kings let us since life can little more supply than just to look about us and to die expatiate free over all this scene of man a mighty maze but not without a plan a wild where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot or garden tempting with forbidden fruit together let us beat this ample field try what the open what the covert yield the latent tracts or giddy heights explore of all who blindly creep or sightless soar eye natures walks shoot folly as it flies and catch the manners living as they rise laugh where we must be candid where we can but vindicate the ways of god to man say first of god above or man below what can we reason but from what we know of man what see we but his station here from which to reason or to which refer through worlds unnumberd though the god be known it is ours to trace him only in our own he who through vast immensity can pierce see worlds on worlds compose one universe observe how system into system runs what other planets and what other suns what varied being peoples every star may tell why heaven has made us as we are but of this frame the bearings and the ties the strong connections nice dependencies gradations just has thy pervading soul looked through or can a part contain the whole is the great chain that draws all to agree and drawn supports upheld by god or thee presumptuous man the reason would thou find why formed so weak so little and so blind first if thou can the harder reason guess why formed no weaker blinder and no less ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made taller or stronger than the weeds they shade or ask of yonder argent fields above why joves satellites are less than jove of systems possible if it is confessed that wisdom infinite must form the best where all must full or not coherent be and all that rises rise in due degree then in the scale of life and sense it is plain there must be some where such a rank as man and all the question wrangle ere so long is only this if god has placed him wrong respecting man whatever wrong we call may must be right as relative to all in human works though labored on with pain a thousand movements scarce one purpose gain in gods one single can its end produce yet serves to second too some other use so man who here seems principal alone perhaps acts second to a sphere unknown touches some wheel or verges to some gole it is but a part we see and not a whole when the proud steed shall know why man restrains his fiery course or drives him over the plains when the dull ox why now he breaks the clod now wears a garland an egyptian god then shall mans pride and dullness comprehend his actions passions beings use and end why doing suffering checked impelled and why this hour a slave the next a deity then say not mans imperfect heaven in fault say rather mans as perfect as he ought his being measured to his state and place his time a moment and a point his space heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate all but the page prescribed their present state from brutes what men from men what spirits know or who could suffer being here below the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day had he thy reason would he skip and play pleased to the last he crops the flowery food and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood oh blindness to the future kindly given that each may fill the circle marked by heaven who sees with equal eye as god of all a hero perish or a sparrow fall atoms or systems into ruin hurled and now a bubble burst and now a world hope humbly then with trembling pinions soar wait the great teacher death and god adore what future bliss he gives not thee to know but gives that hope to be thy blessing now hope springs eternal in the human breast man never is but always to be blessed the soul uneasy and confined at home rests and expatiates in a life to come lo the poor indian whose untutored mind sees god in clouds or hears him in the wind his soul proud science never taught to stray far as the solar walk or milky way yet simple nature to his hope has given behind the cloudtopt hill an humbler heaven some safer world in depth of woods embraced some happier island in the watery waste where slaves once more their native land behold no fiends torment no christians thirst for gold to be contents his natural desire he asks no angels wing or seraphs fire but thinks admitted to that equal sky this faithful dog shall bear him company go wiser thou and in thy scale of sense weigh thy opinion against providence call imperfection what thou fancyst such say here he gives too little there too much destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust yet cry if mans unhappy gods unjust if man alone engross not heavens high care alone made perfect here immortal there snatch from his hand the balance and the rod rejudge his justice be the god of god in reasoning pride my friend our error lies all quit their sphere and rush into the skies pride still is aiming at the blessed abodes men would be angels angels would be gods aspiring to be gods if angels fell aspiring to be angels men rebel and who but wishes to invert the laws of order sins against the eternal cause ask for what end the heavenly bodies shine earth for whose use pride answers  it is for mine  for me kind nature wakes her genial power  suckles each herb and spreads out every flower  annual for me the grape the rose renew  the juice nectareous and the balmy dew  for me the mine a thousand treasures brings  for me health gushes from a thousand springs  seas roll to waft me suns to light me rise  my footstool earth my canopy the skies but errs not nature from this gracious end from burning suns when livid deaths descend when earthquakes swallow or when tempests sweep towns to one grave and nations to the deep no it is replied the first almighty cause  acts not by partial but by general laws  the exceptions few some change since all began  and what created perfect  why then man if the great end be human happiness and nature deviates how can man do less as much that end a constant course requires of showers and sunshine as of mans desires as much eternal springs and cloudless skies as men for ever temperate calm and wise if plagues or earthquakes break not heavens design why then a borgia or a catiline from pride from pride our very reasoning springs account for moral as for natural things why charge we heaven in those in these acquit in both to reason right is to submit better for us perhaps it might appear were there all harmony all virtue here that never air or ocean felt the wind that never passion discomposed the mind but all subsists by elemental strife and passions are the elements of life the general order since the whole began is kept in nature and is kept in man what would this man now upward will he soar and little less than angel would be more now looking downward just as grieved appears to want the strength of bulls the fur of bears made for his use all creatures if he call say what their use had he the powers of all nature to these without profusion kind the proper organs proper powers assigned each seeming want compensated of course here with degrees of swiftness there of force it is a certain axiom in the anatomy of creatures that in proportion as they are formed for strength their swiftness is lessened or as they are formed for swiftness their strength is abated  all in exact proportion to the state nothing to add and nothing to abate each beast each insect happy in its own is heaven unkind to man and man alone shall he alone whom rational we call be pleased with nothing if not blessed with all the bliss of man could pride that blessing find is not to think or act beyond mankind no powers of body or of soul to share but what his nature and his state can bear why has not man a microscopic eye for this plain reason man is not a fly say what the use were finer optics given to inspect a mite not comprehend the heaven or touch if tremblingly alive all over to smart and agonize at every pore or keen effluvia darting through the brain die of a rose in aromatic pain if nature thundered in his opening ears and stunned him with the music of the spheres how would he wish that heaven had left him still the whispering zephyr and the purling rill who finds not providence allgood and wise alike in what it gives and what denies far as creations ample range extends the scale of sensual mental powers ascends mark how it mounts to mans imperial race from the green myriads in the peopled grass what modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme the moles dim curtain and the lynxs beam of smell the headlong lioness the manner of the lions hunting their prey in the deserts of africa is this at their first going out in the nightime they set up a loud roar and then listen to the noise made by the beasts in their flight pursuing them by the ear and not by the nostril it is probable the story of the jackalls hunting for the lion was occasioned by observation of the defect of scent in that terrible animal between and hound sagacious on the tainted green of hearing from the life that fills the flood to that which warbles through the vernal wood the spiders touch how exquisitely fine feels at each thread and lives along the line in the nice be what sense so subtly true from poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew how instinct varies in the grovelling swine compared halfreasning elephant with thine twixt that and reason what a nice barrier for ever separate yet for ever near remembrance and reflection how allied what thin partitions sense from thought divide and middle natures how they long to join yet never pass the insuperable line without this just gradation could they be subjected these to those or all to thee the powers of all subdued by thee alone is not thy reason all those powers in one see through this air this ocean and this earth all matter quick and bursting into birth above how high progressive life may go around how wide how deep extend below vast chain of being which from god began natures ethereal human angel man beast bird fish insect what no eye can see no glass can reach from infinite to thee from thee to nothing  on superior powers were we to press inferior might on ours or in the full creation leave a void where one step broken the great scales destroyed from natures chain whatever link you strike tenth or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike and if each system in gradation roll alike essential to the amazing whole the least confusion but in one not all that system only but the whole must fall let earth unbalancd from her orbit fly planets and suns rush lawless through the sky let ruling angels from their spheres be hurled being on being wrecked and world on world heavens whole foundations to their center nod and nature tremble to the throne of god all this dread order break  for whom for thee vile worm  o madness pride impiety what if the foot ordained the dust to tread or hand to toil aspired to be the head what if the head the eye or ear repined to serve mere engines to the ruling mind just as absurd for any part to claim to be another in this general frame just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains the great directing mind of all ordains all are but parts of one stupendous whole whose body nature is and god the soul that changed through all and yet in all the

truth is clear whatever is is right wk pfsc    epistle ii know then thyself presume not god to scan the proper study of mankind is man placed on this isthmus of a middle state a being darkly wise and rudely great with too much knowledge for the skeptic side with too much weakness for a stoics pride he hangs between in doubt to act or rest in doubt todeem himself a god or beast in doubt his mind or body to prefer born but to die and reasoning but to err alike in ignorance his reason such whether he thinks too little or too much chaos of thought and passion all confused still by himself abused or disabusd created half to rise and half to fall great lord of all things yet a prey to all sole judge of truth in endless error hurled the glory jest and riddle of the world go wondrous creature mount where science guides go measure earth weigh air and state the tides instruct the planets in what orbs to run correct old time and regulate the sun go soar with plato to the empyreal sphere to the first good first perfect and first fair or tread the mazy round his followrs trod and quitting sense call imitating god as eastern priests in giddy circles run and turn their heads to imitate the sun go teach eternal wisdom how to rule then drop into thyself and be a fool superior beings when of late they saw a mortal man unfold all natures law admired such wisdom in an earthly shape and showed a newton as we show an ape could he who taught each planet where to roll describe or fix one movement of the soul who marked their points to rise and to descend explain or his beginning or his end alas what wonder mans superior part uncheckd may rise and climb from art to art but when his own great work is but begun what reason weaves by passion is undone two principles in human nature reign selflove to urge and reason to restrain nor this a good nor that a bad we call each works its end to move or govern all and to their proper operation still ascribe all good to their improper ill selflove the spring of motion acts the soul reasons comparing balance rules the whole man but for that no action could attend and but for this were active to no end fixed like a plant on his peculiar spot to draw nutrition propagate and rot or meteorlike flame lawless through the void destroying others by himself destroyed most strength the moving principle requires active its task it prompts impels inspires sedate and quiet the comparing lies formed but to check delibrate and advise selflove yet stronger as its objects nigh reasons at distance and in prospect lie that sees immediate good by present sense reason the future and the consequence thicker than arguments temptations throng at best more watchful this but that more strong the action of the stronger to suspend reason still use to reason still attend attention habit and experience gains each strengthens reason and selflove restrains let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight more studious to divide than to unite and grace and virtue sense and reason split with all the rash dexterity of wit wits just like fools at war about a name have full as often no meaning or the same selflove and reason to one end aspire pain their aversion pleasure their desire but greedy that its object would devour this taste the honey and not wound the flower pleasure or wrong or rightly understood our greatest evil or our greatest good modes of selflove the passions we may call it is real good or seeming moves them all but since not every good we can divide and reason bids us for our own provide passions though selfish if their means be fair list under reason and deserve her care those that imparted court a nobler aim exalt their kind and take some virtues name in lazy apathy let stoics boast their virtue fixed it is fixed as in a frost contracted all retiring to the breast but strength of mind is exercise not rest the rising tempest puts in act the soul parts it may ravage but preserves the whole on lifes vast ocean diversely we sail reason the card but passion is the gale nor god alone in the still calm we find he mounts the storm and walks upon the wind passions like elements though born to fight yet mixed and softened in his work unite these it is enough to temper and employ but what composes man can man destroy suffice that reason keep to natures road subject compound them follow her and god love hope and joy fair pleasures smiling train hate fear and grief the family of pain these mixed with art and to due bounds confined make and maintain the balance of the mind the lights and shades whose wellaccorded strife gives all the strength and color of our life pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes and when in act they cease in prospect rise present to grasp and future still to find the whole employ of body and of mind all spread their charms but charm not all alike on different senses different objects strike hence different passions more or less inflame as strong or weak the organs of the frame and hence one master passion in the breast like aarons serpent swallows up the rest as man perhaps the moment of his breath receives the lurking principle of death the young disease that must subdue at length grows with his growth and strengthens with his strength so cast and mingled with his very frame the minds disease its ruling passion came each vital humor which should feed the whole soon flows to this in body and in soul whatever warms the heart or fills the head as the mind opens and its functions spread imagination plies her dangerous art and pours it all upon the peccant part nature its mother habit is its nurse wit spirit faculties but make it worse reason itself but gives it edge and power as heavens blessed beam turns vinegar more sowr the ruling passion be it what it will the ruling passion conquers reason still we wretched subjects though to lawful sway in this weak queen some favorite still obey ah if she lend not arms as well as rules what can she more than tell us we are fools teach us to mourn our nature not to mend a sharp accuser but a helpless friend or from a judge turn pleader to persuade the choice we make or justify it made proud of imagined conquests all along she but removes weak passions for the strong so when small humors gather to a gout the doctor fancies he has driven them out yes natures road must ever be preferred reason is here no guide but still a guard it is here is to rectify not overthrow and treat this passion more as friend than foe a mightier power the strong direction sends and several men impells to several ends like varying winds by other passions tossed this drives them constant to a certain coast let power or knowledge gold or glory please or often more strong than all the love of ease through life it is followed even at lifes expense the merchants toil the sages indolence the monks humility the heros pride all all alike find reason on their side the eternal art educing good from ill grafts on this passion our best principle it is thus the mercury of man is fixed strong grows the virtue with his nature mixed the dross cements what else were too refined and in one interest body acts with mind as fruits ungrateful to the planters care on savage stocks inserted learn to bear the surest virtues thus from passions shoot wild natures vigor working at the root what crops of wit and honesty appear from spleen from obstinacy hate or fear see anger zeal and fortitude supply even avarice prudence sloth philosophy envy to which the ignoble minds a slave is emulation in the learned and brave lust through some certain strainers well refined is gentle love and charms all womankind nor virtue male or female can we name but what will grow on pride or grow on shame thus nature gives us let it check our pride the virtue nearest to our vice allied reason the byas turns to good from ill and nero reigns a titus if he will the fiery soul abhorred in catiline in decius charms in curtius is divine the same ambition can destroy or save and makes a patriot as it makes a knave this light and darkness in our chaos joined what shall divide the god within the mind extremes in nature equal ends produce in man they join to some mysterious use though often so mixed the difference is too nice where ends the virtue or begins the vice now this now that the others bound invades as in some wellwrought picture lights and shades fools who from hence into the notion fall that vice or virtue there is none at all if white and black blend soften and unite a thousand ways is there no black or white ask your own heart and nothing is so plain it is to mistake them costs the time and pain vice is a monster of so frightful mien as to be hated needs but to be seen yet seen too often familiar with her face we first endure then pity then embrace but where the extreme of vice was never agreed ask where is the north at yorktis on the tweed in scotland at the orcades and there at greenland zembla or the lord knows where no creature owns it in the first degree but thinks his neighbor farther gone than he even those who dwell beneath her very zone or never feel the rage or never own what happier natures shrink at with affright the hard inhabitant contends is right virtuous and vicious every man must be few in the extreme but all in the degree the rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise and even the best by fits what they despise it is but by parts we follow good or ill for vice or virtue self directs it still each individual seeks a several goal but heavens great view is one and that the whole that counterworks each folly and caprice that disappoints the effect of every vice that happy frailties to all ranks applied shame to the virgin to the matron pride fear to the statesman rashness to the chief to kings presumption and to crowds belief that virtues ends from vanity can raise which seeks no interest no reward but praise and build on wants and on defects of mind the joy the peace the glory of mankind heaven forming each on other to depend a master or a servant or a friend bids each on other for assistance call till one mans weakness grows the strength of all wants frailties

joys those loves those interests to resign taught half by reason half by mere decay to welcome death and calmly pass away whatever the passion knowledge fame or pelf not one will change his neighbor with himself the learned are happy nature to explore the fool is happy that he knows no more the rich are happy in the plenty given the poor contents him with the care of heaven see the blind beggar dance the cripple sing the sot a hero lunatic a king the starving chemist in his golden views supreamly blessed the poet in his muse see some strange comfort every state attend and pride bestowed on all a common friend see some fit passion every age supply hope travels through nor quits us when we die till then opinion gilds with varying rays those painted clouds that beautify our days each want of happiness by hope supplied and each vacuity of sense by pride these build up all that knowledge can destroy in follys cup still laughs the bubble joy one prospect lost another still we gain and not a vanity is given in vain even mean selflove becomes by force divine the scale to measure others wants by thine see and confess one comfort still must rise it is this though mans a fool yet god is wise wk pfsc    epistle iii learn dullness learn the universal cause  acts to one end but acts by various laws in all the madness of superfluous health the trim of pride and impudence of wealth let that great truth be present night and day but most be present if thou preach or pray view thy own world behold the chain of love combining all below and all above see plastic nature working to this

beast all served and serving nothing stands alone the chain holds on and where it ends unknown has god thou fool worked solely for thy good thy joy thy pastime thy attire thy food who for thy table feeds the wanton fawn for him as kindly spreads the flowery lawn is it for thee the lark ascends and sings joy tunes his voice joy elevates his wings is it for thee the linnet pours his throat loves

vindicate their grain thine the full harvest of the golden year part pays and justly the deserving steer the hog that plows not nor obeys thy call lives on the labors of this lord of all know natures children all divide her care the furr that warms a monarch warmed a bear while man exclaims see all things for my use see man for mine replies a pampered goose what care to tend to lodge to cram to treat him all this he knew but not that twas to eat him as far as goose could judge he reasoned right but as to man mistook the matter quite and just as short of reason man will fall who thinks all made for one not one for all grant that the powerful still the weak control be man the wit and tyrant of the whole nature that tyrant checks he only knows and feels another creatures wants and woes say will the falcon stooping from above smit with her varying plumage spare the dove admires the jay the insects gilded wings or hears the hawk when philomela sings man cares for all to birds he gives his woods to beasts his pastures and to fish his floods for some his interest prompts him to provide for more his pleasure yet for more his pride all feed on one vain patron and enjoy the extensive blessing of his luxury that very life his learned hunger craves he saves from famine from the savage saves nay feasts the animal he dooms his feast and till he ends the being makes it blessed which sees no more the stroke or feels the pain than favored man by touch aetherial slain several of the ancients and many of the orientals at this day esteamd those who were struck by lightning as sacred persons and the particular favorites of heaven  the creature had his feast of life before thou too must perish when thy feast is over to each unthinking being heaven a friend gives not the useless knowledge of its end to man imparts it but with such a view as while he dreads it makes him hope it too the hour concealed and so remote the fear death still draws nearer never seeming near great standing miracle that heaven assigned its only thinking thing this turn of mind whether with reason or with instinct blessed know all enjoy that power which suits em best to bliss alike by that direction tend and find the means proportioned to their end say where full instinct is the unerring guide what pope or council can they need beside reason however able cool at best cares not for service or but serves when pressed stays till we call and then not often near but honest instinct comes a volunteer this too serves always reason never long one must go right the other may go wrong see then the acting and comparing powers one in their nature which are two in ours and reason raise over instinct as you can in this it is god directs in that it is man who taught the nations of the field and wood to shun their poison and to choose their food prescient the tides or tempests to withstand build on the wave or arch beneath the sand who made the spider parallels design sure as demoivre without rule or line who bid the stork columbuslike explore heavens not his own and worlds unknown before who calls the council states the certain day who forms the phalanx and who points the way god in the nature of each being founds its proper bliss and sets its proper bounds but as he framed a whole the whole to bless on mutual wants built mutual happiness so from the first eternal order ran and creature linked to creature man to man whatere of life allquickening ether keeps or breathes through air or shoots beneath the deeps or pours profuse on earth one nature feeds the vital flame and swells the genial seeds not man alone but all that roam the wood or wing the sky or roll along the flood each loves itself but not itself alone each sex desires alike till two are one nor ends the pleasure with the fierce embrace they love themselves a third time in their race thus beast and bird their common charge attend the mothers nurse it and the sires defend the young dismissed to wander earth or air there stops the instinct and there ends the care the link dissolves each seeks a fresh embrace another love succeeds another race a longer care mans helpless kind demands that longer care contracts more lasting bands reflection reason still the ties improve at once extend the interest and the love with choice we fix with sympathy we burn each virtue in each passion takes

reason late instruct mankind  here subterranean works and cities see  there towns aerial on the waving tree  learn each small peoples genius policies  the ants republic and the realm of bees  how

ruddier burdens bend and there the streams in purer rills descend what war could ravish commerce could bestow and he returned a friend who came a foe converse and love mankind might strongly draw when love was liberty and nature law thus states were formed the name of king unknown till common interest placed the sway in one then virtue only or in arts or arms diffusing blessings or averting harms the same which in a sire the sons obeyed a prince the father of a people made till then by nature crowned each patriarch sat king priest and parent of his growing state on him their second providence they hung their law his eye their oracle his tongue he from the wondering furrow called their food taught to command the fire control the flood draw forth the monsters of the abyss profound or fetch the aerial eagle to the ground till drooping sickening dying they began whom they revered as god to mourn as man then looking up from sire to sire explored one great first father and that first adored or plain tradition that this all begun conveyed unbroken faith from sire to son the workman from the work distinct was known and simple reason never sought but one ere wit oblique had broke that steady light man like his maker saw that all was right to virtue in the paths of pleasure trod and owned a father when he owned a god love all the faith and all the allegiance then for nature knew no right divine in men no ill could fear in god and understood a sovereign being but a sovereign good true faith true policy united ran that was but love of god and this of man who first taught souls enslaved and realms undone the enormous faith of many made for one that proud exception to all natures laws tinvert the world and counterwork its cause force first made conquest and that conquest law till superstition taught the tyrant awe then shared the tyranny and lent it aid and gods of conqurors slaves of subjects made she midst the lightnings blaze and thunders sound when rocked the mountains and when groaned the ground she taught the weak to bend the proud to pray to power unseen and mightier far than they she from the rending earth and bursting skies saw gods descend and fiends infernal rise here fixed the dreadful there the blessed abodes fear made her devils and weak hope her gods gods partial changeful passionate unjust whose attributes were rage revenge or lust such as the souls of cowards might conceive and formed like tyrants tyrants would believe zeal then not charity became the guide and hell was built on spite and heaven on pride then sacred seemed the ethereal vault no more altars grew marble then and reekd with gore then first the flamen tasted living food next his grim idol smeared with human blood with heavens own thunders shook the world below and played the god an engine on his foe so drives selflove throjust and through unjust to one mans power ambition lucre lust the same selflove in all becomes the cause of what restrains him government and laws for what one likes if others like as well what serves one will when many wills rebel how shall he keep what sleeping or awake a weaker may surprise a stronger take his safety must his liberty restrain all join to guard what each desires to gain forced into virtue thus by selfdefence even kings learned justice and benevolence selflove forsook the path it first pursued and found the private in the public good twas then the studious head or generous mind follower of god or friend of humankind poet or patriot rose but to restore the faith and moral nature gave before relumd her ancient light not kindled new if not gods image yet his shadow drew taught powers due use to people and to kings taught not to slack nor strain its tender strings the less and greater set so justly true that touching one must strike the other too and jarring interests of themselves create the according music of a wellmixd state such is the worlds great harmony that springs from union order full consent of things where small and great where weak and mighty made to serve not suffer strengthen not invade more powerful each as needful to the rest and in proportion as it blesses blessed draw to one point and to one center bring beast man or angel servant lord or king for forms of government let fools contest whatever is best administered is best for modes of faith let graceless zealots fight his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right all must be false that thwart this one great end and all of god that bless mankind or mend man like the generous vine supported lives the strength he gains is from the embrace he gives on their own axis as the planets run yet make at once their circle round the sun so two consistent motions act the soul and one regards itself and one the whole thus god and nature linked the general frame and bade selflove and social be the same   epistle iv o happiness our beings end and aim good pleasure ease content whatever thy name that something still which prompts the eternal sigh for which we bear to live nor fear to die which still so near us yet beyond us lies oerlookd seen double by the fool  and wise plant of caelestial seed if dropped below say in what mortal soil thou deignst to grow fairopening to some courts propitious shine or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine twined with the wreaths parnassian laurels yield or reaped in iron harvests of the field where grows  where grows it not  if vain our toil we ought to blame the culture not the soil fixed to no spot is happiness sincere it is no where to be found or every where it is never to be bought but always free and fled from monarchs st john dwells with thee ask of the learned the way the learned are blind this bids to serve and that to shun mankind some place the bliss in action some in ease those call it pleasure and contentment these who thus define it say they more or less than this that happiness is happiness one grants his pleasure is but rest from pain one doubts of all one owns even virtue vain take natures path and mad opinions leave all states can reach it and all heads conceive obvious her goods in no extreme they dwell there needs but thinking right and meaning well and mourn our various portions as we please equal is common sense and common ease remember man the universal cause  acts not by partial but by general laws and makes what happiness we justly call subsist not in the good of one but all there is not a blessing individuals find but some way leans and hearkens to the kind no bandit fierce no tyrant mad with pride no cavernd hermit rest selfsatisfyd who most to shun or hate mankind pretend seek an admirer or would fix a friend abstract what others feel what others think all pleasures sicken and all glories sink each has his share and who would more obtain shall find the pleasure pays not half the pain order is heavens first law and this confessed some are and must be greater than the rest more rich more wise but who infers from hence that such are happier shocks all common sense heaven to mankind impartial we confess if all are equal in their happiness but mutual wants this happiness increase all natures difference keeps all natures peace condition circumstance is not the thing bliss is the same in subject or in king in who obtain defense or who defend in him who is or him who finds a friend heaven breathes through every member of the whole one common blessing as one common soul but fortunes gifts if each alike possessed and each were equal must not all contest if then to all men happiness was meant god in externals could not place content fortune her gifts may variously dispose and these be called unhappy happy those but heavens just balance equal will appear while those are placed in hope and these in fear not present good or ill the joy or curse but future views of better or of worse oh sons of earth attempt ye still to rise by mountains pild on mountains to the skies heaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys and buries madmen in the heaps they raise know all the good that individuals find or god and nature meant to mere mankind reasons whole pleasures all the joys of sense lie in three words health peace and competence but health consists with temperance alone and peace fair virtue peace is all thy own the gifts of fortune good or bad may gain but these less taste them as they worse obtain say in pursuit of profit or delight who risque the most that take wrong means or right of vice or virtue whether blessed or cursed which meets contempt or which compassion first count all the advantage prosperous vice attains it is but what virtue flies from and disdains and grant the bad what happiness they would one they must want which is to pass for good oh blind to truth and gods whole scheme below who fancy bliss to vice to virtue woe who sees and follows that great scheme the best best knows his blessing and will most be blessed but fools the good alone unhappy call for ills or accidents that chance to all see falkland falls the virtuous and the just see godlike turenne prostrate on the dust see sidney bleeds amid the martial strife was this their virtue or contempt of life say was it virtue more though heaven never gave lamented digby sunk thee to the grave tell me if virtue made the son expire why full of days and honor lives the sire why drew marseilles good bishop purer breath when nature sickend and each gale was death or why so long in life if long can be lent heaven a parent to the poor and me what makes all physical or moral ill there deviates nature and here wanders will god sends not ill it is nature lets it fall or chance escape and man improves it all we just as wisely might of heaven complain that righteous abel was destroyed by cain as that the virtuous son is ill at ease when his lewd father gave the dire disease think we like some weak prince the eternal cause prone for his favorites to reverse his laws shall burning aetna if a sage requires forget to thunder and recall her fires on air or sea new motions be impressed o blameless bethel to relieve thy breast when the loose mountain trembles from on high shall gravitation cease if you go by or some old temple nodding to its fall for chartres head reserve the hanging wall but still this world so fitted for the knave contents us not a better shall we have a kingdom of the just then let it be but first consider how those just agree the good must merit gods peculiar care but who but god can tell us who they are one thinks on calvin heavens own spirit fell another deems him instrument of hell if calvin feel heavens blessing or its rod this cries there is and that there is no god what shocks one part will edify the rest nor with one system can they all be blessed give each a system all must be at strife what different systems for a man and wife the very best will variously incline and what rewards your virtue punish mine  whatever is is right  this world it is true was made for caesar  but for titus too and which more blessed who chained his country say or he whose virtue sighed to lose a day  but sometimes virtue starves while vice is fed what then is the reward of virtue bread that vice may merit it is the price of toil the knave deserves it when he tills the soil the knave deserves it when he tempts the main where madness fights for tyrants or for gain the good man may be weak be indolent nor is his claim to plenty but content but grant him riches your demand is over  no  shall the good want health the good want power add health and power and every earthly thing  why bounded power why private why no king nay why external for internal given why is not man a god and earth a heaven who ask and reason thus will scarce conceive god gives enough while he has more to give immense the power immense were the demand say at what part of nature will they stand what nothing earthly gives or can destroy the souls calm sunshine and the heartfelt joy is virtues prize a better would you fix and give humility a coach and six justice a conqurors sword or truth a gown or public spirit its great cure a crown rewards that either would to virtue bring no joy or be destructive of the thing how often by these at sixty are undone the virtues of a saint at twentyone for riches can they give but to the just his own contentment or anothers trust judges and senates have been bought for gold esteem and love were never to be sold o fool to think god hates the worthy mind the lover and the love of human kind whose life is healthful and whose conscience clear because he wants a thousand pounds a year honor and shame from no condition rise act well your part there all the honor lies fortune in men has some small difference made one flaunts in rags one flutters in brocade the cobbler aprond and the parson gownd the friar hooded and the monarch crowned  what differ more you cry than crown and cowl i will tell you friend a wise man and a fool you will find if once the monarch acts the monk or coblerlike the parson will be drunk worth makes the man and want of it the fellow the rest is all but leather or prunella stuck over with titles and hung round with strings that thou may be by kings or whores of kings thy boasted blood a thousand years or so may from lucretia to lucretia flow but by your fathers worth if yours you rate count me those only who were good and great go if your ancient but ignoble blood has crept through scoundrels ever since the flood go and pretend your family is young not own your fathers have been fools so long what can ennoble sots or slaves or cowards alas not all the blood of all the howards look next on greatness say where greatness lies  where but among the heroes and the wise heroes are much the same the points agreed from macedonias madman to the suede the whole strange purpose of their lives to find or make an enemy of all mankind not one looks backward onward still he goes yet never looks foreward further than his nose no less alike the politic and wise all sly slow things with circumspective eyes men in their loose unguarded hours they take nor that themselves are wise but others weak but grant that those can conquer these can cheat it is phrase absurd to call a villain great who wickedly is wise or madly brave is but the more a fool the more a knave who noble ends by noble means obtains or failing smiles in exile or in chains like good aurelius let him reign or bleed like socrates that man is great indeed what is fame that fancied life in others breath a thing beyond us even before our death just what you hear you have and what is unknown the same my lord if tullys or your own all that we feel of it begins and ends in the small circle of our foes or friends to all beside as much an empty shade an eugene living as a caesar dead alike or when or where they shone or shine or on the rubicon or on the rhine a wits a feather and a chief a rod an honest mans the noblest work of god fame but from death a villains name can save as justice tears his body from the grave when what to oblivion better were resigned is hung on high to poison half mankind all fame is foreign but of true desert plays round the head but comes not to the heart one selfapproving hour whole years outweighs of stupid starers and of loud huzzas and more true joy marcellus exiled feels than caesar with a senate at his heels in parts superior what advantage lies tell for you can what is it to be wise it is but to know how little can be known to see all others faults and feel our own condemned in business or in arts to drudge without a second or without a judge truths would you teach or save a sinking land all fear none aid you and few understand painful preeminence yourself to view above lifes weakness and its comforts too bring then these blessings to a strict account make fair deductions see to what they mount how much of other each is sure to cost how each for other often is wholly lost how inconsistent greater goods with these how sometimes life is risqud and always ease think and if still the things thy envy call say would thou be the man to whom they fall to sigh for ribbands if thou art so silly mark how they grace lord umbra or sir billy is yellow dirt the passion of thy life look but on gripus or on gripus wife if parts allure thee think how bacon shined the wisest brightest meanest of mankind or ravished with the whistling of a name see cromwell damned to everlasting fame if all united thy ambition call from ancient story learn to scorn them all there in the rich the honored famed and great see the false scale of happiness complete in hearts of kings or arms of queens who lay how happy those to ruin these betray mark by what wretched steps their glory grows from dirt and seaweed as proud venice rose in each how guilt and greatness equal ran and all that raised the hero sunk the man now europes laurels on their brows behold but stained with blood or ill exchanged for gold then see them broke with toils or lost in ease or infamous for plundered provinces oh wealth illfated which no act of same ever taught to shine or sanctified from shame what greater bliss attends their close of life some greedy minion or imperious wife the trophyd arches storyd halls invade and haunt their slumbers in the pompous shade alas not dazzled with their noontide ray compute the morn and evening to the day the whole amount of that enormous fame a tale that blends their glory with their shame know then this truth enough for man to know virtue alone is happiness below the only point where human bliss stands still and tastes the good without the fall to ill where only merit constant pay receives is blessed in what it takes and what it gives the joy unequaled if its end it gain and if it lose attended with no pain without satiety though ever so blessed and but more relished as the more distressed the broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears less pleasing far than virtues very tears good from each object from each place acquired for ever exercised yet never tired never elated while one mans oppressed never dejected while anothers blessed and where no wants no wishes can remain since but to wish more virtue is to gain see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow which who but feels can taste but thinks can know yet poor with fortune and with learning blind the bad must miss the good untaught will find slave to no sect who takes no private road but looks through nature up to natures god pursues that chain which links the immense design joins heaven and earth and mortal and divine sees that no being any bliss can know but touches some above and some below learns from this union of the rising whole the first last purpose of the human soul and knows where faith law morals all began all end in love of god and love of man for him alone hope leads from gole to gole and opens still and opens on his soul till lengthened on to faith and unconfined it pours the bliss that fills up all the mind he sees why nature plants in man alone hope of known bliss and faith in bliss unknown nature whose dictates to no other kind are given in vain but what they seek they find wise is the present she connects in this his greatest virtue with his greatest bliss at once his own bright prospect to be blessed and strongest motive to assist the rest selflove thus pushed to social to divine gives thee to make thy neighbors blessing thine is this too little for the boundless heart extend it let thy enemies have part grasp the whole worlds of reason life and sense in one close system of benevolence happier as kinder in whatever degree and height of bliss but height of charity god loves from whole to parts but human soul must rise from individual to the whole selflove but serves the virtuous mind to wake as the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake the center moved a circle strait succeeds another still and still another spreads friend parent neighbor first it will embrace his country next and next all humanrace wide and more wide the oerflowings of the mind take every creature in of every kind earth smiles around with boundless bounty blessed and heaven beholds its image in his breast come then my friend my genius come along oh master of the poet and the song and while the muse now stoops or now ascends to mans low passions or their glorious ends teach me like thee in various nature wise to fall with dignity with temper rise formed by thy converse happily to steer from grave to gay from lively to severe correct with spirit eloquent with ease intent to reason or polite to please o while along the stream of time thy name expanded flies and gathers all its fame say shall my little bark attendant sail pursue the triumph and partake the gale when statesmen heroes kings in dust repose whose sons shall blush their fathers were thy foes shall then this verse to future age pretend thou were my guide philosopher and friend that urged by thee i turned the tuneful art from sounds to things from fancy to the heart for wits false mirror held up natures light showed erring pride whatever is is right that reason passion answer one great aim that true selflove and social are the same that virtue only makes our bliss below and all our knowledge is ourselves to know gnothi seayton
