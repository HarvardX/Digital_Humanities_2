epistles to lorenzo  nec tardum operior nec praecedentibus insto london mdcclvi  advertisement the following sheets contain part of several epistolary rhimes written on different occasions and in different parts of europe the object of the whole would be to reconcile within the bounds of moderation the zealots and philosophers of the present age  the author is sensible the latter or as they are called the advocates for natural religion are the greater bigots of the two and that a superstitious attachment to infidelity is the masterpiece of enthusiasm the rapsodies of jacob boehmen being much more intelligible than the plain demonstrations of some modern if the truth of this observation be called in question the reader may turn for conviction to a late pamphlet called the light of nature the light of the gospel written by an author who for twenty years past has occasionally obliged the public with works of the same stamp freethinkers  to the end proposed therefore the means would be to establish on undisputed principles the certainty of those maxims which most affect the present and future happiness of mankind  with this view it is necessary the author should wear an assumed character and propose nothing but what reason common to all may allow in doing this then he would endeavor to show the principal defects and point out the limits of the understanding to prove a priori the source of good and evil the universal propriety of original sin and the moral necessity of that inseparable connection between happiness and misery virtue and vice the immortality of the soul being at the same time pointed out from arguments universally acknowledged and felt  such is the general design of the author that of the present publication is to inform himself how far this specimen may give the public room to think him capable of the whole or whether any part may be worth a finishing hand  by the public also he would be understood to mean the philosophical part of the world only for as to the gentlemen of the belles lettres he does not willinigly subject himself to their censure having chosen a poetical style for no worse reason than an incapacity to express the same sentiments better in any other confiding therefore in the wellbred humanity of such critics he hopes they will not put his verses to the horatian torture by pulling them to pieces to examine the disjecta membra poetae  epistle the first to lorenzo while zeal pursues beyond the grave whom priest nor patriot could save lost st john saved and damned by fame an honored and a blasted name lorenzo asks ingenuous youth what is and who beleives the truth lorenzo would thou learn of me truth is where all the world agree is there no point where all unite i answer none are in the right yet would thou know so skepticks err to whom enquiry may refer where trembling doubt and error blind at once a guard and guide may find at once successfully apply and give to falsehoods face the lie alas denied the perfect rule that serves alike the knave and fool alike the ignorant and the wise adoring these what those despise whether we judge from natures law that truth infallibly we draw or think the just criterion given in revelation pure from heaven it differs not unless we find some active index in the mind some ray of heavens unerring light to guide in this or that aright let christianity display it is wondrous volume to the day the sacred lines however true alike affect not me and you the accepted sense of holy writ still resting on the accepting wit for who that read but comprehend as taught by father priest or friend or tenets new more nice than wise peculiar to themselves devise how then prevails the sacred text if by the comment thus perplexed if heretics of every kind still in the word their gospel find still if the spirit hides the flaw that marrs the letter of the law let natures striking scenes engage the lettered and unlettered age no fixed ideas yet we find conveyed from hence to humankind when meteors shine or comets blaze behold the wondering crito gaze prognosticate in error wise the judgments gathering in the skies the aurora streaming from the pole what mighty fears his heart control see him confess his angry god and dread his mercies as his rod whilst thou blasphemer crito cries liftst up thine hand against the skies fearless in scientific pride on the wild whirlwinds wings would ride when thunder splits the clouds in twain or lightnings melt them into rain against heaven itself so mad to arm in magic steel you brave the storm with franklin impiously defy the thunderers red right arm on high bold titan take your mounted stand to wrest the lightenings from his hand thus by no certain instinct led we comprehend what is seen or read but from unlike experience taught peculiar are our modes of thought do pause when pleas of right or wrong to captious opponents belong while this affirmed or that denied with equal force on either side avoid lorenzo vain dispute it is empty triumph to confute no honor whets the champions blade truth warms no casuist by trade see the winged cork from side to side rebound the truant school boys pride with equal warmth with equal noise so disputants like truant boys between what saint or father says bang the light shittlecock of faith our first mistake lorenzo this all on their faith would found their bliss and here while flattering hope depends to truth presumptuous faith pretends thus contradictions are professed yet truth must be to all the test but tell me what connection ties so close the happy and the wise ah what avails the truth to know when truth the frequent source of woe while gilded fictions flattering rays with sunshine beautify our days or mildly shed it is silver beams reflected light our nightly dreams while pleasure and it is laughing train dance by the moonshine of the brain from hence does bliss or misery flow the truth to know or not to know for bliss in vain the learned explore swift as their search it flies before through every clime on every wind and leaves their panting wish behind o say what truth does science reach the infants peace of mind to teach o say what truth shall faith receive exclusive happiness to give in pope or mufti what is given but fear of hell and hope of heaven a view of future bliss or woe the guiding prospect here below if promised then seraphick skies or osmans sensual paradise or with the indian taught tascend to converse with a former friend still if the tenet moves to act words and opinions bow to fact to truth or knowledge unconfined the bliss or woe of humankind as happy those who blindly trust in pope or mufti if as just no more required by gracious heaven than to requiring man is given let calvin then selecting rave or luther souls unsorted save or peters heir deny the keys of heaven to heretics like these rejecting thou the vain abuse know every system has it is use or new or old or yours or mine subservient all to heavens design though truth from each be distant far as good hope from the polar star as parts to complex engines prove inspired by mechanism to move this retrogade and that direct in different modes to one effect so these or moral or divine in natures grand machine combine machine how vast how lost is man in natures wonderworking plan the reason this  we ever drew of nature a perspective view fixed to one station time and place in power no just survey to trace so individuals also draw their eye their rule their will their law no wonder then that wrong and right perplex from various points of sight that widely different both appear if viewed from thence or seen from here place lights with art the shades between and black and white the varying scene at points opposed each strikes the eyes and this affirms what that denies the demonstration of his sight who doubts who knows not black from white the proofs of both exactly suit and evidence supports dispute how madly then the world agree to rave at alien heresy heirs to religions brighter sphere how strangely damned and damning here halfwitted zeal of all the test itself condemning with the rest by sampsons rage so thousands lost fell but at blinded sampsons cost lorenzo is it thyself to please do covet truth in hopes of ease wouldst thou of future bliss or woe secure thy hopes and fears below be truth no more thy ardent search behold thy nostrum in the church faith by indulgent heaven designed to help the weak to lead the blind to check the rash to warn the bold taffright the young tamuse the old from our ownselves ourselves to save and bring us smiling to the grave askst thou what church by each confessed his own superior to the rest enquire of all  of all inquired their medium is the term desired do thou require this term of me go seek it in conformity at london pekin or peru a constant rule for ever true from hence deduce that golden mean each daggerdrawing church between nor doubt if here thou fixest right in half their difference all unite their half of difference if unknown will moderation make thine own hard is the task adventurous youth and bold thy enterprise for truth yet can thou bliss or ease forego and burns thy bosom but to know have in thine earlier hours been taught the generous fortitude of thought to set blind prejudice apart to rend the old woman from the heart to damn traditions idle rules the mother and the nurse of fools the ingenuous muse shall lead the way safe in the theme though rude the lay truth hopes not for poetic praise to fiction sacred are the bays epistle the second to lorenzo ruled by no giant hopes or fears whose stature grows with length of years in search of truth expect to find the labor suited to the mind with genius nature bearing part the strict yet gentle nurse of art for aim not thou a point to hit beyond the reach of human wit or join lorenzo blindly those who first would natures god disclose for say the voice of reason true be ours a just abstracted view be it the privilege of man to trace exactly natures plan the scale of beings in his hands to know the point at which he stands compared with all he boasts to know as well above him as below yet if of human logic vain he links to heaven a kindred chain man his conclusions idly draws and heaven prescribes by human laws imagine thou in what degree a seraph stands tween god and thee conceive thyself a mite unseen and being infinite between in this comparison says pride a seraph thou to god allied thy pride lorenzo disbeleive let lock nor addison deceive for though creations varied plan assigns degrees respecting man yet skeptic know and learn to fear god is beyond thy proper sphere created beings all his care does he with them creation share ah no the system all our own god the creator stands alone at equal distance all his plan the mite the seraph or the man is it not so the passive clay of yon corinthian column gay that gilt entablature or base or marble of yon shining vase resemble more the artists mind than if to meaner use consigned absurd is joness genius known by the great model or the stone the pile erect to trajans name affected not by empty fame the cross revered the honored bust and trodden floor are kindred dust for all in one degree respect their sovereign lord the architect how justly then so ever we plead that reason natures book does read as by it is known and written laws of each effect we trace the cause those laws can never themselves confine the legislative power divine whose will that order first decreed and bade the effect the cause succeed agent by some superior scheme of which in this we can but dream bear atticus the criticks rod in vain we then define a god in vain we attributes bestow or reason here from what we know though science teach religion warm what wild ideas still we form incongruous embrios of the brain that strive to scale the heavens in vain too short to reach beyond the sky the focus of the mental eye too cold our most transporting zeal to paint what heavens and light conceal yet will the skeptic ask me why go rise and to the dog star fly thou can not nor the cause unknown central attraction holds thee down a power occult which ever thy birth fast bound thee to thy native earth from which thou never can hope to rise to lunar plains or solar skies nor less within it is sphere confined the subtle essence of the mind though heaven has given it power to rove in freedom through the plains above has winged it is active feet to run with mercry round the central sun has given it distant worlds texplore and seas of space without a shore yet still within creations round within our narrow system bound of what is above or what without we harbor universal doubt say light prevails no contrast shade outlines the void we would pervade if darkness reigns no chearing ray delineates blind enquirys way hence mortal man must ever be thy author here unknown to thee destined thy erring way to trace through natures particolourd space let ignorance then her idol dress in justice love and happiness adorn with mercys golden chain with all the virtues grace it is train and then adore in humble plight and call those fopperies infinite the pagan thus despised as blind creates his idol to his mind thinking his deity expressed by bird or beast he likes the best then bows before it is painted shrine and calls his wooden god divine cast the presumptuous thought aside it is not humility but pride unless that truly humble we to adore the god humanity and such it is for whence arise our virtues but from moral ties whose known relations thus define that essence mortals call divine lorenzo ready for reply lay not thy prompt objection by thou say thy friend himself deceives nor god adores nor god beleives for though the mind the power descries if left it is by essence is meant here those attributes or qualities by which we define any known existence or distinguish it from any other essence in the skies if none believed or none displayed to what is adoration paid in me no certain faith is found my deity an empty sound not so for granting iconfess thy attributes a god express even thou wilt assert still undefind the perfect by the imperfect mind but to thy attributes must join thy infinite or thy divine as jugglers who tenhance deceit to sacred science give their cheat while with the curtain still they hide the slight of hand too closely eyed so here sly theologues impart the hocus pocus of their art and hold religions sacred veil where slights of understanding fail for know alas their wisest plan displays but a superior man whom infinite the conjurers rod presto converts into a god for till they solve our problem right and tell us what is infinite they still must be reduced to own their compound deity unknown to all or reasoning or inspired this infinite a term required differs lorenzo then with me in terms alone we disagree perfection infinite is thine indefinite perfection mine condemn not then halfunderstood i not deny that perfect good allgracious merciful and wise god reigns supreme beyond the skies neither it is true my terms imply but granting none i none deny requiring but to acquiesce that thou thy infinite express idly does bolingbroke refine granting that wisdom is divine while full as idly he denies justice and goodness to the skies ideas equally our own our goodness as our wisdoms known to both as hard to reconcile or natures frown or natures smile alas no attributes of thine can ever the deity define impossible to judge or know of god above from man below reserved the prospect of the skies to gratify immortal eyes lorenzo let us reason right no finite spans an infinite unless with matho versed in arts we hold the infinity of parts but none the absurdity will plan that god can be contained in man though as absurdly they suppose our qualities the god disclose joinst thou with florio the dispute tenhance each moral attribute pretending these however crude divine perfection does include as species in a genus they or parts which do the whole display so with the grandeur all tinspire of the gay mansion of his sire an idiot heir his mothers fool taught his synecdoche at school conceived by part the whole was shown and took a sample of the stone convinced does polydore with me that gods indefinite agree yet argue that our partial view may still be relatively true for if no abstract lights we gain it is just our best to entertain our god to call that wondrous cause in nature traced by natures laws mistake not here nor god dethrone be the first cause in nature known it is but a consequent effect whose cause no similars respect the god we then by this define nor self existent nor divine be known creations various ties whence physical relations rise explained distinct to mortal sense the wondrous scheme of providence say thou the knowledge hence derived of him those systems has contrived alas from hence we only trace the features of creations face the front it bears to humankind but not it is selfexisting mind should we presuming to display the spirit of the golden day thus call it is essence it is result attraction fire alike occult or say it is vegetation green whod think it is the sun we mean so here tabsurdity we fall nor thus define a god at all yet while to thee i freely own i reverence a god unknown think not through ignorance or pride a god was ever yet denied no the word atheist is here used to signify simply one who denies the being of a god atheist ever was known on earth till fiery zealots gave him birth for controversys sake their trade and damned the heretic they made does clody impudent and vain deny a god in skeptic strain and yet in ignorance advance that natures works were made by chance warm theologues absurdly wife with their anathemas despise for well may clody these inflame whose god exists but in a name a technic term devised at school i pity clody as a fool to epicurus strains belong the censures of an idle song for say united worlds might join by accident and not design  atoms might luckily contrive and strangely find themselves alive or by some other scheme as wild the world be fortunes favorite child explain the terms  say what is meant by atoms fortune accident what mean thou but thefficient cause of natures works and natures laws o think not then the eternal mind to term or epithet confined but take away or change the name and clodys god and mine is the same say thou in chance a power defined fortuitous absurd and blind unworthy that stupendous plan which natures scenes display to man where grace with harmony allied and wisdom strike on every side alas to clody these unknown for wondrous wisdoms all his own in nature nothing he surveys that actuates his soul to praise in vain the planets run their course obedient to attractions force theccentric comets far and wide pursue the same unerring guide in vain describes their varied race in equal times an equal space in vain through microscopic eyes innumerable wonders rise on the green leaf whole nations crawl and myriads perish in it is fall alas what bears the barren mind what beauty can affect the blind should clody then his chance disclaim and own a deity by name the blundering deist must advance a god no wiser than his chance how obvious is the truth and yet what learned volumes have been writ how scholiasts labor to confute what none do actually dispute of the first cause or fools or wise the pure existence none denies but in it is the word essence is here used in the sense above mentioned page    essence disagree for who defines infinity blush not lorenzo then to own the eternal god a god unknown whose face to mortal eye denied can never gratify thy pride to him your votive altars raise as athens did in ancient days nor dare pollute his sacred shrine with human sacrifice divine but humble adoration bring and silent praise fit offering so the peruvian pure in heart strange to the guile or guilt of art unawed by tenet text or tale erects his temple in the vale sacred to the universal mind the god and guide of humankind no firstlings here affront the skies nor clouds of smoking incense rise no hypocrite with acid face no convert tortured into grace no solid skull in wisdoms cowl no hooded hawk nor solemn owl nor blind nor ominous invade this spotless consecrated shade but as the native of the spray man hails his maker with the day by nature taught heaven asks no more in spirit and in truth to adore epistle the third to lorenzo nor to the fount of hippocrene nor groves of laurel ever green nor where the wanton graces stray with flowers is strewn the muses way lorenzo no i more rejoice at reasons rough and manly voice than at the sprightliest softest airs that ever tickled fancys cars though senseless echo found them sweet and bade the public voice repeat lorenzo systems thrown aside be reason then our honest guide the guide not only to the mind in science deep or sense refined but to the plain and honest given the first best artless gift of heaven reason that sees not but the sense of ciceronian eloquence the limits of our reason known to heaven resign it is honored throne on humbler wings but rise to know thy heaven on earth thy god below content to trace from natures laws the effects of an abstracted cause the cause of all the effects we see the all we mean by deity adapted thus enquirys plan to truths as relative to man know natures law no less extends to physical than moral ends what moves the fixed mechanic power to shed the soft refreshing shower that in the womb of teeming earth it is atoms quickens into birth does in the moral scene connect the cause and consequent effect hence vice the source of human woe as springs of streams that from them flow on virtue happiness depends as matter to the center tends nor less capricious to the sense physics indeed than providence conceive not then as skepticks dream that natures an imperfect scheme because perplexed with grief and pain man covets perfect bliss in vain say thou that man the work of heaven to him if imperfections given imperfect must that system be whose lord a being weak as he lorenzo let not words deceive all imperfections relative for of perfection absolute all nature is beyond dispute for all from god itself derives and all is perfect god contrives man surely perfect then you will cry as man most perfect i reply the creature of his makers will but formed his pleasure to fulfill designed in wide creations plan to fill the place and act as man for does capacity timprove perfection positive remove as well imperfect might thou say the rising sun at dawn of day since with superior heat and light it blazes in meridian height formed with progressive powers to rise in this even mans perfection lies perfect as such humanity however degraded in degree yet will thou say is man consigned to fill the place by heaven assigned impossible to rise or fall why feels he misery at all another question answers this what title have mankind to bliss correct ideas let us gain say what the misery of pain in vain lorenzo do thou here affected stoicism fear none feels more tenderly than i mine the soft heart and watery eye the sanguine hopes the needless fears yet unsubdued by sense or years yet ah how little understood mankinds imaginary good to heaven my grateful vows be paid that man in human frailty made that grief and ignorance my lot in joy and literature forgot or best remembered in the taste they give to improvements rich repast no transport ever had fired my breast if born of sciences possessed as when by native genius fired to early knowledge i aspired by slow degrees instructed grew as nature opened to my view to the weak eye as hope was given hope that directs the soul to heaven hence though no stoic i conceive all joy and pain comparative the glow of health the bliss of ease had never boasted charms to please nor cordial draught nor downy bed had ever revived the drooping head had sickness pale and trembling grief never wished for wearied eyes relief see belmont on the sofa laid what racking pains his limbs invade take half his gout the respite given he calls a blissful taste of heaven give but a youth dispersing wealth who riots on the bloom of health that blissful part which yet remains and his were hells distracting pains pains which no aggravation know and yet so relative our woe inflict them when by chloes kiss the amorous youth dissolves in bliss even these distracting pains were worse a mortals most embitterd curse in by mental sorrows are here meant those reflections or uneasy sensations which are vulgarly supposed sometimes to attend the perfect health of the body mental sorrows thus our grief seeks but comparative releif the trifling cares that you despise to some momentous miseries ah me what threatening danger nigh why swells the tear from delias eye ah whence proceeds this sad distress from the insignificance of dress thus even to circumstance we owe the difference of bliss and woe pleasure and pain as light and shade by one the other still displayed o what capricious joy and strife attend the various scenes of life to wield the scythe with sweaty brow to turn the soil beneath the plough to sow in hope and reap in joy thine labor is the sweet employ stranger to hope from want secure lifes easy burden to endure to eat the grape nor prune the vine laborious idleness is thine yet idleness of care complains and labor quarrels with it is pains how sunk and terrible to thee the hollow eye of poverty while villius meets her with a smile and sings or whistles all the while though worn his hands perplexed his head he relishes the sweets of bread and many a time in pleasant rue dances for joy without a shoe nor less thy woes nor more thy joy since equal cares thy peace destroy since wanting never thou never have tried the effects of being satisfied in plenty little more enjoyed than the dull bliss of being cloyed the child of penury but ease as of satiety disease disease that takes our lives by stealth and makes a beggary of wealth when fortune made thee rich and gay it gave the anxiety for play bade with thy hawk thine acres fly thy freehold totter with the die not greater care poor villius knows as blessed in nothing he can lose thus plenty giving bread more white but steals the whet of appetite a blessing plainly halfaccurst that gives me wine but steals my thirst lorenzo farther might we go and prove still nearer bliss and woe to each inseparably joined alternate regents in the mind yet so precarious in their reign bliss tyrannizes into pain and when to cruel pain we bow it is rod grows light we know not how the tension of the extended nerve say physiologists may serve this seeming paradox texplain the affinity of joy and pain as strung the harp with trembling wire with nerves so strung the human lyre in healthful concord tuned they say pleasures harmonious concert play but if their tension more or less from passion sickness or distress most tremblingly alive all over the strings in discord charm no more but jarring plays the ungrateful strain with harpysingers deafning pain deduce we then lorenzo hence that joys and pains are modes of sense as tunes in music where each note the simple gamut has by rote and adventitiously combined please or displease but as they are joined should also passion sense or art wind up too high the nervous part the tuneful notes in noise expire or breaking strings unman the lyre for as excess of joy or grief finds in a tear the same releif the rapture of cleoras kiss inflicts the racking pain of bliss the effect the same while both destroy exquisite pain extatic joy theme of continual dispute no relative is absolute no error such conceived by man a blunder is in natures plan nor dare we impiously pretend ills absolute from god descend the question old unanswered lies from whence did moral evil rise thou say if power to stand was given man had not fell the care of heaven no tempter known to lead to vice serpent nor eve in paradise lorenzo in the pride of sense instruction is impertinence she therefore daughter of the wife has long been sheltered in disguise entering beneath the mask of sport the presence tho forbid the court so fond with young delight to stray and moralize the wantons play that even her precepts still prevail in every savrite gossips tale yet so that those her arts would learn may the allegorys face discern the moral then from tales deduct and let philosophy instruct here the grand error that we make morals for physicals we take like those half mad amphibious wits who jumble in their learned fits effects and causes each for either god man heaven earth and all together fire spirit virtue mixture rare with darkness soluble in air to hutchinsonian idiots leave what none but idiots can conceive nor think thou moral ill exists and battles in creations lists a formal enemy to man since natures monarchy began a being physical or power active poor mortals to devour for it is impossible a cause should counteract creations laws as one or other must prevail and one or both together fail believe me then what ill we call is no abstracted cause at all for stripped creation of mankind no moral ill were left behind owing to the human breast it is rise for mans first moral action vice lorenzo state the matter clear be pain and pleasure strangers here strangers to pleasure and to pain induce what motives to complain for had we never been grieved or pained of vice we never had complained suppose we then in natures plan texist the microcosm of man asleep in senseless matters arms which perfect rest nor grieves nor charms should heaven a conscious mind inspire where reason checks and passions sire nor pain inflict nor pleasure give but wake the form alone to live unnervd by hope unawed by fear alike from all reflections clear suppose to action then consigned this naked unaffected mind lorenzo with precision hence let us infer the consequence behold the source of moral ill the prior agent was the will reason without the power to act to censure or advise a fact as by experience naught it knew of good or bad or false or true for reason it is conclusions draws from similar effect and cause no instinct faculty or sense that promptly dictates innocence that bids us virtues steps pursue or points to bliss it never knew for giving reason then had heaven no less than actual pleasure given this not supposed  hence reasons use some known effect must introduce now if as we admit of few received principles nor would this have been admitted so easily had it not been what those philosophers who doubt of almost every thing else will readily agree to innate we maintain a love of bliss and hate of pain directed as the passions fired the will to pleasure first aspired if pleasure was the point attained of pain an equal sense was gained as the first tree of knowledge bore of good and evil equal store for when the mind one pleasure knew it is state of perfect rest withdrew no neutral sense it might retain as less than pleasure now was pain thus felt the initiated mind the sting which pleasure left behind and reason did to act commence on the information of the sense if justly then we are taught to know vice as the precedent of woe what deeds from passion take their rise must needs in consequence be vice in guilt original involved here see the mystery resolved to the first man no more confined than passions found in every mind is the first cause of grief and pain and vices hatred horrid train as mans the source so mans the end ourselves our crimes alone offend is heavens premeditated woe heaven needs no friend nor fears a foe has no vindictive rage in store for it is own sake on man to pour blessed in himself the almighty cause or kept or broken human laws for know vain man no act of thine renders defective gods design no power to human frailty given to controvert the will of heaven presume not at so high a price to rate the iniquity of vice nor let the vainlyvirtuous fool projecting heaven by line and rule sorelashd and wasting to the bone the crime of healthier days tatone conceive by want of rest or meat the eternal purpose to defeat presume not at so low a rate to value the decrees of fate even such in physics are the fools puzzled beyond the maze of schools who boast a power or power to form would natures fortress take by storm with martial engines stranger far than those of archimedes were madmen monro could never cure of circles and their quadrature of thinking drunk creation reels like a slung coach on springs and wheels yet say not therefore guilt is free or promise crimes impunity since it is ordained the sting of woe to bliss inordinate shall grow that each false pleasure bring it is pain and every vice it is kindred train lorenzo evil understood how near the source of moral good twas reason taught us this to prize for reason virtue did devise know pleasures which the passions taste in haste are won are lost in haste while their equivalent of pains long the tenacious mind retains hence did not reason check below the will would work continual woe reason bestowed a common friend not to keep faultless but amend to lead selflove a glutton blind which else nor hopes nor fears could bind to give it is scene of action light and check each sensual appetite the bliss of social love to share and passions blunders to repair caelestial guide o give my youth to enjoy thy lovelier sister truth for whose embrace my vows i pay in ardent sighs the enquiring day nor when enquiring day is over cease by the midnight lamp to pore over the dull tale or tedious page of saint or more laborious sage happy if saint or sage could tell where i with her might ever dwell with thee bright truth for whom alone my genius for the verse be known content for thee to change the bays the poets for thy lovers praise
