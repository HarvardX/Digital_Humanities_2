and death shall be no more these grateful share the gift of natures hand and in the varied scenes that round them shine the fair the rich the awful and the grand admire the amazing workmanship divine blows not a floweret in the enameled vale shines not a pebble where the rivulet strays sports not an insect on the spicy gale but claims their wonder and excites their praise for them even vernal nature looks more gay for them more lively hues the fields adorn to them more fair the fairest smile of day to them more sweet the sweetest breath of morn they feel the bliss that hope and faith supply they pass serene the appointed hours that bring the day that wafts them to the realms on high the day that centres in eternal spring spring a rural song by mr tho brerewood when approached by the fair dewy fingers of spring swelling buds open first and look gay when the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing and are danced by the breeze on each spray when gently descending the rain in soft showers with its moisture refreshes the ground and the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers like rich gems beam a luster around when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe and the cuckoo proclaims with his voice that nature marks this for the season to woo and for all that can love to rejoice in a cottage at night may i spend all my time in the fields and the meadows all day with a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime young as april and blooming as may when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn may my fairest and i sweetly wake view the far distant hills which the sunbeams adorn then arise and our cottage forsake when the sun shines so warm that my charmer and i may recline on the turf without fear let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy while we breathe the first sweets of the year be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side bubble out and transparently flow creep gently along in meanders and glide through the vale strowd with daisies below while the be flies from blossom to blossom and sips and the violets their sweetness impart let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips the rich cordial that thrills to the heart while the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate which the fowler has caught in his snares may we think ourselves blessed that it is not our fate to endure such an absence as theirs may i listen to all her soft tender sweet notes when she sings and no sounds interfere but the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats are at strife to be louder than her when the daises and cowslips and primroses blow and checquer the meads and the lawns may we see bounding there the swift lightfooted do and pursue with our eyes the young fawns when the lapwings just fledged over the turf take their run and the firstlings are all at their play and the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun let us then be as frolic as they when i talk of my love should i chance to espy that she seems to mistrust what i say by a tear that is ready to fall from her eye with my lips let me wipe it away if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes and let no single beauty escape but see none to create so much love and surprise as her eyes and her face and her shape thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves and the meadows around us are mown when the lass on the sweet smelling haycock receives what she afterward blushes to own when evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads with the dew then no longer well roam with my arm round her waist in a path through the meads let us hasten to find our way home when the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings each one by the side of its mate when a mist that arises a drowziness brings upon all but the owl and the bat when soft rest is required and the stars lend their light and all nature lies quiet and still when no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night but at distance the clack of a mill with peace for our pillow and free from all noise so that voices in whispers are known let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys that are mused on by lovers alone the violet hail blooming daughter of the youthful year sweet to the smell and pleasing to the sight how does thy presence gloomy nature cheer and fill the bosom with a soft delight at thy approach stern rugged winter flies to pour his anger on the frozen north while balmy zephyrs fill our peaceful skies and call the buds and genial blossoms forth the lark highmounting at the rise of day salutes the blushing morn with gladsome notes the little warblers hop from spray to spray and trill wild music through their tuneful throats the shepherd counts his flock the rustic ploughs the farmer views with joy his springing corn the milkmaid drains the sweetlysmelling cows and sings the pleasures of the april morn now lovers now the golden minute seize in every word express a generous care in every act be studious how to please and weave the flowery chaplet for the fair pleased with the beauties of the rifled mead their smell her sense their colors strike her eye snowdrops like innocence in white arrayed and violets

assumed her loveliest fairest look cold chilling frosts and noxious damps were fled when jolly spring his native skies forsook to woo fair flora to his fertile bed gay dressed in all the colors of the bow he sought the goddess in her fair abode quick winds and hasty showers his coming show but his bright beams proclaim the present god the fanning gales convey a grateful smell from where the hyacinth and crocus blow with sudden life the buds around him swell and where he treads all flowers promiscuous grow the feathered songsters full of joy appear and chant his nuptial bliss through every grove spring the gay god that leads the smiling year and flora queen of beauty and of love from this unblamd this chaste delight arose an offspring worthy of their mutual flame invoked lucina eased the mothers throes and violetta was the daughters name whatever enraptured poets have designed of wit youth beauty or excelling grace the nymph enjoyed in person and in mind so bright her wit so beauteous was her face alas what ills must careless nymphs betide since prudence naught avails to guard the dame lascivious pan the blooming virgin eyed and vowed by force to gratify his flame the virtuous fair his loathed embraces flies the amorous god pursues with equal speed the plains around reecho to her cries while every power is absent from her aid fatigued her panting bosom heaves for breath her trembling legs refuse the tedious race she faints she sinks into the arms of death and a cold paleness overspreads her face her melancholy fate the mother mourns with tears fastflowing in a gentle shower the muchlamented child to life returns no more a virgin but a purple flower as long as grief for innocence distressed as long as tears from gentle hearts shall flow so long her fate shall melt the feeling breast with generous pity and with virtuous woe the gentle nymph the mournful story hears within her bosom various passions move soft pity melts her tender soul to tears and virtuous pity is a friend to love the progress of poetry by mrs madan vitis ut arboribus decori est ut vitibus uvae ut gregibus tauri segetes ut pinguibus arvis tu decus omne tuis virg unequal how

assist my numbers and enlarge my heart direct my lyre and tune each trembling string while poetrys exalted charms i sing how free as air her strains spontaneous move kindle to rage or melt the soul to love how her first emanations dawned disclose and where great source of verse bright phoebus first arose where nature warmth and genius has denied in vain are arts stiff languid powers applied unforced the muses smile above control no art can tune the inharmonious soul some rules it is true unerring you may cull and void of life be regularly dull correctly flat may flow each studied rhyme and each low period indolently chime a common ear perhaps or vulgar heart such lays may please the labored work of art far other strains delight the polished mind the ear well judging and the taste refined to blend in heavenly numbers ease and fire an addison will ask a pope require genius alone can force like theirs bestow as stars unconscious of their brightness glow hail greece from whence the spark etherial came that wide over earth diffused its sacred flame there the first laurel formed a deathless shade and sprung immortal for thy homers head there the great bard the rising wonder wrought and pland the iliad in his boundless thought by no mean steps to full perfection grew but burst at once refulgent to the view who can unmoved the warm description read where the winged shaft repels the bounding steed where the torn spoils of the rapacious war with shocking pomp adorn the victors car when from some hostile arm dismissed the reed on the marked foe directs its thirsty speed such strength such action strikes our eager sight we view and shudder at its fatal flight we hear the straightend yew recoiling start and see through air glide swift the whizzing dart when higher themes a bolder strain demand life waits the poets animating hand there where majestic to the sanguind field stern ajax stalks behind his sevenfold shield or where in polished arms severely bright pelides dreadful rushes to the fight with martial ardor breathes each kindling page the direful havoc and unbounded rage the clash of arms tumultuous from afar and all that fires the heros soul to war bold pindar next with matchless force and fire divinely careless waked the sounding lyre unbound by rule he urged each vigorous lay and gave his mighty genius room to play the grecian games employ his daring strings in numbers rapid as the race he sings mark muse the conscious shade and vocal grove where sappho tuned her melting voice to love while echo each harmonious strain returned and with the soft complaining lesbian mourned with roses crowned on flowers supinely laid anacreon next the sprightly lyre essayed in light fantastic measures beat the ground or dealt the mirthinspiring juice around no care no thought the tuneful teian knew but marked with bliss each moment as it flew behold the soil where smooth clitumnus glides and rolls through smiling fields his ductile tides where swollen eridanus in state proceeds and tardy mincio wanders through the meads where breathing flowers ambrosial sweets distill and the soft air with balmy fragrance fill o italy though joyful plenty reigns and nature laughs amid thy bloomy plains though all thy shades poetic warmth inspire tune the rapt soul and fan the sacred fire those plains and shades shall reach the appointed date and all their fading honors yield to fate thy wide renown and everblooming fame stand on the basis of a nobler claim in thee his harp immortal virgil strung of shepherds flocks and mighty heroes sung see horace shaded by the lyric wreath where every grace and all the muses breathe where courtly ease adorns each happy line and pindars fire and sapphos softness join politely wise with calm wellgoverned rage he lashed the reigning follies of the age with wit not spleen indulgently severe to reach the heart he charmed the listening ear when soothing themes each milder note employ each milder note swells soft to love and joy smooth as the famepresaging vide hor lib iii ode iv doves that spread prophetic wreaths around his infant head ye numerous bards unsung whose various lays a genius equal to your own should praise forgive the muse who feels an inbred flame resistless to exalt her countrys fame a foreign clime she leaves  and turns her eyes where her own britains favorite towers arise where thames rolls deep his plenteous tides around his banks with thick ascending turrets crowned yet not these scenes the impartial muse could boast were liberty thy great distinction lost britannia hail over whose luxuriant plain for the free natives waves the ripening grain twas sacred libertys celestial smile first lured the muses to thy generous isle twas liberty bestowed the power to sing and bid the verserewarding laurel spring here chaucer first his comic vein displayed and merry tales in homely guise conveyed unpolished beauties graced the artless song though rude the diction yet the sense was strong to smoother strains chastising tuneless prose in plain magnificence great spencer rose in forms distinct in each creating line the virtues vices and the passions shine subservient nature aids the poets rage and with herself inspires each nervous page exalted shakespeare with a boundless mind ranged far and wide a genius unconfined the passions swayed and captive led the heart without the critics rules and void of art so some fair clime by smiling phoebus blessed and in a thousand charms by nature dressed where limpid streams in wild meanders flow and on the mountains towering forests grow with lovely landscapes lures the ravished sight while each new scene supplies a new delight no industry of man no needless toil can mend the rich uncultivated soil while cowleys lays with sprightly vigor move around him wait the gods of verse and love so quick the crouding images arise the bright variety distracts our eyes each sparkling line where fire with fancy flows the rich profusion of his genius shows to waller next my wondering view i bend gentle as flakes of feathered snow descend not the same snow its silent journey done more radiant glitters in the rising sun o happy nymph who could those lays demand and claim the care of this immortal hand in vain might age thy heavenly form invade and over thy beauties cast an envious shade waller the place of youth and bloom supplies and gives exhaustless luster to thy eyes each muse assisting rifles every grace to paint the wonders of thy matchless face thus when at greece divine apelles strove to give to earth the radiant queen of love from each bright nymph some dazzling charm he took this fair ones lips anothers lovely look each beauty pleased a smile or air bestows till all the goddess from the canvas rose immortal milton hail whose lofty strain with conscious strength does vulgar themes disdain sublime ascended thy superior soul where neither lightnings flash nor thunders roll where other suns drink

whose rich stream a thousand floods are lost the strong the soft the moving and the sweet in artful drydens various numbers meet awed by his lays each rival bard retired so fades the moon pale lifeless unadmird when the bright sun bursts glorious on the sight with radiant luster and a flood of light the comic muse with lively humor gay in congreves strains does all her charms display she rallies each absurd impertinence and without labor laughs us into sense the follies of mankind she sets to view in scenes still pleasing and for ever new sure heaven that destined william to be great the mighty bulwark of the british state the scourge of tyrants guardian of the law bestowed a garth designing a nassau wit ease and life in prior blended flow polite as granville soft as moving row granville whose lays unnumberd charms adorn serene and sprightly as the opening morn row who the spring of every passion knew and from our eyes called forth the opening dew still shall his gentle muse our souls command and our warmed hearts confess his skilful hand be this the least of his superior fame whose happy genius caught great lucans flame where noble pompey dauntless meets his doom and each free strain breathes liberty and rome o addison lamented wondrous bard the godlike heros great his best reward not all the laurels reaped on blenheims plains a fame can give like thy immortal the campaign strains while cato dictates in thy awful lines caesar himself with second luster shines as our raised souls the great distress pursue triumphs and crowns still lessen in our view we trace the victor with disdainful eyes and all that made a cato bleed despise the bold pindaric and soft lyric muse breathed all her energy in tuneful hughes music herself did on his lines bestow the polished luster and enchanting flow his sweet cantatas and melodious song shall ever warble on the skilful tongue when nobler themes a loftier strain require his bosom glowed with more than mortal fire not see mr hughess ode entitled an ode to the creator of the world occasioned by the fragments of orpheus orpheus self could in sublimer lays have sung the omnipotent creators praise damascus moving fate displayed to view from every eye the ready tribute drew the attentive ear the bright characters in his tragedy entitled the siege of damascus eudocia charms and with the generous love of virtue warms she seems above the ills she greatly bears while characters in his tragedy entitled the siege of damascus phocyas woes command our gushing tears characters in his tragedy entitled the siege of damascus abudah shines a pattern to mankind in him the hero and the man are joined high on the radiant list see pope appears with all the fire of youth and strength of years wherever supreme he points the nervous line nature and art in bright conjunction shine how just the turns how regular the draught how smooth the language how refined the thought secure beneath the shade of early bays he dared the thunder of great homers lays a sacred heat informed his heaving breast and homer in his genius stands confessed to heights sublime he raised the ponderous lyre and our cold isle grew warm with grecian fire fain would i now the excelling bard reveal and point the seat where all the muses dwell where phoebus has his warmest smiles bestowed and who most labors with the inspiring god but while i strive to fix the ray divine and round that head the laureled triumph twine unnumberd bards distract my dazzled sight and my first choice grows faint with rival light so the white road that streaks the cloudless skies when silver cynthias temperate beams arise thick set with stars over our admiring heads one undistinguished streamy twilight spreads pleased we behold from heavens unbounded height a thousand orbs pour forth promiscuous light while all around the spangled luster flows in vain we strive to mark which brightest glows from each the same enlivening splendors fly and the diffusive glory charms the eye to the memory of mr hughes by the same round hughess humble thodistinguishd urn the muses wreathed with baleful cypress mourn in every face a deep distress appears each eye overflows with tributary tears such was the scene when by the gods required majestic homer from the world retired such grief the nine on maros tomb bestowed for addison such sorrow lately flowed snatched from the earth above its trifling praise thee hughes to happier climes thy fate conveys eased of its load thy active spirit flies from orb to orb and glides along the skies the toils of life the pangs of death are over and care and pain and sickness are no more o may that spot which holds thy dear remains the noblest spoil earths spacious breast contains its tribute pay may richest flowers around spring lightly forth and mark the sacred ground there may the bay her shady honors spread and over thy urn delightful odours shed immortal as thy fame and writings grow till these shall cease to live or thames to flow nature subdued foretold the great decline and every heart was plunged in grief but thine thy soul serene the conflict did maintain and traced the phantom death through years of pain not years of pain thy steady mind alarmed by judgment strengthened and by virtue armed still like yourself when sinking life ebbed low you neither dared nor meanly feared the blow loose to the world by every grace possessed greatly resigned you sought the stranger rest fearless of fate thus thy own phocyas died when from his wound gushed forth the purple tide drawn by thy pen the theory we see the practic part too soon we learn from thee who now shall touch the lyre with skill divine or who to tuneful airs shall tuneful numbers join who shall the rapid tide of vice control at once enchant the sense and mend the soul in whom shall the fair sisterarts unite with virtue solid sense and boundless wit such was the turn of thy exalted mind sparkling as polished gems as purest gold refined great ruler of our passions who with art subdued the fierce and warmed the frozen heart bid glory in our breasts with temper beat and genuine valor free from feverish heat bid love in all its native luster rise and in eudocias form delight our eyes virtue distressed thy happy lines disclose with more of triumph than a conqueror knows touched by thy hand our stubborn tempers bend and flowing tears the wellwrought scene attend that silent eloquence thy power approved the cause so great twas generous to be moved what pleasure can the bursting heart possess in the last parting and severe distress can fame wealth honor titles joy bestow and make the laboring breast with transport glow these gaudy trifles gild our dawning light but oh how weak their influence on our night then fame wealth honor titles vainly bloom nor dart one gleam of comfort on the tomb the only joy the struggling soul receives is in the applause that conscious virtue gives this cordial joy retiring hughes possessd this cheered his dying hours composed his breast and soothed his pure and peaceful soul to rest free from the bigots fear or stoics pride serene he lived and as serenely died when on lifes utmost verge he dauntless stood dy to plunge and seize the immortal good collecting all his scattered rays in one his last the siege of damascus exalted work intensely shone his living sentiments there sketchd we viewed but while our eyes the shining path pursued and wondrous heights his towering muse had gained alas the shining path alone remained so when the sun to worlds unknown retires how strong how boldly shoot his parting fires larger his setting orb our eyes confess eager we gaze and the full glory bless as over the heaven sublime his course extends with equal pomp the

sat and his ungarterd hose of each lean limb half hide and half expose his cheek he leaned upon his hand below his nutbrown slipper hung upon his toe now with abstracted flight he climbs apace high and more high through pure unbounded space now mere privation fails the wings of thought he drops down headlong through the vast of naught a friendly vapor mathesis supplies born on the surging smoke he joys to rise matter through modes and qualities pursues now caught entranced its naked essence views now wakes the vision fading from his sight leaves doubts behind the mists of mental night

attend among them one whom long experience blessed with a mechanic head above the rest he formed the ruff in good elizas days and first confined the slender waist in stays he first with beautyspots adorned the maid and bid her borrow luster from their shade he knit the loversknot in times of old and formed the circle of the bridal gold he on the ear first hung the sparkling rings his was the tucker his the kissingstrings he first in canvas hoop enclosed the maid turned the round coif and raised the stiffend head while other loves the paste or packthread brought drew out the plan and built the bird in thought he sought the wand which first her grandsire bore the expressive ensign of the sheriffs power this next the infant dian active strode and round the parlour fancied journeys rode its mane like gold in glittering tinsel spread and painted streamers nodded over its head but now miss molly with becoming speed pressed with her wanton weight the nimble reed artful he tempts the little fair to stay and steals the longdescended gift away his useful theft the winged band approve fair dian smiled and thus began the love  ah generous victor spare one useful toy  ah let us once again the bow enjoy  those eyes alone can greater mischiefs do  want not our skill and wound without our bow  be thine the turtles be the sparrows thine  and keep the quiver  but the bow resign  crowned with its arch marias horse shall rise  and trail thy labors through the wondering skies thus he nor sued in vain the maid gave ear and with a graceful nod received his prayer and now disrobed of all its useless pride firm to the bow the pliant reed she tied as when some full but distant mark in view with stretchdout arm the parthian draws his yew the string declining from its closing ends obliquely to the arrows head descends so sell the cord so stood the captive steed by dians hand to rise for nobler flights decreed the little loves not idle by her side for various works the manuscript divide those over the surface spread its leaves while these collect the sacred relics for the stays exulting cupid too his tribute brings and waves on high the deeplyscollopd wings with art

griefs attend at once his hope his joy and labor end the volume fails  and still unfinished lies the bird of love still wants a tail to rise but while around the imperfect work they wait or by the silent maid all pensive sat hermes so bids the laughterlovingdame like an old justice of the quorum came a dark fullbottomd wig his temples shades and over his shoulders venerably spreads an ancient cane his steady footsteps guide and an old sword stuck stiffly by his side with a long file of senateacts he came these taxed the land  and those secured the game in dians skilful hand he left the prize and quick as thought shot upward to the skies with cautious skill the shining steel she guides and in small remnants hermes gift divides speeches of kings came flourished from her hand and furled like heros plumes their edicts stand laws hung like cambrick on the wrists of beaux and annas acts looked like her furbeloes these nicelygatherd on her lace she strung and on the bird decrees of nations hung of proclamations next a dome she frames enclosed within a living taper flames through equal folds its wanton blazes play and wavy rounds transmit the silver ray cupid with reverence receives the prize a thousand transports sparkling in his eyes  and shall great actions public triumphs grace  and does thy work he cried deserve them less  when python by apollos arm lay slain  and stretched his livid body over the plain  revolving seasons did the deed proclaim  and spoke the conquest in the pythian game  in every age this just reward was due  and roman games as roman heroes grew  but still to love proceed no solemn shows  no myrtle garland binds the victors brows  hence then shall the gay youth and active maid  in merry gambols fly over this with the following episode refers to the riddle little white nancy etc nancys head  for know that trembling light which glimmers there  was nancy once a maid like dian fair  when merry sports the hoary season brings  and raises hinds from slaves to shortlived kings  when rose the circling monarchy obtains  and dreadful whiskers mark disloyal swains  this sure at least may nancys memory claim  and dians work demand a winter evenings game thus spoke the god then spread his golden wings and over the waving taper active springs fair venus sons the great example view and over the light their vaulting chief pursue but say my muse since thou alone can tell how nancy lived and how lamented fell nancy a virgin of the vestal train hymen in marriage sought but sought in vain in vain he strove with all his joys to move and warm her marble breast to nuptial love the nymph regardless of his prayers and sighs from his embraces pale and panting flies the god pursued  and now had reached the fair as thus she cried  o holy vesta hear  let nancy still amid thy maiden choir  from hymen free preserve thy living fire she said  and sudden to a taper turned and in his circling arms still trembling burned  yet shall thou stubborn maid enraged he cried  at all my weddingfeasts attend the bride  wherever hymens called thou too be there  a witness to those joys thou would not share thus he  and on his nancy silent gazed as her white petticoat around her blazed so great alcides from the world retired and flaming in the magicshirt expired canto iii argument one of the loves is sent to aeolus for a prosperous gale to fly the

anxious thoughts oppressed ceased from his sport and thus the loves addressed  thus far have jove and fate propitious shone  our bird is finished and one labor done  its safety is our next our chiefest care  while high it soars through pathless fields of air  to guard it from the whirlwinds rapid power  or careful shield it from the treacherous shower  will aeolus implored refuse his aid  or jove deny when love and dian plead scarce had he ended but a love withdrew and on the wings of generous duty flew nor tarried till he reached the distant cells where the hoarse winds imperious tyrant dwells here breathed the south that falls in genial showers and gentle zephyrs crowned with vernal flowers there blew the east that buttons breasts of beaux and over cloes neck the tippet throws or with the north in dreadful union raves whirls over the main and rolls the madding waves so if great things may be compared with small and troubled oceans to a jug of ale when tattle heats the drink that cheers her soul and to her tooth prepares the groaning bowl her giddy hands the mingling fluids shake and the white bubbles over the the surface break unnumberd virgins crowd on every side to various punishments condemned for pride belinda here her pins and powder tries and the dear glass with fruitless labor eyes behind her chair the ruffling north attends and ever discomposes as she mends raw vapors steam around the cruel fair and winds that whistle nothing but despair there amoret cold piercing blasts pursue and stain her nose with everlasting blue others whose hoops unwary youths enflamed here run  o l  d so rumpled and ashamed through these the love and not regardless went as onward to the monarchs throne he bent the merchant here his ready aid implores and asks a brighter gale from indias shores there luckless hero for a calm entreats while her leander tempts the fatal streights and blackeyed susan with impatience burns to know how soon sweet williams ship returns whilst aeol midst his guards in awful state arrayed in furr like russias sovereign sat his stretchdout arm dispensing prosperous gales to fame and conquest swells britannias sails now all was hushed and love his silence broke and thus the windcompelling king bespoke  if ever dians beauty reached thy cell  if ever thine eye beheld the sportive belle  when the fair huntress foremost of the train  grew to her steed and scowerd along the plain  if aeol then in conscious rapture strayed  and round her neck in glad confusion played  if then with greedy joy her lips he pressed  rumpled her tucker and unveiled her breast  that hand that did so often thy bliss reprove  gives to thy charge this day the bird of love  let zephyrs then in active whispers breathe  but every other wind be still as death  this fan be thine and such in love its power  not jove in all his shapes ever boasted more  when future passions shall thy breast invade  be this the present to the favorite maid  its sheet unfurled reveals a scene of gold  and love in ambush lies in every fold  soon as her hand these painted altars raise  the nymph not vainly with my arrows plays  this ever shall new thoughts of thee suggest  and bear thee to her lips and waft thee to her breast thus he  and the grim monarch of the wind in swelling bags a happy gale confined with these well fraught the love returns to day and back to dian wings his liquid way now with the bird she seeks the flowery meads pancies and dazies spring wherever she treads the little loves around with decent pride hang on her hoop and triumph by her side lo mid the ranks superior cupid moves and issues out his orders to the loves to these he gave the lanthorn and the tail but trebly charged em to supply the gale a chosen cohort from the rest he drew and to their care assigned the important clue  soon as the maid in equal poise sustains  and on her arm my bird obliquely leans  you forward haste  this glove shall be the sign  with judgment to contract or give it line  do you with caution from the tail repair  but yield the lanthorn with distinguished care  who diligent this day attends my bird  his hand shall next to cupids hold the cord the glove was waved  the steady engine flew sprung into air and lessened to the view proudly it sailed on crouding zephyrs born and every love was pilot in his turn dian transported too beheld it fly and to the taper grew her aching eye but cupid timorous saw its height in air and thought his bird too distant from his care twas he the messenger decreed to send and would by proxy on his bird attend what better than a billetdoux may prove the tender representative of love for lo the maid a gilded sheet imparts that breathed unfeigned flames and real darts led by the clue its rapid flight it steers and to the bird his airy summons bears ah what avail its easywaving wings and length of tail that boasts successive acts of kings how frail our span of time how fixed its date how soon the noblest labors yield to fate sleepbreaking care gay pleasure and pale woe meet in one stream and in one channel flow virtue but like a shining vapor flies and when it brightest blazes soonest dies for juno now with memorable spite saw cupids bird and sickend at the sight her past dishonor all her breast alarms venus preferred and her own slighted charms now from her eye a gleam of envy breaks and all the goddess to revenge awakes  shall juno then inglorious quit the field  and unrevenged the palm of beauty yield  if idas goddess boasts superior charms  why did my jove prefer me to his arms  but still her impious hands detain the prize  her power increases and her altars rise  while i to partial fate unheard complain  and call for vengeance to the gods in vain  but swift through either let my iris glide  and hang my keenest scissars by her side  for lo where yonder glimmering ray appears  her urchins bird its airy journey steers  there all his joy on one small thread depends  that

endless praises pay oin men and angels join the exalted lay to charity delightful sovereign of the cheerful smile save when thy eye pours forth the streaming tear compassionate as often it does when want in pensive mood and tattered garb appears where shall i find thee for thy sacred step the power of secrecy attends and guards o fortune fortune wherefore not to me devolves thy golden tide to me whose hand would turn thy flood into a thousand rills why on the barren rock and niggard heath plays thy favonian breeze why shines thy sun to tip the dunghill with a beam of gold why do thou stretch

helpless orphans as before his door they kneel imploring with distressful tears softening the rude hard flint his harder heart feels no emotion for anothers woe if in the world to come severest pangs spontaneous crimes await how much will mourn beings unsocial unbenevolent this principle allies us to the stars its nonexertion where the power is given looks hateful to divine and human view and yet how dances yonder misers heart ignoble what from charity he holds he deems economy and hugs the thought of posthumous applause if by his will he gives the public what he cannot keep oh vanity of fame i would rather lie tombd in oblivion ere i would have my name engraved immortal on so low a base wretch as thou art  it is ostentation all a pride which gnaws thy vitals up and turns  the milk of human kindness into gall queen of the liberal vast extensive thought sweet charity oh lead me to the cell where haggard famine over her dying race sits weeping while on her uncovered breast the cold rain beats  there let me see thy hand raise her dejected head and give the means of present comfort to her sobbing soul so shall my tears convince thee that my heart is prone to pity though i cannot

and flowerets paint the ground or lambkins gambol over the plain or songsters chant around to me in vain does nature smile in vain her charms display whilst i with neverending toil consume the livelong day time was i have hailed the vernal powers flushed with the general joy when tepid gleams and gentle showers have brightened earth and sky have trod with glee the velvet green that robbed the laughing earth and eyed the universal scene or marked each flowerets birth when snowdrops first in silver dressed shot forth their daring head or when the violets sapphire vest a fragrant incense shed or starry pileworts polished hue besprigd the fields with gold or daisies pied or harebells blue or trueloves verdant fold yet not with dull lethargic gaze i viewed fair natures face the florid earth the solar blaze and vast etherial space for who that sees this beauteous frame replete with wonder shine but must with ready voice proclaim a plastic power divine or in the deep sequestered grove from care and business freed have sought the sacred muses love and tuned my rustic reed or by some fountain laid along that winds around the trees with raptures heard the woodland song or breathed the scented breeze or stretched upon the mountains steep in phoebus drowsy beams have passed the hours in gentle sleep or wild romantic dreams and often with sweet benevolence a heavendescended fair have sacrificed the sweets of sense sublimer joys to share with her to range the thorny shade or climb the steepy hill or search the field or marshy glade or trace the mazy rill with care to cull each healing plant and every balmy bloom and where disease and pining want combined their horrid gloom there to dispense their cheering aids in each distressful cot where feeble swains or pallid maids bemoaned their dreary lot but ah the herbs the flowers i seek with curious eye no more no more they flush the haggard cheek or blooming health restore nor healthful tincture they disclose nor cordial draught supply but on the spot from whence they rose they blossom fade and die erewhile with daphne in my arms the time transported flew when doting on her lovely charms which natures pencil drew but now my scanty views confined to daphnes charms alone since hymens rites with love combined and made her all my own save what my little babes afford whom i behold with glee when smiling at my humble board or prattling on my knee not that i daphnes charms despise which still new pleasures bring her lovely presence never cloys she is grateful as the spring the dewdrop sparkling on its bed in daphnes eyes expressed her cheeks outshine the campions red the daisys white her breast her hair outvies the saffron morn her soft mellifluent note the thrush that on the leafy thorn distends his vocal throat nor wish i dear connubial state to break thy silken bands i only blame relentless fate that every hour demands nor mourn i much my task austere which endless wants impose but  oh it wounds my heart to hear my daphnes melting woes ixionlike her fate she moans whose wheel rolls ceaseless round while hollow sighs and doleful groans fill all the dark profound for often she sighs and often she weeps and hangs her pensive head while blood her furrowed fingers steeps and stains the passing thread when orient hills the sun behold our labors are begun and when he streaks the west with gold the task is still undone my harmless lambs may ye never feel such dire oppressive need while poverty with rod of steel still urges swifter speed how happy are the beasts and birds who find their food unsought kind nature all their wants affords without one anxious thought the beasts in freedom range the fields nor care nor sorrow know their meat the tender herbage yields the fountains drink bestow each hour the birds with sprightly voice in rival songs contend or over their bounteous meals rejoice or in fond dalliance spend but foresight warns me not to taste the bliss which heaven designed but joyless all my nights to waste to shun more woes behind oh heaven why did thou reason give to curb the impassioned soul why did i not by instinct live and act without control or why within this tortured heart must keen reflection dwell to double every present smart and future pains foretell but ah vile wretch no longer blame what gracious heaven decreed nor thus with petulance disclaim allpatient virtues meed i will rather now with filial fear adore the present god and his paternal stripes revere and kiss his healing rod for his blessed providence withstood i counteract his will and what his wisdom meant for good my folly construes ill who knows but liberty and wealth might work a woeful change with luxury might impair my health or virtuous thoughts estrange what i detest he gives in love in love my suit denies or often my wish my bane might prove my bliss what i despise then let not my presumptuous mind oppose his love or might for well has
