the adventures of anthony varnish  vol iii  the adventures of anthony varnish or a peep at the manners of society by an adept  parva res est voluptatum in vita prae quam quod molestum est in three volumes vol iii  london printed for william lane leadenhallstreet mdcclxxxvi  the adventures of anthony varnish chapter xxix meet with a mortifying disappointment  an extraordinary character  he gives some very important advice  i experience one of the ill consequences of being too warm in an argument  find the wisest men are subject to particular weaknesses  meet with a poet  he delivers an opinion not much to the credit of human nature  when i had purchased the articles of dress that i stood in need of i inquired the nearest way to westminster where my late masters friend the lieutenant lived to whom i had a letter of recommendation and by the assistance of various persons who were kind enough to show me the way i made a sort of a zigzag movement toward the place of destination but unfortunately for me when i came there i heard that the gentleman was gone in the country but the day before and an old woman who was left as the guardian dragon of his furniture in his absence informed me for my comfort that she did not expect him to return to town for at least two months this intelligence was another thunderbolt of fate that drove me still nearer to the cave of despair however wishing her a good morning i assumed new courage and resolved to keep up my spirits as well as i could not doubting but that i should shortly arrive at the end of all my inquietude  buoyed up by this idea i continued whistling an old tune till i found myself at a gate which led into a row of trees and this place on inquiry i found to be st jamess park when i had sauntered about a considerable time i sat down on one of the benches in the mall and continued there for some minutes in a state of insensibility with my hands in my breechespockets and my head reclined against a tree i was exactly in this position when an odd sort of a figure came and sat down on the same seat he was a tall athletic man with a black visage thick lips and rather meanly attired but notwithstanding which there was an air of politeness in his demeanor and such marks of philanthropy in his countenance that he attracted my respect by a sort of involuntary impulse  he had scarcely sat down three minutes before he entered into conversation with me by asking with a smile which seemed equally to partake of good humor and concern what makes you look so serious my lad i told him with a low bow that i was not well  i am sorry for it said the stranger but tell me now without disguise is the disease situated in your body or your mind  i answered him with a deep sigh that it lay entirely in my mind  does it replied he well my lad i will be your physician on this occasion but contrary to the general rules of practice i shall administer without a fee and my medicines though salutary are not expensive  but first tell me what religion you profess for i perceive by your tongue that you are a native of ireland when i informed him that i was educated agreeably to the established church of that country he took my hand with seeming rapture and professed himself very warmly my friend then taking a little book out of his pocket he presented it to me with these words  i give you this my young friend said he to learn by heart which i conjure you to do immediately  you will find it contain some prayers that you must repeat in the course of the day according to the order in which they are set down do that and pray to god to bless you and depend upon it all will go well for the evils we experience in this life originate from two causes the first is by neglecting our daily worship of the almighty and the second is by not knowing ourselves for if we knew ourselves my young friend we should have no occasion for the rigorous exercise of those severities which the wisdom of men finds it necessary to put in force for the wellbeing of each other but losing sight of those great beacons of our felicity we suffer ourselves to be driven about by the tempest of our passions until we are eventually lost for ever  i hope my lad continues he that my advice has made a proper impression upon your heart  you look like a goodnatured young man and i dare take upon me to assert that you will profit by my instructions  the imposition of the pious pedlar of whom mention is made in the former part of this history was still so fresh in my recollection that i could scarcely muster up words enough to tell him that i was obliged to him so much do the actions of the unworthy part of human nature place us on our guard against the professions of the best however i promised him to read his book with attention which pleased him so much that seizing the button of my coat he began to give me a short history of his life in which i was informed that he was a major in the army on halfpay and that the whole business of his life was to succor the distressed and take such poor wretches under his protection as from their poverty or other causes were deprived of every temporal comfort and obliged to seek for happiness in the contemplation of eternity  he was proceeding to give me the history of a poor woman he had been to see that very morning who had been deprived of her senses as well as property by the villainy of an attorney when the narrative was interrupted by a gentleman who tapped the major on the shoulder with great familiarity and placing himself on the bench they entered into mutual inquiries about their private affairs to my great joy and satisfaction for i should have remarked that the military reformer of manners labored under exactly the same impediment in point of delivery as the celebrated demosthenes and was obliged to deposit three or four large stones in his mouth before he could make himself understood and the good man in the midst of his zeal for my happiness talked so fast and so vehemently that the stones dropped one by one out of his mouth unperceived and he was actually reduced to a dependence on a single pebble for his powers of elocution when the person beforementioned came to my relief and indeed that circumstance was particularly fortunate to me for the major had first griped fast hold of my button to prevent my escape from his admonitions which though very pious were not extremely pleasant and then he put his mouth close to my face and so bespattered me with spittle that before he would have got half through his story i probably should not have had an eye left or been able to have distinguished an object at a yard distance  but my attention was now engaged by a severe conflict between the major and his acquaintance which i could perceive derived its source from a difference in political principles the major being a strenuous advocate for the privileges of the people and the other equally as violent for the prerogative of majesty in the course of this debate i was somewhat concerned to find the major lose sight of that equanimity of disposition which i imagined was the natural concomitant of a mind so well regulated as his after a few polite bickerings they both left their seats in great perturbation and walked up the mall to finish and adjust their political disputation  they had scarcely left the bench when the vacancy was filled by a meagre thin man in a threadbare black coat who approached with one hand deposited in his bosom and the other in his waistcoatpocket he wore a small hat which partly covered a tiewig without powder that seemed by the appearance of the caul in various places to have seen almost as many days as its master he wore likewise a black stock which by the careful manner in which he had buttoned his coat to the top gave me strong suspicion to imagine that from a rigid principle of either prudence or poverty he made it answer all the purposes of a shirt for i could not trace the smallest vestige of that necessary appendage of a mans dress through any of those apertures which the iron hand of time had made in his suit of sable  his beard was at once gristly and gray and appeared to have been unmolested by the razor for at least a week which added to the pale aspect of his weatherbeaten face made him altogether no indifferent representation of the figure of famine when he had taken his seat he seemed to retire within himself with a sort of sullen dignity and bore a kind of nolimetangere on his forehead that tacitly forbade all human communication  i dont know exactly to what motive to attribute it but certainly i never felt a stronger curiosity take place in my breast than did at that time to know the history of this seeming original thrice i made advances to speak to him but was as often instantly frozen by the uncharitable contraction of his muscles at length an occasion offered of doing him an inconsiderable service which i did not suffer to pass unheeded  i observed that he had taken a small bundle of papers from his bosom which he looked at for some time with great earnestness till a silent tear stealing from his eye sullied his manly cheek but eager to wipe away so frail a testimony of his weakness he felt in his pocket with great trepidation for a handkerchief and in his hurry dropped those papers which had moved him to so public and expressive an indication of his sorrow and chagrin i immediately leaped from my seat and taking up the bundle delivered it to him with all that delicacy of address and tenderness of manner which should ever accompany our actions when we mean to pour the balm of consolation into the wounds of the unfortunate he seemed pleased with the respect i paid him and gently bowing toward me so far descended from the majesty of genius as to offer me a pinch of snuff from a paltry iron box as a recompense for my civility which i accepted with rapture as an overture of friendship  after a few mutual inquiries the understrapper of apollo opened his circumstances as follows  i am said the wretched man a poor but faithful servant of the muses and have been wandering about the plains of parnassus for the last thirty years of my life gathering laurels to adorn my tomb but have found the journey so painful and the profit so scanty that had i known the inconveniences before i set forward in the pursuit i should scarcely have had the hardiness to encounter such complicated perils of fatigue to have acquired the reputation even of a homer  emboldened by this free declaration on the part of the poet i told him that i presumed those papers which he held in his hand were some children of his brain that he doubtless meant to favor the world with in due time  ah replied this literary veteran you guess right as to my intention i do mean to publish them but of what importance is the possession of the most brilliant talents if you want friends to bring you into reputation  you may perish in a garret with the abilities of an otway  i told him that i always conceived a work of merit would sufficiently recommend itself  aye my dear friend says the bard that observation proves you to be a very young man indeed when you have acquired a little more experience you will see that in nine instances out of ten the retinue of folly overcome the inheritors of genius if a noble lord or a great man has a fool in the family who wishes to be celebrated as a wit it follows as naturally as the night succeeds the day that he must be supported in his pretensions at the expense of reason and justice  it matters not how absurd his productions may be he will always find the pen of venality ready to aggrandize his fame  here i ventured to interrupt his harangue by observing that i thought bestowing of praise upon performances that were undeserving only served to heighten their deformity by making them more conspicuous as dressing a cripple in finery served but to render him the more remarkably ridiculous  that observation will hold good says my companion in almost every other human concern but that of public writing for in that particular province where individuals indeed should be most tenacious of their reason they are least so and tamely resign their judgment upon the literary essays of the times to newspaper editors and reviewers of periodical publications who independent of the facility with which they are corrupted are in general as little capable of discovering the beauties of a work and very often much less so as the herd of asses who listen to their determinations  by these sarcastic opinions i naturally conjectured that my new friend had recently undergone the flagellations of criticism but as the asseverations of the author opened a new field of knowledge to my view i resolved to cultivate his acquaintance with all the industry in my power  chapter xxx the poet and i resolve to dine together  poor encouragement for authors  dive for a dinner  the poets refectory  a proof of their antipathy to a certain profession  every mouth open but none satisfied  an unfortunate circumstance  the comforts of a thick head  i observed a kind of ingenuous shame hang about the poet which it was evident arose from a consciousness of his poverty and it doubtless would have depressed him much more if the lofty ideas i perceived he entertained of his own abilities as an author did not step in to his assistance and counteract by the ambition they suggested to his imagination all the slights he might hourly receive from the gross bulk of mankind on the score of his wretchedness and want of money  as we walked through the park in an inattentive moment i asked my companion where he proposed to dine that day to which question he replied with a significant look that bore strongly the tokens of surprise afraid lest i had committed some gross impropriety my cheeks reddened with a deep suffusion of scarlet and i remained silent when the poet reading the state of my thoughts relieved me from my embarrassment by voluntarily informing me that there was a house not very far distant at which he usually satisfied the craving demands of nature unless he was engaged abroad which he observed happened but seldom and if i were inclined to accompany him that i should be exceedingly welcome to a share of his porridge  it is true says he we poor fellows who have the misfortune to labor under that most incurable of all diseases the cacoethes scribendi have seldom an opportunity of tasting those elegancies whose delicious flavours render life so desirable to the animal part of humanity  no continued this miserable child of the muses we are frequently obliged to walk over the thorny path of distress and waste our existence in the vale of misery  here he ended his remark with a deepfetched sigh at the same time clapping his hand as it were by instinct to his purse  a combination of events that very plainly evinced the weakness of his finances for however poets may be elevated above the common classes of human nature in their ideas i find the visitations of misery can make them melancholy as well as other men  in our way to the place of entertainment the little author diverted me with various anecdotes of the persons in whose company we might in all probability dine and if his penciling was to be depended upon as conveying the outlines of truth a most egregious set of beings they were  at last after innumerable turnings and windings through bystreets and filthy alleys i was given to understand by my conductor that we had come to the wishedfor port and i was looking with prodigious industry but in vain for a sight of some of those insignia of good living which hung pendant from the windows of the house i had been introduced to the day before and i began then to imagine that the poet was out in his reckoning or in plain english had mistaken his way when he removed my scruples by hailing me from a neighboring cellar into which he was descending with great precipitation and had already got so far that nothing but his head remained above the surface of the earth  i followed him into this subterranean cavern with infinite caution on my part which was was very necessary to observe for though the poet from long practice could have run down them on a pressing occasion yet a stranger must have found the descent to be no easy passage as several of the stairs were wanting and one false step might have been as detrimental to the safety of his person as it is generally found to the reputation of a fair lady but thanks to my prudence i landed safe in this retreat of genius for such it might be called from the characters of the persons who retired there to eat in security  the appearance of the place altogether was so unlike what i had ever seen before that had i been conveyed thither in a sleep i should have had no doubts on my awaking of being an inhabitant of the other world  all the light we were favored with proceeded from the glimmering of two dirty lamps which only served as milton has observed to make darkness more visible and by the aid of which i could just discern a table at one end of the apartment where the poet taking me by the hand introduced me as his particular friend and a man of genius  before the dinner was served up a sort of general conversation took place in the course of which a human figure who sat at one corner of the table whom i took for an author for he was still thinner if possible than my companion accosted my friend with well mr crambo have you heard the melancholy news this morning  no replies the diminutive poet lord bless me what is that  only your competitor balderdash in limbo  that is all adds the other  i am sorry for it says my friend shrugging his shoulders but it is what we must all come to  aye it was a damned unlucky accident for poor frederic cries another for he had been appointed that very morning editor to the scandalous chronicle  that was a damned stroke of fate indeed says a fourth pray continued he is it a fair question mr slang to ask the sum he is nabbed for  oh certainly replies the other it is thirteen pounds and upwards  zounds that is a sum indeed exclaims another but perhaps it could be settled  as our friend is known to be seedy the creditor might be persuaded to compound for half the debt on good security  no rejoins another that is impossible for his creditor is as inexorable as dick flint the bailiff  why then he hasnt the proper feelings of a man cries my friend  oh damme we know that replies the other but the best of the joke is he is not a man  not a man exclaims the poet in amazement why what the devil is he then  why if you must know he is a tailor says the other  oh damn the tailors echoed instantly and at the same moment from every mouth in the cavern but mine from which circumstance i naturally concluded there was a little antipathy existing between the two professions  the farther discussion of that subject was now postponed by a summons from the cook who gave an additional edge to their appetites by the following polite exordium  come gemmen says the lusty host get ready for i shall soon be with you  damme here is a dish fit for his majesty god bless him  you may say what you please gemmen about your hellishogabalus but i will be cursed if he ever sat down to soup like this  marrow and fat my blades  i have bought you the best meat in the market and here it is my masters swimming in an ocean of soup like a fleet at spithead  this will do your hearts good my boys  it is no wishywashy stuff such as they give the mounseers made up of cabbage and garlic  no no i knows what is fitting for you  you love the solid thing and for the matter of that do you see you do credit to it  why zounds one of you authors will eat more in one meal than a french grenadier could in three and much good may do you with it say i  only understand me rightly my masters you must come down today by ch  t for damme i cannot stand it much longer if you go any more upon tick do you see  at the end of this polite and persuasive harangue he took up a large earthen dish which smoked like a furnace or the tremendous crater of mount vesuvius and bending under it came waddling toward the table but whether it was his overeagerness to accommodate his halffamished guests or that the heat of the dish burnt him so much that he could not hold it any longer i will not take upon me to determine but he certainly was too precipitate in the affair for not looking rightly before him and the place being exceedingly dark instead of placing the smoking viands immediately in the center of the table he clapped it down with such violence on the scull of a tragic poet who lay sleeping on the table with his head resting on his hands as split the dish into a hundred fragments to the great annoyance of the whole society who were terribly scalded by the soup which was splashed around the table in copious streams like the bursting of a waterspout or the falls of niagara  as for the lethargic servant of melpomene it was generally thought that so far from being able to honor any more of his friends by writing dying speeches to immortalize their memory he would behold the sweet face of the sun no more or in other language that his scull was fractured past relief but in that conjecture his brethren of the quill were fortunately deceived for when a neighboring surgeon was sent for to examine the contusion he gave them the satisfaction of knowing that their friends wound was very inconsiderable and likewise added to their manifest comfort that if a ton weight had fallen upon the poets cranium instead of an earthen dish it would not have done his faculties the smallest injury as nature had furnished him with a particular thickness of bone in that part that absolutely bade defiance to accident for its demolition  as this unlucky affair had destroyed the hopes of the company relative to the engagement of a hot dinner they were obliged to call their philosophy to their assistance a lady to whom they were frequently obliged to be indebted in spite of their teeth and sit down to the miserable and cold remains of some oxcheek and neck of beef which they presently devoured with such speed as made me imagine that a thousand such men in a country would cause a general famine indeed as for my part my wonder had been so much excited by the singular occurrences that took place in the cellar that all my former ideas of eating gave way to my astonishment and i thought as little of satisfying the cravings of my belly as an old maid on the eve of matrimony  chapter xxxi crambo and i take a walk  agree to see a play  a visit to a firstrate comedian  he is jocular at the expense of the poet  strong doubts of crambos sanity of mind  after discharging the reckoning in the cellar my friend crambo and i proposed taking a saunter into the fields and during our ramble he asked me if i were willing to go to the play that evening upon my replying in the affirmative and observing that i could not indulge that propensity at present on account of the expense he bade me make myself easy on that particular as he knew one of the principal comedians for whom he constantly wrote puffs and proposed that i should call upon him with a note which if he were at home he said he would certainly honor at the same time remarking that he was sorry to give me so much trouble but would have called himself on the actor if he had not lodged unfortunately next door to a vile caitiff of a tailor who had his name upon the debtorside of his ledger for a greater sum than he found it convenient or indeed even possible to pay  being naturally fond of such exhibitions i greedily seized so favorable an opportunity of seeing a play on the london stage imagining that to be the very fountainhead of dramatic excellence and going into the first public house we came to the poet wrote a note which he sealed up and sent by me to the player resolving to wait for my return at the alehouse and solace himself with the comforts of a quid of tobacco a pennyworth of porter and a bellyfull of reflection  rapt in idea with the pleasures which were to accrue from this commission i hurried to the actors house with all the haste imaginable and knocking at the door of his august mansion it was opened by a servant in rich livery who appeared as much pampered with the good things of this world as an archbishop but before he would condescend to answer me the plain question whether his master was at home or not surveyed me from head to foot with a look of the most mortifying contempt and then answered with a supercilious smile  well if he be what the devil can you possibly want with him  i was so provoked with the fellows manner and incivility that i had a great inclination to knock him down but repressing my choler as well as i could told him with some heat of resentment that i came with a note from mr crambo  what crambo the poet says the fellow with a sneer well i will take it in but i am cursedly afraid my friend that you will go without your errand for to my knowledge my master hasnt any cash to spare at present  he has had a bad run at hazard lately and been tricked most infernally  he is left without a single guinea and as poor as a minoritymember then he walked leisurely up stairs after bidding me wait in the hall till his return  from the observations of the impertinent footman upon the state of his masters purse i conjectured that my associate crambo had applied to him upon occasion for other favors infinitely more substantial egad than orders  after i had stood cooling my heels in the hall for above twenty minutes the jackanapes in livery returned with a message from mr buskin his master desiring me to walk up i obeyed the mandate of the actor and following the footman up an elegant staircase i was shown into a superb room decorated with titians loves of the gods and a couple of bawdy paintings which my friend crambo assured me afterward were the performance of a clergyman and presented to the player as a mark of his particular esteem i found mr buskin sitting at a table like his redoubted highness the great mogul demolishing a gallon of claret with two prostitutes of high ton and a noted bailiff from lincolns end who had conscientiously lent him fifty guineas that morning in hard specie upon his simple bond and judgment for a hundred to be paid in six months and the cash was displayed with great ostentation before him  turning to me with a contemptuous sneer this consequential selfswoln comedian inquired in an authoritative tone of voice if i was the person who brought the note from old crambo i answered yes sir with a bow down to the very carpet which by the by i might as well have spared myself the trouble of performing as this haughty stage hero did not stoop from his dignity so much as to observe even the humility of so poor a being as myself  well says the actor having read the note i dont know what to say to this business this crambo is a cursed troublesome sort of a fellow  curse me says the player but it would be an act of charity to confine him in a dark room with clean straw for a year or two  who is he said one of the ladies  who is he replied the king of shreds and patches with a halfstifled laugh why damme he is an author and more plague to me than a thirdday ague  the animal is continually levying contributions upon my purse and if i refuse him the supplies i am sure to feel his sting the next day in some of the daily papers where he incessantly scribbles with as little regard to truth in his writing as he has to decency in his manners  why do you indulge him in his beggarly requests rejoins the other lady  for the best reason in the world to an actor cries the player because i am afraid of him you strap of beelzebub so i am obliged to throw a sop to cerberus now and then to stop his growling though damme i have often a great inclination to strangle the old dog and get rid of him that way continues the scenic chief by anticipating the conclusion of public justice  this joke at the expense of my friend crambo set the table in a roar but on its subsiding the tender limb of the law who flanked the left side of the comedian exclaimed vociferously b  st me master buskin why dont you do him over  swear to any thing above ten pounds and i am your man  by the lord i will muzzle the thief of the world in four and twenty hours  say it is a match and the things done do you see me so enough said but whether the actor really held the philanthropic advice of his bosomfriend in abhorrence or that he was afraid of the consequences i cannot tell yet certain it is that he chose to turn a deaf ear to the charitable remonstrance of his companion at that period and calling for pen ink and paper immediately wrote an order for two to the pit which he delivered to me with as much majesty as if he had been in the act of personating the eighth harry  as i had succeeded so well in my negotiation i saluted the mimic hero with the greatest marks of respect in the performance of which he was pleased to eye me with a kind of merry disdain and at last bursting forth into an immoderate fit of laughter roared out damme what i suppose youre a young poet too ant you i instantly replied no sir with evident marks of confusion  well well replied the mangler of heroics i ask your pardon most sincerely for the suspicion i should have seen at first sight that youre too sleek and well dressed to drink the waters of helicon and if you are not damnably dry indeed my honest fellow continues the actor you never should  take my word for it it is a cursed dirty puddle and in some respects may be compared to bad gin for though it frequently intoxicates the ragged part of my associates may i be hissed the next time i immortalize dionysius if it ever fattened a single scoundrel of them all  at the conclusion of this salutary admonition one of the demireps politely observed that she wondered mr buskin should waste his time talking about such shabby dogs to which elegant observation the player thought proper to reply that though he admitted the rhymeweaving rascals were contemptible as men yet says the son of melpomene they are to be dreaded as enemies and in some sort are a kind of necessary appendage to the character of an actor and answer much the same purpose to us as a candlestick does to a taper for though continued mr buskin they havent the power to increase our innate flame of merit yet we find it damned difficult to stand upright without their assistance  so mind my friend says the player turning to me give my respectful compliments to my worthy friend mr crambo and tell him not to forget me in the next critique he writes for the stage for he knows that i both respect admire and regard him cries the insolent mummer as the devil does holy water turning his head to the bailiff who sat in full enjoyment of the fun with his tongue thrust in his left cheek by the way of a tacit comment on the players sincerity  the actor giving me a nod that seemed to say i might depart when i thought proper i saluted the respectable group and instantly left the house  on the way back to my companion i could not avoid reflecting on the singular behavior of the comedian  first on the long and tedious interval that i passed in his hall which was an intolerable sacrifice i understood afterward he made every poor devil pay to his vanity whose quality or supposed rank in life did not elevate him sufficiently to be treated as his equal  secondly the wanton freedom and uncharitable impertinence with which he spoke of poor crambo who from his education as well as his heart could properly claim an infinite preeminence over this upstart ranter of heroics in the grand scale of society  and lastly at the general contempt he threw upon authors of all descriptions by his illiberal remarks upon my dress and condition when he should have retreated within his own mind and been thankful to fortune for his situation which lifted him above the experience of those calamities that are hourly endured by men of the most sublime merit virtue and sensibility and whose caprice of disposition could not be better or more strongly evinced than by her ridiculous dispensations in favor of so worthless an individual  when i came to the rendezvous i found my friend crambo sitting with his pot before him writing with a pencil in a book which i learned afterward he carried about with him to enter such thoughts as arose in his imagination and which he imagined worth a record as i perceived that he was deeply immerged in thought i was resolved not to disturb his ideas but to remain where i was until he should be disengaged and descend like another mortal to interest himself in the affairs of this sublunary world  during this interval the woman of the house came out of the bar and desired me to take my companion away as fast as possible for she did not choose to harbor madmen in her house when i testified my surprise at this strange account of my friends intellects she told me that since i left him he had started from his seat and running about the room with a book in his hand made such a noise and uttered such unintelligible jargon as frightened two fishwomen and a ticketporter who were drinking brandy in the same box and she farther informed me that she had sent to a mad doctors who lived within a few doors for a straight waistcoat to confine him but unfortunately the physician had left home about an hour before on a visit to a celebrated lady who had gone out of her mind on the death of a favorite lapdog  here i thought proper to remove the poor womans apprehensions by informing her that mr crambo was a poet and that what she took for incoherent ravings was probably only the recital of some passages of a new poem which he had been conceiving  that i would answer for it he was a very harmless character and entreated her to let him remain unmolested for a few minutes longer as perhaps disturbing him then might unhinge the best chain of ideas that were ever forged in the human understanding and stop his progress in the very moment that he was galloping on his sublime pegasus to the heights of immortality  chapter xxxii discover crambo in a poetical reverie  go to the play  my friend and i meet with a disaster  the applause of an audience not always consonant with reason  more ways than one of acquiring fame  the poets remarks on the present state of the theaters  he disputes with a critic and shows his contempt of modern actors  my wishes are constrained to be obedient to necessity  presently i observed that the poets eyes began to glisten and my landlady conjuring me to step on one side for the love of god i followed her advice being willing to see what turn this affair would take but my friend crambo did not leave me long in doubt for grasping the pewter pot in one hand and his commonplace book in the other he strutted about the room repeating the following lines from dryden with great energy happys the man and happy he alone he who can call today his own he who secure within himself can say tomorrow do thy worst for i have lived today be fair or foul or rain or shine the joys i have possessed in spite of fate are mine not heaven itself upon the past has power but what has been has been and i have had my hour at the conclusion of this elegant quotation the little bard stalked across the room with the port of an emperor when running up to him i took my friend by the hand and informed him of the success of my embassy taking care to conceal the disagreeable expressions which the player had made use of so much to crambos disadvantage  as the clock struck five my companion put me in mind that it was time we went to the theater if i wished to have a good seat as the piece to be performed that evening was a very attractive dish to the public and considered by the million as possessing merit though for his part he thought otherwise  having paid the landlady who seemed more than commonly rejoiced at my friends departure we hurried to the scene of action and got there just time enough to squeeze in with the crowd who had been waiting for the doors opening the pressure on all sides of me was so great that i had not the power to make use of my hands but was carried forward by the mob entirely at their disposal like an unnavigated boat in a strong current and by the time i had got into the pit i was almost reduced to the consistence of a jelly as for the little poet he had been more scurvily used than myself for added to the embraces his ribs had undergone the outrageous behavior of the multitude who surrounded him had fairly carried away his hat and wig and he was obliged to sit with his handkerchief tied round his head for the rest of the evening an orangewoman accosting me to buy some fruit i attempted to put my hand in my pocket when alas i found they were turned inside out and i was robbed of every shilling that my rigid economy had preserved out of my last guinea i communicated this doleful piece of news to my neighbor crambo who after shrugging his shoulders a little and pointing to the loss of his own hat and wig bade me be comforted  you see cries the poet how that vixen fortune delights in persecuting us poor devils and it matters not a whit if she means to plague the human heart whether she effects her vile purposes by the loss of a purse or the demolition of an empire so my friend contitinued the bard even let us assume that equality of temper which makes its possessor easy under every difficulty and defeat the malice of the gipsys intentions by showing in our conduct that we despise her and all her works  the motto of my existence has been always nil desperandum which let me tell you is the best charm we can make use of to extirpate the presence of care  notwithstanding this welltimed address of the poet i could not chase away for the soul of me the sorrow that i felt for the loss of my money i was then almost dead with fatigue and want of rest  the miseries that i had endured the night before were still warm in my imagination and the uncertainty of knowing whether i should or should not have the felicity of paying a salutary visit to morpheus on that night loaded my heart with the most inexpressible anxiety but these fears were presently removed by the kindness of the philanthropic author who generously offered me the use of one half of his bed until fate should enable me to procure one of my own  our conversation was now interrupted by the ringing of a bell behind the curtain which i understood was a signal that the performance was going to begin when i saw the people sit down around me in preparation my heart beat high with expectation of the coming pleasure and at length the moment of gratification arrived the curtain was drawn up and a young man of a genteel aspect stepped forward to speak the prologue as i understood that he was a dramatic novitiate that had lately made his appearance with particular honor to himself and advantage to the manager i listened with the greatest attention to his manner of delivery and to the language of the composition expecting to see and hear something if not immediately perfection at least very near approaching to it but in this as well as many other instances of my life i was most cruelly deceived as for the language of the composition notwithstanding i was assured by the persons around me that it was written by a man of fashion i was convinced it was the most absurd combination of nonsense that ever disgraced the dramatic exhibition of a barn and as for the actor who spoke it he put me in mind of the merryandrew to an itinerant charlatan by his gestures rather than a firstrate comedian who might be presumed to have some latent regard for common sense when strutting away his ridiculous hour on the boards of so respectable a theater for he skipped and jumped about the stage like a mad dancing master in one of the wards of bedlamhospital  when the disgusting business of prologuespeaking was over the comedian retired but instead of being attended in his theatric exit by those murmurs of disapprobation which i conceived must have always followed so vile a martyrdom of propriety he was loudly applauded by several people from the pit and galleries this extraordinary conduct in an audience that i naturally supposed enlightened from the opportunity they had of contrasting real merit with buffoonery surprised me so much that i asked crambo what he thought of their procedure he smiled at my question and told me a secret well worth knowing to all frequenters of theaters namely that the plaudits i had so judiciously condemned were bestowed by the dependents and hired auxiliaries of the player in question to some of whom he gave orders for admission and to others money to support him in his earnest and laudable endeavors to acquire a great reputation as an actor at the expense of every thing rational or praiseworthy  as for the judgment or reason that is supposed to predominate in a playhouse says the poet i would not give three farthings for their influence besides i dare aver that the small portions there may be of either among the audience of this evening is confined to a few individuals who are too proud to enter into a contest with ignorance and too well bred to be violent in their displeasure so that unfortunately for common sense continues the bard folly and presumption defeat her and all her influence within these walls in nine instances out of ten  as the little man got heated in his remarks upon the prostitution of public praise he spoke so loud that he was overheard by several people around us some of whom thought his observations very pertinent and were so well pleased at the grace and facility with which he delivered them that they paid him a particular attention during the rest of the entertainment so much had the beauties of his understanding overcome the prejudice that was at first conceived against him from his grotesque and singular appearance  at length the play began and i kept a watchful eye first on the performers and then on the poet being willing to perceive by the emotions of his countenance which from his black eyes heavy brows and meagre muscles was finely calculated for expression how far his feelings corresponded with my own one of the most celebrated of the actresses making her appearance such a clapping of hands ensued as could not have been exceeded if thalia herself had personated the character all which she received with a kind of indifferent insolence of behavior as tacitly implied that she imagined it was doing them a prodigious favor by deigning to appear at all but entering into the business of the scene she conducted her dialogue with such a smartness of delivery as seemed to give general delight and at one or two passages where the poet had arisen a small degree above his usual dullness she got through so well and did the author such justice by adding to his wit a certain poignancy peculiar to herself that i observed the muscles of the grim bard who was leaning his chin most attentively upon an oaken stick relaxing with a lazy tendency toward a smile of approbation i was the more pleased that my friends iron features were expanded at this happy essay of the actress as her management of the execution had made me extremely well pleased  at the conclusion of the comedy i heard the bard utter a loud groan which was an ample testimony to me that he had not been amused equal to his wishes and he was sitting in a kind of sullen discontent when a gentleman observed that he had never seen a more excellent comedy nor one better performed this public asseveration was in the opinion of the poet too great an insult to the taste of the audience to pass unnoticed and rising accordingly from his seat with the importance of a cicero he challenged the person who had passed such an eulogium on the performance and performers to point out where those beauties lay in the construction of the piece or the merit of the players that he had so warmly attributed to both  my friend had scarcely thrown the gauntlet of defiance when a circle was formed of every one within hearing to listen to the criticisms of the author his former remarks having excited their attention upon my friends opponent making a few loose and desultory attempts to defend his assertion the little retainer of the muses answered him in the following manner  the science of acting said the bard is a more difficult undertaking than is generally imagined by the actors themselves or by those weak persons who arrogate a sufficient share of judgment to determine on its excellences when in reality they have frequently no requisite to make them competent to such a situation but their presumption and no ally to support so gross an usurpation of knowledge but their impudence many young people impelled by a bastard kind of ambition continued the slave of parnassus rush upon the stage foolishly imagining themselves under the guidance of the muses and prosecute their intentions with as much industry and zeal as those hoodwinked wretches who from a supposed call of the spirit run about the confines of these nations propagating religious bigotry at the expense of human happiness yet they are both too often mistaken in the cause and in general made miserable by the effect  but this is a free country exclaimed the son of apollo with a significant sneer and we have thank heaven a privilege to be ridiculous whenever we think proper   here the bards adversary stopped the progress of his raillery by asking him if he did not admit that the present actors taken in general were equal to those he remembered when some years younger to which question my friend replied no with a strong emphasis and supported his negative by the ensuing remarks  the modern players said the poet are governed by a momentary caprice and sacrifice the little understanding they have to please the vitiated palate of the public without the least concern at the outrages they are doing to nature or the unpleasantness of a labor where their reason and their efforts must be continually at variance the actors of the old school on the contrary nobly stepped forward in the defense of insulted wisdom and rescued the stage from that barbarity into which it had been gradually sinking before for at least half a century and their exertions did them immortal honor for they dared to oppose their judgments as men against the ruinous prejudices which a false taste had implanted in the hearts of their benefactors at the head of this reformation stood the late inimitable garrick vociferated crambo who united as many qualifications for an actor in his mind as the almighty will perhaps admit a human being to possess and the want of which all men of discernment must lament in his successors who are seldom correct but frequently intolerable  and who can expect otherwise said the poet from men who have not a common knowledge of punctuation or the absolute necessity that the gesture voice and eye of the performer should intimately correspond in the execution or that the smallest deficiency in the conduct of either renders the representation imperfect in the same degree as the want of the most inconsiderable feature in the human body will not only take off from the beauty of the whole but in some cases make it even repulsive and disgusting  by this time the usual summons was given for the commencement of a farce that was to succeed the comedy written by the favorite author of the day which the bard no sooner heard than taking me by the arm he forced me out of the theater asserting that he would rather attend a puppetshow at bartholomewfair than the performance of a modern farce especially a dramatic abortion squeezed from the brain of an animal who had scarcely knowledge sufficient to declare whether a human being was a substantive or a preposition for continued the inspired crambo i have it in my power to apologize for the laughable blunders of the one but cannot for the monstrous absurdities of the other upon which he dragged me by main force out of the pit though i was repeatedly assured that a great comedian was to support the principal character in the afterpiece  chapter xxxiii arrive at the poets lodgings  an argument that sometimes proves the pleasure of living in a garret  an accident occurs which terminates in a tragical manner  a convincing proof that fatigue is a better opiate than laudanum  a hasty sketch of the furniture of an authors study  my friend crambo not being in a condition to go into a house of entertainment we scudded as fast as possible to his lodgings where we cast anchor a little before ten oclock they were situated at the bottom of an alley in st giless so narrow that it would not admit two people to walk abreast and so long that i thought we never should come to the bottom for there the bard had chosen his residence in the garret of a building that had once been a house and whose attic story leaned for support against the mansions on the opposite side of the alley he made innumerable apologies to me as we ascended to his apartment for taking me so high and told me that his predilection in favor of a garret entirely arose from its being more detached from the world than any other room in the house besides the great advantages it afforded to a mind devoted to study and contemplation  as we had no candle and the poet was extremely drowsy as well as myself we agreed to go to bed by moonlight but alas i found to my cost when i had laid myself down with an intention to sleep that very few persons had reason to envy my friend crambo the possession of his couch for the feathers it contained were so scanty that my bones rubbed against the frame of the bed nor were they quite so soft in their quality as eiderdown for a few having made their way through the ticking they annoyed my poor carcass worse than so many crowquills however i knew that my circumstances obliged me to make a virtue of necessity so putting the best face i could upon the matter i was preparing to resign myself to the arms of morpheus whom i secretly implored to shed his poppy over my brow when an accident happened that removed all ideas of sleep for some time this was occasioned by the retainer of the muses himself who in groping his way to the bed stumbled over some bricks which he had artfully placed for its support at the foot and which falling down not only destroyed the whole economy of the poets contrivance but made such a confounded noise as alarmed an old woman who slept in the floor beneath and whose profession i afterward found was that of a fortune tellers a secret she had picked up in the neighborhood of norwood and by following which she made more in a week than my friend crambo did by writing poetry in a month  the accident had not happened above five minutes when the old sybil made shift to crawl up to the poets door and bestowed such a volley of curses upon him as made my hair stand on end and among the rest of her predictions she declared without any ceremony that crambo would most assuredly come to be hanged but the little bard was so exasperated at the tenor of the last assertion that collecting all the strength he was master of he ran fullbut with his head against the stomach of the prophetess but using more force in the business than was necessary and she at the same time fastening her claws an inch deep in his throat they tumbled together down a perpendicular height of at least twenty feet where they continued to fight on their arrival with prodigious ferocity like two contending cats till they were parted by some people who lodged in the same house and came out to their assistance  however in a few minutes after the affray the poet returned to his apartment groaning and sobbing with the pain it had occasioned but undressing himself he at last came to bed also uttering incoherent ejaculations to the supreme being not to procure a sweet slumber but to punish the wretch who had been the primary cause of his bodily torture  yet in spite of every disadvantage i made shift to sleep tolerably sound until the bright beams of the sun had awakened my companion who shaking me violently by the shoulder broke the fetters of my repose to inform me that it was time he should get up and procure another hat and wig which he wished to do as early as possible that his deficiency in that particular might not be seen by the neighborhood which he assured me was not the least scandalous within the bills of mortality and if i were willing to accompany him on that occasion he should be very glad but if on the contrary i was too much fatigued he would leave me to my slumbers and return in half an hour  when i rubbed my eyes sufficiently to survey the apartment of poor crambo i must own i felt so little inclination to be left behind being struck with amazement at the wretchedness of his retreat that i immediately told him i should be extremely happy to take a walk in so fine a morning  well says the bard if that is your resolution i will step down stairs while you are dressing yourself and get something applied to my forehead which is extremely painful and be with you directly  and indeed he had ample occasion for a plaster for the disaster of the preceding night with the old woman had been attended with some very ugly effects among the rest a great lump upon his forehead about the bigness of a turkeys egg was not the most insignificant  when the bard had left the room i took an accurate survey of the furniture of his garret which consisted of the miserable succedaneum for a bed on which though it appeared next to an impossibility that any one could close their eyes for half an hour i found from recent experience that even misery could drown his feelings in the soft bands of sleep even on a couch of stone there was likewise a square deal table with three legs remaining out of four which it appeared the cabinetmaker had formerly thought necessary for its support on which were some writings among the rest i discovered three cantos of a poem on the inefficacy of wealth toward constituting human happiness and a satirical epistle to a justice of the peace who i understood afterward had dealt with such a degree of severity toward the poet as the latter had thought sufficient provocation to draw upon the head of the devoted magistrate the bitterness of his redoubted pen  there was moreover a rebus for a magazine a list of bloody murders for one of the morningpapers and some loose paragraphs in one of which a man was to have his jaw twisted in the act of taking some blasphemous oaths in covent garden  another was an outrageous puff for a tragic actress who was to appear at one of the theaters in the course of the ensuing week setting forth that she was the great granddaughter of a generalofficer and supported an aged mother and three sisters by plainwork  the third was an account of a bankruptcy that was to take place in a great house at philadelphia  and the fourth a particular relation of the plague and its consequences that was to break out at grand cairo in the beginning of the following month with a full account of the lethargy that was to seize the prussian monarch at berlin when the emperor was on a visit to the austrian netherlands  i probably should have discovered some valuable manuscripts in my researches had i not been disturbed in the pursuit by hearing the poet coming hastily up the ladder which led to his room upon which i replaced every thing in proper order and set myself down in a chair without a back which by the by was the only one in the room and was very industriously reading a dying speech that was pasted against the wall accompanied by a bawdy ballad and john the painters effigy when the servant of the parnassian family entered his sublime apartment and told me he was ready to attend me  chapter xxxiv disadvantages of living in a dirty neighborhood  the poet dips for a wig  pays a visit to a bookseller  a mornings lounge in westminsterabbey  meet with an original  a summary discourse on the prostitution of epitaphs  a man of an excellent understanding soured by misfortunes  by the time my friend crambo and i had got out of the alley we were both almost out of breath not with the distance of ground we had walked over but with the alertness we were forced to make use of to avoid some unsavory salutes from the windows as we passed for by the number of offerings which the chaste nymphs of that district discharged from their apartments one would naturally conclude that sacrificing to cloacina was the principal amusement of their existence  at last i found myself in the middle of a court which was occupied by dealers in almost every article of dress such as clothes boots shoes and in short every appurtenance necessary to the completion of a fine gentleman and at length we arrived at a wigwarehouse the windows of which were faced with shambles and ornamented with wigs for all ages sexes and complexions which the bard no sooner saw than he entered beckoning me to follow him the master of the shop perceiving the nature of his visit inquired with much complaisance if he wanted a tiewig a jasy a bob or a major to which the poet immediately replied a tiewig  will your honor make a choice or take a dip says the merchant  oh a dip by all means replies the bard  why then come into the backshop master says the other and i will fit you for sixpence as well as any gemman in the land we both followed his directions and going into a little back room he produced a canvass bag at the same time informing us that it contained caxens of such delicate workmanship as would not disgrace the forehead of a chief magistrate  when the poet had deposited his sixpence he stripped off his coat and the master of the shop having opened the mouth of the repository the little bard put down his arm as far as he could reach and after groping about for some minutes pulled out an old brown wig without powder which from its complexion and disorder seemed to me as if it had been in the hands of a japanner of shoes and literally not worth twopence but the shopkeeper it appeared thought otherwise for taking it from the hands of the poet he told him with exultation that he was in luck for he had brought out a wig for sixpence which was honestly worth a crown between man and man and placing it alertly on a block began to comb it and indeed the ingenious wigretailer brought it by dint of industry into so respectable a form that i could not help congratulating my friend crambo upon the additional graces it gave his countenance  the next concern being to procure a decent hat and my companion not being over nice in respect to the fashion he got one in a neighboring shop upon very moderate terms and being now equipped with the habiliments of a gentleman he took leave of me having first exacted my promise to dine with him at the ordinary in the cellar at the usual hour after which he set off for paternoster row on a visit to a bookseller with whom i understood he had articled himself under a heavy penalty to furnish a history of the last war for the moderate premium of halfacrown a sheet  feeling myself in an awkward situation destitute of a penny to buy the necessaries of life and deprived of the society of the ingenious author whose singularities of disposition in a great measure tended to divert my own chagrin i resolved to pay a visit to westminsterabbey and endeavor by discoursing with the tombs of departed statesmen and heroes to reconcile myself to those wants and inconveniences which oppressed me by learning from their posthumous declarations how soon they would be no more when i entered the abbey i felt an awful sensation pervade my whole frame the gothic magnificence of the pile at once pleased and surprised me i fancied myself walking over the ashes of the good and great whose names have shone so conspicuous in the page of history and trod with a kind of sacred apprehension along the sculptured pavement lest the levity of my actions should give offense to the ennobled dust that slept around me  i was reading with particular delight the epitaphs on the tombs of the british poets when a man of a genteel mein but shabbily accoutred and apparently in greater misery than myself accosted me and requested in terms of the utmost politeness that i would assist him in the translation of a latin epitaph in the corner and at the same instant informed me that his curiosity was strongly excited to know if our forefathers were as ridiculous in their monumental inscriptions as ourselves and as willing to honor the memory of a wealthy scoundrel as the present generation the oddity of the remark and the solicitude of the man conspired to awaken my desire to know who he was which i presently effected by asking him the following question pray sir replied i do not you imagine that the custom all enlightened nations have adopted of paying a proper tribute to the merits of the dead is not only laudable in itself as an exercise of the principle of gratitude for the services they have rendered us but eventually of benefit to the living inasmuch as it holds forth to their embraces a certain desirable reward after death for the maintenance of virtue and propagation of knowledge while they remained members of human society your idea of rewarding men of merit is erected upon a very noble foundation says the stranger and if these rewards were confined merely to persons of that denomination i should have no possible dislike to their continuance but as on the contrary like splendid titles and other human honors they are lavished with as much or more profuseness on the unprincipled knave who dies amidst the execrations of his fellow creatures as on the scholar who has ornamented his country by his labors or the soldier who has defended it by his valor i think they must be considered by all men who judge properly as a living satire upon our vanity and not a lasting record of either our virtues or our wisdom i told him in reply that if the abuses really existed which he had pointed out i though that every man might retire to the grave contented with having done his duty and be totally indifferent whether a tomb was raised to tell the world he had existed or not and that however false praise might be lavished or rather prostituted on a bad man it by no means tended to diminish the virtues of a good one and though in some few instances the practice might be liable to ridicule yet taken all together the spirit of commemorating the actions of the deceased was not only praiseworthy but in my humble opinion strictly proper  on the conclusion of my reply the stranger said i will pursue the subject no farther as i find i am not likely to make you my proselyte very readily you are but a young man and have a much better opinion of mankind i am afraid than they deserve but when you have lived as long in the world as i have you will perceive its vices and its follies and most cordially despise them i told my new acquaintance that i was very sorry every days experience but too fully proved the justice of his remarks upon the depravity of our species  and though a very young man continued i i have discovered more vices in the small circle of persons with whom i have been connected than i before imagined to have existed in the whole world oh ho then replies the misanthropical stranger evidently pleased at my condemnation of modern manners you have bit at the bridle you have found some difference between their professions and their actions have you indeed i have most woefully rejoined i i am glad of it says the stranger give me your hand the more unpalatable the draught of life is in the beginning the sweeter it will become at the conclusion and take the word of a soldier young man when he avers that you will be the better for it as long as you exist had i continued the stranger felt the rod of adversity in my youth i should not have been left destitute of the blessings of life at a period of my existence when i most require them  his last expression touched me to the soul by the manner in which he delivered it i sympathised with his misfortunes and begged to know if i could serve him before that i recollected i had not even the power to assist myself however he took my offer in my good part and perceiving my sensibility told me as we walked through the ailes of the abbey the principal circumstances that had brought him to regard the world and its dependences with so inveterate an antipathy  chapter xxxv the history of captain blisset  i am apprehensive my young friend said the stranger that you will find nothing sufficiently entertaining in my history to repay you for the trouble of listening to a chain of occurrences that have made up the principal part of my being and which are tinctured with an infinitely greater proportion of sorrow than of joy however as it appears to be your wish to hear it i will be as brief as possible  i am descended from a reputable family in the north of ireland my name is blisset and my father was one of those people who are distinguished in that kingdom by the name of gentlemenfarmers besides the profit that arose from a large portion of land which he rented from a neighboring nobleman he had a small fortune that was left him by a distant relation on the joint issue of these he contrived to live in a state of comfort enjoying all the diversions of the country such as hunting fishing and all those amusements which are annexed to the life of a country gentleman but being one evening at a rural ball he danced with a beautiful lady whose natural graces made such an impression on his heart that he could not quit the room without inquiring into her name and circumstances and the account he received was far from adding fuel to his growing love for he learned that she was the only daughter of a gentleman of considerable property in the adjoining county and who intended her as a wife for a young baronet of large estate who was hourly expected to return home from the continent where he had been for some time for the improvement of his education  though this account considerably diminished my fathers hopes it by no means removed the flame that still continued to rage within his bosom  at last he contrived to have an interview with my mother for so the lady proved in the consequences to my misfortune and they became so perfectly agreeable to each other that a private marriage was resolved on to put it out of the power of even fate itself to divide their love  she took an opportunity when her father was gone to town upon business of the most serious importance to convey the principal part of her clothes and baggage to her lovers house who met her in her fathers park with a trusty servant and a carriage into which they both got and drove with all expedition until they arrived at the farm where a clergyman attended to unite them in the indissoluble bonds of matrimony  when her father returned to the country and found how his daughter had disposed of herself in wedlock without his knowledge he grew frantic with the disappointment but strove to forget her want of duty and herself by going to reside in france where he survived the event but a few years and left all the property he was able in large bequests to his friends and acquaintance and the rest so laden with mortgages and other disagreeable encumbrances that my father was half ruined in the endeavors to recover the remainder  however in spite of these drawbacks on their felicity they contrived to live very comfortably my mother bearing him a child every year and the first fruit of their love was your humble servant  the circumstance of my being a boy so pleased them both that my parents continued to caress me with the most extravagant tokens of parental fondness a mode of behavior which they pursued till i left my country and saw them no more as i grew up in strength and beauty i was indulged in every wanton and improper propensity at the expense of my brothers and sisters this partiality in my favor was so glaring to every person that visited the family that some who were on the most intimate footing with my father and mother strove to remove or at least to reduce a partiality which existed in preference to the rest of the children who were in general more amiable in the eyes of strangers for the unlimited manner in which i experienced their illtimed kindnesses had worked me up to such a pitch of arrogance and ill nature that my humor became intolerable to all those whose senses were not hoodwinked by the unaccountable partiality of a parent and various were the methods practiced by the servants to mortify young master frank for that is my name while my brothers and sisters were treated with kindness by every one but their parents some would take an opportunity while they were putting on my clothes to run a pin into my arm as if by accident and others would give me a sly pinch which made me roar for an hour you may be sure i did not fail to make the most of these abuses to my parents but at last my complaints became so frequent and so numerous that they lost their credit and in the sequel i was pinched and pushed about by all the servants in the house out of the sight of my parents without even the satisfaction of having my accounts believed in this manner was the earlier part of my life passed till i arrived at nine years of age when it was thought proper to send me to an academy in the same county but i had not been long there before the same spirit broke out which had rendered me so intolerable at home but now the scene was changed for my humors were counteracted with a studious particularity and my faults punished by such severe applications of the birch to my illfated posteriors that i could not sit down for whole days succeeding the punishment at length a full true and particular account reached the ears of my parents who instantly flew to the school and charged the master on pain of their displeasure not to whip me any more but strive to make me learn my task by persuasion which they assured him was a sufficient incitement to make a boy do his duty of so gentle and governable a disposition as mine  leaving the master of the seminary under that ridiculous restriction they returned home and it was not long before i resorted to my old tricks which the master endeavoring to curb by the methods prescribed by the wise authors of my being and finding them ineffectual very fairly took the resolution of sending me back to profit by their sage instructions or in other words turned me out of the school as an incorrigible young puppy who was destined to ruin by possessing a perverse disposition which he was forbidden to regulate or alter by the silly determination of two weak people who rather chose that their offspring should shoot up to manhood detested by every one but themselves than grow amiable dutiful and exemplary at the expense of a sore breech and a few salutary tears  at my return home my parents were filled with the most implacable resentment against the schoolmaster whom they honored with the terms of insolent pedagogue hardhearted tyrant and other phrases equally expressive of their folly and malignity but at the same time took a firm resolution that their dear frank should not be exposed to such merciless cruelty for the future which they were well assured i had not deserved because forsooth i had told them to the contrary and in consequence i was permitted to pass my time until i approached a state of manhood without receiving those advantages of education which other young people enjoyed for fear that discipline should break my heart and too much study impair my constitution but one day after dinner as the family were sitting in conversation my mother told a story of a circumstance in which i was materially concerned but her manner of relating it displeased me so much that when she came to a particular part of the narrative i very coolly gave her the lie direct and upon her offering to remonstrate with me upon the impropriety of my behavior i immediately spit in her face but this last was an outrage that not even their partiality could overlook i was threatened by my father with personal chastisement which i defied him to put in execution and at length things grew to such a height of animosity that it was determined to purchase me a commission in the army in one of the regiments ordered abroad for we were then at war accordingly the whole business was immediately put en train and i was consigned to the care of a near relation of my father in town who was to provide every requisite necessary for such an undertaking and to give me such advice as would prove beneficial to me in my conduct as an officer he having retired from the army but a few years and in which he had served with an unsullied reputation ever since he was the height of a regimental drum  agreeable to the desire of my parents the sage veteran formed such rules for my conduct as he thought from experience would prove most serviceable but in general i turned such a deaf ear to his instructions as disgusted the old gentleman exceedingly and after executing his commission with fidelity he gave me up to fortune as a perverse young man who would one day bleed severely under the rod of her displeasure  the morning before i took my leave of this worthy man he seized me by the hand and pressing it between his with a warmth which nothing but true friendship could inspire spoke to me with the most engaging complacency in nearly the following manner  my dear frank said the old gentleman before you quit me entirely i must entreat your particular attention to the advice i am now going to give you do not shrink from it my dear boy it is not the severe admonition of an old man who looks with a jaundiced eye upon mankind it is the essence of all the knowledge i have gleaned in a long course of service during which i have endeavored not only to live in but with the world and i have learned from a knowledge of my own weakness to look with an eye of charity upon all the frailties incident to our nature i know the passions of youth are difficult to be restrained within the circle of prudence but i have likewise discovered my dear child that the more they are restricted the happier it is for ourselves as a soldier you should make your passions observe the same degree of subordination to your reason as the duties of your profession will teach you to observe to your commanding officer let each have its proper influence in the general system but suffer none to be licentious your own good sense will i hope inform you that you have now entered into a profession whose basis is virtue and honor and that the utmost circumspection of behavior is necessary on your part to preserve the character you have assumed from violation you are now a soldier frank said the old gentleman with a particular strength of emphasis and you must reflect that you are going to join an army of which you must consider yourself an active part whose purpose is to crush the ambitious spirit of a perfidious enemy and furnish another action of british glory to be recorded for ever in the archives of immortal fame there is continued the greyheaded veteran an absolute necessity for every man who wishes to be respected to observe a proper degree of civility toward all ranks of people and that mode of behavior is particularly requisite in an officer it should be your constant study to deserve the commendations of your general by strictly adhering to your duty to court the good will of your brotherofficers by your complaisance and to insure the blessings of your inferiors by acts of kindness rectitude and humanity and take my word that the pleasures you will experience by following this line of conduct will amply repay you for the trouble of putting it in practice for besides the advantage of establishing your own content it is the best possible method of aggrandising your fortune to enforce this observation more strongly i will tell you an anecdote of two persons whom i knew well and the consequences of whose lives prove the necessity of paying a proper deference to the opinion of others  there were two friends william and frederic who were educated together at the same university the former possessed a sweet and gentle disposition the latter a strong understanding and both happening to be under the care of the same guardian for they were orphans they followed one course of study and were intended for one profession when they arrived at mans estate it was thought expedient as they had some very important connections in america to send them over there to settle as merchants accordingly they went to one of the principal colonies which was then subject to the british legislature and carried over some strong letters of recommendation to the principal people but particularly the governor on their arrival on the continent they received every token of respect and friendship from the people but frederics temper being discovered to be as bad and unaccommodating as williams was good and polite the latter naturally attracted the hearts of his acquaintance while the former was treated with a coldness bordering on incivility which soured him to such a degree that he at last became intolerable even to his old companion and colleague william and it was determined at length for the mutual happiness of both parties to break up the partnership and reimbark for england but previous to their departure the governor invited william and frederic to dine with him and finding them both to be gentlemen of great information in regard to the situation of the province he thought it proper to send a letter by them to the secretary of state as two persons in every respect capable of pointing out the necessity and advantages of a measure which government had then in contemplation when they arrived in england they were both closeted with the secretary who began with asking frederics opinion who gave a succinct and clear account of the matter but delivered his opinion in such a supercilious and dogmatic manner as gave the minister more disgust by his manner than he had satisfaction by his information and he was dismissed with that kind of civil and constrained coldness which clearly proved that he had lost the favorable opinion of the secretary and sacrificed his fortune to the haughtiness of his spirit on the contrary william gave his opinion with equal accuracy but with the utmost modesty and when the minister had heard every thing that he could advance upon the subject he condescended to show him a sketch of the intended operations and after speaking for a considerable time in defense of his proposed plan he asked william what he thought of the undertaking who replied with an air of the utmost gentleness and goodbreeding that he had formerly conceived those measures would be most salutary and beneficial which had been advised by his friend frederic until he was convinced to the contrary by his lordships superior reasoning he had scarcely uttered his opinion when the minister caught him in his arms and told him that he perceived he was not only a gentleman of extensive knowledge in politics but a warm friend to his country and that he might depend upon it he would mention him to the king and indeed he was as good as his word and by the force of his interest procured him a considerable post under government which he has enjoyed with particular honor ever since and is enabled in consequence to support the intemperate and proud frederic who is now reduced to the necessity of being the object of his bounty now you see my dear boy said the old soldier by the fate of these two gentlemen what a prodigious superiority that man has with a good temper and moderate talents over him with an enlarged understanding provided the latter is not regulated by good manners and supported by modesty  the old gentleman having concluded his instructions for my wellbeing took a final leave of me with tears in his eyes after supplicating heaven to make me prosperous and happy as a man and honorable and magnanimous as a soldier  chapter xxxvi conclusion of captain blissets story  the next morning continued the gentleman i embarked with the regiment for america and arrived at boston after a disagreeable and tedious passage of upwards of two months not being used to fatigue the inconveniences i suffered in the voyage added to the sickness i had continually while at sea made me curse the hour in which i consented to be a soldier but finding the die was cast and that i must submit to the stern decrees of fate i bore my fortune as well as i could and submitted my body to all the drudgeries and duties of war in direct opposition to the impulse of my spirit habituated as i had been to have my own will obeyed from my childhood i could but ill brook to be commanded at the caprice of another and ordered into situations which i disliked and upon services the most disagreeable and my own dissatisfaction was increased when i took a comparative view of my brotherofficers who seemed to bear their worst hardships with a degree of pleasure and content when the most trivial of mine were rendered extremely miserable by the perverseness of my disposition for no spark of the amor patriae or love of glory irradiated my breast i considered myself as a slave and was consequently unhappy full often did i curse those indulgences which i had experienced from my father and mother and even hated them for giving me an existence which was become irksome and intolerable by their neglect of all the important parts of the education of a child  not to trouble you too much with a recital of trivial accidents let it suffice when i acquaint you that after a service of something less than two years i got appointed to a company and was ordered by the general to take the command of a party that was sent to dislodge some indians who were sculking about the woods to the great annoyance of the rear of the army a few months previous to this expedition i must inform you that i had a quarrel with a lieutenant who happened to be stationed under my command and i resolved so diabolical was the complexion of my mind at that period to take that opportunity of getting him if possible out of the way or in other words to use some treacherous means of destroying his life we had frequent skirmishes with the indians in all which my particular enemy or rather the object of my hatred came off unhurt though i studiously placed him in the post of danger for that purpose as his sight became every day more hateful to me i watched all opportunities of punishing him for disobedience of orders but in this too he foiled me for knowing the implacability of my heart and being a brave and sober man he was uncommonly punctual in the observance of his duty it being resolved in council to make a grand attack upon a post which the indians possessed the next morning at daybreak i determined to place my enemy in the hottest part of the fire and if he escaped his death then i had made up my mind to dispatch him myself by shooting him through the head  early in the morning we began the attack which lasted with unremitting fury for some hours at last i was unfortunately surrounded by some indians who made me their prisoner and carried me off in triumph i had scarcely arrived among their chiefs when i was ordered to be scalped a punishment of all others the most dreadful and they had fastened their hands in my hair to draw the skin over my scull which they were going to separate with a knife when providence interfered in behalf of a wretch like me and to make my humiliation the deeper chose for its instrument the very lieutenant whose life i intended to destroy it seems that hearing of my captivity he got a handful of men together and rushing through the thickest part of the enemy arrived at the spot just time enough to save me from the bloody catastrophe  overcome with joy at my delivery i fell at the feet of my benefactor and asked him how he could think of venturing his life to save so unworthy a being to which he nobly replied that he was not ignorant of the hatred i so unjustly bore him but that a knowledge of my infernal malice though it might alarm his feelings as a man could not efface his duty as a christian which instructed him to save the life even of his enemy and if possible to return him good for evil  i was so awed by the majesty and benevolence of his conduct that i took a resolution from that hour of looking up to him as an example and amend my life by a recollection of the means by which it had been preserved  nothing remarkable occurred after this adventure till the campaign ended when the regiment i belonged to being ordered home i sold out in order to settle in america having contracted a soft intimacy with a lady who resided there and whom i afterward married we have lived ever since in the utmost harmony and were it not for the intrusion of distress which indeed added the captain with a heavy sigh has visited us since our union but too often we should be as happy a couple as any breathing under heaven in short continued the stranger i am afraid that the vices of the former part of my life have drawn down a curse upon my innocent wife and children here the tears started from his eyes which so affected me that i involuntarily wept too but the stranger recovering himself went on as follows  i had not been long married when i received a letter which informed me of the death of my father and that my mother had married a second husband and at the time of my fathers decease his affairs were so embarrassed by the lawsuits which he had been maintaining for years that he had left his family almost in a state of beggary  nor did my own private affairs turn out a whit better for having run out the money which i got for my commission and the principal half of my wifes portion remaining in the hands of a capital merchant in london who refused to remit any part of it to the continent we resolved to leave america and get that satisfaction in england which it was almost impossible to procure at so great a distance we accordingly sold off all our effects and my wife and i with two children and a maid embarked for the port of london  when we arrived here i took every prudent step as i then thought for the recovery of my property  but alas there i was most woefully deceived i was ridiculous enough to build a certainty of success upon the justice of my cause but the event has proved that it was but a sorry foundation to erect my hope upon for after two years spent in unnecessary protraction in which time i had expended not only my last guinea but every valuable i had that could raise one the momentous affair came to a trial and i had the mortification to find that my oppressors being a richer man than myself was a certain sign that he would prove victorious and that the boasted laws of this country can afford but little protection to the equitable claims of poverty and honor when their spirit and their intention can be so easily perverted by the villainous ingenuity of professional maneaters in short sir i lost my cause for want of sufficient money to fee the counsel and the judge very gravely decreed against me because i had not an opportunity of telling him the reasons why he should have done otherwise  i shall never forget the situation of my wretched family when i returned to inform them of the melancholy event which had consigned them to all the horrors of want and desperation my poor maria after she had recovered her senses a little for she fainted repeatedly in my arms on the first news of our defeat and was assured that such an account could be real she fell upon her knees surrounded by her halffamished children and implored the omnipotent searcher of all hearts to reject the last claims of mercy which might be entreated in his dying hour by the unprincipled miscreant who had robbed her poor little ones of that bread which justice should have given them to satisfy the irresistible appeals of hunger but pardon the presumption of a maddening wretch exclaimed my poor maria recollecting herself for i bow my head in obedience to thy blessed dispensations and must teach my heart no other language in future but  o lord thy will be done  the noise which the tender partner of my misfortunes had made in the wild indulgence of her sorrows attracted the notice of a person who was in the adjoining chamber on a visit to an old couple one of whom was bedridden and having been turned out of the hospital as incurable was obliged to lengthen his woefraught being by the casual bounty of the good and charitable hearing the moans of distress he gave a gentle tap at the door and lifting up the latch he entered the room but good heavens how was i amazed to recognize in his person the individual lieutenant that had saved me from the fury of the barbarous indians it was some time before i could make him believe who i was so much had the woes that i had endured and the difficulties i had experienced altered my person since we took leave of each other but the moment that he was convinced of my identity he embraced me with all the warmth of an old friend and sitting down with a little infant on each knee asked the particulars of my life since we had parted with all possible delicacy and painful curiosity  when he had been made acquainted with our story he took my wife by one hand and me by the other and bade us not despair but put our trust in god almighty who would receive us if deserving into his benign bosom and shield our little family from the machinations of the wicked and the prostitution of power  after a present of some gingerbread to the children which i understood he always carried about with him for that purpose he took his leave promising to pay us another visit the following morning and he was as good as his word for he not only came to make us happy by his advice but to comfort us by his assistance and insisted as fortune had looked upon him with an eye of kindness since he left america by advancing him in the army that i should partake of that bounty as he expressed it which providence only sent to the rich that they might become faithful stewards to the poor by distributing her gifts with the hand of circumspection and benevolence among the most necessitous of their fellow creatures  notwithstanding the number and weight of my distresses i felt a great consolation in the visits of this worthy officer and indeed both i and my family must have perished but for the generosity of his disposition the frequency with which the remembrance of the malice i once exercised toward him recurred to my mind hurt my peace exceedingly but i now strive to expiate the heinousness of such transgressions by uniformly praying for his wellbeing  chapter xxxvii the stranger takes his leave  reflections on the vicissitudes of life  arrive at the cellar  a humourous account of a marriageceremony in which the intentions of hymen are defeated by the influence of bacchus  here the officer took his leave with the warmest wishes for my felicity and the hour approaching that i was to meet my friend crambo at the ordinary i set forward for that place contemplating all the way on the vicissitudes of human nature and the inscrutable and unaccountable methods by which providence protects us from impending evil and destroys our fairest hopes of prosperity these reflections tended to bring on a strong tincture of melancholy in my mind for as i looked around me i fancied that misery had taken up her abode in almost every breast and that the smiling countenances of many that passed me in the street served but as a temporary veil to cover the real inquietude of the heart within  the few examples of happiness i had seen since i started in the world convinced me of the truth of an observation i had often heard which asserts that we are born to suffer much more than to enjoy but finding myself arrived at the mouth of the cellar where i was to meet the poet the fumes of the boiled and roast that ascended from that receptacle of the sons of apollo saluted my nostrils in gales of such delicious flavor as drove away in an instant every other consideration but that of eating and voluptuousness  as i descended into the quilldrivers refectory i heard a loud laugh which indicated that mirth presided at the board when i had got far enough into the cellar to have a glimpse of the company i perceived my friend crambo as merry as the best of them i was particularly glad of that sign as i imagined he had been fortunate enough to touch his bookseller for some cash that morning and i found afterward that i was not out in my reckoning for i had scarcely sat down when he whispered in my ear that he had been cursed lucky since he saw me and had absolutely persuaded his publisher in paternoster row to advance him half a guinea at the same time slipping a couple of shillings into my hand unperceived by the company added that he was always happy to have it in his power to assist his friends now the poet was called to order by the rest of the company to listen to a story which mr mpaste the compiler of a monthly magazine was going to divert the company with my friend bowed obedience to the fiat and i sat wrapped up in expectation of hearing something excellent  you must know gentlemen said the compiler that i have the honor of lodging at a chandlers shop and being considered as an inmate of the family i was applied to to write an epithalamium on the approaching nuptials of my landlady with an old tallowchandler who lived opposite which were to happen in a few days and to have the thing done in a genteel style it was resolved by both parties that it should be celebrated on a saturday evening well gentlemen you must suppose every thing going on swimmingly the bridecake made the company invited and the old yellow tabby that had been mouldering at the bottom of the brides drawer under the ravages of moths and time for at least twenty years drawn forth by the influence of that wanton rogue cupid and newly furbished and farthingaled by the ingenious hands of a modern mantuamaker to make it if possible look fashionable as it was intended for the gaudy vestment of the bride on that momentous occasion  instead of a system to fasten on her cap which she had imported but the day before from cranbornalley she wore an old wig of her former husbands which was frizzled and tortured into the shape necessary for the purpose and when fastened on her head her visage by the aid of this modish ornament bore no bad resemblance to the forehead of a newfoundland dog  the company invited on that memorable evening consisted of a few select neighbors  mrs grogram the oldclothes woman a rich chimneysweepers lady and her two daughters a pettifogging attorney mrs snatchem the pawnbrokers widow from the corner of the opposite alley the tallowchandlers nephew and your humble servant  when the clock had struck four this goodly group had assembled and it was plain that the bridegroom had exhausted not only his purse but his invention to dress himself out to the best advantage and make his person as engaging and irresistible as possible  he had chosen a deepcoloured prussianblue coat that would have been considered as the pink of elegance about half a century ago the cuffs being large enough to make a modern waistcoat with flaps down to his heels and the dark blue was finely relieved by a large row of brass buttons which covered at least onefourth of that part of his habiliments added to this he had on a scarlet waistcoat of prodigious magnitude a pair of buckskin breeches and a wig without powder in circumference as large as a moderate gooseberrybush which considering the intense heat of the weather was a dress taken all together that must naturally as you will imagine attract our notice if not our admiration  after tea the whole party was summoned to attend the hymeneal altar and when we had got to the door to step into the coaches that waited for our reception there was as great a crowd gathered in the street to behold our dress and equipage as if the lord mayor of london were going to westminster in solemn procession on the ninth of november or a show of wild beasts had just arrived from the african deserts when we were all secured within the coaches they moved in awful grandeur amidst the shouts of the populace to the parish church where the high priest of hymen vulgarly ycleped a parson waited to unite these extraordinary originals in the solemn bands of holy matrimony  in the course of this tremendous service a few mistakes happened which sometimes disconcerted the whole business but you will not wonder at that when i inform you that the bridegroom was as deaf as a millpost and the priest when he came to that part of the affair which requires him to ask the bridegroom if he is willing to take his blessed acquisition to be his true and lawful wife was forced to bawl as loud as the woman that cries newcastle salmon in the hundreds of drury lane before he could make him understand the nature of the question but however the bridegroom made ample amends when he did for as soon as his ear had caught the intent of the requisition he answered with great precipitation yes yes yes yes yes but this was not all the impediment which took place for another important mistake occurred which was no other than the bridegrooms putting the ring on the wrong finger of his amiable spouse and this unfortunate stroke of fate caused an infinite deal of trouble to the parties for the hero of the evening being a man of a narrow and avaricious disposition had purchased a secondhand ring for the occasion from his neighbor the pawnbroker which unluckily not being measured to the ladys finger proved too small but the bridegroom by dint of personal strength had absolutely forced it on the poor gentlewomans middle finger ere the mistake was found out and then the endeavor to pull it off being found impossible the ceremony was finished without it and the blessing perhaps conveyed with equal efficacy to the parties notwithstanding so gross a violation of prescribed order  as we returned home the bride expressed some doubts as to the validity of the obligation they had mutually entered into as she imagined the blunder of her yoke fellow in the wrong application of that important appendage to matrimony on the finger of a lady had in a great degree defeated the intention of that sacred business and she began to enlarge on the stupidity of some people with such a tincture of bitterness that we certainly should have had a matrimonial duet in proper character before the consummation if i had not luckily observed that the mistake was of no sort of consequence whatever for that the personal liberty of his majestys liege subjects might be charmed away with equal force by placing the ring on the wrong finger as well as on the right as my landlady paid a sort of deference to my opinion i had the good fortune to accommodate the matter before it arrived at what might be called a downright dispute but not without a few oblique hints from the lady which proved pretty clearly to the company that she was not perfectly satisfied with a husband who did not upon all occasions know what use to make of his wifes ring  but now the cavalcade arriving at the brides door the betrothed couple were handed out of the carriage attended by the huzzas of threefourths of the vagabondinhabitants of that enlightened and elegant quarter of the town as soon as the whole party was well housed we sat down to a cold repast of boiled beef ham pigscheek and jellies with plenty of whitbreads best brown stout pipes and tobacco and a bowl of punch almost capacious enough to swim a fleet of westindiamen nor would i have you understand gentlemen that this assemblage of dainties was provided in vain on the contrary the only spirit of ambition that seemed to reign among the guests was who should devour the most totally regardless of the use of knives and forks which they thought superfluous as heaven had given them fingers they began the attack with the appetites of aldermen and continued the siege with the industry of pigs till at last what with the punch and good living the major part of the company began to stagger about the room the ladies not excepted and the bride and bridegroom made such direct overtures of fondness before their guests as plainly evinced that they wished them all at the devil that they might be at full liberty to put the finishing stroke to a business which the church had so recently sanctified with its infallible authority but alas that grim disposer of human events vulgarly called fate doubtless envious of their approaching raptures cruelly determined that this should not be and the lovely bride panted in vain for those pleasures which destiny decreed should exist only in her warm imagination  to drop all metaphorical descriptions and come to the point i must inform you that some wags who frequented a public house in the same street entered into a combination to put a trick upon the tallowchandler which should deprive him of the sweet society of his bride for one night at least and they effected it in the following manner one of them got a note conveyed to the bridegroom who by this time was halfseas over requesting his immediate attendance at a friends house upon some business of the most material consequence to his peace at the same time desiring him to steal away unperceived by the company at his house and promising that he should be detained only a few minutes at farthest the credulous maker of candles no sooner received this mischievous epistle than he stole away to the appointed rendezvous where a man was dressed up as a countryman just arrived from lincolnshire with an account of his brothers death and that he had left him a great fortune at the same time apologizing for the manner of communicating the intelligence as apprehensive of disordering the tender nerves of his lady if he had gone directly to his house with such a dismal tale upon his wedding day dismal tale cries the tallowchandler interrupting him half fuddled why damme it is the best story i have heard these seven years and damme you are the best friend i have seen these seven years to be sure do you see as how i ought to be sorry for the death of a relation but damme never mind  though he was a cursed sort of a curmudgeon cries the bridegoom i hope he is gone to a better place at any rate do you see my friend if he is happy why i am contented  during this exemplary dialogue the pretended countryman plied the tallowchandler with large glasses of punch half the ingredients of which were strong brandy until they had brought him to a proper pitch of insensibility when one of the party came running in to inform his associates in iniquity that all was ready which it seems was a watchword for bringing out the bridegroom  and each taking hold of an arm and a leg they conveyed him to the door where a stagecoach was waiting for some passengers and taking him to the rear of the carriage they threw the poor tallowchandler by main force into the basket like a stinking salmon into the thames in which situation he lay bent double and snoring as loud as the hogs at vauxhall until he was waked the next morning at winchester by the ostlers throwing in a heavy portmanteau which alighting on the breast of the intoxicated bridegroom entirely broke the fetters of his repose as well as three of his false ribs and he was instantly dragged out of his uncomfortable bedchamber roaring like a bull with agony by the servants of the inn who secured him as a fellow who only feigned to be drunk and had stolen into the basket with a design of robbing the stage on the journey  these particulars i have since learned from one of the conspirators thus was the poor fellow in the warm moments of fond expectation like another tantalus snatched from the enjoyment of bliss just as he got the cup of happiness to his lip while his poor lady at home overcome by grief and anger at the disappointment of her wishes fell into hysterics for the remainder of the night and from which she was not entirely recovered until the next morning when some timely draughts of burnt brandy and nutmeg relieved her so far that she was enabled to sit up in her bed and listen to the condolance of her female friends who had kindly assembled for that pious purpose but the poor woman was so woebegone and dejected that she could answer their consolation and conjecture only with her tears  chapter xxxviii the poet gives me some salutary advice  he is attracted by my abilities  consults me on his literary pursuits  i forfeit his friendship by the exercise of my candor  a sarcastic colloquy between the host and the poet  the latters overthrow and discomfiture  after the company had applauded mr mpaste for his story which he assured them he should work into a tale and have inserted in the next months publication we all sat down to dinner at the conclusion of which my friend crambo and i retired to another part of the room in order to discourse upon our private affairs and think of some expedient by which i might be enabled to get a livelihood without existing by the sale of the few articles of wearingapparel i had left after ruminating upon a variety of projects the poet advised me to look into the daily papers where i should be certain of reading among the list of the wanteds something that would answer my purpose at the same time the generous son of apollo made me an unlimited offer of his purse and friendship such as they were upon all occasions and throwing the former upon the table emptied its contents which consisted of two halfcrown pieces a sixpence with a hole in it a few halfpence and a tobaccostopper  i was so much affected by this instance of his generosity that i could not refrain from getting up and hugging him in my arms as the best and most disinterested friend i had in the world a compliment which he returned with great ardour and accompanied it with an observation even more pleasing than his bounty namely that he had been attracted solely by the purity of my judgment and my abilities as a scholar such an eulogium from any one would have given me pleasure but when i considered it as coming from the mouth of one of the greatest authors of the age for such i had conceived him to be from his own broad insinuations i was transported by my vanity to a pitch of the utmost extravagance and did not fail to extol my panegyrist to the skies in terms of unbounded flattery all which though but the incense of a novice like me he received with peculiar complaisance and was pleased to declare himself as happy in my commendation as if the stagyrite himself had peeped from his tomb to signify his approbation of the labors of his brain  after swearing an eternal attachment to each other he took a parcel of papers from a pocket made withinside his waistcoat and spreading them upon the table in particular order addressed me as follows mr varnish said the diminutive bard i am now going to give you an unquestionable proof of my confidence which no man in my circumstances would if he were not previously convinced of your experience and taste as a scholar as well as of your unshaken fidelity to my interest as an individual in short my dear sir exclaimed the poet squeezing my hand i am going to show you some hints mere literary atoms to be sure but such i flatter myself as when called into form will not only secure me the otium cum dignitate at present but what is infinitely more dear to my imagination will hand me down to posterity with a laurel wreathed around my brow so ample that the very shadow of it shall hide the weaknesses of my nature here my dear friend are the precious morsels said the poet holding up the papers upon which i must inevitably build my fame and fortune but to return to the intent of this communication let us now commune a little upon the scheme i have in agitation and i entreat you as my particular friend to point out such parts as shall appear objectionable to you for the very best writers that ever existed have been obliged to the assistance of their friends on these occasions mr varnish you know  pope had his bolingbroke prussias monarch his voltaire and moliere his old woman humanum est errare but it is the lot of our nature the most brilliant genius that ever honored the blazing ages of antiquity was not perfect no continues my friend crambo absolute perfection is not to be found on this earth that is certain but apropos to business or perhaps you may think the exordium of more importance than the subject the affair that i mean to consult you upon my young aristotle is an epic poem and the basis of it is said the poet leaning across the table and whispering in my ear with a tone of exultation the siege of gibraltar  well says the little author looking me full in the face and rubbing his hands i hope you will admit my friend that i have been tolerably lucky in my subject at least i think so too indeed replied i for i know of no theme so proper for the pen of an englishman as the glorious achievements of his own countrymen  you charm me by the propriety of your observations replies the poet i protest you have an amazing deal of judgment apt and comprehensive and what is better damme but you are a true patriot  i bowed my acknowledgements for the favor of such compliments when the bard produced the argument of the first book for my consideration  when i had perused it a little i ventured to point out an inaccuracy in the poets manner of treating the story to which he significantly replied with a nod of the head aye aye read on my friend if you please the deeper you get into the marrow the more you will be ravished with the performance  i proceeded agreeably to his directions to read farther and carefully to examine the matter as i went on at last coming in my humble opinion to a manifest impropriety i gave my opinion of it with all the freedom of a man who felt himself interested in the reputation of his friend but i found that the author was so far from taking it in this point of view that he demurred against my observation and added  pish man i perceive you are not sufficiently acquainted with the subject  i told him in reply that though i did not pretend to be a poet i could lay some claim to a strong memory and that informed me the plot was ill managed and if such a breach of propriety were admissible in an epic poem it was not to be reconciled to the laws of truth and to depart from truth in such a theme were to dishonor the cause he meant to immortalise but here i found that i had overshot my mark for the little bard looking at me with a countenance reddened high with ferocious indignation snatched the manuscript out of my hand with great violence and told me in direct terms that he had been grossly deceived in ranking me for a man of understanding when i had not discernment enough to discover a literary beauty if it were even set down in roman capitals  i now began to smell my error and would willingly have retracted but i found it was too late for upon my attempting to open my mouth he turned round to the landlord of the place and cried aloud damme landlord here is a pretty fellow pretends to judge of an epic poem and he has not read enough to distinguish between the excellence of the iliad and the mummery and trash contained in the life of tom hickathrift here you mr critic cries the bard to me be so good as to return me the two shillings you dog i lent you to pay for your dinner what you have lent him money too says the landlord laughing heartily yes replies the poet and he has made me a damned grateful return for it  by ch  t says the landlord i am glad of it why are you glad replies the bard bristling up to the host like an enraged turkeycock why cries the other because you would sooner be giving your money to any idle vagabond like that than pay your lawful debts  you tell a damned lie says the poet i will let you know what it is to give a gentleman the lie in his own house and be damned to you replies the other why you poor dog that is impossible says the bard for you never kept one but have spent your life under ground grubbing for an existence like a mole in a meadow until you have become as blind to your own interest as the reptile you imitate blind says the landlord with all the dignity he could assume aye i say blind cries the follower of the muses or you would never affront a man of genius when he condescends to eat in your infernal regions condescend to eat quotha replies the subterranean cook  damme you snivelling dog you know you would have been starved long ago if it had not been for many a good slice from my surloin which i suffered you to take upon tick from a motive of charity you know i did you ungrateful scoundrel surloin cries the author enraged to the summit of madness by the foregoing remarks  damme you never had a surloin in your cellar what had i then you mongrel maker of verses rejoins the host oxcheek and neck of beef says the other and too good for you and be damned to you replies the landlord you lie you scoundrel cries the bard do i says the other damme i will teach you better manners  and immediately threw the remains of a shin of beef at the poet which striking him on the side of his head he instantly measured his length upon the floor and growling bit the dust  now hostilities on both sides beginning to cease and finding that i had not the most distant expectation of regaining my former post in the little authors good opinion i pulled out the two shillings and giving them to the landlord for the poet with a heart ready to burst with vexation i walked up stairs to meditate at my leisure upon the instability of human friendship  chapter xxxix take a lodging  the symbols of an author  reflections on the neglect of genius  walk out and meet with an old acquaintance  my prejudice against the count removed  i had not proceeded far in the street before i recollected that it was a step absolutely necessary to provide myself with a lodging and as the evening was advancing with rapid strides and the enamoured charioteer of day was posting to his thetis on the wings of love i thought it high time to be as industrious in the settlement of that business as possible i had scarcely taken the resolution when passing by a mean sort of a house i perceived a bill stuck on the window signifying that they had lodgings to let for single gentlemen  though i had but very slender pretensions to the character of a gentleman i resolved to try what sort of accommodation the house afforded and accordingly knocking at the door a woman came who first took an accurate survey of my figure in so surly a manner as convinced me that she was not very fond of my appearance and then asked my business i replied that i wanted a lodging and if any in her house suited me i had no objection to take them  she told me i was an utter stranger to her to be sure but as she conceived something favorable from my countenance if we could agree why she would as soon let me have a room in her house as another that to be sure she never had any thing but gentlemen lodge in her house but says the old hag we must not always judge from appearances handsome is that handsome does and your money may be as good to me as anothers  after this preamble i had a strong inclination to go away thinking the lodgings might be too elegant for me until she informed me that she had but one room unoccupied and the last gentleman that lived in it was a poet oh ho my good landlady says i show me the apartment directly for i am sure if it was not too good for a poet it will do very well for your humble servant so saying i shut the door and followed the poor woman up four pair of stairs into a back garret here cries she leaning upon an old table to recover her breath  this is the only place i have to spare at present and this has been empty but three weeks only since poor mr couplet left it aye aye my good woman replied i i could have guessed at the last tenant by the relies of his profession these are the true symbols of genius cried i taking up the stump of a pen a washerwomans bill and a shoe without a heel you are merry said the old lady but i assure you mr couplet was as fine a spoken man as you would meet with in a summers day and pray replied i how came you to lose so accomplished a lodger aye poor gentleman cries the landlady wiping her eyes good lack he was was arrested one evening on a note of his printers and is now writing a parcel of sermons for a norfolk clergyman in the masters side of the fleet prison yes i thought it would come to that replied i when you mentioned his profession for there are only two things of which a man of genius may be said to be certain in this world and pray what are they asked my landlady a prison while he exists and a grave when he is no more he is consigned to the first because he has more spirit than economy and he is indebted for the latter to the convenience of his neighbors and what is still more melancholy there are many persons who will give a guinea for his works bound in morocco when he is dead that would perhaps have denied him the loan of a crown when living to have protracted his miserable existence anon cried the woman oh nothing rejoined i  how much do you ask for this apartment two shillings a week is the lowest that i can afford it at cries the other if you are willing to give that you may take possession directly i nodded assent to her proposal and the bargain was ratified  the woman was retiring out of the room before i observed that my apartment was totally deficient in one necessary and even indispensable article of furniture namely a bed and upon my intimating this defect to the wrinkled gentlewoman she waddled over to an old chest of drawers as i imagined and unhinging the sides let down a bedstead with all the apparatus in the same breath informing me that there was one at my service good enough for the best man in the land though i was not an entire convert to her method of thinking in regard to the beauty of the affair i was very well satisfied as it was full as elegant as i could wish in such a situation so wishing my landlady safe down stairs i sat upon one corner of my couch with a heart heavy laden with sorrow and my arms enfolded and broke out into the following ejaculation  hapless miserable man how art thou subjected to the caprice of fortune who not satisfied with making thy wretched being groan under the pressure of pain and hunger and subject to the inclement elements adds to aggravate thy calamities the intolerable stings of mental pain to what purpose are we decreed to exist if to prolong a series of days clouded with misfortune it were better that we were altogether extinct for the continuance of a life such as mine is not worth the solicitation i am poor and consequently must be despised and being naturally unsuspicious am hourly liable to the subtle arts of hypocrisy and imposition  after i had indulged myself in this reverie i sat musing upon the most probable means of raising a small supply of money i revolved upon every expedient that my fancy could suggest to my despair but found them all either unproductive as to the desired end or impossible to be put in execution i was rapidly sinking from one base idea to another until i found my mind a chaos of confusion in which desperation and shame alternately passed before me to relieve myself from this heavy embarrassment i took up my hat and walking down stairs sullenly rushed into the street with a full determination to raise some money by one means or another  as i was rambling along in this state of perturbation without knowing which path to pursue for the best i felt a tap on the shoulder from a person behind which was given with an air of great familiarity and upon my turning round to recognize the person who had saluted me so unexpectedly a young man held out his hand as an overture of friendship and gave me to understand that he had enjoyed the pleasure of my company a few days before at an ordinary near the seven dials i instantly recollected him to be one of the gentlemen to whose notice my very good friend the count had introduced me as this rencounter brought his ungenerous behavior to me fresh into my memory i told my new acquaintance the whole story without disguising the smallest circumstance when i came to that part of the narrative where he declared his intentions of making my fortune by marriage and had so completely lulled my understanding by the force of the grossest flattery that was ever directed to a human being the young man burst into an immoderate fit of laughter as i considered the excessive mirth of my new friend to be another instance of my disgrace in consequence of the counts lies and ingenuity i inveighed against him in the severest terms of reproach that my resentment could furnish me with and swore to chastise him personally the first time that i should meet with him here my new acquaintance thought proper to correct the violence of my language by observing that admitting the count had played a few of his usual pranks at my expense i should yet find it my interest to keep well with him besides added he the account you have heard of his character from the landlady must have arisen from prejudice for it is not only overcharged but in many respects entirely false and could have proceeded from no other but the mouth of his enemy for though i will admit that he is fond of indulging an eccentric disposition and sometimes fastens too close upon the weaknesses of mankind believe me that he is neither destitute of principle or of friendship but very often exercises both in the most disinterested manner for the advantage of his fellow creatures this testimony of the stranger in favor of the count tended considerably to reduce the ill opinion i had formed of him and the more particularly when my new companion assured me that he would pay me what he had borrowed the first time that he saw me and would cheerfully lend me as much more provided he had it in his pocket and my necessities called for such an instance of his generosity  chapter xl we agree to drink together  i am comforted by his discourse  he favors me with a short history of his life  the melancholy death of a good woman occasioned by the wickedness of mankind  my spirits raised by mr butlers philosophy  pledge my waistcoat  am promised relief by the keeper of a registeroffice  it was now proposed by my new adherent that we should drink together to our better acquaintance and i felt myself extremely mortified to tell him that i was obliged to defer that favor oh damn it replies the young fellow if you are shy from the want of ready cash never mind that to be sure i am not very rich myself continues he but as what we shall spend new will not make me a penny poorer at the years end i must insist upon your accompanying me they fell excellent porter at the crooked billet yonder cries he pointing to an alehouse at the end of the street and take my word for it that it will warm the cockles of your heart and operate like a draught from the lethean lake it will make you forget your cares my boy giving me a hearty flap upon the back  so come along do you see and make no more words about the matter  by the force of this persuasion i followed him to the house and taking our seats he called for a tankard of the best which soon made its appearance mantling with a majestic head at the top like a smallcauliflower which he gently removed aside and drank to our mutual prosperity then offering me the vessel in my turn i was so fond of the healthgiving beverage that i took care to see the bottom of the tankard before my lips would permit the salubrious liquid to separate from their embraces  when we had become a little more intimate by the influence of the tankard for it is wonderful how forcibly that operates in cementing friendships my new acquaintance informed me without reserve of his situation in life and his willingness to prove of service to me if i thought him worthy of such a distinction at the same time assuring me that he was himself by no means unacquainted with misfortune i had scarcely time to thank him for his kind offer when he unbosomed himself in the following terms  my name sir says he is butler my father was an officer in a marching regiment who died when i was but ten years old and left my mother to struggle with an iniquitous world incumbered with two children  myself and my sister who was my elder by two years as they had contrived in my fathers lifetime to live in a style of some respectability she had contracted a numerous acquaintance some of whom had it in their power to assist her  and as she had frequently received the most unconditional offers of friendship from them she thought it no breach of propriety or delicacy to call their professions into practice when she found herself in a situation that made so exalted an exercise of the human wishes necessary but here my good mother found she had been leaning for assistance upon a broken staff for as soon as her polite friends discovered and they possess uncommon sagacity upon these occasions that her circumstances denied her the power of fulfilling the reciprocity of beneficial offices they gradually fell off in their attachments and the visible declension of their friendship began with pity and ended with contempt dejected with the unfavourable prospect of her affairs she found that she must exert her utmost industry to maintain herself and family which she effected however very tolerably by taking in plainwork in the performance of which my sister though young afforded her considerable assistance  and the profits of that annexed to the scanty pittance allowed from government to the widows of subaltern officers just furnished a bare sufficiency to bring us up with decency and frugality in this confined manner we contrived to jog on until one day she received an unexpected visit from a distant relation who had held a place of importance under the east india company and who proposed to use his interest with the directors in procuring me a place in some of the public offices my mother was overjoyed at this prospect of my success and in consequence strained every nerve to give me a suitable education when i had attained my fifteenth year not hearing from her kinsman she wrote him a letter upon the subject which he condescended to answer after a delay of four months but the sweetness of the contents attoned for the seeming coolness and neglect  for in that letter he assured my mother that she need not be uneasy for he had got an absolute promise that i should be appointed to the first vacancy that fell and as the appearances of good fortune are sometimes not content with coming alone another circumstance took place at this time which gave additional happiness to the poor widow my sister who was remarkably tall and handsome for her years had attracted the notice of a gentleman of immense property and his passion was so deeply rooted that he wrote a letter to my sister desiring an interview in which he made the most ardent and unequivocal declaration of his love my sister had no sooner received this flaming epistle than she ran in triumph to her mother and showed the flattering testimony of her own powers of attraction and the poor woman was not less transported than her daughter for she literally believed that the endowments of her child were capable of subduing the heart of an emperor and had no doubt of the reality of the circumstance indeed this was my good parents weak side for if ever she discovered more folly than usual it was in the extravagance of her raptures whenever she heard the voice of deceit attribute that degree of beauty to my sister and understanding to myself which the dispensations of providence had perhaps denied both the one and the other but as the partiality is amiable though destructive it ought to be forgiven  to return to the narrative my sister was permitted to give her enamoured swain such encouragement as was consistent with prudence but at the same time to take no material steps in the affair without first consulting her mother in the infancy of the attachment poor louisa for that was her name faithfully fulfilled the engagement entered into with her fond parent  but at last she permitted her lover to make some small inroads upon decorum which she well knew would be displeasing to the author of her being and for that reason she concealed them from her knowledge till at length poor girl she waded so deep in the habits of deception that even the idea of a falsehood had lost its consequent horror  unhappy louisa she little imagined that she was wounding her eternal happiness when she lost sight of the beauty of truth in short eventually passing from one indiscretion to another the rapid approaches of vice became less formidable as they became more frequent until prudence at length abdicated her gentle bosom and left the defenseless victim a prey to the alluring arts of prostitution  to come to the catastrophe in a few words my poor sister fell a prey to the insinuations of a villain who first perjured his soul to draw her from the arms of innocence and peace and then consigned her to destruction for giving faith to his detestable and infernal frauds on the news of this miserable event my mother was seized with a fit of sickness which terminated in a deep melancholy and her disorder was strengthened when at her particular request i went to the indiahouse to enquire after her relation from whom she had not heard for a considerable time and learned to my sorrow that he had been gone to the continent for some months before and so far from having got me the situation he promised that he had never so much as mentioned my name to the board of directors both these disappointments affected her peace so much that her melancholy ended in a confirmed madness and she died poor woman cried mr butler with the tears in his eyes in bedlamhospital a shocking spectacle of woe and wretchedness  since her death i have procured myself a decent livelihood by writing for attorneys in which situation i have continued ever since to be sure we are obliged to work devilish hard for what we earn and the service is not the most respectable besides i am perfectly convinced that if the finer feelings of human nature are to be rendered callous by example it must be by associating with that right honorable fraternity  but as the motto of our family has been il faut manger from time immemorial i am sometimes obliged to sacrifice my ease and my ambition to fulfill the intent of so important an obligation  when my companion had finished his story he ordered the pot to be replenished and bade me not permit the accidental strokes of misfortune which visited every man at some period of his life or another to cast me down at the same time pulling out his purse he requested me to accept of the loan of a few shillings but this i absolutely refused telling him with great firmness that i would sooner put an entire end to my being than continue to live a burden upon fortuitous charity he clasped my hand in his and told me that he admired my spirit but advised me not to let it carry me too far that there was a medium between rashness and meanness and again entreated my acceptance of his offer but on my refusal a second time he put his purse in his pocket asking me with a grave air how i intended to exist this question made me thoughtful but i replied  i trust i shall be able to do that by my industry i mean to enquire for some place i suppose you are not over nice says my friend no i replied if it will but afford me a living i shall be satisfied till something better offers then your best way rejoins he is to make application to a registeroffice and they will direct you to a place immediately the fees of office amount only to a few shillings added he  and if you will not let me assist you you had better leave something at my uncles and he will lend you halfacrown with the greatest readiness and you may fetch it away at pleasure when you find it convenient but will not that be taking too great a liberty with your relation cried i besides you know that i am a total stranger to his person here my friend smiled and told me that the word uncle was only a metaphorical expression in common use among all men of the world and applied to those people who get a convenient livelihood by lending money on pledges and you need not have any scruples of delicacy cries my friend on the score of making use of their purse for they will take pretty good care not to lay you under the smallest obligation to their politeness or even to their humanity upon the strength of this information i went to a house almost opposite and which was distinguished from the rest by the sign of three blue balls and entering by a small door in a dark passage i pulled off my waistcoat and deposited it with the man of the shop for two shillings though it had cost me a guinea but a short time before and was not a bit the worse for wear however i pocketed the money and buttoning my coat from the top to the bottom i hurried back to my friend who congratulated me on the dexterity with which i had executed the business he having previously insisted upon discharging the reckoning we parted extremely well pleased with each other and engaging provided i was not employed in service to dine with him the following day at the ordinary where i first had the happiness of attracting his notice  i did not lose a moment in delay but went immediately to a registeroffice that was kept in holborn i had scarcely signified the intention of my visit when the keeper informed me that he had several places that would suit me exactly and requested me to come in the morning and he would satisfy me more fully in the matter  i was so much pleased with the issue of this adventure that i went home and slept that night with unusual comfort but waking before the hour appointed by the officekeeper for my attendance i lay in bed ruminating upon the happiness that awaited my embraces and so fondly was i wrapped in the pleasures of the imagination that i thought i saw fortune smiling upon my wishes which elevated my heart so much that every pulse in my body accorded with peace and harmony  chapter xli attend at the office in the morning  dispatched to my new place  my reception by the housekeeper  pass an ordeal before my master  approved of and made happy  before i got up a thousand pleasurable circumstances arose in my mind and i had no doubt but i had arrived at the end of my calamities at last hearing the clock give notice that the longexpected hour of nine was come i leaped out of bed with uncommon sprightliness and surveyed my garret with rapture as i put on my clothes for those objects that had appeared to me disagreeable but the evening before wore now a more graceful aspect so much does the beauty of all exterior objects depend upon the serenity and tincture of the mind  when i had dressed myself i sallied forth to the temple of fortune for such had my fond fancy pictured the registeroffice to be and i did not permit the grass to grow under my feet in the journey for i performed it as quick as if the preservation of my life depended upon the speed i should use in that expedition i got to the house just as one of the understrappers of the place was opening the shop for the public accommodation when i told him my errand he looked at me with some surprise and said it was very lucky that i had not called the family up in the middle of the night and added that for his part he was much obliged to me that i had patience to wait until he had pulled down the first shutter i could not help feeling some resentment toward the author of these sarcastic remarks upon my eagerness for employment but resolved to suppress my anger at any rate and not suffer my passions to operate at so critical a time to the disadvantage of my interest so apparently taking all in good part i sat down in the shop to wait until the principal should think proper to honor me with his presence  during the time of my attendance in the office a great number of young people of both sexes came in with some of whom i entered into conversation and learned from their discourse that the hand of necessity had not been employed in oppressing me alone but that a considerable number of other people had received an equal share of her regard who perhaps deserved from their merits a very different fate  at last when my patience was wellnigh exhausted the director of the office made his appearance in a morninggown and a blue velvet cap and eyeing me among the crowd of claimants called me on one side and gave me to understand there was a family at the west end of the town that wanted a servant immediately and that he believed i should find the place not only easy but comfortable at the same time giving me to understand that i must take this part of his behavior as an instance of his great regard for me as it was not usual with him to be so expeditious but that he had conceived a liking for me from the first from the manner and modesty of my application and had determined in consequence to lose no time in settling me to my advantage after i had returned him my warmest thanks for his kindness i gave him a shilling and taking his recommendation to the family i set out in quest of a new place of servitude with a heart as light as a feather  when i arrived at the house to which i was directed the door was opened by an old woman turned of fifty who seemed to carry about her person all the dignity and consequence of a housekeeper and i found afterward that i was not deceived by my conjectures  when i told her the nature of my errand she began to question me as to my age and if i had ever been in service before to all which interrogatories i gave such proper answers that she deigned to tell me that she believed i would answer her masters purpose bidding me sit down in the kitchen until she went up stairs to see if the old gentleman was stirring in this state i continued for about ten minutes when a healthy rosycheeked wench came into the kitchen and under pretense of wiping some dishes she took an opportunity of surveying my figure from the corner of her eye which i imagined she did not think displeasing for turning round she asked me with a smile of hospitable complaisance if i would eat any thing that morning or if i had an inclination for some tablebeer she would draw me some i returned her many acknowledgements for these instances of her goodnature and one word begot another till i found myself inclined to be extremely talkative from the friendly complexion of her manners and she was inspired with confidence from the seeming candor of my disposition the first question she put to me that savoured of curiosity and proved her in full possession of the true female spirit was exactly as follows i supposes you are the young man that i heard old honor the housekeeper say was coming to live in our family to this home thrust i replied yes i came with that intention my dear but whether i shall succeed or not depends upon the will of the person who is to employ me oh as for that cries the damsel if you have the good fortune to be pleasing to mrs honor my master will take you tonight before tomorrow for he leaves all them there matters to her as i thought this was a piece of intelligence well worth attending to i questioned the nymph of the kitchen very particularly as to the real situation of mrs honor and found that she had lived in the family for many years and by her upright conduct and fidelity had acquired a very great ascendency over the inclinations of the old gentleman her master  i found likewise from my communicative fellow servants that the family consisted of the old gentleman and his niece a beautiful young lady of about eighteen who was at that time absent from the family on a visit to a relation at eppingforest and whose return was most anxiously wished for by the servants as the sweetness of her temper not only charmed all those that came near her but likewise tended to correct that of the old gentleman her uncle whose natural turn of mind partook of too much acidity when it was not diverted from its illnatured pursuits by the persuasive gentleness of his amiable niece those two with the housekeeper the ruddy lass who entertained me with the familyanecdotes a housemaid and myself formed the domestic establishment of this respectable though confined circle  i was now summoned by mrs honor who had come into the kitchen for that purpose to follow her up stairs into her masters room that i might undergo such enquiries as he should think necessary to make preparatory to my preferment when we had ascended two pair of stairs she bade me stay in the landingplace till her master was ready accordingly she went into an adjoining chamber but returned in a few minutes beckoning me to follow her and tread as lightly as possible i obeyed her directions with such a palpitation of my heart as made me imagine i could even hear its throbbings against my ribs when we came to an inner room i perceived the old gentleman sitting at a table with a napkin under his chin and very seriously employed in demolishing a large bowl of bread and milk which i afterward understood to be his daily breakfast  this new master of mine had passed his grand climacteric at least a dozen years but notwithstanding his aspect was healthy and florid a large nose somewhat inclined to the aquiline parted too small gray eyes which seemed to twinkle with asperity and emit the rays of discord and ill nature when he was given to understand that i waited his pleasure he took no farther notice than by nodding his head and eating the remainder of his mess with an additional haste when he had finished his mornings repast he threw himself back in his chair and pulling a pair of spectacles from a case he fixed them on his tremendous nose with great deliberation and sat looking at me for a few minutes with such circumspective curiosity as if he intended to measure the exact altitude of my person during this critical survey of the greyheaded senior i not only blushed from ear to ear but trembled in every limb lest on so nice an investigation of my figure and appearance i might be found deficient in the requisites for a servant at least in the old gentlemans eyes but he soon removed those apprehensions by observing to his housekeeper that my person corresponded with her account and he had no objection to employ me provided my character were unexceptionable at this declaration i pulled the lieutenants letter from my pocket and was eagerly going to present it to the old man for his perusal but he seemed to retreat from my endeavor with an observation that i need not be in such a devilish hurry and turning to his housekeeper why honor says he this lad you have brought me seems as much transported at the idea of eating a good dinner as a hungry poet at a twelvepenny ordinary i hope he is not halfstarved egad if he is he will cost me more in a month than would pay his wages for a year the housekeeper making no reply to this sarcastic interrogation i made the old gentleman an humble salute and told him that my eagerness arose from an ardent desire of having the honor to serve him and not from any other motive  he appeared somewhat pleased at my apology and told me it was very well at the same time he ordered his housekeeper to prepare for my reception on the evening of the next day  perfectly happy at the success of my application i left my new master and was going into the kitchen immediately to inform the goodnatured damsel of my reception but i found that measure needless for as i opened the door that led to the landingplace i discovered her at the passage ready to wish me joy by which circumstance i found that the inquisitive nymph had been listening at the door during my conversation with her facetious master and the agreeable mistress honor  chapter xlii stumble by chance upon a former acquaintance  a fruitless attempt to regulate the morals of the vulgar  my friend maltreated for his piety  he preaches the doctrine of forbearance in the midst of affliction  i sallied out of the house with a light and merry heart and resolved after i had discharged my lodging to keep my appointment with mr butler whom i had promised to meet at the ordinary at dinner  i was humming over to myself a favorite tune of old carolan the irish bard when i observed a crowd of people on the opposite side of the way and being willing to know the cause that had brought so motley a collection of beings together i crossed the way and found one half of the audience listening with great attention to the exhortations of a man who stood with his back toward me and the other half indulging themselves in excessive laughter seemingly at the expense of the apostle who addressed them for i soon learned from the tendency of his discourse that it turned entirely upon religious topics but how was i struck with astonishment when the preacher turned round and i discovered him to be the very identical man who had given me such excellent admonitions for my future conduct in life but a few days before in st jamess park and who had left me in a great hurry to settle a political dispute that had arisen between him and another person a recollection of the disagreeable effects of his elocution would have prompted me to retire from the scene immediately for fear of a second part of the same tune but i soon found this was impossible for the majors eye had no sooner come into the line of direction with mine than he burst through the crowd and shook me heartily with one hand while he secured a young chimneysweeper from escaping with the other and after asking me a thousand questions in the same breath threefourths of which i could not understand from the impediments of his speech he concluded his list of enquiries by desiring to know how i liked his book upon selfknowledge and if i had read it over and over and heaven forgive me for uttering such a confounded lie i told the good man without hesitation that i had perused it with great attention and had no doubt but i should live the better and become the happier for being acquainted with its contents this assurance put the good soldier in a rapture and turning to me he pulled the young chimneycleanser forward and presenting him to my view  here says he this boy you now see i met this morning quarrelling with his companions he was then extremely wicked and swearing the most shocking and profane oaths and i thought it my duty as a christian to reclaim them if possible and bring the stray sheep back to the shepherds fold two of the three abused me for my endeavors and even were so hardened as to throw stones at me but i pitied the poor wretches for their behavior arose from the impulse of the devil and not from themselves when it pleases heaven that they should be reclaimed they will but i fear their time is not come as for this poor boy whom they had beaten severely i took him into a house in the neighborhood and had him washed and cleaned and he has promised me to be a good child for the future and never to swear have not you my boy cries the major addressing himself to the young sweep yes sir answers the other aye continues this worthy character and because i found him of a good disposition and not stubborn i have given him sixpence to encourage him and some books to teach him his duty which i dare say he will attend to  will not you my lad says the major yes sir says the boy come read me that prayer aloud at the beginning of the book cries the major i cannot read your honor says the boy that is a shame to your parents replies the major  but continues he if you cannot read you can say your prayers and be sure you do that every night and morning i will your honor says the boy if my master will give me leave that is a good child replies the major your master must give you leave or he will never prosper either in this world or the next come repeat this prayer after me added the major here the good man made the boy rehearse a long invocation to the deity which the sooty understrapper seemed to do with wonderful unwillingness while the crowd who was listening to this singular dialogue were employed in ridiculing the pious labors of my friend some by groans and others by thrusting the tongue in one cheek and looking very gravely with the other but the whole group was soon dispersed by the arrival of the boys master who had been informed of his delay by another of his apprentices and heated with anger he tore the young proselyte away from the embraces of the wellmeaning reformer of manners whom he honored with the most opprobrious epithets for detaining his lawful apprentice from his duty and after beating the lad in a most unmerciful manner he began to pelt my friend with the filth of the street without ceremony in which agreeable pastime he was joined by the greater part of the mob and in spite of all my endeavors to the contrary by an unlucky maneuver of the enemy they fairly drove us from the field for just as the major regardless of their shouts was exercising his lungs in a most vociferous and thundering tone to bring them to a sense of their misconduct and to put them in the path of righteousness he received an untimely as well as unsavory salute from the foe of a large handful of mud which striking him with great force exactly in the mouth which he had opened with great energy as wide as a small oven put a final period to my friends elocution by entirely stopping up that necessary aperture and thereby rendering the organs of speech totally useless in this discomfited state we retired into a house but not before i had stripped to my skin to offer any of them battle and probably i should have come off even worse than my military friend if the major had not insisted that i should not use the arm of flesh to correct the evil machinations of the spirit but act like a true adherent to the christian faith in its primitive purity and when i received a blow on one cheek calmly to present my enemy with the other though i admitted the major to be my superior in knowledge it was with a great degree of difficulty that i could bring myself to follow his pacific notions under the pressure of such unparallelled insolence  however when we had cleaned ourselves from the dirt that disfigured us in consequence of the unsavory and illtimed application of the mob the major and i took our leave of each other but not before he had expressed the utmost wishes to be of service to my affairs and extorted a promise that i would punctually breakfast with him on the following morning  chapter xliii meet by accident with count dapper  i resolve to be revenged for his impositions  the method he took to disarm my anger  an object of misery  the counts idea of promiscuous charity  an noble instance of his humanity  when i had left my apostolic preceptor i was ruminating upon some scheme to fill up my time till the hour of dinner and wandering by a booksellers shop i stopped to peruse some loose pamphlets that lay scattered on the window when i observed a smart welldressed man ogling through his glass at some ladies that were crossing the way it was not long before i recollected the very identical features of the facetious count who had played so many pranks with my vanity at the expense of my purse i stood for some time surveying him with great accuracy that i might be certain of committing no mistake in the business for he was so metamorphosed by his dress that i should not readily have known him again but for a peculiar smartness of air and cock of the hat that characterised all his movements the moment that i was convinced he was my man i walked up to him with a stern and determined manner to claim not only the money he had so ingeniously borrowed of me but likewise satisfaction for the injuries and shame i had experienced by his artful maneuvers  when i had approached him i gave him a hearty slap on the shoulder which seemed to set his whole nervous system in commotion an effect that did not so much proceed from the violence of the blow as the particular place to which it was applied he turned immediately round as i imagined to thank the person who had bestowed so great a mark of their esteem upon him and perceiving me he exclaimed with a smile aye aye my dear fellow is it you  damme it is well it is no worse i thought it was some diabolical understrapper deputed from the enchanted castles about shirelane to drag me into limbo at the desire of some vile unhallowed rascal of a tailor who not having the fear of decency before his eyes had issued a writ by the l  d to abridge my privileges of action but damme i have met with an agreeable surprise give me your hand my gay fellow continues the count you shall dine with me today up to your ears in clover i know an excellent house  beefsteaks and porter fit for a prince  besides there is the widow lamb a monstrous goodnatured gentlewoman who keeps a house of entertainment for hungry gentlemen in oxfordroad i will introduce you to her acquaintance damme any thing to serve a friend the captain is onboard the sloop cries the count slapping his thigh and by the immortal powers it shall be your own fault if you want for any thing  i tell you what mr count replied i with a serious air i must inform you that you have mistaken your man most egregiously it is true i have formerly suffered myself to be made a complete ass but that is now over and what is more sir i insist upon immediate reparation i would have proceeded farther had he not stopped my harangue by indulging an excessive fit of laughter at the conclusion of which he cried out in disjointed sentences  oh damme this is fine  good  very good by ch  t excuse my laughing my dear friend continued the beau but i cannot avoid it i cannot upon my soul this is too much but damn it you cannot be serious yes sir but i am replied i and strutted up to him with my arms akimbo no no i know better rejoins the count you are not serious and what is more you do not intend to be serious  yes but i do sir replied i  oh no you dont added he why zounds man if you were serious i would not keep you company i have a mortal aversion to serious men and you must laugh now come i know you will if it is only to oblige me whether it arose from my admiration of his impudence or that the pleasantness of his features for he had habitually a smile attuned my heart to forgiveness and philanthropy i cannot tell but he certainly hit upon the only possible mode there was of disarming my resentment and before i had time to rally the demons of revenge to my assistance he took me under the arm and forcing me along the street cocked his glass and saluted every welldressed man or woman we met not one of whom however thought proper to return the compliment and amused himself in this manner without paying the most distant attention to me or my remonstrances  we had not walked very far before he gave me an instance of his possessing a goodness of heart that would have done honor to a bishop a poor woman sat upon the cold stones at the corner of an alley with two children in her lap soliciting charity from accidental passengers misery and hunger were strongly depicted in her face the complexion of her poor infants was sicklied over with the pale hand of famine and the tattered vestments that barely served to cover one half of her body and answer the rigid purposes of delicacy were ragged filthy and unwholesome in this woebegone state did the silent mourner sit for her tongue seemed to have lost the faculty of telling the sorrow that was so eloquently delivered from her eyes and with an extended arm to receive the benevolent offerings of the good and worthy she reclined as one pining in thought with green and yellow melancholy and looked like patience on a monument smiling at grief   when this wretched spectacle first caught the counts attention he pulled me by the arm and pointing to the miserable group broke forth in the following apostrophe there said he behold an instance of the boasted humanity of this nation you see that unfortunate being laden with almost as many afflictions as the vengeance of heaven can inflict upon a human creature as a punishment for the most complicated vices and yet her situation lamentable as it is cannot touch the heart of one person in one hundred that passes by sufficiently to administer any thing to her relief  the rich plebeian spurns at her necessities because he can silence the appeals of pity in his bosom by being forced to contribute to the support of a parishworkhouse the haughty and swollen ecclesiastic thinks it sufficient that he is paid for teaching others the beauties and advantages of charity without being at the unnecessary trouble of practicing it himself and the prude valuing herself upon the preservation of that chastity which never was besieged instead of giving a piece of money for the relief of a sickly female tosses her head and wonders such harlots should be encouraged by the illtimed bounty of inconsiderate people to live in idleness and get bastards in this strain continues the count do they comment upon the variegated miseries of such objects as these when none of their remarks it is highly probable are founded either in charity or truth  that poor woman added he is the widow of a man of honor and understanding whom i knew well he came over from ireland a few years since in the hope of mending his fortune but poor gentleman he experienced a sad reverse and falling into misfortunes in a strange country it speedily broke his heart and he left that disconsolate woman pregnant with these children who are twins after the decease of her husband she contrived to eke out a subsistence by the donations of her late husbands friends  but that precarious channel having long since been dried up she is now obliged to beg her bread in the manner you behold for the circumstance of her having drawn her first breath in our sisterkingdom entirely deprives her of receiving any benefit from a workhouse and throws her upon the humanity of the public whose general sentiments in regard to such children of calamity as she is i have painted to your imagination with i am afraid too accurate a pencil  here the count pulled out his purse and took a crownpiece from among a parcel of money and walking up to the object of his discourse put it into her hand which he squeezed with some fervor and calling upon god to bless her left her rather precipitately to wonder at the benevolence of a dissipated man whose heart not being steeled by the rigorous laws of prudence or influenced by her narrow saving selfish doctrines was tremblingly alive to the necessities of human nature  this noble behavior of the count not only obliterated the remembrance of our former transactions but raised him to such a pitch in my esteem that i verily believe i would have encountered any hardship to have served a man of so exalted a way of thinking  from this scene we repaired to the ordinary where i met my friend butler to whom i communicated my success at the registeroffice after passing an afternoon in innocent merriment i took my leave of these pleasant but unthinking companions and found on my attempt to pay my share of the reckoning that the whole had been discharged by the count who took this opportunity to repay me what he had borrowed and offered me the loan of a guinea which i refused with many thanks for his good opinion of my principles  when i had disengaged myself from my friends and asked pardon of the count for my unwarrantable behavior i made the best of my way to my lodging where i advertised my landlady of my departure the next day and after putting every thing in readiness to enter upon my new post i retired to bed and enjoyed the most balmy and comfortable nights rest i had ever done since my arrival in great britain  chapter xliv i go to breakfast with major credulous  am surprised at meeting with an acquaintance  my admiration of the majors virtues  i repair to my new place  am struck with the beauty of my masters niece  agreeable to my appointment with the major i got up early and dressed myself with as much neatness as possible to answer two purposes in the first place to breakfast with my military friend and in the second to appear as decent as i could upon my entrance to my new situation  when i arrived at the majors lodgings in the neighborhood of st jamess i was shown up stairs by a decent orderlylooking woman and found on my entrance into the apartment that several persons were attending there for the purpose of seeing the major among the rest was a lady whom i shrewdly suspected to be a fille de joye a strange repulsivelooking man in a rusty black coat with a bushy wig and a remarkable cast in his left eye the sight of which was almost buried in his nose and a decrepid old woman who was almost bent double with the weight of age while we sat there waiting for the major several others came in and among the rest i was astonished to recognize the face of captain blisset the gentleman whom i formerly mentioned as having met in westminsterabbey his surprise at meeting me was to the full as great as mine after congratulating me upon my happiness in being known to the major he informed me that he was the very gentleman to whose kindness both himself and his family had been so much indebted and toward whom he had exercised such a diabolical spirit of rancour while on the same service in america  a farther discussion of the subject was now prevented by the majors entering the chamber the moment he saw me he ran up and embraced me and i was presented to the company as a young man to whom he considered himself greatly indebted then he related the history of our affair with the chimneysweeper and its disagreeable issue  while the major was pronouncing this eulogium in my favor the people in the room eyed me with great attention and respect but particularly the captain who seemed extremely delighted that i should have taken so active a part in defense of so worthy a character  the breakfast apparatus being all placed in order we were summoned by our good host to the table who made us follow him in his trulylaudable custom of kneeling down and repeating some prayers preparatory to our repast in the performance of which he showed as much zeal for the honor of his savior and respect for the canons of heaven as ever a rubyfaced pastor in the three kingdoms but the most beautiful feature in the majors portrait and in which he differed very materially from the reverend gentlemen in question was  that he constantly illustrated and enforced his precepts by his example when that part of the morning duty was finished he performed the honors of his table with the politeness of a gentleman and the hospitality of an irishman for i understood from his own declaration that he was a native of that kingdom most assiduously endeavoring to render our situation as completely happy as possible and his demeanor so far from being soured by his religious attachments was at once open frank cheerful and benevolent  when the breakfast was over he gave audience to his visitors in an inner room to which they all retired one by one as the major signified his wishes when they were all gone the good man came into the room where i had remained and apologized to me for his absence by making me acquainted with the leading features of their several characters and the general intent of his conversation with them all by which i found that my conjectures relative to the young lady were true that the old woman had formerly kept a house of ill fame in the neighborhood of covent garden but had been converted from a continuance of her meretricious practices by the majors exhortations who found her in bridewell beating hemp for the good of society that the man with an oblique vision was formerly one of the greatest reprobates about town but being sent to the countyjail for debt was enlarged by his creditors at the intercession of the major who took upon himself a part of his pecuniary obligations on a solemn promise from the prisoner that he would follow his counsels and purify his conduct in future the major was now proceeding to a panegyric on the captain but i interrupted his narrative by informing him of our conversation in the abbey my friend frankly declaring that his time was not his own he having long since resigned it to the service of the public i took that as a hint for my departure and wished him a good morning but not before he had embraced me in a most affectionate manner and promised to remember me particularly in his prayers which he should daily offer to the throne of mercy for my felicity and if prayers from so incorruptible a heart as his could not be effectual i tremble for the authority of a prelate  i now hurried to my new place and found every thing prepared for my reception in the family i was soon given to understand by my fellow servants in the kitchen that our family had been increased since my departure by miss jesse my masters niece who had returned home from her annual visit and by the favorable account i heard from peggy for that was the name of the goodhumoured wench in question i was enamoured with the young ladys character before i saw her person but it was not long before i had an opportunity of being an eyewitness to those irresistible charms which had attracted my notice so much in the description when the bell rang from above i was ordered by the housekeeper to lay the cloth for dinner a service i performed with such dexterity as procured me the approbation of mrs honor  i was in the act of placing the last knife and fork when the young lady entered the room and at the first glance i caught of her person i was so transported with an undescribable emotion that i stood for some minutes motionless and incapable of fulfilling my duty i believe she perceived my confusion and partly guessed at the cause for she observed by way of encouraging me when her uncle came in to dinner that i was a modestlooking young man and seemed very attentive to my situation but the pleasing effects of her gentle spirit were strongly counteracted by her uncle who replied with a contracted brow aye aye niece new brooms sweep clean when i know him better i will tell you more of my mind this retort of my masters threw me into confusion which the young lady perceiving she gave me a smile unperceived by her saturnine relation which seemed to insinuate that old people have their humors which ought to be indulged on account of their age but not regarded on the score of their folly  chapter xlv become deeply in love with my masters niece  write a poem on my hopeless situation  the singular event that followed it  am ordered to attend my charmer at vauxhallgardens  the personal graces of miss jesse added to the amiable complexion of her mind had made such an indelible impression on my heart that i became unhappy out of her sight indeed the idea of her charms was continually stepping between me and my peace and i was ridiculous enough to sigh for the possession of that which fortune had placed infinitely beyond my reach in this melancholy state i wandered about the house sometimes like a being lost to himself meditating upon a subject that was hourly preying on my spirits without the most distant hope to bear me up against so much inquietude but so little are our inclinations within the government of our own power that i am perfectly convinced we are frequently doomed to be involuntarily miserable  i had not been a fortnight in my new place before i had every reason to believe i had made a conquest of my fellow servants peggy whose attentions to me in every thing accompanied by certain lovefraught smiles left me no room to doubt about the the nature of her desires but i was too much absorbed in reflecting upon the charms of the mistress to pay the least regard to the wiles and witcheries of the maid and my passion for that divine creature became at last so troublesome that my nights were sleepless and my days were wretched she existed in my imagination when i was awake and haunted my dreams when i wished for rest i had resolved a hundred times in the moments of madness to throw myself at her feet disclose my passion and then quit her sight for ever but the terrors which hung about the last part of the resolution constantly defeated the advantages of the first and in this state of uncertainty and disquiet i passed my melancholy hours until my very existence became intolerable  one evening having retired to my room to indulge in secret the sorrows of my heart i took up a pen and diverted myself with writing the following verses the lovers complaint my plaints to my jesse unknown unblessed must i wander and sigh while echo rehearses each moan and sorrow distills from each eye the nymph i lament to have seen is gentle complacent and kind the graces have fashioned her mein and wisdom illumines her mind for her i have roses entwined but dare not the chaplet reveal for though her soft spirit is kind her dignity freezes my zeal by the aid of my lyre no more shall accents of melody flow its tones must my passion deplore and breathe but the measure of woe unheeded approaches the spring to open the blossoms of may in vain does sweet philomel sing or the flowerdeckd valley look gay but cease thy emotions fond heart no longer or flutter or beat for why should you pine with a smart the tongue is denied to repeat the passions that wound my repose will hasten the period of strife for love like the phoenix has rose and fed on the ashes of life then since i must never impart those feelings i am doomed to deplore the pulses that govern my heart shall throb with its transports no more my pipe i have thrown on the ground that was wont to beguile the sad hours ah me all the magic of sound is broke by superior powers how cruel is fate with such woes my ardour of youth to suppress say why does she smile upon those whom prudence forbids her to bless then go lovely nymph to the plain and enslave all the shepherds you see you may find a more affluent swain but none that will love you like me while i stray the willows among unconscious of peace or of rest for hope that gave strength to my song has deserted thy corydons breast   when i had finished this impassioned epistle which i left carelessly on the table i pursued the avocations of my duty with more alertness and it should seem that by disburdening my brain of this poetical child it had operated to reduce the poignancy of my grief as the tears of a woman are said to relieve the heart when laden with the keenest sorrows  but how was my joy rekindled when returning to my room i found that my amorous sonnet had been perused by some fair incognita who had even added fuel to my attachment by annexing the following lines though hope like coquettes often plays with the heart to prove her seduction and skill we all find it best to subscribe to her art and obey the caprice of her will then cease lovesick youth to abandon her wiles or yield up your mind to despair attend her suggestions and cherish her smiles for she soon may extinguish your care the state of perturbation that this discovery threw me into is easier to be conceived than described various were my conjectures relative to the person who had left this testimony of her concern and my arrogance at times would hurry me so far as to ascribe it to the fair object of my desires but my presumption had scarcely brought such an idea to my imagination before my reflection reassumed her power corrected my vanity and destroyed it the impossibility of such a circumstance taking place left me bewildered in doubts and uncertainties however i was relieved from all farther conjectures as to the author of the verses on the following evening  some young ladies and gentlemen having formed a party for vauxhallgardens in which they had engaged my incomparable and charming jesse to accompany them i was ordered by my master to attend at the door of the gardens at a particular hour to wait upon her home as this was a service i would have preferred to the honor of attending even royalty itself and in which i cheerfully could have spent my existence i needed no monitor to spur me to my duty but was ready at least two hours before the time appointed waiting at the grand avenue to the gardens with the utmost anxiety for a sight of her whose presence would have cheared me even in the bosom of a wilderness at length she approached all charming as she was and dressed with such an elegant neatness that she appeared like another venus attired with elegance at the toilet of the graces it being determined by her party to return to town by water as it was a remarkably fine night i was dispatched to procure a boat in readiness against their arrival at the stairs and i executed the commission so much to their entire satisfaction that i had the superlative pleasure of hearing the company commend my assiduity and address to their fair companion  when they had all taken their seats under a temporary awning to shield them from the unwholesome dews of the night i entered the boat and sat behind the watermen their company consisted of my mistress and two other ladies an officer in the guards and a young attorney from the temple in this manner we proceeded down the thames the party taking it by turns to beguile the time with songs and relate tales of mirth for the mutual entertainment of each other but we had not passed beyond the arches of westminster bridge above a hundred yards before an accident took place that proved fatal to one of the party and had nearly involved us all in one general destruction  chapter xlvi an accident happens that threatens us with imminent danger  a bait for the devil  my mistress makes a declaration of love in my favor  my master dies  i marry the object of my desires  the infallible secret to insure conjugal felicity  the moon which had shone with such unusual brightness on our first setting out was almost totally eclipsed by a cloud ere we had performed one half of our voyage and rendered the objects on the thames so indistinct that our watermen not looking about them with that caution their duty required ran against a coalbarge which was moored at a small distance from surrystairs the violence of the shock added to the sudden bustle of the ladies who all started up instantaneously on the first notice of danger overturned the boat notwithstanding all the efforts of the gentlemen to the contrary being a good swimmer i immediately caught hold of my angelic mistress by the arm but not before her whole body had been immerged in the water and bore her in that situation senseless to the shore by the assistance of the watermen the two ladies her companions were saved and the officer swam to a parcel of timber that floated conveniently in the neighborhood of the place where the disaster happened by this time the shrieks of the ladies had drawn several people to the waterside who exercised every office of humanity in their power as for the illfated limb of the law though he was heard to call for assistance in such piteous accents as would have melted a heart of stone no one could be prevailed upon to go to his relief until a young man who was present stripped himself in a trice to swim to the aid of the unfortunate beau  and was just preparing to plunge into the stream when one of the company happened to mention the name of his profession which operated like a charm on the disposition of the humane youth who no sooner understood that he was an attorney than he very deliberately put on his clothes protesting that as he was a lawyer he might drown and be damned for him that for his part he would not run the chance of incurring the displeasure of the devil by so untimely robbing him of his dues  when the fair jesse had recovered the use of her senses she eagerly enquired for her deliverer and finding that she was indebted for her life to my zeal and activity she clasped her dear arms about my neck and prayed that she might have the ability to express her gratitude i was so overpowered by her condescension that i remained speechless kneeling at her feet till my passion getting the better of my reason i seized her hand and smothered it with kisses by the gentle manner in which she rebuked me for this freedom i first discovered that i was not indifferent to her heart which probably i should have remained ignorant of as long as i lived if the decrees of fate had not turned this seeming evil to my good  when we returned home she made me a present of a locket which she entreated me to keep for ever as a token of her gratitude and esteem a present to me of the most inestimable value for it contained a ringlet of her lovely auburn hair woven in the shape of a truelovers knot on receiving this mark of her favor i threw myself at her feet and imploring her pardon for my presumption made a full declaration of my passion after this confession i would have retired from her sight and left the house for ever but perceiving my intention she called me back and told me while her beauteous cheek glowed with a suffusion of blushes that my partiality in her favor had not been a mystery to her for some time that she could trace it in all my actions and read it in all my looks but added the divine jesse i strove to avoid such observations as much as possible for in spite of the distance that fortune has thrown between us i felt an advocate that pleaded in behalf of your merits in this breast so powerfully that i was obliged to yield to its solicitations and must inform you however painful to my delicacy that my happiness cannot be more essential to your peace than yours is to mine here the accomplished lady turned aside her head to hide her confusion while i poured forth my acknowledgements at her feet in terms of the most rapturous gratitude in short we made a full confession of our regards for each other and resolved to embrace the first opportunity that fortune should offer and prudence should countenance to make our bliss complete and it was not long before that happened for her uncle being suddenly seized with the gout in his stomach it carried him off with the assistance of three physicians in a few hours and we had the pleasure to find that he had left the greater part of his fortune at the sole disposal of his niece  when the customary time had elapsed that is prescribed for people apparently to mourn for the loss of those whose deaths they had hourly prayed for my jesse and i were led to the sacred altar of hymen and there performing all due rites and ceremonies the beauteous maid was given up to my possession and i may venture to add that if every wedded pair experienced as much felicity as we have done since the mysterious and indissoluble knot made us one the honorable state of matrimony would no longer furnish food for the pen of satire or laughter for the faculties of folly by the ridiculous feuds it too frequently engenders and gentle reader to give you a convincing proof that i have a proper regard for the wellbeing of my fellow creatures i will publicly make known the inestimable secret by the observance of which we are so much happier than our neighbors it is briefly this  looking with an eye of kindness upon
