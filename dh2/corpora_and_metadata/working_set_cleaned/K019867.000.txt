envenomed hate but minds like his a base degenerate race might meanly persecute  but not disgrace the noble soul its energy maintains in spite of dungeons tyranny and chains the sons of europe found a guileless race no fraud was veiled beneath the smiling face their manners mild benevolent and kind pourtrayed the cloudless sunshine of the mind blessed in their princes patriarchal reign whose power relieved but never inflicted pain their placid lives no fancied evils knew their joys were many and their wants were few one custom with their virtues ill agreed which made humanity with anguish bleed compelled at superstitions shrine to bow the hapless victims of a cruel vow their sweetest maids were often doomed to prove no joy in friendship nor no bliss in love yet love and nature cannot be suppressed the sigh will heave and palpitate the breast for spite of vows which heavens wise laws disown love sits triumphant on the heart  his throne and breaks those fetters bigots would impose to aggravate the sense of human woes the rigid laws of time and place our bard in this nights drama ventures to discard if here he errs  he errs with him whose name stands without rival on the rolls of fame him whom the passions own with one accord their great dictator and despotic lord who placed aloft on inspirations throne made fancys magic kingdom all his own burst from the trammels which his

of the law which binds a priestess to her duty  should the heart to heaven devoted become the prey of sacrilegious love our law consigns its priestess and the accomplice of her guilt to instant death

associates join with me in praise of him who has achieved what ignorance with sapient shrug and satisfied benumbing prudence derided as the chimera of a madmans fancy falling at his feet let us be proud in being first to pay due homage to such surpassing excellence  they all kneel columbus rise rise  rather my alonzo in these arms receive my thanks thou next to heaven my firmest friend ye men of spain let what has passed admonish you in what may be to come  keep in your minds the time when we had gained the course which shut out the eastern world how you beat your breasts oppressed with fear and superstition  how with womanish tears you bade adieu to life and blubbered out a requiem for your souls then embracing desperation instead of fortitude i was to be your sacrifice and this body which has been your conduct to wealth and honor you would have given to the sea and ignorance and cowardice would have triumphed   valverdo mighty sir forgive us   columbus freely good valverdo  let the man stand forth who at a time so fraught with peril first discovered land   herbert coming forward it was my good fortune   columbus thou art not a spaniard   herbert no your excellency i am an englishman and though we englishmen are an odd whimsical set of fellows yet we generally contrive and i trust ever shall to keep a good look out ahead when our superior is in danger   columbus tell me your fortunes   herbert my name is harry herbert i am descended from as respectable and independent an ancestor as the world can boast  an english yeoman but the civil wars leaving my family little which my imprudence soon made less i thought that although king henry was deprived of the honor of this enterprise that did not preclude his subjects so i shipped myself off for castille where i had just time and cash enough to fall a dozen times in love and into other serapes before i had the honor of embarking on board your excellencys squadron   columbus herbert thou do honor to thy country   herbert then sir i am glad that for once i am even with it for i am sure my country does honor to me  indian music without roldan behold a crowd of people many of whom seem clad in sacred vestments

if human here are fruits to feed you dwellings to shelter you and garments to clothe you   columbus chief you behold in us the children of mortality but the power we serve in his high mercy has bestowed upon us superior gifts thus through unknown seas to brave the imperious surge and to construct engines which can sweep thousands from the earth  but that deity commands us to proclaim his name with peace  the king our master wishes to enrich thee and himself  this hardy metal useful in all the purposes of life he will exchange for those thy country may produce  presents a hatchet

stranger   orozimbo with columbus roldan herbert nelti catalpo etc move up the stage alonzo often has a tender glance escaped my eye impelled by beautys power and from my bosom the soft sigh instinctively has stolen  many a fair castilian has enforced this test of admiration but now my every sense seems drawn by power magnetic to that lovely saint  permit me fairest creature to express my admiration at the charms which now present themselves  though all the wonders of a new discovered world display their rival novelties yet now that i behold its first of wonders all else exacts from me as little notice as i i fear have power or merit to command from you   cora strange you wrong yourself and hold me unskilful to distinguish when you suppose desert like yours can pass unnoticed  your praises of the humble cora though they have caused no vain emotion yet ever will the mind receive with pleasure praise even unmerited when it is bestowed by those who claim our admiration   alonzo all that the warmest fancy can depict in the bright colors of ideal excellence can never reach that exquisite perfection nature exhibits  how must i bless my happy fortune that bore me to a clime which boasts an ornament like thee   cora aside what new emotion rises in my breast  i fear to ask my heart from whence it springs oh cora think of thy sacred duty  think of the vow which passed thy lips so lately  stranger though sacred hospitality commanded me to pay this courtesy yet now a higher duty enjoins me to desist from further converse   alonzo let me entreat one instant    cora it must not be  my conduct is controlled by rigid laws farewell  oh cora what days of wretchedness art thou doomed to suffer   aside as she retires to the priests alonzo alonzo what could she mean her conduct is controlled by rigid laws  if she be destined to another my lot is misery   orozimbo with columbus coming forward in harmony and peace i rule a free and happy people and i were unworthy of my kingdom

what you see something angelic about me eh  yes my love i come from a little paradise called england   nelti is england a world   herbert a bit of one but little as it is it somehow contrives to manage all the rest  should you like to live in england   nelti o yes i suppose english women armed with spears made of that pretty hard iron climb the mountains and destroy the wild bull   herbert destroy the wild bull no my dear our english women find prettier amusement in encouraging the breed of horned cattle  the use of the pretty hard iron is confined to the men and no great favorite there for i know many flourishers of spontoons who have a cursed antipathy to cold iron  who is that elegant creature you were conversing with   nelti her name is cora she was this day admitted a priestess of the sun  the handsomest virgins are always selected to sustain that sacred office   herbert the handsomest you were then on that account not    nelti did i say the handsomest oh dear i mean they select the most sedate  for from this day she must never leave the temple or converse with any except the priests   herbert except the priests go where you will you find those gentlemen always contrive to be well taken care of  would you like to become a priestess   nelti sighing last night perhaps i should   herbert charming sensibility and may i my sweet girl interpret that sigh in my favor   nelti ah you will not love me   herbert not love thee  by magna charta i will resign my life fortune and liberty to thee  besides i will bring thee beads clothes music    nelti ah that is not love  they only try to please the eye who find their actions cannot touch the heart  no presents or toys could influence nelti  no not if you were to give her an iron javelin and a tame tiger   herbert indeed  very delicate presents for a young lady   nelti aside i wish i could make him love me  how do women in england gain their lovers hearts   herbert generally by using them like dogs  for when a woman studiously avoids looking at a man abuses him on all occasions and is kind to every one else we naturally conclude they love each other to distraction   nelti aside i never can find in my heart to use him ill  what ugly thing is that   enter dolores and bribon from a boat herbert a doctor of physic who having killed all his patients in the old world except his wife who would never take his medicines has ventured hither in pursuit of new patients new fees and perhaps a new bedfellow   nelti and what is the other   herbert a lawyer and a coxcomb   nelti what is a coxcomb   herbert a reptile my dear that is found in abundance in all countries and yet is not easily described  it is a kind of mongrel which men drive from them because they hardly consider it as belonging to them and the women will not receive because they think it will not breed   dolores all seems pretty quiet  i say bribon    bribon what do you say doctor dolores   dolores this seems cursed mild wholesome unprofitable air for a physician  but heaven is merciful wherever i go patients increase   bribon there seems plenty of gold and plenty of gold plenty of law follows as naturally as a bill of costs  i say doctor do you see that sweet pretty wealthylooking girl    dolores i fancy i shall have some pretty female practice here  i was a great favorite in spain for my maxim was always to stick to my friends to the last   herbert doctor welcome to the new world  so you kept on board till all was quiet   dolores to be sure  consider the importance of my life to you all but my chief reason was that the famous astrologer doctor diego diablasco told me something ill would happen if i were rash  but there seems no danger  that is a very pretty girl and i love a fine young girl almost as much as i do fine old gold   herbert and have you doctor so soon forgot your old helpmate in valladolid   dolores ah poor old dorothy but lord i hate constancy as much as i hate health addressing nelti permit me sweetest of savages to enquire after the state of your health  how is your pulse let me feel how it beats  beats   takes her hand nelti feel how it beats perhaps it beats harder than you think   dolores then there is the more necessity i should feel it my pretty pretty    nelti there then   strikes him dolores zounds a dozen such patients would do for me   herbert doctor i hope to be honored with the hand of this charming girl   dolores oh with all my heart  i am sure i have had enough of it  but you cannot marry her   herbert why thou professor of the glorious art of manslaughter   dolores because the pope allows no religious ceremonies with heretics  all dealings with them must be in the way of plunder and glorious intrigue   herbert the pope pshaw  i shall sit down here for life contented with a little  i will build a neat convenient house after the fashion of the country with a plain silver door and a diamond knocker the apartments shall be merely lined with plates of gold neatly carved  the sophas of silver tissue and stuffed with the down of hummingbirds  as for frescowork of emeralds rubies pearls amethysts and such nicknacks my wife may ornament her dairy and dressing room with them  in short i will have every thing in a snug comfortable way without show or expense   dolores without show or expense  pray great sir  will you allow a poor man to gather up the chips and now and then take a peep into your golden apartments   herbert why dolores by the time i build i fancy you will have a snug leaden apartment of your own  so go count beads instead of ducats and try not to cheat young harry out of his mistress but old harry out of your soul   exeunt herbert and nelti bribon zounds let us follow for who knows but in a minute these savages may knock

a paper  my brother in ambition look on this paper   valverdo what is this  the royal signature   roldan mark me  when our gracious queen embraced the fortunes of this foreign viceroy even proffered her regal ornaments to equip his fleet the minister fonesca jealous of the fame that might attend this enterprise worked on the fears of the suspicious ferdinand to execute this commission of control which now columbus conduct gives pretense arrays me with the power of crushing his authority and with disgrace returning him to spain   valverdo glorious hearing   roldan do thou valverdo tamper with the troops  press on their superstitious minds the injury our faith will suffer by winking at idolatry tell them the way to sudden wealth is easy had they a fit commander  insinuate  but we waste

has appeased their just resentment and at the request of orozimbo consents to liberate the prisoners   roldan it is well shews a plan of attack but as we must secure a place of safety for it were madness to repose confidence in savages here have i drawn a plan which must render the town an easy capture   alonzo the town a capture   roldan do thou not understand me   alonzo i hope i do not   roldan there is no safety but in their destruction   alonzo roldan thou surely can not be so damned as think it  what stab the fond heart which overflows with love and adoration for thee  trample down sacred hospitality and erect the throne of treachery and murder  by the great god of justice first through this body thou must force thy way thou traitor to humanity   roldan softhearted fool these mawkish virtues have ever been the sainted garb of cowards   alonzo coward  they fight enter cuto with indians who rush in betweenem cuto thanks to the god this arm received the stroke that would have

name of heaven stain not thy honor and thy manhood with treachery and ingratitude   roldan fortune permits thee now to school me  but boy thou shall feel my power go to the viceroy tell him that roldan lacks brotherly affection for the poor indians and add for by the power of vengeance it is true that roldan is his covenanted foe  that he has given freedom to those castilians he dared disgrace with bonds and that by thee he greets his excellency with defiance and contempt   exit roldan alonzo perfidious bloody villain oh my friends dangers i fear await you  i blush to say we have among us those whose vileness your pure nature cannot image let us prepare to meet the worst  summon your warriors while i instruct them how best to guard each place of vantage  and should this roldan attempt to execute his villainous intent depend on the protection of columbus   exit alonzo with indians scene ii a retired place enter columbus columbus all happiness is mingled with alloy  i have triumphed over every opposition malice and folly raised to check my glory  i now in europes eye shall stand arrayed in all the honors which success commands  those who if accident had thwarted my reasonfounded schemes would with important ignorance have scoffed at the silly vague projector  will now with panegyric full as thoughtless admire my courage and applaud my prescience  yet when i have attained the summit of my wishes when i should give some little rest to my careworn mind which long has struggled with adversity when i might contemplate with joy the virtues i have found in this new world virtues more rare than all the riches it abounds in  i sind i have conducted to this hapless spot hearts black with discontent and factious jealousy thirsting for plunder and for blood but if determined rigor  virtuous example    enter herbert running herbert may it please your excellency  i beg your excuse  but i am so choked with rage and breathless with running that i have scarce power to tell you  your troops have mutinied   columbus mutinied explain   herbert roldan sir that  but i know a soldiers duty too well to speak ill of a superior officer or i would tell your excellency what a cursed inhuman scoundrel i think him  their villainy and ingratitude is beyond belief  they murmur that you will not give them leave to cut the throats of these innocent indians  they call for roldan to head them and i will do him the justice to say he would let them indulge in such pretty harmless diversion as long as there was a throat left in the country   columbus this demands my instant presence  herbert in half an hour attend me at the camp   exit herbert oh if i had that roldan in england i would hang him up without judge or jury  though on recollection i have fixed on the worst place in the world for hanging folks up because a great man like me wills it  but now for vengeance  and yet i dont know how it happens that although in some things i am a tolerably active industrious fellow yet when i have to seek revenge i grow so infernally lazy i can scarce find in my heart to set about it   exit scene iii  the sea coast  a boat stationed enter roldan with troops meeting valverdo roldan may i trust that look propitious  oh let thy words confirm it  how have thou prospered with the soldiers   valverdo they more than met my wishes and the dastard few whom conscience kept in doubt i soon won over by the stimulus of plunder spiced with our churchs dispensation  in a word they have all sworn that on a signal given they will desert columbus   roldan and in an hour to a fairer promiser would they abandon me  it mads me that i must climb the heights of proud ambition on the shoulders of such a crew of mongrels  my design is to send columbus loaded with chains and accusation a prisoner to spain and with him those henhearted fools whose superstitious scruples might prove troublesome   valverdo with deference to your happier policy do you not risk by this the wrath of isabella   roldan not a whit for unless valverdo thou have made some saint thy enemy who in mere spite may work for them a miracle they will not fatigue the royal ear with much complaining  to be plain the vessel which shall convey them hence is so strained crazy and unfit for service she cannot weather out the slightest storm therefore the first rude wind that blows will send them to explore another world  but hark that trumpet speaks columbus  now fortune be my friend   enter columbus moscoso and troops columbus roldan what means this outrage this treason to thy king why spur on to desperation and rebellion your few mistaken followers whom my power did i not abhor revenge could in an instant sweep from the earth   roldan columbus on thee let me retort the name of

thee worthier to command them pass that javelin without fear or doubt  be that the barrier betwixt my influence and thine   roldan much it glads me thou have proffered so fair a trial and i swear if they approve thee i will resign into thy hand my sword and life   columbus now my brave soldiers hear my firm intent i will lead you on to wealth but not by massacre i will make you all the wonders of the world rich and beloved  then without control decide your fate but remember  you have but one step to make from honor to disgrace  valverdo and those on columbuss side pass over to roldan columbus be it so  men without hearts are not worth regretting   herbert who has been standing on roldans side after eyeing with contempt those who deserted columbus passes between the front of the stage and roldan to columbus herbert great sir accept my humble services  despise not him who honors you  pray excuse these tears  let me embrace your knees   falls and embraces his knees columbus my heart my heart  herbert thy gratitude unmans me  embraces him roldan now columbus look on that paper by it thou wilt find thy king distrusted thee giving the paper and pray you all remember i exerted not the high authority of which my sovereign thought me worthy till he was deserted and despised   columbus peace fiery indignation  down rebel heart  and do not choke my utterance  well viceroy giving his staff to roldan where are your racks  your instruments of vengeance   roldan oh do not fear  we mean no torture   columbus and think thou villain the subtilest inquisitor who has outdamnd his fellows

your orders pointing to herbert  for that stubborn rebel  bear him to torture   columbus hold roldan  thy vengeance must be most complete when i descend to ask a favor from thee  let my humility glut thy vindictive wrath  allow that englishman to share my fortunes   roldan bear him away   columbus roldan a wretch like thee should have a cowards caution  do thou not dread that in his dying moments when in defiance of thy tortures for i can read his noble soul he braves thee to the last and glories in a death of honor do thou not fear he may infect this ruffian crew with some faint sparks of honesty and make them less fit instruments for thee   roldan bear him to death   herbert heaven preserve your excellency  will you great sir condescend to indulge the last wish of vanity and when you have nothing else to do write to england the story of my fate that when my fortunes shall be enquired after my friends with joy sparkling through a tear may say herbert stuck to his commander to the last and died as an englishman ought   columbus my noble fellow this hand shall justify thy fame   herbert then i am easy  may your portion of happiness be equal to your virtues  farewell  to roldan

the most infernal scoundrel the devil ever made a friend of all your worthy associates about you will i dare say allow  but i brand you with the name of fool for enabling an humble man like me thus to triumph over you to defy you  scorn you  laugh at you  hands off reptiles   exit herbert guarded columbus to roldan is then my triumph for a worlds discovery and the trophies which i bear to spain to

their weight   columbus you know not what you ask  wish me to forfeit the honors my king has heaped on me  no these are his gracious gifts and i have not yet learnt to disobey him  and here i vow before that power who cheers the soul of suffering virtue though their cankerous rivets corrode my very bones no hand but ferdinands shall free me from them  by heaven my soul pants for the moment

guardian of the innocent to thy supreme protection i commend the generous natives of this hapless land assist them to defend their liberties from the fell grasp of this detested crew  to them extend thy mercy and let me pour my thanks for that celestial fortitude which glows within my breast  with it i can defy the storms of fortune safe in the approval of a guiltless mind which not deserving wrong can never feel disgrace   exeunt columbus and attendants to the boat enter orozimbo alonzo and indian warriors  alonzo rushes to the top of the stage alonzo great chief your succors come too

then to be roasted and the humane priest remarked there was not so excellent a receipt for insuring the love of heaven as taking half a dozen heretics and broiling them gently over a slow fire  acknowledge roldan viceroy says he  i would see you damned first says i  so watching my opportunity i gave the priest a cornish hug showed his scullions a specimen of english wrestling and off i came trussed for dressing as you see me   alonzo well my brave friend thou then wilt aid our cause   herbert do you suppose that i who had my forefathers chopped to atoms in deciding the preference between

been defense and safety to us but why droops the brave alonzo  if any tender scruple of shedding native blood now check thy wonted ardour freely avow the generous weakness  on thee depends our fate  yet would i welcome the loss of empire and of life rather than save them by alonzos misery   alonzo no  with honest zeal i draw my sword against the enemies of innocence though the same clime has bred us  he who regards his countrys real honor owns for his countrymen none but the virtuous  yet orozimbo this heart is bursting with its anguish   orozimbo thy sorrows though i am unconscious of the

who in the prime of youth when every fine affection of the soul glows with its noblest fervor when all the joys of life seem decked with magic splendor does she deserve the punishment of guilt who buried in yon ruthless prison casts a fond thought on the delights she has lost dares to condemn the tyranny which binds her and claims her right to liberty and love   orozimbo i would aspire to reign beyond the limits of weak prejudice but reflect alonzo how sacred are a countrys customs   alonzo there there is the source of half the misery of human kind  custom is the vile confounder of virtue and of vice  it checks the operation of our godlike reason and makes the greatest glory of creation a being void of will  oh orozimbo soar superior to the mists of error  when thy great soul displays unmanacled its glorious attributes  thou wilt cease to think that god delights in cruelty whose blessed infusion in the human heart breathes mercy and benevolence   orozimbo often have i admired thy wisdom and thy virtue but now methinks in thee i hear the voice of heaven and it shall be obeyed  but i must praise thy wondrous goodness which can thus plead for others misery   alonzo there i am unworthy of thy praise  mine is a selfish zeal  i have sued for one whom i adore nay for myself i have sued  oh orozimbo in the repeal of an inhuman law thou have restored my forfeit life  nay more
