the case of the barbers of london the barbers of london were a fraternity before the time of edward the second and by letterspatent of edward the fourth were made a body corporate and invested with several powers and privileges in the   d year of henry the eighth the public policy thought proper to unite them with another company not then incorporated called the surgeons of london in order as is most probable to transfer those powers and privileges to the latter without directly appearing to wrest them from the former to whom they had been originally granted  this coalition of the two companies having now subsisted above two hundred years the barbers are surprised to find an attempt made by the surgeons to dissolve it by authority of parliament without their participation or consent  the principal reasons assigned by the surgeons in their printed case to induce the legislature to this extraordinary act of power are  barbers in the time of henry the eighth were all surgeons and that the parliament by uniting them with others of superior abilities intended their improvement in that profession but that they having long since ceased to intermeddle with any branch of surgery this intent of the act is frustrated and the laudable purpose of the union at an end  alteration of the circumstances of things the junction of the two companies how advantageous soever in former times is now become highly inconvenient  surgeons if distinctly incorporated would be encouraged to meet and communicate to one another their experiments and successes  paris edinburgh and glascow  but the first of these reasons is grounded on a mistake in point of fact for though it be true that the barbers were all originally surgeons and incorporated as such yet long before the union in question most of them had quitted the actual exercise of that profession and the right itself of exercising it in virtue of their charter had been   h   chapter    no person within the city of london nor within seven miles shall occupy as a surgeon except he be first examined approved and admitted by the bishop of london or dean of st pauls taken away by parliament and though in the preamble of the uniting act both companies are styled surgeons yet from the    h   chapter    sect   no person within the city of london suburbs of the same and one mile compass of the said city using any barbery or shaving shall occupy any surgery letting of blood or any other thing belonging to surgery drawing of teeth only except enacting part which expressly restrains the barbers from occupying any part of surgery except toothdrawing it is evident the legislature did not consider them as real surgeons nor could intend their improvement in a science they were forbid to practice so that the circumstances of things are not altered from what they then were or from what they manifestly were designed to be and therefore the barbers having no relation to the surgeons or their art as it was then deemed no objection to their union cannot now with any propriety be insisted on as a reason for their separation  with regard to the inconveniences complained of as the charge is general this general answer only can be given that the barbers have always with the greatest deference submitted to the surgeons in all matters peculiar to them and cheerfully contributed out of their common stock toward every expense which they have declared necessary for the honor or advancement of their profession and since none of these inconveniences have been of consequence enough to deserve being particularly pointed out we may venture to pronounce them inconsiderable and unworthy the attention and redress of parliament and the rather as all of them put together have not prevented the surgeons of london from carrying the improvement of their art both in speculation and practice to a greater height than has been done in any other place or nation  that the frequent meetings of ingenious men and their free communications on the subject of their profession may tend to the benefit of mankind in general and to the honor of their country in particular is not denied but surely the constitution of the united company is no obstacle to these laudable purposes the barbers have for many years at their monthly courts submitted to withdraw at a stated hour and resigned the parlour to the surgeons and if this condescension is not supposed to afford them sufficient time for conversation on these particular days nothing hinders them from holding separate assemblies at the hall almost every other day in the year  as to what is said to have been done at paris edinburgh and glascow no particular answer can be given unless it appeared by what means for what reasons and upon what terms the separations in those places were brought about in london there are but two instances of separations of companies viz that of the feltmakers from the haberdashers in   0  and that of the apothecaries from the grocers in      but both these were effected by mutual consent without the intervention of parliament and it may be proper to observe that the feltmakers miscarried in a former application for an exclusive charter in      for want of the haberdashers consent  upon the whole therefore the barbers humbly hope the forgoing reasons will be deemed insufficient to induce the legislature to destroy an union they themselves thought proper to form an union which two hundred years existence has rendered venerable and which by the improvements abovementioned appears to have answered all the purposes for which it was established  but if for other reasons which the surgeons say may be given the parliament shall be inclined to favor them in this part of their request the barbers from the scrupulous regard and tenderness which that august assembly has always shown for private property cannot but hope they shall be continued in the enjoyment of all their present possessions without any division whatsoever and that for the following reasons  united companys lands and tenements particularly the site of their hall parlour etc originally belonged to them and by the uniting act    h   chapter    the united company shall have possess and enjoy to them and their successors for ever all such lands and tenements and other hereditaments whatsoever which the said company or commonalty of barbers have and enjoy to the use of the said mystery and commonalty of barbers of london seem with great justice to have been intended to remain to their sole and separate use though in fact the surgeons have hitherto been indulged in the equal enjoyment of them with the barbers  surgeons share of what may have been acquired since the union will scarce be an adequate recompense to the barbers for the above indulgence much less for the unmerited loss of a brotherhood now so honorable and advantageous to them  barbers when distinctly incorporated can fall but very little if any thing short of those of the united company so that a reduction of income must subject them to very great difficulties which considering that they neither desire nor have given the surgeons just cause to desire a separation would be extremely hard and unreasonable  flourishing condition of the surgeons the only real alteration in the circumstances of things will sufficiently enable them to support the dignity of their new and favorite institution with becoming splendour without distressing their less happy brethren the barbers  the case of the barbers of london
