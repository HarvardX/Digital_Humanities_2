henrietta book the third chap i in which our heroine meets with a new disappointment and some farther instances of miss woodbys friendship  henrietta being now left to her own reflections beheld her late conduct in a light in which it had never appeared to her before the sense of blame so justly incurred filled her with remorse and shame hitherto she had industriously aggravated the cause of her fears that she might not stand selfcondemned which to an ingenuous mind is of all others the greatest evil but mrs willis had stated her case too justly  what force could give her unwilling hand to the old baronet how could she be cheated into a convent when she was forewarned of the design from her obstinate opposition to her aunts will nothing worse could have happened than the loss of her favor and protection which by her flight she had anticipated she now wondered at the unreasonaness of her fears and looked back with the deepest regret upon the errors they had occasioned  these melancholy thoughts and her anxiety about the reception her aunt would give her kept her waking almost the whole night as soon as it was light she rose and dressed herself impatient to be gone mrs willis at her summons made haste to join her and when they had breakfasted set out immediately upon their journey henrietta full of perturbation and enquietude mrs willis with that ity which attends the consciousness of doing what is right  the young lady as she drew nearer her aunts dwelling found her emotions increase one while her imagination represented lady meadows as kind and indulgent ready to forgive her error and to restore her to her affection and immediately after she would tremble with the apprehension of her severe reproaches  mrs willis perceived her uneaness and used her utmost endeavors to compose  but when the chaise stopped at the door she was near falling into a fainting fit and her friend was obliged to ask if lady meadows was at home for henrietta was not able to speak  the servantmaid who opened the door having got a glympse of the young lady as she sat in the chaise eagerly flew to the side of it  o my dear miss said she in a transport of joy is it you  how do you do jenny said miss courteney and trembling added is my aunt at home  my lady said the girl set out two days ago for her seat in devonshire oh miss here has been sad doings poor mrs white is turned away there came an ugly mischiefmaking lady from london and told my lady a heap of stories about you and so mrs white was turned away but will not you please to alight miss  henrietta looked at mrs willis for she knew not herself what to resolve on the news she had heard having thrown her into the utmost perplexity  i wish we could see mrs white said mrs willis to her in a whisper  miss courteney immediately enquired of the maid how long mrs white had left her aunt and where she was to be found the girl told her she had been gone above a week and that she believed she was at her sisters in windsor henrietta had often heard her mention her sister who was married to a tradesman in windsor and after she had taken leave of the poor affectionate girl who wept to see her depart again she gave the postboy directions where to drive  mrs white when the chaise stopped at the door heard from a little parlour where she was sitting the voice of miss courteney enquiring for her and flew with trembling eagerness to meet her  oh miss said she taking her hand and leading her into the room i am rejoiced to see you where have you been all this time  what an unfortunate creature was i to be the means of your taking such a rash resolution  oh that i had kept what i knew to myself  but surely it was very unkind in you not to acquaint me with your design not to ask my advice i might have prevented all this trouble but thank heaven you are safe and well  well i see you are  henrietta then interrupting the good woman who between chiding and fondness had taken no notice of mrs willis that i am safe said she i am obliged to this gentlewoman for some strange treachery was preparing for me i believe but her care has prevented it  treachery interrupted mrs white  aye you have met with enough of that i suppose there was your newfound friend and acquaintance miss  i forget her name whom you told all your secrets to you made no scruple to trust her miss though you was so reserved to me she was the occasion of my losing my place ah miss but i will not upbraid you i see you are concerned god forbid i should add to your uneasiness i have suffered greatly upon your account it was very unkind in you to put it in the power of a stranger to do me so much mischief surely i did not deserve such a return from you but god knows my heart i would not upbraid you for the world no i scorn it but i have been the greatest sufferer i am sure and yet i meant well  was not the ladys name woodby interrupted henrietta impatient to hear the particulars of this new act of treachery and baseness  aye woodby replied mrs white a disagreeable creature as ever my eyes beheld i shall never forget how she sidled into my ladys dressing room and half out of breath told her she had taken the liberty to wait on her to bring her some news of her niece i could not hear distinctly all she said for my lady ordered me to withdraw but i put my ear to the keyhole as i had done once before for your service miss which i have reason to repent heaven knows  but what is past cannot be helped  it is not my way to rip up things that are past  well said henrietta but what did you hear  nay for that matter resumed mrs white i may draw myself into another preme perhaps after what i have suffered i ought to be cautious but i love you miss and must tell you every thing whatever it cost me and that you have experienced already well she made up a horrible story that you had gone away suddenly from lodgings where she visited you and notwithstanding the friendship there was between you and a great clutter she made with that word you went away without giving her any notice of your intention and this she said had a strange appearance  miss courteney lifted up her eyes here in astonishment at what she heard  as for me continued mrs white she did my business in an instant for as soon as she was gone my lady sent for me and in a violent rage told me i should not stay another night in her house she was informed she said that i had been the cause of your running away by filling your head with notions of her designing to confine you in a convent she would hear nothing that i could say in my own defense and dismissed me that very evening  i am excessively sorry said henrietta that you should suffer so much on my account  it was indeed very imprudent in me to be so communicative to miss woodby but i could not imagine she was capable of so much treachery  but how have you been able to conceal yourself so well miss from the enquiries of all your friends said mrs white mr bale it seems your guardians son knew not where to find you  did mr bale say he knew not where i was cried miss courteney in astonishment  he told mr danvers so replied mrs white who went several times by my ladys orders to enquire for you  was there ever such complicated treachery said henrietta looking at mrs willis with tears in her eyes well my dear said the good woman there is at least this advantage in misfortunes that they bring us at last to wisdom you will for the future be more cautious how you engage in such perilous enterprises  ay miss said mrs white and how you trust false friends to the prejudice of your true ones  you see what it has cost me  but no more of that  i can forget and forgive  well and what is now to be done said miss courteney folding her hands with a melancholy air  it is easy to answer that question said mrs willis you must write to your aunt my dear and give her an account of all that has happened to you there is certainly something to condemn in what you have done but in what you have suffered there is much to be pitied i am persuaded her tenderness will silence her resentment i hoped to have left you with your aunt miss continued mrs willis but since that cannot be you will return with me i suppose  to be sure i will said miss courteney with whom in my present situation can i be so happy as with you  mrs white desired she might be permitted to come and see her to which henrietta readily consented promising if she was reconciled to her aunt to use her utmost endeavors to reinstate her in her place  chap ii which throws new lights upon mr bales behavior and contains a very improving conversation  the two ladies being again seated in their postchaise mrs willis kindly applied herself to comfort her fair companion whose affecting silence showed a deeper sense of her new disappointment than any words could express however miss courteney felt in reality lower perturbations and less anxiety in her return than when she began her journey so true it is that when we hope little we fear little likewise  she now looked upon her aunts affection as irrecoverable miss woodbys vile insinuations had strengthened her suspicions mr bale when he found himself detected would doubtless account for his behavior in a manner unvourable to her her unhappy flight had given such a color to her succeeding actions as rendered any justification of herself hopeless and the insidious chaplain might now with case confirm those prejudices he had raised  in this manner she reasoned herself into a belief that her misfortune was irremediable despair as an ingenious writer the author of maxims characters and reflections etc printed for j and r tonson observes being that ease to the mind which mortification is to the flesh henrietta found some relief in being freed from that vicissitude of hopes and fears which had so long held her mind in the most racking suspense and with a kind of gloomy satisfaction resigned herself to all the bitterness of her fate  mrs willis who knew not the peculiarities of lady meadowss temper or if she had would not perhaps have considered that obstinate people are ever most obstinate in error thought all things might be set right again by miss courteneys giving a candid narrative of what had happened to her since her leaving her she therefore pressed the young lady to delay writing to her aunt no longer than the next day  there are some cases said mrs willis to her when she saw her sitting down to write in which simplicity is the greatest refinement of art yours is one of them be as simple and ingenuous as you can in the account you give your aunt and let the facts speak for themselves  henrietta followed her advice and related every part of her conduct since she had left her and the treachery and deceit that had been used toward her with the utmost plainness and sincerity and saw that she had made her letter more affecting by its simplicity than she could have done by the nicest touches of art mrs willis read it and approved of it and it was immediately dispatched to the post  scarce was this little affair over when mr bale sent in his name  i like this piece of ceremony said mrs willis it looks as if the man was ashamed of what he has done do you choose to see him miss  oh no replied henrietta it would be strange indeed if i was willing to see a man whom you suspect of having such shocking designs and who i am sure has not acted honestly  well then said mrs willis i will go down to him and hear what he has to say  she returned again in less than an hour smiling this young man said she does not want sense what would you say miss if i was to tell you that he has persuaded me he has acted very right and with the best intentions in the world  i should say that i am less unhappy than i thought i was replied miss courteney for surely it is a great misfortune to meet with persons who abuse our confidence and the good opinion we have of them  that misfortune said mrs willis will in time become so common that you will feel it less sensibly than you do now the only way to avoid being deceived is to be always upon your guard against deceit  that is to say i must be always suspicious said henrietta that may be a very prudent maxim but my heart disavows it  alas my dear replied mrs willis we all enter upon the world with high notions of disinterestedness friendship sincerity and candor but experience shows us that these qualities exist not or among so very few that it does not fall to the lot of one mortal in a thousand to meet with them in those we contract friendships with the frequent disappointments we suffer in the search of them make suspicion grow into a habit of thinking which if it lessens our enjoyments lessens our inconveniences likewise  then i said miss courteney shall be always exposed to inconveniences for i am sure i can never bring myself to suspect persons who appear deserving of my good opinion and indeed i think it is more honorable to be often deceived than to be always doubting  but it is not so safe replied mrs willis smiling however my dear in unexperienced youth like yours this way of thinking is meritorious the faults of the world can only be learned by a long acquaintance with it and by suffering from that acquaintance those who derive this kind of knowledge from the heart rather than the head are indeed safe themselves but dangerous to all others  but i will keep you no longer in suspense with regard to mr bale he has glossed over his behavior so as to make me appear satisfied with it which indeed it is necessary i should if i would not wish to make an enemy of him and a very powerful one he might be to my husband  he asked for you as soon as he saw me and did not seem surprised at the very slight excuse i made for your not seeing him he expressed great concern for the treatment you had received from his wife for in her frantic rage it seems she told him all that had passed between you  you find said he i did not exaggerate my wifes failing  it is a great misfortune replied i but sir i think if you had not made a secret of your connections with miss courteney mrs bales jealousy would not have had so plausible an excuse nor would the young lady have had any reason to complain of you  i should have found it absolutely impossible said he to have concerned myself in miss courteneys affairs or been of the least use to her had my wife known any thing of the matter the very fight of miss courteney would have roused her suspicions and have put it out of my power to act either as a friend or guardian by her and in her unhappy situation she had great need of my care and attention  however sir replied i it was certainly ill judged to conceal from miss courteney that you was married what must she think of such a strange conduct  why mrs willis resumed he i have already told you that i could not own my marriage to miss courteney without letting her into my reasons for not being able to offer her an asylum in my house during her aunts displeasure an offer she had great reason to expect i was unwilling to expose my wifes foible and to raise scruples in the young ladys mind which might prevent her from receiving those little services from me which she had so much need of i hope you will represent all this to her and let her know how greatly i am afflicted at what she has suffered  to be sure i will replied i but miss courteney tells me you have received letters from mr bale in which he acquaints you that there are some foreign merchants coming to reside in my house and that she was to be removed for that reason i surprised her greatly by saying i had heard nothing of it and indeed i am a good deal surprised myself at it  why to be plain with you mrs willis said the young gentleman this was only an invention  indeed said i looking very grave to be sure you had some good reason for it  doubtless i had pursued he and you yourself shall be judge of my reason  this is a bad world mrs willis a very bad world nothing but stratagems and designs fraud and cunning our sex mrs willis is in a state of war with yours our arms are sighs and vows and flattery and protestation and as in all other warfares we fight to destroy  bless us interrupted henrietta half smiling what could this fine preface lead to  i protest resumed mrs willis laughing it was with the utmost difficulty i composed my countenance to a look of grave attention while he uttered all this with a solemn accent and an air of infinite importance  truly sir replied i for so young a gentleman you think very gravely of these matters it is highly commendable in one of your years  heaven forbid mrs willis said he that all men should be libertines but in short it was to preserve miss courteney from falling into the snares of one that i formed an excuse for sending her into the country  vile dissembler exclaimed miss courteney again glowing with indignation preserve me from falling into the snares of a libertine i hope my own discretion without any aid from him was sufficient to guard me against any snares that a libertine could lay for me  i hope so too said mrs willis  henrietta blushed a little at this expression which seemed she thought to imply a doubt but would not interrupt mrs willis again  i told you that this gentleman was very artful continued the good woman as you will be convinced by the story he told  you must know said he to me looking extremely wise and lowering his voice that when i waited upon miss courteney at the lodgings she had taken after she left her aunt i observed a fine gay young man there who followed me when i went out and looked at me in a manner that showed great curiosity and attention it came into my head that this might be the spark of whom miss courteneys aunt was apprehensive i discovered that he lodged in the house with the young lady and this circumstance i liked by no means i resolved to remove her immediately and place her with you she so readily consented to my proposal that i doubted whether i had not been extremely mistaken in my conjectures concerning this young gentleman but a day or two after she was settled with you my spark came to enquire for her at my house now it was plain that miss courteney held some correspondence with him otherwise he could not have known where to come after her  i happened not to be at home and the servants told him that no such person was there he came several times and was always answered in the same manner his enquiries at length reached the ears of my wife she desired he might be shown up to her apartment when he came next and it was from him that she learned miss courteney was under my care  to one of her temper it was enough to know that i had the management of a ladys affairs to make her suspect that i had a more than ordinary interest in the lady herself but she concealed her thoughts from me and i who was wholly ignorant that this gentleman had seen my wife was only concerned at the connection there seemed to be between miss courteney and him and therefore fixed upon that stratagem to remove her out of his reach without giving her any suspicions of the cause  i have since enquired about the gentleman and i hear that he is a man of quality and that he is shortly to be married to a great fortune judge now whether his designs on miss courteney could be honorable and whether i had not reason to act as i did with regard to sending her away  and now my dear added mrs willis smiling did you ever hear a more plausible tale  i have somewhere read it observed replied henrietta that we are better deceived by having some truth told us than none mr bale has put this maxim in practice his tale is plausible because part of it is true but his inferences are all false and their cause lies too deep for me to discover it  she then related succinctly all that had passed in the house of mrs eccles and that she had earnestly entreated mr bale to dispose of her elsewhere being resolved after the affront that had been offered to her to remain there no longer she added that the young lord having hinted his suspicions that mr bale was her lover she thought herself obliged to tell him his name and explain the nature of his connexions with her that she might not by going away with a person unknown leave room for calumny to slander her  mrs willis was charmed with this candid account of her conduct which overthrew all mr bales insinuations she embraced her with great tenderness all will soon be set right said she your aunt will receive you with redoubled affection miss courteney sighed but having already taken her resolution she was prepared for whatever events might happen  chap iii which we are afraid will give some of our readers a mean opinion of our heroines understanding  two days afterward a letter was brought by the post for miss courteney the direction was in her aunts hand she opened it with some trepidation and found it as follows  henrietta for niece i cannot after what has happened call you  if you had not by the highest imprudence that any young woman could be guilty of given too much our for the shocking censures that are cast on you i might perhaps have been deceived by your plausible account of things i am sorry to find you have acquired so much art it is but too sure a proof that you are less innocent yet it would be easy for me to take to pieces every part of your defense and show you the absurdity of it but this is needless for whether you are innocent or guilty you have greatly wounded your reputation and i can no longer with honor consider you or treat you as my niece  there is but one way left by which you can retrieve your fame and my affection motives which ought to have some weight with you but infinitely less than the desire of securing your salvation  i hoped and believed your conversion was near completed and doubtless it would have been had not your passions intervened  if you will retire to a convent and put yourself into a way of being instructed in the true religion i will pay your pension largely and the day that sees you reunited to the faith shall see you restored to my fondest affection and made sole heiress to my whole estate consider well before you determine and know that upon any other terms than these you must not hope for farther notice from me  f meadows   although several parts of this letter were extremely shocking both to the delicacy and pride of henrietta yet the shining bribe that was offered her to procure her apostasy made a large compensation she had now an opportunity given her of making a worthy sacrifice to the religion she believed and professed a circumstance that exalted her in her own opinion for her selflove had been deeply wounded by the humiliations she had undergone and as great delicacy always suffers most so it enjoys most from its own reflection  she was not free from a little enthusiasm that told her it was glorious to suffer in the cause of religion nor so disinterested as not to feel great pleasure in the thought of being able to free her moral character from injurious suspicions by so firm an attachment to her religious principles  her impatience to answer her aunts letter would not allow her time to communicate to mrs willis the contents of it but as soon a she had done writing she sent for the goo woman and put lady meadowss letter into he hands with such an air of conscious satisfation as persuaded her the so much desired conciliation was effected but when upon reaing the letter she found her mistake she thr it down and in a melancholy accent and a look that expressed the most anxious curiosity asked her how she had resolved  read this said henrietta giving her the letter she had written i am sure you will not disapprove of what i have done mrs willis read it eagerly and found it as follows  madam it is a great grief to me to find that your affection is irrecoverable for at the price you have set upon it i must ever deem it so if my defense seems absurd madam it is because truth is too weak to combat prejudice i leave it to time and my future conduct to clear my innocence and am resolved never to give a confirmation to those aspersions which are cast on my character by sacrificing my religion to my interest  that poverty which happily is become my choice will be my best vindication and if it affords me no other blessing but that of a good conscience it will bestow on me the highest that is attainable in this life and which will enable me to bear cheerfully all the misfortunes that may befall me among which i shall always look upon the loss of your esteem as the greatest i am madam with all due gratitude and respect your obliged and very humble servant  henrietta courteney   i must approve nay admire your resolution miss said mrs willis returning the letter and if you persist in it you will appear to me a wonder  do you doubt my persisting in it replied henrietta  when i consider said mrs willis your birth your youth your beauty and the expectations you have been encouraged to entertain i know it must cost you a great deal to throw away the advantages that are offered you and which possibly you might secure by temporising at least  dissimulation interrupted henrietta on any occasion is mean and scandalous but in matters of religion it is surely a heinous crime and i hope i am far enough from committing it but i own i have many motives to stimulate my resolution  my own imprudence and the treachery of others have given a wound to my reputation which a voluntary poverty can only repair in this licentious age she who with youth and even the slightest advantages of person dares to be poor deserves surely to be thought virtuous and i shall ever acknowledge the bounty of providence that amidst the unjust censures which have been cast on me has made an humble lot my choice  i am satisfied interrupted mrs willis reason i see has a greater share in your so lately formed resolution than the zeal of enthusiasm or the suggestions of vanity and you may believe me a true friend to your fame when i heartily congratulate you on your present situation and now my dear miss suffer me to assure you of my tenderest friendship a friendship which cannot be contented with bare professions and insists upon your putting it to some trial  tell me how i can serve you o that you would honor me so far as to let this house be your asylum till fortune does justice to your merit condescend to live with me my dear miss and share my little income  you are very kind dear mrs willis replied henrietta but my circumstances will not permit me to continue your boarder and no distress shall oblige me to be burdensome to a friend i have already resolved how to dispose of myself and in the scheme i have formed i shall need your assistance  tell me my dear cried mrs willis eagerly how i can be of any use to you  you must replied henrietta blushing a little you must get me a service my dear mrs willis  a service exclaimed the good woman  i am very well qualified resumed henrietta recovering from her first confusion and smiling to wait upon a woman of fashion for my mother gave me a useful as well as genteel education and this station will be at once private enough to secure me from disagreeable accidents and public enough to make my conduct acquit or condemn me  i will not added she observing mrs willis continued silent offer myself to any place by my own name that would look like an insult upon my great relations and be perhaps an obstruction to my success it is sufficient for me that whenever i am discovered it may be in circumstances at which they not i need be ashamed  when i first heard you mention this scheme said mrs willis i thought i could never be brought to approve it but a little reflection has convinced me that it may have good consequences you cannot be long concealed that graceful form will soon draw notice upon you whenever you are known to be in a station so unworthy your birth and merit the pride of your relations will be rouzed how glorious then will this humiliation be for you methinks i see their confusion for their neglect of you and their eagerness to repair it by restoring you to the rank you was born in  oh my dear you will certainly be happy yet i am sure you will  henrietta smiled a little at the good womans sanguine expectations but in reality the same thoughts had made a great impression upon her and contributed more than she imagined to allay the uneasiness she felt at being reduced to take such a step by degrees she formed in her own mind so romantic a scene that she grew impatient to enter upon it and again entreated the assistance of mrs willis  the good woman telling her that a cousin of her husbands was a sackmaker and in great vogue at the court end of the town it was agreed that she should go to her and engage her good offices toward recommending the young lady to a place it being very likely that among her customers who were mostly women of quality she might hear of one that would suit her  chap iv which contains very trifling matters  mrs willis succeeded beyond her hopes the mantuamaker had been desired by a lady she worked for to look out for a genteel young person to serve her in the quality of her woman and promised her cousin that she would mention her friend to the lady the next day being to wait on her with some clothes that were to be tried on she added that the lady was a citizen but had an immense fortune and that her place was certainly a very good one  henrietta seemed very well pleased with her landladys success though she was not free from some uneasy perturbations at the thoughts of the condition she was so soon to enter upon  mrs measure did not fail to visit her cousin the next day well said she i have done the young gentlewomans business she has nothing to do but to wait upon miss cordwain and if she likes her figure she will hire her directly  why pray replied mrs willis what kind of figure will best please this lady  oh cried mrs measure miss cordwains woman must be very genteel and look like a gentlewoman the richer she is dressed too when she goes to wait on her the better every thing about miss cordwain must be magnificent well pursued she laughing and taking a pinch of snuff which produced several little pauses in her discourse it is really surprising to see these little cits how they mimick people of quality  they must be so extravagantly in the fashion  i vow and protest the negligee i tried on miss cordwain today had a train three yards and a half long  henrietta that moment entering the room mrs willis seeing her cousin was surprised at her appearance said this is the young gentlewoman who wants a place  the mantuamaker upon this information resumed her familiar look and manner and throwing herself again upon her chair took a full survey of the young lady who thanked her with some hesitation and a blush that crimsoned over her face for the service she had done her  i have just been telling my cousin said mrs measure that miss cordwain the lady i have recommended you to maam is very hard to be pleased her woman must look like a lady forsooth she has refused three that went to see her place one because she had a red hand it looked she said as if the creature had stood at a washtub another because she went to be hired in a linen gown and the third because she had lived with nobody of higher rank than a baronets wife  but i am sure she can have no objection to you maam unless perhaps she may think you too handsome do you take snuff maam offering her box which henrietta civilly declined  but dear maam pursued the mantuamaker who makes your clothes i never saw any thing so frightful as the slope of that ruffle then such a horrid sleeve it is well you are naturally genteel  henrietta slightly bowed in return for this compliment and asked her at what hour it would be proper to wait upon miss cordwain  about one oclock in the forenoon replied mrs measure that is her breakfast time her father honest man is in his warehouse before six but this is his only daughter and he expects she will be a duchess or countess at least  she has fifty thousand pounds  where does the lady live asked henrietta  here in one of your filthy lanes replied the mantuamaker i forget the name of it but every body knows mr cordwain the packer  she then rose up made one of her best courtesies and hurried into a chair that was waiting for her for this polite mantuamaker was above visiting her customers in a hackney coach and this insolence was such a proof of her excellence in her business that few ever scrupled to pay for it  chap v which shows henrietta in a new situation  henrietta having summoned all her resolution that she might acquit herself with propriety of the task she had undertaken prepared the next day to wait upon miss cordwain she remembered the mantuamakers hint and therefore avoided any studied simplicity in her dress but no apparel however mean could have hid that noble air or disguised that native elegance so conspicuous throughout her whole person  as soon as she was ready she stepped in to mrs williss parlour and while a coach was sent for assumed a more than ordinary cheerfulness in her discourse with the good woman for she was extremely desirous of concealing the emotions she felt upon this mortifying occasion and affected a most heroic indifference while inly she suffered all that a mind decate and sensible as here is could feel  mrs willis followed her to the door with tears in her eyes the young lady stepped into the coach smiled a farewell and ordered the coachman to drive to mr cordwains a few minutes brought her to the house and the servant of whom she enquired if miss cordwain was at home having shown her into a parlour bowed and withdrew  miss cordwain being informed that a lady enquired for her ordered her admittance and the same servant returning conducted henrietta to her dressing room  miss cordwain who was still lingering over her teatable with a female acquaintance rose up at henriettas graceful entrance and receiving her with a low courtesy offered her an armchair at the upperend of the room  henrietta conscious of the error she had committed in not making use of the mantuamakers name before blushed a little at this reception which was not suitable to the character she was to appear in and declining the chair mrs measure madam said she she could utter no more than those two words but they were sufficient to give miss cordwain to understand her business  the haughty citizen was excessively shocked to find she had been betrayed by the figure of henrietta into so improper an instance of respect and that the person she took for a lady of distinction was the young woman who had been recommended to her service thought to recover the dignity which she conceived she had lost from this mistake by assuming an imperious air and an insolent accent  who did you live with last said she to henrietta throwing herself again into her chair and glancing her over with a supercilious eye i hope it was with a woman of quality you will not do for me i can tell you if you have not been used to attend upon persons of rank  henrietta notwithstanding the confusion she was under at acting so strange a part could not help being diverted with the pride of this daughter of trade  i am afraid madam said she i shall not be worthy of your place for i never lived in the service of any woman of quality nor indeed in any other  what you are a gentlewoman i suppose interrupted miss cordwain drawling out the word gentlewoman and now i remember measure told me you had never been in service well that does not signify i have no objection to your having been a gentlewoman you may be the better servant for what i know for to say the truth said she addressing herself to her companion those sort of poor gentlewomen when they are reduced as they call it to wait upon us who could buy their whole generation often know their distance better and are more humble than such as have been bred to service  oh said the other lady with an applauding smile ever while you live madam choose a gentlewoman for your maid there is alderman fig the grocers lady i have heard he often declare she never was so well served as when colonel nobles daughter waited on her the colonel was killed in the last war and as those folks you know have seldom any thing to leave their families his fine gay daughters were obliged to go to service after his death and did very well but some body left them ten thousand pounds a piece and spoiled two excellent servants by making them gentlewomen again  nay if they had fortunes left them replied miss cordwain why you know then they had a right to be called gentlewomen  well child pursued she turning to henrietta as i told you before i have no objection to your having been a gentlewoman for i am resolved never to have any other to wait on me i shall take you upon measures recommendation and the sooner you come the better  henrietta who had really enjoyed the conversation that had passed between these two ladies told her that she would come whenever she pleased and it being agreed she should come the following day that she might dress her new lady for a cityfeast she courtesied profoundly low and withdrew  henrietta whose imagination was naturally lively and not wholly free from those romantic notions which persons of her age readily admit began to consider her transformation from the niece of lady meadows and a presumptive heiress into the waitingmaid of a cit as one of those caprices of fate which never fail to produce surprising effects she could not help fancying herself the future heroine of some affecting tale whose life would be varied with surprising vicissitudes of fortune and that she would at last be raised to a rank as much above her hopes as the station she was now entering upon was below all that her fears had ever suggested  but these reflections were succeeded by others more reasonable and which indeed afforded her a more solid satisfaction she was going to refute the censures of an injurious world to make that innocence which had been so vilely traduced manifest in her cheerful submission to poverty and servitude at a time when a shining fortune was offered to purchase a change in her religious principles and when perhaps a little dissimulation or a temporary compliance with her aunts proposals might restore her to a rank in life suitable to her birth  the satisfaction she felt from these pleasing ideas diffused such a serenity over her fair face as agreeably surprised mrs willis who had waited her return with impatience  henrietta repeated to her the dialogue that had passed between the two ladies with so much humor and marked the pride of wealth and awkward affectation of grandeur and distinction in these opulent heiresses to the laborious gains of sordid thrift and perhaps successful knavery with such delicate strokes of satire as convinced mrs willis she would not be an injudicious observer of the manners of those whom it might be her lot to associate with nor pass through this new scene of life without drawing improvement from it  the good woman was grieved to find that she must lose her so soon but being fully persuaded that this humiliating step would terminate in something happy for her fair friend she disposed herself to part with her cheerfully  it was agreed between them that the elder mr bale should not be made acquainted with any part of his sons behavior with regard to henrietta till his return from holland when the whole affair might be laid heartily before him and that the younger should be told that she was gone into service but where he was not to be informed  the next day henrietta after taking a tender farewell of mrs willis repaired to her new dwelling miss cordwain was just gone out to make some little purchases for the evening and henrietta being directed to go into her ladys dressing room was met by her predecessor who had lingered in the house to have an opportunity of speaking to her that according to the general custom of servants she might prejudice her against her new mistress  from this girl who was not sparing in her invectives she learned that miss cordwains temper which was not naturally good was extremely sowered of late by a disappointment in love that the packer her father had been treating with a certain nobleman for a mah between her and the noblemans eldest son but that it had been broke off because the citizen had refused to lay down more than thirty thousand pounds with his daughter and the nobleman insisted upon forty  this little piece of history was followed by a thousand other family anecdotes to all which henrietta listened in silence and was not sorry that the censorious waiting woman whose tongue had during a whole hour run with surprising volubility was at length silenced by the arrival of miss cordwain whose voice when she heard on the stairs she took a hasty leave and retreated through a different door from that which the lady entered  miss cordwain as soon as she saw henrietta slightly inclined her head in return to her respectful courtesy and throwing some millenary trifles upon her toilet she sat down to her glass and ordered her new woman to comb her hair showing a fretful impatience at her hairdressers long delay for she was to meet her company at nine oclock and it was now almost four so that she had good reason to fear she should hardly have time enough to dress  while henrietta was acquitting herself handily enough of this task her lady took up a colection of songs that lay upon her table that she might improve her mind while her body was dorning and after reading intently a few moments to herself she hastily turned over the leaves to a place that was doubled down and began to read aloud a most piteous complaint of a despairing nymph whose lover had forsaken her for another she concluded this doleful ditty with a deep sigh and repeating the burden of it for men are as false as the changeable wind henrietta said she was you ever in love  our fair heroine who understood this question as a prelude to a confidence from her mistress was at some loss how to answer it when she was relieved from her perplexity by the arrival of monsieur finesse the french haircutter  miss cordwain immediately dropping her tender languishments assumed a supercilious air and after haughtily interrogating the ingenious artist for not coming sooner submitted her tresses to his forming hands a settled gloom all the time clouding her face for whether it was that her glass on which her eyes were intently fixed told her some unpleasing truths or that her gentle bosom heaved with some secret discontent but it is certain that every thing displeased her nor could all henriettas obliging attention to the adorning her person draw a smile of approbation from her  after five hours labor however the lady was completely dressed her father who had not seen her since dinner which she had swallowed in haste having so much business on her hands now entered the room and liking the shewy appearance she made why jenny said he you are as fine as a duchess  as fine as a duchess repeated she pouting and why not  very true girl replied the father thou have that which can make duchesses but jenny i have something to say to thee in private so send your waitingmaid away  henrietta immediately retired into her mistresss bedchamber which being only separated from the dressing room by a slight partition of wainscot she could not avoid hearing every thing that passed  i have had a proposal made me this afternoon resumed the father and i came to acquaint you with it mr traffic has asked you in marriage there is immense riches for you girl what say you  sure papa cried miss cordwain hastily you have not given him any encouragement have you a fine match indeed so i must be called plain mrs traffic all my days and there is miss fig married to a viscount and has coronets upon her coach three weeks ago miss haggle the brokers daughter became a countess and but this very morning i heard that the duke of hazard is courting miss steam our neighbor the soapboilers niece and she has but twenty thousand pounds  i cannot bear it so i cannot pursued miss cordwain bursting into tears to see all my comrades at hackney boardingschool married to right honourables and i am not likely to be even a paltry baronets wife  here her tears and sobs suppressed any farther utterance and had such an effect upon the fond father that he also was ready to cry  dont break my heart jenny said he half sobbing you know it is death to me to see you fret and grieve yourself are you not my only child is it not for you that i have been toiling and laboring for these forty years up early and down late scraping all i can together gaining much and spending little and all to make you a peeress of great britain and a peeress you shall be so dont cry my girl and spoil your complexion neither neighbor fig nor neighbor haggles daughter shall be greater than you you shall be a countess jenny will that content you i will lay down the odd ten thousand that the earl of  and i quarrelled about and you shall have his son  i am obliged to you papa said miss cordwain but    nay interrupted the father i find nothing will please you you were crying just now because you were not a countess and when i tell you you that i will part with another ten thousand pounds to make you easy you come with your buts  why suppose i am a countess replied miss cordwain will not miss steam be a duchess and take place of me i can never endure that  what signifies her taking place of you said her father the dukes estate is not half so good as the earl of  besides you refused a duke you know and you have often told me that you like lord b  better than any man in the world and how have you pined since the match was broke off  well i confess replied miss that i do like my lord b  and would rather marry him than any duke in the land provided that little odious thing miss steam did not marry above me she to be called her grace at every word while i am only lady b  i should die with vexation  since it is so said the father i shall lay aside my design and make no advances to the earl  and then his son will marry some body else cried miss cordwain  what would the girl be at interrupted the good man with some heat if you will not have him need you care who has  miss cordwain now burst into a flood of tears she liked lord b  but she could not bear the thoughts of miss steams being in a rank above her and love and envy raised such tumults in her breast as made her seek a relief in tears  i wish you knew your own mind girl said the father half angry and half concerned at her grief  i know my own mind well enough replied miss sullenly i would marry lord b  and i would not have that proud  be a duchess  take my word for it said the father she will never be duchess of hazard i know her fortune is not sufficient to chr the dukes estate of two mortgages that have almost swallowed it up  nay then interrupted miss cordwain who eagerly admitted an argument that set her mind at ease i am sure the duke will not have her for she is so ugly you know papa that nothing could charm him but her riches  well said the father smiling with pleasure to see her in good humor again i am to meet a friend of the earls tonight shall this affair be brought on again  as you please papa said miss cordwain courtesying you know it is my duty to be obedient  aye said the good man kissing her you have always been one of the most dutiful children in the world and i will make thee a lady though i dont leave myself a shilling with this wise declaration he quitted the room leaving his daughter in high spirits who after she had called her maid to adjust whatever might be amiss in her dress and taken a full survey of herself in the glass stepped into her coach with the air of a citizen who had a fortune of forty thousand pounds  chap vi contains an incident which the sagacious reader has probably foreseen  henrietta when she was left alone found sufficient matter for reflection in the sentiments and behavior of this wealthy tradesman and his daughter and as it was now become necessary for her own peace of mind to reconcile herself to the situation that fortune had placed her in she endeavored to extract useful lessons from every scene that passed under her observation  why have i lamented my poverty said she to herself riches neither give understanding to the mind nor elegance to the person how mean is miss cordwain with forty thousand pounds what narrow notions what selfish passions how ignorant how contemptible  all the advantages her large fortune procures her is a title and a coronet honors how despicable when such as miss cordwain wear them  let me thank heaven then that made my father a younger brother that he inherited the virtues and elevated sentiments of his noble ancestors and wanted that allurement to upstart wealth which might have given me a miss cordwain for a mother and have deprived me of those generous precepts and those bright examples by which i have been taught to think poverty a less evil than dishonor and that a peaceful conscience is cheaply purchased with the loss of every worldly advantage  these were her reflections as she afterward declared to her friend it is not therefore surprising that with such sentiments our fair heroine found herself tranquil in her humble station and dignified misfortune by her graceful resignation to it  if the woman she served had had judgment enough to distinguish merit and goodness enough to love it henrietta must have engaged her attention and her kindness but little minds like nothing but what resembles themselves  miss cordwain sometimes condescended to enter into a conversation with her woman but was quickly disgusted with the difference of their notions and what she could not comprehend she either despised as folly or suspected as artifice  they were upon these terms when mr cordwain acquainted his daughter that they were invited to spend a week at the earl of  s countryseat for the contested ten thousand pounds being granted by the citizen the treaty of marriage was renewed and this visit was proposed in order to bring the young people together again with some kind of decorum  miss cordwain in high spirits gave her woman notice to make preparations for this little journey which done henrietta went to take leave of her faithful mrs willis  what a triumph would mine be said she to her friend if any of my relations should happen to be at this noblemans seat and behold me in the character of miss cordwains servant  you have done right my dear replied mrs willis to call it a triumph for so indeed it would be the triumph of virtue over pride and prejudice  the good woman informed her that her guardian was in a very ill state of health and was gone to montpelier in consequence of his physicians advice that the young man had been there to wait upon her and that when he heard of the resolution she had taken he affected to think himself extremely injured by her conduct as it showed the utmost contempt of his advice and friendship but it was easy to perceive added mrs willis that there was more grief than anger in the reproaches he threw out against you upon this occasion he seemed much mortified at my refusing to tell him where you was but owned that his wife made him very uneasy upon your account and when i urged that as an argument against the propriety of your seeing him his silence acknowledged me in the right  henrietta was sensibly affected with the news of her guardians illness and since his return was now uncertain she resolved to write to him immediately and give him an account of all that had happened to her since he went abroad fearing that unless she explained the reasons of her conduct he might be prejudiced against her by her aunts representations of it she would not give him any disquiet by mentioning his sons behavior but left that to be unravelled by time  mrs willis having promised to get this letter safely transmitted to mr bale henrietta took a tender leave of her and returned home  the next morning very early the coach and six was at the door miss cordwain impatiently stepped in for she thought every moment an age till she saw her noble lover again her face dressed in smiles of pleasing expectation and her heart exulting with the consciousness of her own worth which by her fathers concession of the disputed thousands had received such a considerable addition but being as i have before observed not very happy in the frame of her temper this sunshine of satisfaction was soon clouded at being obliged to wait a few minutes for her father whose slowness but ill suited with her eager impatience  indeed the wary citizen having wisely considered that they had a journey to perform of at least twenty miles was busied in packing up some necessary refreshments that they might not be famished by the way for this purpose he had caused a neats tongue a cake of gingerbread two or three pounds of almonds and raisins and a bottle of sack to be provided and he himself brought the basket in which they were deposited to the coach directing henrietta to get in first that he might place it safely in her lap which done he took his seat next his daughter and ordered the coachman to drive  miss cordwains ill humor insensibly wearing off they pursued their journey with great satisfaction not having baited above three or four times on the road  at length the young ladys eyes were delighted with the prospect of the magnificent villa which she expected one day to be mistress of but her attention was soon called off that object by the presence of her lover who being just returned from a little excursion on horseback alighted as soon as he saw the coach stop and advanced to hand his mistress out  the young lord presented his hand to miss cordwain with an air of forced gallantry but happening to glance his eyes toward henrietta he started back in great surprise  miss cordwain vexed at the attention with which he gazed upon her woman jumped out of the coach before he had sufficiently recovered himself to be able to offer her again the hand which in his confusion he had withdrawn  the lady having on a capuchin which she had wore during the journey untied it and tossing it into the coach to henrietta bid her in an imperious tone to take care of it  this action and these words gave the young nobleman to understand that our beauteous heroine was actually the servant of miss cordwain a circumstance which furnished him with new matter for wonder and indeed this encounter gave him so much perplexity and so entirely engrossed his thoughts that the old tradesman who enquired after my good lord and my good ladys health with as many bows and scrapes as would have served any trader to express his acknowledgment to a customer whom he had just imposed upon was obliged to repeat his questions several times before he could procure an answer  as for henrietta she had upon the first fight of this young nobleman whom she immediately knew to be the same person who lodged at mrs eccless been under some confusion left he should accost her as an acquaintance before the lady on whom she attended but observing that from miss cordwains behavior he understood her situation and took no further notice of her than by a side glance which he gave her full of passionate concern she was relieved from her fears and far from being discomposed at the character she appeared in she acquitted herself of the little duties of her station with the most graceful ease gave her lady her fan received her commands and with a little french trunk in her hand that contained some laces and linen followed her to the house at a respectful distance  lord b  s emotions at this unexpected meeting with henrietta having now in some degree subsided he entertained his mistress as they walked with his usual vivacity and politeness but could not help often turning to snatch a look of her fair attendant whose charms in that humble station a station so unworthy of her birth and shining merit acquired a pathetick power that melted him to a tenderness he had never known before  he conducted the lady and her father to the apartment of the countess his mother and taking the first opportunity to leave them retired to his own that he might be at liberty to reflect upon his adventure  to know that the woman whom all his most diligent enquiries for so many weeks could never discover was in the same house with him was a circumstance that afforded him infinite satisfaction but he saw no probability of turning this circumstance to the advantage of his designs upon her for with what face could he plead his passion to one of her delicacy while he was publicly addressing another  the servile condition he saw her in was a bar to his hopes she who with such uncommon attractions could resolve to be poor must needs be incorruptible what allurement could riches throw out for a woman who knew no other pride but the pride of virtue  he could not hope to make an impression upon her heart by the disguise of honorable love she must needs know the terms he was upon with miss cordwain and was afraid that she already despised him for the meanness of such a choice  it was indeed still in his power to throw such obstacles in the way of this match as to defer if not break it entirely but he could not resolve to make such a sacrifice to love he would have married henrietta with  miss cordwains fortune and was amazed at the violence of his passion when he considered the prodigious disproportion between twenty and forty thousand pounds  yet most sincerely did he wish his generosity could have been put to this trial and in the violence of his gri at the apparent impossibility that this should ever happen a thousand times did he curse the malevolence of fate that united so many virtues and graces in one lovely woman and denied her wealth which however by his preference of miss cordwain he tacitly acknowledged was worth them all  a whole hours labor of thought and reflection left lord b  s mind in the same state of anxious doubt and solicitude it was in when he first entered upon this examination of his own heart and all he could be certain of in this confusion of ideas and opposing sentiments was that the unexpected sight of miss courteney had charmed him more than ever and following the impulse of his passion without knowing whither it would conduct him or what it would terminate in he anxiously lay in wait for some opportunity of speaking to her in private which he found when he least expected it  chap vii in which our heroine again appears very foolish  mean time our lovely heroine who had been received by the countesss woman with prodigious ceremony and had during a whole hour listened with smiling attention to all the impertinences she uttered was at length relieved from the fatigue of such a conversation and with a profusion of compliments conducted to a chamber contiguous to that of her mistress as soon as she was left alone she began to consider how she should extricate herself from the difficulties her unexpected meeting with lord b  had involved her in  her delicacy was shocked at the thoughts of remaining in the house with a man who had made an attempt upon her honor especially in the situation she now was a situation that would seem to invite his future attacks and though he might well impute their meeting to the fantastic effects of chance yet he would not fail to construe her stay into a tacit encouragement of that passion he had professed for her at parting the dishonorable purport of which was evident from the engagements he had entered into with miss cordwain  she reflected also on the censures under which her character labored at present and was justly apprehensive that when this part of her story was known the malicious world would not fail to insinuate that she threw herself into lord b  s way and the inferences that would be drawn from such a supposed conduct must needs be highly disadvantageous to her  but on the other hand how could she quit miss cordwains service so abruptly without giving occasion for strange conjectures and setting the tongue of malice loose to assign reasons for her behavior very different from the truth  however the inconveniences which might attend this step were light compared with those she foresaw from exposing herself voluntarily to the pursuits of a young libertine whose eyes in this last interview had spoke too plainly to leave her in doubt of his sentiments  she therefore resolved to go away the next day and as soon as she was summoned to the toilet acquainted miss cordwain with her intention  henrietta was a scrupulous observer of truth and would not on this occasion violate it by forming any plausible excuse for her sudden determination so that miss cordwain in whose breast the stings of jealousy had been rouzed by the passionate glances lord b  had darted at her maid began to entertain strange suspicions from so unexpected an overture and in a peremptory tone demanded to know her reasons for quitting her service in such a manner  henrietta with great sweetness assured her that she did not desire to be dismissed in consequence of any discontent but that the necessity of her affairs obliged her to return immediately to town  your affairs said miss cordwain with a haughty sneer i vow it is mighty pretty to hear servants talk of their affairs as if they really had any concerns of more consequence than the duty they owe their principals i wonder you dont tell me you have half a dozen engagements in town pursued she laughing aloud such a speech would become you mightily but prithee go creature pack up your rags in a sheet of brown paper and take yourself away i suppose you have found out a new method of living less mortifying to your pride of beggarly gentility tha waiting upon a woman of fortune and i doubt not but you will be shortly seen flaunting it in public places with a flimsy sack a painted face and all the trappings of your trade  to this coarse abuse henrietta listened in silence beholding her imperious mistress all the time with such a calm but steady eye as called up a blush in those cheeks which had been before overspread with a livid paleness  not that she felt any remorse for the reproaches she had uttered or was ashamed of her indecent transports but henriettas soft composure the dignity of her silence and the energetick expression in her eyes struck a kind of awe into her meansould adversary and inly raging at the inferiority she was conscious of she commanded her to be gone from her presence  henrietta instantly obeyed and meeting the countesss woman as she went out of the room she begged her to send a servant to the nearest inn to hire a postchaise for her being resolved to return to london that very day  this wellbred abigail expressed great concern that she was so soon to lose the honor of her company and asked with an appearance of anxiety if she was not to return again  henrietta replied in the negative at which the other seemed wonderfully surprised though she was not ignorant of all that had passed between henrietta and her lady for hearing miss cordwains voice very loud she had applied her ear to the keyhole and needed no further information  our fair heroine having evaded the artful questions of this prying woman and discouraged her reflections on her own lady whom in her general invective against the pride and caprice of mistresses she did not spre told her she would have the pleasure of viewing the fine gardens that belonged to the house before she went away and mrs supple promised to join her as soon as she had executed the commission she was charged with  henrietta accordingly repaired to the gardens full of reflections upon the scene that had lately passed she entered a little covered alley that led to a grotto which she had an inclination to take a view of when hearing the sound of steps behind her she looked back supposing it was mrs supple but was not a little surprised to find it was lord b  who seeing her cross the terrace from his chamberwindow had followed her thither  henrietta rightly judging that this encounter was not merely accidental turned her steps from the grotto and struck into a less private walk lord b  perceiving her intention crossed immediately and met her bowing profoundly low and with an air as respectful as if he was accosting a duchess enquired after her health  henrietta not at all flattered by this instance of respect which he by whom it was paid considered as an act of supererogation and that it would affect her accordingly returned his compliment with the most graceful ease and smiling told him he must not now consider her as miss courteney but the servant of miss cordwain  o that horrid appellation cried he what violence did i not do myself to behave to you as i did this morning but tell me for heavens sake madam what has occasioned this transformation  my aunts continued displeasure replied henrietta your lordship has perhaps heard what circumstances my father died in the station therefore in which you see me ought not to be called a transformation it is what i was born to since i was born in indigence  i cannot bear to hear you talk thus interrupted lord b  how could you think of subjecting yourself to a condition so unworthy of you when you knew there was a man in the world that would have died to serve you  i am not of a temper said henrietta to be easy under great obligations and servitude is in my opinion less shocking than dependence  why do you talk of obligations said lord b  love knows no property could you doubt that my fortune would be at your command suffer me i conjure you pursued he to snatch you from this unworthy situation can riches be better employed than in supporting her i love  my lord interrupted henrietta her face glowing with indignation this is an insult i could not have expected from one of your rank and politeness i am fallen very low indeed when a man who is upon the point of marriage with another des lk to me of love  there are certain engagements replied lord b  a little confused at the air with which she uttered these words in which the heart has no part  very likely interrupted henrietta but it is sufficient for me to know that the engagements your lordship has entered into leaves you not the liberty of addressing me in this manner and i look upon the professions you make me as the highest insult upon my distress  lord b  notwithstanding he found in this justifiable haughtiness the ruin of his hopes could not help admiring a mind so rightly turned humble with such propriety and proud only when condescension would be meanness  this is not a time said he to tell you how far i am bound by those engagements you speak of but whatever they are they ought not to deprive me of the happiness of doing you service  i am obliged to you my lord said henrietta but at present the greatest service you can do me is to take no notice of me  in speaking these words she courtesied and would have left him but he not able to part with her thus snatched her hand  you must not leave me said he till you promise to give me an opportunity of speaking to you more fully  ah how i love you cried he gazing on her passionately  again this insulting declaration interrupted henrietta pulling her hand from him and giving him a look full of scorn and anger as she turned away  hear me madam cried he pursuing her suffer me in the character of your friend to offer you my services my mother was formerly acquainted with lady meadows if it will be of any use to you i will engage her to renew it and offer her mediation betwixt your aunt and you you must not b heaven you must not continue longer in so shocking a situation  this proposal and the earnest manner in which it was made drew henriettas attention angry as she was she thought it merited a civil return  doubt not my lord said she her charming eyes recovering their usual sweetness that i should be glad to consider you in the character of a friend and the offer you now make me is so obliging that i cannot dispense with myself from telling you my reasons for declining it  she then in a few words acquainted him with the purport of her aunts letter to her such are the terms added she upon which a reconciliation with my aunt ca be only effected therefore the countesss interposition in my favor were she disposed to grant it would be of no use  lord b  having before fully informed himself of every thing relating to miss courteney no sooner heard that for so trifling a compliance as the change of her religion it was in her power to secure lady meadows estate to herself which he knew to be very considerable than he thought fit to alter his style and declared that the affair between miss cordwain and him was not carried so far to take from him the liberty of following his inclinations and of offering her his hand be begged her therefore to favor him with another nterview in the morning when he would exain himself further  henrietta perceiving the countesss woman approaching and unwilling to leave him in oubt with regard to her sentiments upon this ew proposal thus answered hastily  my lord this can never be there are many obstacles against it you will find it very difficult to surmount those your own family will throw in your way but suppose that could be done my scruples will raise others less easy perhaps to be overcome  she left him when she had said these few ords and went to meet mrs supple who told her she had procured a vehicle for her and that it would be at the backgate in less than an hour but continued she there is a strange confusion within have you seen your lady  henrietta told her she had not  god knows what is the matter said mrs supple she went into the garden to look for you as i imagined and returned  minutes ago with a most wrathful countenance her father and she confabulated together and then went into my lords dressing room and mr harris my lords gentleman told me that the old man seemed to be very asy  henrietta had no time to make any reflections upon what she heard for a servant that moment came to tell mrs supple that her lady had sent him to look for her and desired that she would bring miss cordwains woman to her apartment  henrietta though a little surprised followed mrs supple with great cheerfulness who desired her to wait in the antichamber while she went to acquaint her lady with her being there where we will leave her for a few moments till the reader is informed of the accident that occasioned this summons  chap viii which contains a curious dialogue between the earl and the citizen  miss cordwain who in the notice lord b  took of henrietta found matter sufficient for jealousy and uneasiness entertained the most injurious suspicions when she heard her womans sudden resolution to return to london and having driven her from her presence with a torrent of abusive language vented her rage in tears as soon as she was gone  she reproached herself with her folly in dismissing her so readily when by obliging her to stay she might have guessed her designs or at least have obtained a more certain knowledge of them  her mischievous imagination being now upon the stretch to find some expedient for protracting her departure at last presented her with one which she resolved to make use of  she hid a diamond bracelet and then rung her bell for henrietta with an intention to tell her that she could not find it and insist upon her producing it before she left the earls  mrs supple who was that moment passing by her apartment and knew that henrietta was not in the way stepped in to know what she wanted miss cordwain asked for her woman and being told that she was walking in the garden hastened thither immediately not more delighted with the opportunity she now had of putting a stop to her journey than of affronting her with the suspicion of theft  as she descended the terrace her eyes were blasted with the sight of her woman at a distance in earnest discourse with her lover  at this confirmation of her suspicions she ran back like a fury into the house and meeting her father who had just left the earl in his dressing room told him that they were invited only to be affronted that henrietta was lord b  s mistress that he had taken her out of her service and that she was going back to london that very night at his request  the old man without staying to enquire farther or reflecting upon the extreme improbability of this story swore that never a lord in the land should use his daughter ill and strode back to the earls apartment while miss cordwain retired to her own meditating vengeance on those that had so cruelly injured her  mr cordwain who had promised himself to speak to the earl in very high terms was no sooner in his presence than he sunk into that lileness which mere monied men are so conscious of with persons of birth and politeness however he assumed courage enough to tell his lordship that he had something to say to him in private  the earl observing that his features were ruffled was a little surprised but dismissed his gentleman immediately though he was not quite dressed and then with a complaisant smile desired the citizen to let him know his commands  i am a plain man my lord said mr cordwain i dont understand fine compliments and breeding though i dont want for manners neither and i am sure i have always been very civil to your lordship and i did not expect that your lordship would have invited my girl and i here to scoff at us my lord i can give my girl forty thousand pounds which is what few lords can say let me tell you that and withal i am an honest man though i have forty thousand pounds more in my pocket perhaps but no matter for that i am not proud of my riches  mr cordwain said his lordship wondering to what this eloquent harrangue tended i hope nothing has happened to give you any disgust upon my honor i have the highest esteem for you and i think i give a proof of it by being so desirous of your alliance but i am at a loss to comprehend your meaning when you talk of my having invited you and your daughter here to affront you miss cordwain is a most accomplished young lady and my son has too much judgment not to be as sensible as he ought of her merits  indeed interrupted mr cordwain my daughter is in my eye a very comely young woman and i will never give her to any man though he were a duke or a prince that would keep a mistress under her nose a one may say  you astonish me mr cordwain replied his lordship have you any reason to suspect that my son is a libertine  my lord returned mr cordwain i am no scholar i dont understand hard wor i have had learning enough to scrape a few thousands together and that is sufficient for me your lordships son may be a libertine for what i can tell that is neither here nor there but i am sure he is a terrible rake and what tender father pursued he almost in tears would marry his child to a rake to have all the fruits of his toil and labor for thirty years and upwards squandered away upon lewd women  sure mr cordwain interrupted his lordship with a sterner accent you do not imagine my son capable of acting so dishonourably his principles mr cordwain   nay nay my lord resumed the citizen i have nothing to say against his principles he is no jacobite i dare engage but he is a rake my lord that is my objection to him and rakes are very bad husbands  my son said the peer may have had some youthful follies but i am sure miss cordwains beauty and good sense will fix his heart  and does your lordship really think my girl a beauty said the fond father his eyes glistening with pleasure indeed i always thought so but fathers my lord are apt to be partial  she is both beautiful and witty replied his lordship who found every excellence in fifty thousand pounds  nay as for her wit said mr cordwain i am the best judge of that who have seen her growing up under my eye she took her learning surprisingly my lord and by that time she was ten years old she and read her psalter quite through would it not grieve one then continued he to part with such a girl as this to one that will slight her and keep mistresses  do me the favor mr cordwain said his lordship to acquaint me with your reasons for suspecting that my son will keep a mistress though he should be so happy as to have miss cordwain for a wife  why you must know my lord replied the citizen looking extremely wise that i have made a discovery and yo son is actually carrying on an intrigue with my daughters maid  sure this must be some mistake cried the peer  no no my lord answered cordwain it is no mistake i am very sure of it  and you have discovered this intrigue you say resumed his lordship pray when and by what means did you discover it  about half an hour ago replied mr cordwain my daughter told me of it  oh then it was your daughter that discovered it said his lordship smiling a little at the old mans absurdity  ay ay my lord cried he construing that smile into an acknowledgment of his daughters sagacity i told your lordship she did not want for wit  but miss cordwain is certainly mistaken now said the peer this is some pretty frowardness a lovequarrel depend upon it we shall find it so however i will talk to my son and i will engage the countess to discourse your daughter upon this matter come mr cordwain we who are the parents of these young people know their true interest better than they do and must endeavor to make up this little breach between them i will make an end of dressing pursued his lordship bowing low to the cit and join you in the garden a quarter of an hour hence when i hope to clear up this affair to your satisfaction  mr cordwain immediately withdrew and the peer having stepped to his ladys apartment to acquaint her with this strange story left it to her to manage miss cordwain and went in quest of his son who when henrietta left him had retired to his study and was revolving in his mind a scheme which by reconciling his interest to his love would gratify all his wishes  chap ix in which henrietta has an interview with the countess  the countess like a discreet matron was resolved to see the young woman of whom miss cordwain entertained a jealousy that she might by wholesome counsels fortify her against seduction for she supposed that this suspicion took its rise from the girls being pretty and perhaps some little unmeaning gallantry of her sons who like all other young men admired beauty whenever he found it  she was willing also to know certainly whether miss cordwains fears were only imaginary that she might the better effect a reconciliation between the lovers for she passionately desired the completion of a match that would put her son into possession of forty thousand pounds  when mrs supple appeared in consequence of her summons and told her that mrs henrietta waited her ladyships commands the countess asked her what sort of a young woman she was  mrs supple replied that she was an awkward sort of a body mightily conceited of her beauty she believed and heaven knows added she she has not much to boast of  well tell her to come in said the countess beginning to believe from this account of her that miss cordwains fears were not without foundation for vanity she well knew was the great underminer of chastity from the duchess down to the chambermaid  when henrietta entered the room the countess who expected to see a very different person was so struck with her beauty and the dignity of her air that she rose from her seat and returned the graceful courtesy she made her with a complaisance that surprised her own woman who being ordered by her lady to leave the room instantly obeyed but went no farther than the door where she stood listening and heard all that passed  you appear to me said the countess to henrietta with an engaging smile to deserve so little the suspicions that are entertained of you that i really know not how to mention them to you though it was for that purpose i sent for you hither  henrietta was a little surprised at this beginning but conscious of the integrity of all her actions she was wholly free from any apprehensions that could discompose her  i know not madam said she the nature of those suspicions which i have incurred but i am very sure i have no guilt to reproach myself with which should make me fear to stand the strictest scrutiny  upon my word i believe you said the countess charmed with the noble confidence of her answer and the graceful manner in which it was delivered and it must be my sons imprudence that has given occasion for mr cordwains suspicions  the countess was too delicate to make use of miss cordwains name upon this occasion but henrietta in an instant comprehended the whole mystery and was now able to account for the injurious language that lady had given her  own freely to me pursued the countess smiling has not my son been a little troublesome to you and talked to you of love and such idle stuff  it is some mortification to me madam replied henrietta blushing to own that i have been affronted in the manner your ladyship mentions however it is certainly true lord b  has thought me weak enough to be dazzled with his professions  then you have seen my son often said the countess  henrietta who thought it behoved her to be very explicit on this occasion related to the countess the manner of her becoming acquainted with lord b  his concealing himself in her chamber and his behavior afterward  i did not know his lordships name pursued she and though i often heard him mentioned at mr cordwains yet as i had no reason to suspect that he was the same young nobleman whom i had such reason to avoid i made no scruple to attend miss cordwain hither  i am very much concerned said the countess to hear this account of my son it was a very shocking attempt so you have acquainted your mistress with what happened  no madam answered henrietta that was not necessary but when i discovered that lord b  was the person who had treated me so freely i desired miss cordwain to dismiss me because i did not choose to throw myself in his way  that was very prudently resolved said the countess and when are you to leave miss cordwain  immediately madam replied henrietta i have provided myself with a postchaise to return to london and i believe it is now waiting for me  certainly said the countess after a little pause this sudden resolution of yours must surprise miss cordwain what did she say when you acquainted her with it  she was extremely angry madam replied henrietta and said many severe things to me at which i was then astonished but it  cordwain entertained any unfavourable suspicions of me her behavior may be accounted for  since you have not acquainted her said the countess with my sons rude attempt upon you what reason could she have to suspect you  i know of none madam answered henrietta except his lordships speaking to me in the garden a little time ago may have come to her knowledge  you have shown so much candor in your answers to my questions resumed the countess that i am persuaded you will tell me frankly the subject of my sons discourse to you in the garden  i was born to suffer indignities madam said henrietta her cheeks glowing with indignation my lord b  though he must know that i was not ignorant of his honorable passion for miss cordwain yet dared to affront me with the mention of his love  the countess was a little surprised at this sally which escaped henrietta in the warmth of her resentment when she recalled to her remembrance a declaration which she looked on as the highest insult since lord b  was acquainted with her birth had the countess known that it was the niece of the earl of  who expressed herself in such lofty terms she would have admired that becoming pride which suggested them but in the waitingmaid of miss cordwain it appeared absurd and ridiculous and she was ready to suspect her of artifice and dissimulation  but when she cast her eyes upon henrietta and saw the emotion with which she was agitated the deep blush that glowed on her cheeks and the tears that trembled in her eyes she reproached herself with the injustice she was guilty of in so soon admitting doubts of her innocence  henrietta supposing from the silence of the countess that she had no more to say to her courtisied to her respectfully and was about to withdraw  you must not go said that lady in an obliging accent till i know whether it is in my power to serve you you have thrown up miss cordwains service upon my sons account it is but just therefore that i should procure you another if you are not provided for i will recommend you to my sister she will either take you herself or settle you with another lady  the countess in making this offer had another view besides serving henrietta she was not willing to lose sight of her for she rightly judged that with so many charms in her person and an understanding far above what we generally found in persons of her rank this young woman was very likely to inspire a solid passion and she dreaded lest her son should be so far captivated by her as to neglect the advantageous match that was now offered him  if she placed her with her sister or with any of her friends it would not be easy she thought for her son to get access to her or if he resolved to continue his pursuit his designs whatever they were would be known soon enough to be prevented  henrietta penetrated no further into the countesss sentiments than what served to give her a high idea of her benevolence she accepted her offer with expressions of the deepest gratitude and this the lady considering as a proof of her sincerity and right intentions she in the billet which she gave her for her sister recommended her in very obliging terms to her favor  henrietta again politely thanked her and receiving the billet upon which there was a full direction she went out of the countesss chamber with an intention to depart immediately  mrs supple whom she found in the antichamber informed her that her chaise was waiting for her at the gate upon which henrietta took leave of her and descended the backstairs but was suddenly stopped by mr cordwain who had followed her and seizing her rudely by the arm charged her with having robbed his daughter  chap x contains a discovery which it is hoped the reader will not be displeased with  good heaven exclaimed henrietta in the utmost astonishment what can this mean  look you child said the citizen my daughter tells me you have stole her diamond bracelet any body but myself would send you to prison directly but i am tenderhearted and consider that though i could hang you for this robbery yet that would be poor satisfaction for such a loss therefore in compassion i will spare your life provided you immediately restore the bracelet  henrietta had by this time collected her scattered spirits and comprehended the motive of this malicious accusation  may i not see miss cordwain sir said she in a composed accent i am  that i can convince her she wrongs are greatly by this strange suspicion  see her what should you see her for replied the old man unless you will give me back the bracelet you must not think to move her with your whining her entreaties shall not save you if you are obstinate so look to it but come perhaps you will have the grace to repent and return the bracelet come along  saying this he pulled her up stairs and led her with no great complaisance into his daughters chamber who sat exulting in her successful mischief and the disgrace she had fixed upon the creature that presumed to rival her a blush however dyed her cheeks at the sight of henrietta who with a look that at once expressed the highest contempt of her mean accuser and calm confidence in her own untainted innocence asked her how she had so far offended her as to make her seek her life  offended me creature said miss cordwain have you the assurance to imagine that i am uneasy because  because  you vain saucy flirt  who told you that i could be jealous of you and so you suppose  but you shall produce my bracelet  ay that she shall cried the citizen i wish we were in town i would carry her before alderman greygoose immediately come girl dont be a fool but deliver up the bracelet for this is a hanging matter let me tell you  do you really propose madam said henrietta looking on miss cordwain with a most contemptuous smile to go through with this malicious accusation and are you resolved to perjure yourself and swear that i have got your bracelet  what does the creature mean interrupted miss cordwain coloring  my meaning is said henrietta that your bracelet is certainly in your own possession and that you pretend to have lost it only to fix a scandal upon me  o my god cried miss cordwain putting her hand to her head the excessive insolence of this wench affects me so i believe i shall faint  dear papa let her go about her business i had rather lose ten bracelets than suffer so much uneasiness dear sir let her go one time or other she will meet with her deserts she will not stop at this theft but somebody else may bring her to justice i will have nothing more to do with her  base woman cried henrietta almost choked with rage no i will not take the liberty you offer me has our laws think you no punishment for a calumny like this that strikes at life as well as reputation you shall be forced to prove your charge and my fame shall be cleared to your everlasting confusion  miss cordwain conscious of her guilt and apprehensive of the consequences of what she had done knew not what answer to make to this menace as for the citizen he stared with stupid wonder upon the injured fair one for the extraordinary emotion she was in gave such vehemence to her utterance and such fire to her eyes that he even trembled as if in the presence of some superior being but poor henrietta after this sudden sally of rage found her heart so oppressed with the indignity she had suffered that she burst into a violent passion of tears  miss cordwain was ready to renew her insults when she found her so mortified and her father being recovered from his pannick again urged her to restore the bracelet when a servant came in and informed them that dinner was going to be served and that his lord and lady expected them in the dining room  miss cordwain immediately obeyed the summons for she dreaded the conclusion of this affair when she entered the room the countess who knew nothing of what had happened seeing her look very pale asked her if she was well and lord b  who had promised his father to cure her jealousy by redoubled assiduity for the future approached and with a well counterfeited tenderness expressed his concern for her indisposition  miss cordwain who had been assured by her father that the earl earnestly desired the match between his son and her should go forward resolved not to protract it by any show of resentment at what was past and therefore received his little assiduities with all the complaisance she was mistress of but desirous of mortifying him in the person of her who had so greatly attracted his notice as well as to give him an opinion of the softness of her disposition she told him that indeed she was prodigiously discomposed that her maid had robbed her and my father added she threatens the poor wretch with a prosecution and i was weak enough to be excessively shocked with her blubbering  has your maid robbed you miss said the countess extremely surprised  she has stolen a diamond bracelet from me this very morning madam replied miss cordwain  impossible cried lord b  in a transport that deprived him of all consideration miss courteney could not be guilty of any thing mean or scandalous  these words were scarce uttered when he discovered and repented of his indiscretion but it was now too late to repair it  miss courteney repeated miss cordwain recovering from her surprise who is miss courteney my lord  the countess perceiving her son was embarrassed endeavored to relieve him by asking miss cordwain some questions concerning her loss but that young lady would not be diverted from her question  this creature has a variety of names i suppose said she she hired herself to me by the name of benson and courteney it seems is that she has been formerly known by sure i have been very unfortunate to get such a wretch to attend me  madam said lord b  again thrown off his guard by his indignation at hearing a woman of henriettas merit so grossly abused you dont know who you are speaking of  why do you know said the earl to his son in an accent that showed how extremely he was displeased with his imprudence  yes my lord replied he i do and madam pursued he addressing himself to miss cordwain i am sure you will have candor enough to excuse my engaging with some warmth in the defense of the unfortunate young lady who is now your servant when you shall know that she is the niece of the earl of  and that it is her firm attachment to the religion she was brought up in which hinders her from succeeding to a very large estate and makes it necessary for her to go to service for a subsistence  this account brought tears into the eyes of the countess who inly applauded herself for her discernment in the favorable sentiments she conceived for henrietta before she knew who she was  the earl appeared moved and was beginning to ask his son some questions concerning this fair unfortunate when miss cordwain fetched a deep sigh and fell back in her chair  rage at this discovery of her rivals birth and extraordinary merit and terror left the scandalous accusation she had forged against her should end in her own disgrace operated so powerfully upon her spirits that she fainted away  while the countess supported her lord b  rang the bell very deliberately for assistance and the earl not much concerned at an accident which he imputed to a jealousy that proved her passion for his son took that opportunity to remind him that it was his interest to improve the affection this young woman had for him  the countess who had in vain searched her pockets for a smellingbottle ordered a servant who appeared at the summons of the bell to bring one off her toilet when mr cordwain entered the room and seeing his daughter in that condition made but one step from the door to the place where she sat exclaiming oh my child what ails my child is she dead  dont be alarmed said the countess it is only a fainting fit she will recover presently  lord b  who was ashamed to appear wholly inactive upon this occasion before his designed fatherinlaw had presence of mind enough to take a decanter of water from the sideboard and sprinkle some of it on miss cordwains face  this remedy was applied so successfully that she immediately opened her eyes but the first object they met had like to have closed them again for her father hearing a smellingbottle called for remembered that she always carried one or two about her and searching her pockets with trembling haste pulled out with a smellingbottle the bracelet which she had concealed there as a place where it was likely to be most secure being subject to no search but her own  the old man made none of those reflections upon this accident which were obvious enough to every one else but perceiving his daughter was beginning to recover presented the bracelet instead of the smellingbottle to her conceiving the former to be the best restorative  see child cried he in a transport i have found your bracelet  come you must be well now  i dont wonder you was grieved truly it would have been a great loss  miss cordwain flattered herself from the words i have found your bracelet that her father had had wit enough to save her from any reproach by giving some favorable turn to the discovery but in this she greatly overrated his abilities  and where do think i found it child pursued the old man even in thy own pocket as all the company can witness  very true said lord b  maliciously  was it found in my pocket said miss cordwain why then to be sure i pulled it off with my glove this morning and forgot it i protest i am sorry there has been so much noise made about it  it is a pity indeed said the countess considering who the person is that was supposed to have stolen it  o la papa cried miss cordwain you dont know that my maid henrietta is discovered to be a great lady upon my word it is true pursued she seeing him look surprised  i am sorry to hear that said the citizen rubbing his forehead for if she has friends who will support her she may commence a suit against me for scandalum magnatum and what a power of money may i lose  see what comes of your heedlessness girl i protest i dont know what to do  the countess though she was vexed at the vulgar sarcasm of the daughter was nevertheless desirous of freeing the old man from his uneasiness as well as to have an excuse for visiting the injured young lady  i am persuaded said she that miss courteneys delicacy will prevent her from seeking any public reparation for the affront she has suffered but i will see her myself and if necessary dissuade her from taking any resolution to your prejudice  lord b  who was talking to his father at distant window hearing this proposal approached and by a look which he gave the countess his mother seemed to bespeak her utmost tenderness and complaisance to the afflicted fair one  mr cordwain thanked her  for her kindness but odso madam  stopping her as she was  i  your ladyships pardon you must take the key up with you continued he eling in his pockets and at last pulling it out for when i came down i locked the door for fear the bird should fly away with these words he gave the countess the key smiling and nodding his head in applause of his own sagacity  the countess was extremely shocked to hear of this new indignity which the poor young lady had suffered but she dissembled her concern and silently withdrew  lord b  again stole to a window to hide his emotions and the earl though greatly disgusted with the behavior of both father and daughter yet approached them with a complaisant air and congratulated the  on the recovery of her jewel  thus did these noble persons accommodate themselves to the manners of those whom they in secret despised and for the sake of a few paltry thousands showed the utmost solicitude to associate plebean meanness in the honors of a noble ancestry and to give title rank precedence to one who would disgrace them all  chap xi henrietta returns to london  the countess who was greatly affected with the cruel usage henrietta had received could with difficulty restrain her tears when she entered the room where the fair prioner was confined that air of distinction which he had observed in her before she knew her rth seemed now more remarkable and made e humiliating condition to which she was reuced a subject of painful reflection to lady  ho approached her with a look of tenderness and pity and taking her hand  i scarce know how to speak to you said she about an affair that miss cordwain has much more reason to be ashamed of than you she has found her bracelet  henrietta was a little surprised at the kind and miliar manner in which the countess accosted her but still preserving that distant respect which was due from the character she had assumed to a lady of her rank she courtesied profoundly low and thanked her for the honor she did her in condescending to bring this grateful piece of news herself  i must tell you also said the countess that i am not ignorant of your name and family nor of your motives for submitting to go to service forwhich you deserve to be esteemed and admired by all the world it was my so that betrayed your secret pursued the lady observing that henrietta looked surprised  will not ask you now how you came to intru him with it some other time you shall if you please tell me all your story i have now on leisure to assure you that i am your since friend and that i will serve you with all the interest i have in any way you shall desire  henrietta after making a proper acknowledgment for this kind declaration told the counte that being determined to continue the way life she had entered into till her relations themselves thought proper to alter it the recommendation her ladyship had given her to  sister was the greatest service she could poss desire and would be ever most gratefully remembered  i admire your resolution said the countess but i am grieved to think you should be in a situation so unworthy of you something must be done to extricate you from it  i beg madam said henrietta that your ladyships kind concern for me may not lead you to take any steps in my favor with my relations no pursued she with some warmth their unnatural behavior to me deserves the neglect i show them in not soliciting their assistance i have already got over all those little passions and prejudices which might hinder me from being easy with my humble lot and i freely confess to you madam that i find a secret pleasure in the thoughts of mortifying the pride of my lord  when some accident for an accident it must be shall show him his niece in the quality of a servant  consent at least said the countess to my acquainting my sister with your birth that she may endeavor to place you in such a manner as will be most agreeable to you  i do not wish madam to be known to the person i serve replied henrietta and i desire to have no other consideration shown me than what my behavior in the station i am placed in shall merit  well said the countess it shall be as you would have it but i cannot express to you how much i esteem and admire you  you may judge of my good opinion of you when i tell you that as to what regards my sons passion for you i depend entirely upon your candor and generosity you know our views for him and this is all i shall say  i am obliged to you madam said henrietta for the confidence you repose in me i will endeavor to deserve it and now madam pursued she smiling since my imprisonment is at an end i will with your ladyships permission set out immediately for london the chaise i had hired is i suppose still waiting for me i hope to have the honor of presenting your letter to lady c  tomorrow or next day at farthest  take my kindest wishes along with you said the countess kissing her and taking a diamond ring from her finger wear this for my sake said she giving it to henrietta the intrinsic value of it is but small but i hope you will consider it as a mark of my esteem for you  the countess went out of the room as soon as she had spoke these words leave henrietta extremely affected with her kindness and all obstacles to her journey being now removed she hastened to the gate placed herself in her postchaise which she found waiting and in a few moments was out of sight  mean time the countess returned to her company and told mr cordwain smiling that he had nothing to fear from henriettas vindictive resolutions upon which miss cordwain said she would go up to her and make her an apology for what had happened but dinner was that moment served which made it not necessary for the countess to tell her that henrietta was gone in order to prevent her intended civility but as soon as a proper opportunity offered she took care to let the young lady know that her suspicions of henrietta were very ill grounded that she was perfectly virtuous and likely to remain in the obscure condition of a servant unless her relations who were persons of rank and fortune thought proper to do something for her  she added in order to remove all her uneasiness that she had recommended her to a lady who would procure her a place which was the least she could do for a young woman of her birth in such unhappy circumstances  miss cordwain was very well satisfied with what the countess had done being persuaded that since she was so desirous the treaty between lord b  and her should go forward that she would take care to hinder any thing from happening on the part of henrietta that might give her cause for disgust  but poor lord b  was in a truly pitiable situation he was in love with the person of henrietta and the fortune of miss cordwain and these different passions by turns equally possessed him so that it was impossible for him to form any fixed resolution  when he reflected on the solid advantages that would accrue to him from a marriage with the packers daughter such as being enabled to play as high at arthurs as my lord  to bring as many racehorses to new market as  to have as splendid equipages as the earl of  and several others which make the envy and emulation of many of our present race of nobles he was ready to sacrifice his inclinations to motives so just so reasonable so meritorious  but when the image of henrietta rose to h thoughts her person so lovely her manners  elegant her birth not beneath his own her virtu so eminent how could he think of putting su a treasure out of his reach by marrying her depicable rival and indeed so just were his notio of this treasure and so high his value of it that provided any method could be found to reconcile her to her aunt and secure to her the succession of her estate he would willingly have renounced his pretensions to miss cordwain and have married henrietta though her fortune as heiress of lady meadowss estate would be some thousands less than miss cordwains  such a proof of disinterestedness he thought must needs be very grateful to a young woman of henriettas fine understanding and enlarged sentiments and having brought himself to this point his next care was to procure a private interview with her that he might acquaint her with his designs and engage her concurrence with them  but this scheme being defeated by her sudden departure which he learned from his mother he was plunged into new perplexity and uneasiness he asked the countess with an air of indifference and unconcern where she was gone and how she intended to dispose of herself but that discerning lady who observed his sudden emotion at the news of henriettas departure would give him no other satisfaction than telling him that she supposed she would again go to service for she seemed to have no expectations of any savor from her relations  lord b  after a little reflection comforted himself with a hope that some accident or other would again throw her in his way and that the disgust she must necessarily entertain to a way of life so unworthy of her would induce her to embrace his honorable proposals for such he conceived them to be since all the sacrifice he should expect from her was a temporary compliance with her aunts inclinations with regard to religion but however he thought it would be prudent not to break off with miss cordwain because in her fortune he would always find wherewithal to comfort himself if he was disappointed in his love  in pursuance of this wise resolution he behaved in such a manner to that young lady as gave her no cause to be displeased with him so that every thing in this noble family and their designed allies was upon the same footing as before henrietta with mischiefmaking beauty came in the way  henrietta book the fourth chap i atheists have been but rare since natures birth till now sheatheists never appeared on earth ye men of deep researches say whence springs this daring character in timorous things who start at feathers from an insect fly a match for nothing  but the deity youngs universal passion mean time our fair heroine having performed her little journey without any unfortunate accident arrived late in the evening at the house of her friend mrs willis who in her astonishment at her sudden return asked her a hundred questions in a breath  henrietta satisfied her eager curiosity with a succinct detail of all that had happened to her that day which had indeed been a very busy one  the honest heart of mrs willis was variously affected with the different parts of her story she wept for her sufferings she execrated the malicious miss cordwain she praised the countess and was exceedingly solicitous about the purport of lord b  s designs which from what she had heard of his behavior appeared to her very mysterious but henrietta who had a thorough contempt for that young lord declared that although he should break with miss cordwain and address her upon honorable terms yet she could not bring her  to approve of him  he is mean said she and sordid in his temper his principles are bad he is a lord but he is not a gentleman and i am sure i could never esteem him besides the countess who is more alarmed about the sentiments he has for me than i think she has reason depends upon my honor not to encourage any overtures from him and i will not abuse her confidence  it is easy pursued she smiling to be just when our own inclinations do not oppose it i shall pretend to no merit in making this sacrifice if ever it be in my power to make it because in reality it will not be a great one if riches and splendour could have made me happy i would have married sir isaac darby for it was not his age that i objected to most but those qualities and manners which made his age contemptible  but surely my dear said mrs willis your gratitude would be engaged should lord b  in the present inequality of your circumstances make you an offer of his hand  not at all replied henrietta with some warmth no man has a right to the love or esteem of a woman on whom he has entertained dishonorable designs and failing in them offers marriage at last the lover who marries his mistress only because he cannot gain her upon easier terms has just as much generosity as the highwayman who leaves a traveller in possession of his money because he is not able to take it from him  well well my dear miss said mrs willis smiling i can collect this at least from the nice distinctions you make that your heart is absolutely free you would not reason so well were there any secret passion in the case  surely replied henrietta you do not imagine that i should become less delicate in my notions for being in love that passion like some plants derives its qualities from the soil it grows in for instance in lord b  it is mean selfish wavering  and what would it be in you interrupted mrs willis  ah no matter cried henrietta i am not in love yet and never will by with a man who has such sentiments as lord b  he had best be constant to miss cordwain plebean lords and the nobility of the shop and warehouse are equal matches  to this remark mrs willis who was pleased with the vivacity of her fair friend assented only with a smile for supper was now placed upon the table and as she knew henrietta had not dined she was extremely solicitous to make her eat and with the same maternal fondness hurried her soon to bed that she might recover the fatigue she had suffered during the day  the next morning at eleven o clock our fair heroine set out in an hackneyach for  square where lady d  hd to whom she was to deliver the recommendatory letter which the countess had given her  the lady was at her toilet when she read her sisters letter which henrietta had sent in to her and immediately ordered her admittance surprised at the elegant figure which met her eyes in the glass upon our fair heroines entering the room she hastily turned her head and gazed on henrietta so intently that she blushed which lady d  observing obligingly desired her to sit down and said she would talk to her presently  henrietta modestly placed herself at a distance but so luckily for the ladys curiosity that she could have a full view of her in her glass without renewing her confusion  my sister said lady d  breaking silence at last has mentioned you very advantageously mrs benson i wish it may be in my power to serve you  henrietta bowed respectfully  you are very young pursued the lady i suppose miss cordwains was the first service you ever lived in  at the word service henrietta blushed again and indeed the lady did not pronounce it without some hesitation for having a sensible and ingenuous mind she felt the impropriety of the term when used toward a person who notwithstanding the humility of her deportment had a dignity in her looks and air which commanded respect she took notice of this emotion and the more because she saw it endeavored to be suppressed and being desirous of gaining some further knowledge of her she asked her a hundred little questions which she thought would lead her to an explanation of her circumstances  henrietta avoided making a discovery of herself but answered in such a manner as without satisfying the ladys curiosity gave her a very good opinion of her candor and her sense but she was particularly struck with the graceful ease with which she talked and observed such a perfect politeness in her manners as persuaded her she was born in a much higher rank than her present situation allowed the probability of  lady d  s daughter now entered the room and asked her mamma if she desired to hear her take a lesson from her singingmaster that morning  the lady ordered the master to be admitted upon which henrietta rose up to go away but the lady told her with a benevolent smile that she should stay and hear miss d  perform and desired her to resume her seat  while the young lady was singing lady d  kept her eyes fixed on henriettas face and from the sweet expression in it collecting that she had a taste for music asked her if she had ever been taught  henrietta though not willing to make a display of talents which were not necessary to her present condition yet owned that she had a little knowledge of music  lady d  immediately desired to hear her sing and the young lady at the same time presenting her guitar to her she was obliged to comply her air her attitude the exquisite grace with which she touched the little instrument the sweetness of her voice and the sensibility in her fine eyes charmed lady d  who was an enthusiastic admirer of the art so that she cried out in a kind of transport mr minime would you not be proud of such a scholar  madam said the master bowing the young gentlewoman has a very pretty voice and manner to be sure but if miss d  applies closely to music for seven or eight years longer and does not suffer her mind to be distracted with the study of other sciences i shall have more reason to be proud of my scholar than any master in the world  this speech forced a smile from henrietta who the third time rose up to be gone upon hearing a female visiter announced but lady d  conceiving that she was not obliged to a strict observation of ceremony with the person that was now entering again insisted upon henriettas staying telling her she had thought of something for her and that she would acquaint her with it as soon as the lady was gone  henrietta had but just time to express a grateful acknowledgment of her kindness when the visiter was introduced she was a woman or a mean aspect but had a great deal of selfsufficiency in her air after the usual compliments were over she threw herself into an easy chair and examined henrietta with such extreme attention that she blushed  the lady who took consequence to herself from the power of throwing on ingenuous mind into confusion finding that henrietta was oppressed by her looks gazed at her the more earnestly and having indulged herself several minutes in this exertion of her superiority thought it was now time to make the poor bashful girl stare in her turn and began to display her wit and learning the former in an inundation of words that swallowed up her meaning and the latter in french words and phrases brought in to supply the deficiencies of her own native tongue  lady d  who was used to divert herself with the singularity of this womans character listened to her with complaisance but henrietta who began to conceive a very mean opinion of a lady who seemed to value herself so highly upon the knowledge of a language which was now become a part of every coblers daughters education beheld her with an indifference that sensibly wounded her pride and made her have recourse to other methods to impress her prodigious consequence upon her and since she could not make her stare at her learning she was resolved to make her wonder at her principles  you know lady d  said she abruptly i do not often go to church  i know it and i am sorry for it replied her ladyship  upon my word said she i have too much reverence for the deity to go to a place where it is ten to one but i shall hear him blasphemed  henrietta now began to stare indeed the wonderful lady proceeded  i never pretend to deny that i am a deist  you must pardon me mrs  interrupted lady d  if i tell you that i really think you often declare that very improperly i have heard you say so before your children and servants  madam replied mrs  i take care that my servants shall not think me an atheist they know my principles better they know i am a deist they have heard me declare that i believe there is an intelligent cause which governs the world by physical rules as for moral attributes there is no such thing it is impious and absurd to suppose it the arbitrary constitution of things in the human system produces happiness and misery that is to say misery and happiness is productive of  or rather as i said before the arbitrary constitution of things vice and virtue is necessarily produced by  that is necessarily brings on happiness or misery  prayer and such like artifices of religion is foolish for whatever is is right to talk of imitating god is blasphemy his providence is extended to collective bodies only he has no regard to individuals nor is the soul a distinct substance from the body there is no future state it is all a fiction to argue from unequal distributions is absurd and blasphemous whatever is is best the law of nature is sufficiently clear and there is no need of any supernatural revelation  i must entreat you madam interrupted lady d  seeing her eldest daughter that moment enter the room to change the discourse now miss has not been used to such deep reasoning on these aweful subjects and may perhaps mistake what you are saying for blasphemy  more absurd mistakes than that may be made madam replied mrs  when persons are not allowed to exercise their mental faculties  but your ladyship is going to dress  i interrupt you saying this she rose up and lady d  making no efforts to detain her took her leave  i have always hated that woman said miss d  as soon as she was gone ever since i heard her ridicule parental affection and call it brutual instinct  oh said lady d  laughing it would ill become one of her elevated understanding to have natural affections those she treats as vulgar prejudices her own sex are the objects of her scorn because they are subject to such weaknesses as tenderness and pity she reads seneca on friendship in the morning and exclaims o the exalted passion how divinely he treats it what noble sentiments in the afternoon she overreaches her friend and applauds her own wisdom epictetus is studied with great care she will preach a moral sermon out of epictetus that will last two hours epictetus teaches her to regulate her passions she reads him intently while her maid is combing her hair and closes her book to storm at the poor trembling creature for accidentally hurting her with the comb  chap ii in which henrietta makes a very fantastic distinction  henrietta could not help smiling at lady d  s satirical manner of exposing the follies of the lady who had just left the room but a female freethinker was in her opinion so shocking a character that she would much rather have seen it the object of abhorrence than mirth  lady d  put an end to her reflections for turning toward her mrs benson said she it is time to think of you now henrietta immediately rose from her seat  there is a lady of my acquaintance pursued lady d  to whom your accomplishments of singing and playing will make you a very acceptable companion and indeed i think it is a pity a young woman of your appearance and genteel education should remain in the condition of a servant which i am persuaded you was not born to  henrietta blushed which lady d  observing come said she smiling be ingenuous and confess that the proposal i have made you will suit you better than being a servant  indeed madam it does not replied henrietta i am extremely obliged to your ladyship for your kind intentions but i had rather be recommended to the lady as a servant than in any other character  you surprise me said lady d  after a little pause what objections can you have to a situation so much to be preferred to servitude  i am very sure madam said henrietta that i have not too much pride to be a servant since it is necessary i should be one but i am afraid i cannot so easily  a dependent  lady d  a little disappointed to find herself so far below this obscure young person in delicacy of sentiment answered gravely  well since it must be so i will serve you in your own way let me see you again a few days hence by that time i may possibly have heard of something for you  henrietta again politely thanked her ladyship and withdrew leaving lady d  and her daughter differently affected with her behavior in this last instance for young minds are apt to be struck with uncommon sentiments and to admire such as seem to possess them while persons advanced in years either from experience of the world or the natural depravity of the human heart ascribe every thing to affectation and design that contradicts certain received maxims in life  however henriettas peculiarity made lady d  extremely desirous to know who she was and whether there was any thing extraordinary in her circumstances she wrote to the countess her sister expressing her curiosity but that lady was resolved to keep henriettas secret as well in regard to the promise she had given her as because she really thought an unseasonable discovery of her true name and family would be disadvantageous to the plan she had laid  she therefore contented herself with telling her sister in her answer that mrs benson was a very deserving young woman who had been well brought up but by misfortunes in her family reduced to go to service  lady d  was satisfied with this account and when henrietta in obedience to her commands waited on her again she received her with great benevolence told her she had recommended her to a lady of great fortune whose place she believed would be an advantageous one and ordered her own woman to go with a message to the lady and introduce her  henrietta having a hackneycoach waiting lady d  s woman and her after some ceremonies which our fair heroine would gladly have dispensed with seated themselves in it and as soon as it drove from the door the abigail began  well madam you are certainly very fortunate mrs autumns place is one of the best in christendom you have nothing to do but to flatter her and you will gain her heart for ever  is the lady fond of flattery then said henrietta  oh immensely cried the other but for fear you should mistake and compliment her in the wrong place you must know and i think it is very lucky that i had an opportunity of instructing you you must know that though she is between forty and fifty years of age she affects to be thought extremely young and having been handsome in her youth as my lady says she forgets she is no longer so now she is old  now dear madam this is your cue be sure to praise her bloomy complexion and the brightness of her eyes and if she bids you guess how old she is as it is ten to one but she will some time hence dont exceed twenty years i charge you  the poor simple girl that lived with her last lost her place by saying when she asked her how old she believed her to be that she took her ladyship to be about the same age as her mother she was a vulgar creature to be sure you madam are in no danger of speaking so improperly but on certain occasions you may contradict her rudely and she will be the more pleased as for instance when she says she looks horridly tell her in a surly way as if you were vexed at her perverseness that you never saw her look so handsome  mighty well said henrietta smiling i perceive you are excellent in this art i am   oh no thanks dear madam interrupted lady d  s woman i am fond of doing good offices  i was going to say replied henrietta that i am afraid these wise documents will be thrown away upon me  i hope not said the other gravely come take courage you are but a young beginner these things come of  i should be sorry you were not capable of taking good counsel  they were now arrived at mrs autumns house lady d  s woman sent up word that she was come with the person her lady had recommended to her ladyship upon which both were ordered to go up stairs  they found the lady giving audience to millener a mantuamaker and a mercer several pieces of silk lay unrolled before he and a vast variety of ribbons lappets egret and other fashionable trifles were spread upon a table on which she leaned in a thoughtful posture as unable to determine her choice  when henrietta and her companion entere she raised her eyes and nodding familiarly lady d  s woman who approached he courtsying you find me excessively busy m echo said she well what has lady d  sent me  oh a goodlikely body pursued she looking at henrietta my compliments mrs echo and thanks  you see i have hardly time to speak to you  the young woman may stay i will talk to her presently  mrs echo withdrew and the lady resuming her contemplative posture gave henrietta an opportunity of considering her at leisure  if lady d  s woman had not fixed her age at somewhat more than forty she would have concluded her to have been older by the deep furrows in her face her fallen cheeks and the poor shrivelled hand that supported her head but her dress spoke her scarce fifteen a french fillet supplied the place of a cap and served to bind the few straggling hairs that graced her temples to a tete which was so loaded with hair that her head seemed to be of an enormous size the rest of her dress was suited exactly to the childish ornaments of her head and though no object could be more ridiculous yet henrietta beheld her with a serious concern for true benevolence compassionates those follies which unfeeling hearts sacrifice to mirth  mrs autumn at length rose up that must be the thing said she pointing to a pink and silver she then gave some directions to her millener and suddenly interrupting herself turned with a lively air to the mercer and asked him why he had not cut off the silk  your ladyship did not tell me how much you wanted replied the tradesman  lord i am the giddiest creature exclaimed mrs autumn this matter however was soon settled and the important business with the millener dispatched she dismissed her tradespeople and throwing herself with an affected air upon a settee ordered henrietta to come forward  i was afraid said she that lady d  who is very fond of seeing grave solemn faces about her had sent me some antiquated creature that would have frightened me but you seem to be a sprightly young body we shall agree very well i hope  henrietta courtesied  i hate old people pursued the lady they are generally obstinate and surly god help us we shall all be old if we live  but when one is in years ones self it is time enough to be plagued with the humors of those that are you will suit me extremely well  henrietta courtesied again  you are no talker i find said mrs autumn a little chagrined that the hints she had thrown out had produced nothing which could flatter her extreme desire of being thought young well there is no great harm in that i shall take you upon lady d  s recommendation as for terms   madam said henrietta who now for the first time opened her mouth they shall be whatever you think proper  very well said the lady we will talk no more about them then if you can find out how to please me which will be no difficult matter i assure you my place may prove a very advantageous one and the sooner you come the better  henrietta told her she was ready to come whenever she pleased upon which mrs autumn with the pretty impatience of youth asked her if it would be any inconvenience to her to come that very night  henrietta who was naturally obliging assured her it would not and was dismissed with a gracious smile for her ready compliance  mrs willis who had flattered herself that she should enjoy the company of her amiable friend for a few weeks at least was greatly disappointed when she found she was to lose her o soon and gently blamed her for being so prepitate  henrietta gave her the character of the lady she was going to live with and repeated what she had said to her you may be sure added she that i shall never please mrs autumn in the way she expects to be pleased flattery is always mean but to flatter solly is in my opinion criminal however i gladly embraced the first opportunity that offered to show my willingness to oblige though i would not flatter her you will hardly believe me perhaps said she smiling when i tell you that one of the greatest bars to my happiness in my present humble situation is the difficulty of pleasing without wounding my own delicacy and candor it is not easy to live well with our superiors and preserve our integrity but it is not impossible and if fail in that attempt i shall at least have this satisfaction that i suffer in the cause  virtue  it requires all that sweetness of temp which you possess said mrs willis  live with a woman of mrs autumns fantatick turn without being disgusted with  what an absurdity at fifty years to expect  be thought young and to imagine that  affecting the follies of youth she shall ha the bloom of it also our sex have been  preached with never cultivating our minds till we can no longer please by our persons but here is a woman who has not judgment enough to know when she ought to resign the hope of pleasing by her person take my word for it you will be very unhappy with her unless you resolve to accommodate yourself to her humor and sooth her in her ridiculous folly  that i will not do replied henrietta and since i have learned not to fear poverty my happiness will never depend upon others  mrs willis finding she could not prevail with her fair friend to alter her resolution acquiesced in it at length and henrietta taking an affectionate leave of her repaired to her new habitation  chap iii which shows henrietta in her new service where she acquits herself extremely ill  the lady being engaged with company when henrietta arrived she did not see her till late at night when she was summoned to undress her  come hither henrietta said she as soon as she entered the room i have seen lady d  since you was here  she has given me such an advantageous account of your understanding that i am resolved to make you my confidant  at the word confidant henrietta looked a little confused but the lady who did not observe her emotion reclined her head upon her hand and fixing her eyes on her glass to see how this pensive attitude became her  i am certainly pursued she sighing the most unfortunate woman in the world  benson if you would be happy never marry  i have no thought of marriage at present madam said henrietta  ah how i envy your freedom said the antiquated fair you are plagued with no unreasonable jealousy benson you will not be here long before you are a witness to my persecutions i wish i could conceal them but that is impossible  i am sorry madam said henrietta who was under a necessity of saying something in answer to this strange stuff to hear that you have any thing to make you uneasy  it does not signify exclaimed the lady with an emotion which she herself took to be real i shall be choked if i dont speak may i depend upon your prudence benson  but i know i may well then you must know there is a poor young fellow who pretends  but why do i say pretends  who is desperately  what shall i call it  who has an unconquerable invincible hopeless fatal dying passion for  for me in short is not this a shocking thing  indeed madam replied henrietta with great truth i pity you extremely  ay am i not greatly to be pitied child said the lady then the poor wretch cannot conceal his solly and it makes mr autumn so uneasy that really his temper is intolerable  pardon me madam said henrietta but i am not surprised that mr autumn is uneasy at such folly as you justly call it  why to be sure it is folly said mrs autum but then if one reflects a little  it is not folly neither  for love you know is an involuntary passion so that  but you have a very unfeeling heart benson and yet to judge by your looks you should have great sensibility pray have you never felt the tender passion  if you mean love madam replied henrietta indeed i cannot say i have  well you will be a happy creature said the lady sighing if you can always maintain this indifference but poor languish must not expect to meet with much compassion from you poor wretch continued she laughing i cannot help triumphing a little i have nicknamed him languish from his eternal sighing and the melancholy roll of his eyes mr autumn cannot endure to hear me call him by this name but i love to plague him a little now and then what signifies power if one does not show one has it yet he ought to be satisfied with me for what i did this evening when languish indiscreetly betrayed the violence of his passion by eagerly running though there were two gentlemen nearer to take up my glove which i had dropped i took no notice of the dying air with which he presented it to me but as if his touch had polluted it i received it haughtily from him and threw it aside sure this instance of disdain was enough to satisfy a jealous husband yet mine instead of looking pleased colored with jealousy and rage and gave me such furious glances however this will always be the case where there is so great a disproportion in age mr autumn is not less than forty but hey day is the girl asleep continued she looking at henrietta who stood fixed in thought for the absurd affectation of her mistress gave her matter enough for reflection come undress me mr autumn will wonder at my long stay and as he is ingenious in tormenting himself he will possibly suspect that i have been reading a letter from this rival of his but there he overrates his presumption he has not ventured to write to me yet his passion is only expressed in sighs and looks  henrietta made haste to obey her her patience being almost exhausted for mrs autumn had got on a subject which she knew not how to quit and her women being the only persons to whom she could utter these extravagancies without any danger of being mortified with sarcastick hints of age and such envious and unjust reflections she made herself amends with them for the reserve she was much against her will obliged to maintain with others  henrietta was at length ordered to wait on her to her chamber and soon after retired to her own greatly out of humor with her mistress and not a little displeased at herself to find that her philosophy by which she was enabled to bear the change of her fortune with patience and resignation could not guard her against fulness and disgust at the follies she was eed to be witness to  mrs autumn like other modern  lay in bed always till it was very late this being one of those happy expedients for killing time as the fashionable phrase is which to discover employs the inventions of persons of rank and fortune henrietta had attended three whole hours in her ladys dressing room in expectation every moment of being summoned to assist her to rise when mr autumn at length entered the room  his servant while he was dressing him had told him that his ladys new woman whom he had a glympse of as he passed by her on the stairs was the greatest beauty he ever beheld so that being curious to see her he came to breakfast with his wife that morning  henrietta rose up at his entrance mr autumn bowed looked at her attentively and thought his man had taste but he was still more struck with her noble air than the charms of her face and felt an uneasy emotion when he saw her continue standing with that humble respect which although it became her situation seemed little suited to the dignity of her appearance is not mrs autumn up madam said he not being able to forbear using that respectful style henrietta supposing he did not know her rank in his family replied  i expect my lady will ring every moment sir  pray let her know that i am come to breakfast with her said mr autumn  henrietta went immediately into her ladys chamber and finding her awake delivered her message  lord bless me said mrs autumn what new whim is this he does not use to invade my apartment in a morning i suppose he is come to teaze me with some of his jealous fancies well since it must be so order breakfast to be sent in and come to me directly  what a ridiculous woman is this thought henrietta as she went out of the room to torment herself at her age with the notion of her husband being jealous of her  the good lady when she returned charged her not to leave the room while they were at breakfast your presence said she may perhaps be some restraint upon him  she then slipped on a nightgown and went in a frightful dishabille to attend her complaisant spouse for she was one of those ladies who dress for every body but their husbands  henrietta was not sorry that she was directed to wait for she was extremely desirous of knowing whether her lady had any reason for the uneasiness she expressed mr autumns good humor and complaisance soon put that matter out of doubt but mrs autumn was resolved to persuade her maid that her husband was jealous and laughing affectedly cried  well dont be chagrined mr autumn but i protest i dreamt of poor languish last night  the husband shook his head winked at his wise and pointed to henrietta as if he had said dont expose yourself before your new servant  why how you frown now pursued mrs autumn i knew you would be angry lord what does it signify of whom one dreams one does not always think of the persons one dreams of i wish i had not told you  i wish you had not said mr autumn biting his lip with vexation at her folly the lady then lowering her voice as if she was not willing to be heard by henrietta though she took care not to make it impossible repeated trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ   you are well read in shakespeare madam said mr autumn who was willing to give another turn to the discourse  oh exclaimed she he has touched the passion of jealousy finely in his character of othello i think the moor was uneasy about a dream too  just then somebody tapped at the door henrietta opened it one of the footmen delivered a message from one lady enquiring how mrs autumn did and a sealedup card from another  while the servant was speaking mrs autumn called out what makes the fellow whisper in that manner as if the message he brings was a secret henrietta delivered her the card which she threw upon the table without opening it i am resolved said she to turn that blockhead away his mysterious manner is enough to put strange fancies into peoples heads  the strange fancies are all your own said mr autumn peevishly  i thought it would be so cried the lady you are out of humor what is this sealed up card the grievance come we will open it and you shall know the contents  indeed i will not said mr autumn rising i have not the least curiosity about the contents  good morning to you my dear i am going out  well benson said mrs autumn as soon as her husband had left the room is not this a comfortable life i live what a passion that poor man is in  was mr autumn angry madam said henrietta  to be sure he was said the lady did you not observe it  indeed madam replied henrietta mr autumn did not seem to me to be angry  no really said mrs autumn you have a great deal of penetration it must be confessed  you think you are very discreet now but you are mistaken however i charge you dont gossip among your companions about mr autumns unhappy jealousy i dont want the world to know what i suffer upon that account  i never will mention it madam to any body replied henrietta  nay for that matter said mrs autumn you might mention it without any bad intention by way of pitying me or so and perhaps i should not think the worse of you but if you can be silent benson you will oblige me reports of this kind you know should not be circulated  they never shall by me madam said henrietta  enough enough cried mrs autumn hastily i hate long speeches  henrietta was pleased with a declaration which enjoined her silence for if it be tiresome to listen to the sallies of affectation and impertinence it e much more so to be obliged to answer them  chap iv gives the reader hopes of a favorable change in the circumstances of our fair heresy  henrietta had exercised her patience for some weeks in the service of mrs autumn but every day producing new instances of her folly she resolved to quit her as soon as the countess came to town she conceived she was in some degree accountable to that lady for her actions since it was through her recommendation that she had been introduced to mrs autumn and she thought it neccessary for the justification of her conduct to have so considerable a witness of its being irreproachable  her lady though she found herself always disappointed in that complaisance to her whims which she endeavored to exact from her yet ventured to make her a proposal which her own want of delicacy hindered her from seeing the impropriety of  she had taken it into her head to try her supposed lovers constancy and therefore wrote a letter to him in the character of a lady unknown on whose heart he had made a deep impression but who was resolved not to discover herself till she knew whether his was wholly disengaged  this letter she doubted not would produce a declaration that would afford matter of great triumph to herself who she suspected was the secret object of his adoration  she acquainted her woman with her scheme and gravely desired her to copy the letter for languish she said knew her hand  henrietta blushed with surprise and shame at this improper request and very frankly begged to be excused from complying with it  what said mrs autumn a little confused you dispute my commands then  i never refused to obey any of your commands before madam replied henrietta but this pardon me madam appears so strange  you do not dare to suspect my virtue i hope said mrs autumn in a lofty accent  it does not become me madam said henrietta to censure your actions  no certainly replied the lady nor to refuse to do any thing that i order you to do but i would fain know if you in your great wisdom think there is anything improper in this little piece of gallantry  my opinion is of no consequence madam replied henrietta i only beg to be excused from copying it  well no more of the letter cried mrs autumn hastily perhaps i had only a mind to try your discretion perhaps too i shall like you the better for your steadiness  be modest and reserved and you will be sure of my approbation were you the best servant in the world you would not do for me unless you were extremely modest and now you know my mind be cautious how you behave modesty is a sure recommendation to my favor i can pardon any fault in my servant but want of modesty  henrietta from this declaration had reason to think herself pretty sure of her ladys favor for the severest prude that ever declaimed against the monstrous levity of her own sex could not have objected to the propriety of her behavior but unhappily for her she was that very day guilty of a fault by which she incurred very shocking suspicions for having neglected to ill her ladys smellingbottle with some fresh eau de luce mrs autumn declared that such heedlessness must necessarily proceed from her having her thoughts continually employed upon fellows and telling her that she could not endure such a creature in her sight ordered her to be gone immediately  henrietta did not think proper to offer any answer to this strange charge but quitting her presence immediately and her house a few moments afterward she returned to mrs willis who seeing her alight at her door eagerly flew to receive her  i have great news for you my dear miss said she i was this moment preparing to set out in a coach to bring you a letter which was left here by one of your uncles servants it is very true pursued she seeing henrietta looked surprised i asked the young man who he came from and he said the earl of  you may believe i am impatient to know the contents of this letter come my dear and read it i hope all your troubles are over now  henrietta receiving the letter from her which she took out of her pocket followed her into the parlour and breaking the seal  it is my uncles hand indeed said she and this is what he writes  mrs courteney is desired to call at the earl of  tomorrow morning at twelve oclock he has something to propose to her for her advantage  did i not tell you miss said mrs willis exultingly that the step you had taken would produce a favorable change in your fortune  dont be too sanguine in your expectations my dear mrs willis said miss courteney who knows but my uncle may have another sir isaac darby to propose to me however i will certainly wait upon him and if possible will be punctual to the hour he has prescribed me but if nothing should come of this overture of his lordships i shall be your guest again for some time i have left mrs autumn  she then related to her some circumstances of that ladys extravagant folly and the cause and manner of their parting which together with their comments on lord  s message furnished them with matter sufficient for discourse during the remainder of that day what happened to our fair heroine the next will be found in the following chapter  chap v destroys the expectations raised by the foregoing chapter  henrietta was at her uncles house exactly at the hour prescribed her and upon sending in her name was desired to walk into his lordships library  the earl was there to receive her he had with him two of his daughters but these young ladies withdrew immediately after saluting her in a very distant manner which she returned with equal reserve and coldness  miss courteney said his lordship as soon as they were alone i have been extremely angry with you for leaving your aunt in the strange manner you did  i am extremely obliged to your lordship replied henrietta for taking so much interest in any thing that concerns me  you certainly acted very indiscreetly said the earl but what is past cannot be helped you have had the good luck to make yourself friends notwithstanding this wrong step you have been at the countess of  s seat i hear  yes my lord answered henrietta i was there with   the countess is very much your friend interrupted his lordship hastily but her son is more so  henrietta blushed and was silent  i will not pursued his lordship examine into your motives for leaving lady meadows but i will if possible accommodate matters between you provided you will concur with me in my endeavors for that purpose  i desire nothing more earnestly than to be reconciled to my aunt replied henrietta  i believe it will be your own fault if you are not resumed his lordship and if you recover her savor your good fortune will not stop there  to keep you no longer in suspense then lord b  has declared a passion for you and has solicited my interest toward effecting a reconciliation between your aunt and you that he may pay his addresses to you in a proper manner  i am surprised that lord b  should make such a proposal said henrietta he is engaged to the daughter of a rich citizen  no not engaged replied the earl the match has been proposed and he has visited the young woman  indeed my lord replied henrietta the affair is much further advanced  well well interrupted his lordship we will suppose that the writings are drawn and every thing settled but they are not married nor engaged neither  his inclinations you find have taken another turn you have no reason to blame him for this i am sure and it would be strange indeed if a man of his rank and fortune was to mind the censures of the vulgar  henrietta was silent his lordship proceeded  lord b  will find it difficult no doubt to prevail upon the earl to break off this treaty and consent to his marrying you though lady meadows should offer to make you her heir because in that case your fortune would be greatly below that of this citizen whom he has chose for him nevertheless he does not despair of effecting this provided your aunt will do for you what it was expected she would before you was so unhappy as to disoblige her in this lord b  sufficiently shows the sincerity and ardor of his passion it is your part now to convince him that you are not ungrateful  what would your lordship have me to do said henrietta  i would have you submit to your aunt said the earl and regain her affection if possible lord b  has reason to expect this compliance from you  i will do every thing i ought to do replied henrietta to recover my aunts favor and this without any view to lord b  offers  well we shall not examine too nicely into that matter interrupted his lordship smiling all that remains to be done is this i will see lady meadows myself she will  in town soon i suppose lord b  s proposal which i will acquaint her with w captivate her attention and be your best justification as for what little concessions s may expect from you i shall leave them  be settled by yourselves  there are certain concessions however said henrietta which it is impossible for  to make and which if my aunt insists up as the necessary conditions of a reconciliation between us i must still continue under  displeasure and hazard all the consequences of it  i am afraid you are going to say some silly thing or other interrupted his lordship rising from his seat which motion henrietta understanding as a hint for her to hasten her departure rose also  i will detain your lordship no longer said she than just to tell you that some time ago my aunt proposed to me to settle all her fortune upon me provided i would embrace the roman catholic religion  a noble offer upon my honor said his lordship and did you refuse it  would your lordship have had me accept of it said henrietta  what signifies what i would have had you do replied the earl peevishly what did the consideration of your own interest suggest to you  to refuse it my lord answered henrietta and i did so  i find you are a very romantic girl said his lordship i am resolved to trouble myself no more about your affairs  i hope it will not be imputed to me as a crime said henrietta that i could not be bribed to change my religion  change your religion repeated the earl what necessity was there for your changing your religion you might have humoured the old woman have gone with her to mass and conformed to some of her superstitious ceremonies and be a good protestant in your heart notwithstanding the world knowing your motives would have commended you for such a prudent conduct  i see there is nothing to be done with you pursued he after a little pause for the sake of the unfortunate man who was your father i would have been glad to have seen you well married but lord b  is not such a fool as to take you without a fortune and as you cannot reasonably have any expectations but from lady meadows who has no children and may leave her fortune to whom she pleases without doing any body injustice you know best whether it is worth your while to make a proper submission to her or not  i will never make an improper one said henrietta  to be sure said his lordship your own wisdom is to be judge of that  no my lord replied henrietta you shall if you please be judge  if my conscience   pray let me hear nothing about your conscience interrupted the earl it is not my business to let matters even between you and your conscience your aunts popish confessor who is likely to be her heir is skilful in those things yet i would not advise you to consult him neither for he is an interested person but remember that you may either secure to yourself a good estate and marry a very deserving young nobleman or continue in the obscurity and want your father left you in which is all the legacy he bequeathed you think well of this and then let your conscience determine i do not advise you to do any thing against it  my resolution is already fixed said henrietta my conscience will neither permit me to change my religion nor to counterfeit a change of it  do you insinuate by that said his lordship hastily that i advised you to do either the one or the other  my aunt already knows my mind said henrietta evading a question which she could not answer truly without offending him i have nothing to hope for from your lordships interposition unless she has been pleased to give up this point and i shall cheerfully return to that poverty my father bequeathed me since with it he bequeathed me piety and virtue  it is a pity he did not leave you prudence also said the earl who found something very provoking in this last speech you would not then have disobliged your aunt by you scandalous elopement from her which ha reduced you to the miserable condition you are now in so that your friends know no how to take notice of you  friends my lord replied henrietta rising in her temper i have no friends i have only relations  that is likely to be their misfortune sai his lordship who was very angry at this sarcasm your undutifulness to your aunt makes you unworthy of the notice of your relations and i declare to you plainly that from the moment i will never concern myself abo you  henrietta disdained to make any answer this unjust and cruel speech but courtefied silence and withdrew leaving the earl very well satisfied with himself for the tender and parental part he had acted toward his brothers daughter and furnished with excellent reasons for never seeing her more  i had provided a match for her said he that very evening to an humble friend who he knew would not fail to spread the report not unworthy of a daughter of my own she rejected my proposal she refused to make any submission to her aunt whom i would have prevailed upon to be reconciled to her let her suffer the consequences of her obstinacy and folly i have done all that i ought to do and am justified to the world  his lordship forgot to add that the submission which was expected from her was nothing more than the change of her religion and the match she so obstinately refused could not be effected without she purchased a fortune by an impious hypocrisy nevertheless the omission of these trifling circumstances gave such a color to henriettas behavior that she was considered by all who heard her uncles account of it as an unhappy young creature who would ruin herself and be the blot of a noble family  as for our fair heroine she foresaw that her uncle would justify his neglect of her at her expense she had every thing against her rank fortune power that general prejudice which prevails against the unfortunate and that as general servility which adopts the passions of the great but these reflections filled her with no uneasy apprehensions for there is this advantage in virtue that it is sufficient for itself and needs not the applause or support of others its own consciousness is its best reward  chap vi in which lord b  shows himself a true modern lover  henrietta before she went home waited upon lady d  to acquaint her that she had left mrs autumn she avoided mentioning that ladys peculiarities which had made it impossible to please her but with great simplicity related the error she had been guilty of and the suspicions she had incurred by it which occasioned her dismission  lady d  diverted herself for some time with the extreme delicacy of her whimsical friend and then told henrietta that having still a good opinion of her prudence and modesty notwithstanding the reasons mrs autumn had to suspect her she would place her about a young lady a relation of her own  henrietta thanked her in very respectful terms and took her leave after she had at lady d  s desire left her a direction to her lodgings that she might know where to send for her when it was necessary  at her return she found the faithful mrs willis full of anxious impatience to hear the success of her visit to the earl henrietta through respect to her uncle concealed the greatest part of his discourse to her but owned that she had no expectations from him  mrs willis shrugged up her shoulders then it was as you suspected said she your uncle has proposed some absurd match to you and you have forfeited his future favor by not complying with it  you will be surprised to hear that lord b  has made an application to my uncle said henrietta  surprised repeated mrs willis why to be sure considering how your affairs are circumstanced this is a generous way of proceeding well i hope you begin now to have a favorable opinion both of his love and honor  i am sure i think highly of his prudence replied henrietta smiling only mark the caution with which he acts in this affair my poverty gave him hopes that i should be an easy conquest and that passion which first manifested itself in an open attempt upon my honor sought afterward to allure me with bribes it is not strange that persons who hold money to be the greatest good should think it more than an equivalent for virtue here however he was disappointed again to his great astonishment no doubt and marriage is this honorable lovers last resource but this he does not offer till he is sure i shall have a fortune if not equal to that of my rival the packers daughter yet at least sufficient to justify his choice in  opinion of the prudential part of the world and perhaps he expects i should purchase the mighty blessing of his hand by the sacrifice the temporary sacrifice at least of those principles for which i have already suffered so much  have you any reason for this shocking suspicion interrupted mrs willis  i think i have replied henrietta a reconciliation with my aunt is it seems a necessary preliminary to his addresses and yet he heard from myself upon what condition that reconciliation could only be effected henrietta suddenly interrupting herself cried out there he is there is lord b   where where said mrs willis running to the window it is certainly he said henrietta he passed by in a chair  that instant they heard a loud rap at the door  as i live cried mrs willis in a violent flutter he is come to visit you i hope you will see him miss courteney hear what he has to say pray do there can be no harm in that i am sure  well well said henrietta smiling at her solicitude i will see him let him be shown into the other parlour if you please  mrs willis curious to see this young lord went herself to open the door he bolted out of the chair and with a look and accent full of impatience asked her if the young lady that lodged there was at home  miss courteney sir said mrs willis  yes replied he hastily is she at home can i see her pray tell her a gentleman from  enquires for her  mrs willis desired him to walk into the parlour said she would acquaint the young lady with his being there and a few moments afterward henrietta appeared  lord b  flew to meet her with the air of a lover conscious of the right he had to be well received and taking her hand which he respectfully kissed  now cried he exultingly can you doubt the ardor of my passion for you and will you not at length confess that it is possible for a man to deserve you  certainly my lord replied henrietta it is very possible  may i perish if i think so said he but how poorly would words express my adoration of you judge of the purity the ardor of my love by what i have done to make you mine  have you not seen your uncle miss courteney  i have my lord replied henrietta  you have repeated his lordship and in that grave cold accent too surely my sentiments and designs are still unknown to you it is impossible else that you should be thus insensible nay ungrateful i will say  for i have given no common proofs of love i think  indeed my lord replied henrietta who had a mind to teaze this generous lover a little you shall not suffer for your noble disinterestedness  you shall not relinquish miss cordwain and her immense fortune for me  name not her fortune cried lord b  were it millions i would refuse it for you  nay now your lordship is quite romantic said henrietta to prefer to a rich heiress an unhappy young woman deserted by her relations and reduced to seek a subsistence by her labor  call not my passion romantic interrupted lord b  because it soars above common conceptions a mind so elevated as yours might give it a juster epithet  were my aunt pursued henrietta to leave me her whole estate you would still make no inconsiderable sacrifice by quitting miss cordwain for me since my fortune would then be greatly inferior to here is but you know my lord i have no expectations from lady meadows i have declared to my uncle the hard conditions upon which she offers to make me her heir conditions that i never will accept of and therefore i may well call your passion romantic when under such circumstances you could think of making an application to my uncle  to be sure madam said lord b  whose countenance expressed at once surprise confusion and disappointment  i did apply to the earl not personally indeed i contrived it so that a friend of mine who is very intimate with his lordship should give him a hint of your situation and the sentiments i entertained for you and from the account my friend gave me of his success in his negotiation i conceived that you might be prevailed upon  that is that you would consider  for might i not hope my dear miss courteney that you would not be insensible of my affection  here his lordship paused and looked on henrietta with a languishing air seeming to wish and expect that her tenderness would spare him a further explanation but our fair heroine who did not choose to collect his meaning from the abrupt and inconnected sentences he had uttered continued maliciously silent as if she waited for the end of his discourse  i see resumed he that i have not been happy enough to inspire you with any tender sentiments for me pardon me miss courteney but i must be so free as to tell you that if you were not prepossessed in favor of another person the proofs i have given you of my affection would not be received with such indifference  there needs not any such prepossession replied henrietta vexed at this hint to make me receive with indifference the proofs you have hitherto given me of that affection your lordship boasts of am i to reckon among these proofs my lord the insult you offered me at mrs eccless and the strange declaration you made me in the country  ah how cruel is this recapitulation now cried lord b  do i not do justice to your birth your beauty and virtue by my present honorable intentions  it is not enough for me my lord said henrietta that your intentions are honorable now to have merited my esteem they should always have been so but to speak plainly i am still doubtful of your intentions  doubtful still of my intentions repeated lord b  have i not declared them to your uncle madam have i not solicited his interest with you  suppose that obtained my lord said henrietta and that it has all the weight with me you could wish  why then we shall be happy my angel cried he taking her hand and pressing it to his lips you will be reconciled to your aunt and i may hope for my fathers consent to our union  a reconciliation with my aunt is impossible said henrietta withdrawing her hand  say not that it is impossible replied lord b  but that you have not complaisance enough for me to attempt it  did i not know it to be impossible resumed henrietta i would attempt it for my own sake but nothing less than the sacrifice of my religion will satisfy my aunt on this condition indeed she promises to settle her whole estate upon me i think i once told your lordship so  you did my dear miss courteney interrupted lord b  and i adore you for your steady adherence to your principles  henrietta was a little startled at so unexpected a declaration but lord b  did not suffer her to remain long in the error his last words had occasioned  if lady meadows was not such a bigot pursued he excuse my freedom miss we might expect that she would receive my proposals with pleasure and make such concessions in favor of her niece as might engage my fathers consent to our marriage but since this is hopeless is it reasonable that you should be the victim of her obstinacy by seeming only to comply with your aunts desires all obstacles to our union will be removed a temporary compliance is all that is necessary to secure to you a fortune and a rank in life suitable to your birth do not imagine that i wish to see you a proselyte to the religion she professes no if any thing could weaken my passion your being capable of such a change upon interested motives would do it i love you i repeat it again i love you for your piety  then to be sure my lord replied henrietta you think that a little dissimulation in this case would be a virtue  in your circumstances resumed lord b  it certainly would for while your principles are unchanged what do you sacrifice in yielding to your aunt but externals only this sacrifice your interest your happiness demands of you let me add also that you owe it to a man who loves you with the ardor i do and surely to industriously seek occasions of suffering for a religion which if you could be contented with secretly professing you would be happy yourself and make others happy also is to give the world reason to suspect that ostentation has a greater share in your resolves than piety therefore my dear miss courteney you see it is not the sacrifice of your religion that i require of you but of the reputation of suffering for it  well my lord replied henrietta who had listened to him with great calmness if ever i was in doubt of your intentions you have clearly explained them now of them and of the sentiments you have avowed you may collect my opinion when i declare to you that if you had worlds to bestow on me i would not be your wife  is this your resolution miss courteney said his lordship  it is my lord she replied a resolution justifiable upon your own great principle interest it is my interest i consult when i prefer poverty and servitude to the fortune my aunt can give me because the silent testimony of a quiet conscience is in my opinion of infinitely more value than riches it is interest by which i am influenced when i refuse your offered alliance because i am sure i could not be happy with a man whom i cannot esteem  hold madam hold interrupted lord b  this is too much i have not deserved this treatment but i thank you for it yes from my soul i thank you for it it has helped to restore my senses i have been foolish very foolish i confess  his lordship indeed looked foolish enough when he pronounced these words which were succeeded by a pause of several minutes then suddenly starting from his seat and bowing with an affected negligence  the best apology i can make madam said he for the importunate visit i have paid you is to assure you i never will repeat it  henrietta courtefied gravely without answering him and having rung the bell for a servant to attend him to the door went into the room where her friend was sitting lord b  stopped looked back and finding she had withdrawn he rushed out hastily and flung himself into his chair glad of his escape and congratulating himself upon the victory he had gained over his passion for in the first emotions of his grief at parting he had almost resolved to declare he would marry her without any fortune but her disappearing so suddenly gave him time for a moments reflection and that was sufficient to hinder him from being guilty of an imprudence which he now trembled at the thoughts of  it is so difficult for mean and selfish persons to conceive that any thing but private advantage can influence the resolutions of others that notwithstanding the proof henrietta had given of her attachment to her religion and her inviolable regard to truth yet still lord b  supposed there must be some other latent motive for a conduct in his opinion highly ridiculous and very inconsistent with that good sense which it was apparent she possessed  sometimes he fancied he had a rival and then to clear a doubt so tormenting he was upon the point of returning to her to offer her his hand upon her own conditions but his avarice restrained him from making so dangerous a trial she might accept his offer and with all the passion he felt for her he could not resolve to marry her without a fortune  to stifle a thought which suggested to him designs so destructive to his interest he endeavored to persuade himself that her obstinacy in refusing to temporize a little when such mighty advantages were in view was the effect of female vanity which sought distinction at the expense of solid happiness in this opinion he was confirmed by his friend whom he had employed to sound the earl her uncle with regard to his proposals and to whom he now communicated the result of his interview with henrietta  depend upon it said this sagacious person your goddess will descend from her romantic flights when she finds she has almost soared out of human ken and is much more likely to be laughed at for her extravagant folly than admired and applauded for her extraordinary piety follow my advice pursued he suffer your mistress to believe you have broke her chains if interest does not make her wish to recall you vanity will few women can endure that a lover should escape them and to recover their influence they often make concessions which in the zenith of their power they would have thought impossible  lord b  improved a little upon his friends scheme and resolved to continue his addresses to miss cordwain to pique henrietta he said but in reality he was as much in love with the fortune of that young lady as with the person of our fair heroine and was not willing to hazard the loss of the one while it was yet doubtful whether he should ever possess the other  chap vii which concludes the fourth book of this history  henrietta having acquainted mrs willis with what had passed in her interview with lord b  the good woman who ha flattered herself that the affair would have end more happily though more honorably it could not for her fair friend conjured her with tears of anxious tenderness not to think  going to service again but to allow the countess whom her conduct with regard to her so must necessarily oblige very highly to empl her good offices with lady meadows in her vour that a reconciliation might be effected without those shocking conditions which had at first been proposed to her  if i thought such an application would be successful replied henrietta i would readily consent to it for you may easily imagine my dear mrs willis that this low condition is not my choice but i know my aunts temper whatever she desires she desires with ardor and makes a merit at persisting obstinately in a resolution she has once formed her pride will be a more powerful advocate for me than any thing the countess can urge to that i formerly owed my deliverance from dependence more mortifying than servitude this pride will no doubt be sensibly wounded when she finds that i am determined in my choice if any thing can make her recede from her purpose it will be the shame of seeing her niece reduced so low but surely it is not the way to convince her i am really determined if i allow my friends to teaze her with solicitations when she has already declared her resolution in such strong terms she will believe that i have engaged them to make this trial she will be offended with their interposition and perhaps be the less inclined to raise me from this obscure condition as she will not have the merit of doing it from her own generosity and tenderness but at the instances of others time only my dear mrs willis can produce any favorable change in my circumstances it will either soften the hearts of my relations or it will blunt my sense of the meanness of my condition by familiarizing me to it this i am sure of at least that in the consciousness of doing right i shall always find an unfailing source of happiness however providence may think fit to dispose of me  ah never doubt but you are the care of providence my dear miss cried mrs willis such virtue and piety must sooner or later be happy heaven and your own prudence direct you  i have not always been prudent said henrietta sighing but misfortunes as you once told me teach us wisdom  mrs willis observing an unusual pensiveness stealing over the sweet features of henrietta or this reflection changed the discourse to a less interesting subject and employed her utmost assiduity and tenderness to make the time she stayed with her pass agreeably  a week being elapsed and no message coming from lady d  henrietta began to apprehend that she should be disappointed of a place in which she expected more satisfaction than she had found in those she had hitherto been in when she was surprised with a visit from the countess of   she flew to receive her with a respectful joy the lady tenderly pressed her hand   i had business in the city said she and i took this opportunity to call on you  and how do you do my dear good girl pursued she have you any agreeable news to tell me has your family relented yet  i have no reason to think they have madam replied henrietta  shocking insensibility exclaimed the countess lifting up her eyes you have been very ill used too by mrs autumn my sister tells me  henrietta smiled but was silent  well miss courteney resumed the countess will you come and live with me as my friend and companion i know your generous scorn of dependence but it is the unworthiness of the donor only that can make benefits sit heavy on a mind like yours there is often as much greatness of soul in receiving as in conferring benefits and when true friendship is the motive for giving it is pride not generosity to refuse  do me the justice to believe madam replied henrietta that i receive this instance of your goodness with the deepest gratitude but there is   i understand you interrupted the countess  my son but i hope when he is married you will have no objection to living with me as my friend  the countess in speaking these words looked earnestly on henrietta  no certainly madam cried she eagerly i shall think myself happy in living with you in any situation  i know not what to think of my sons conduct in this affair resumed the countess every thing is settled between my lord and the young ladys father but he still finds pretences to delay the match her eyes as she pronounced these words seemed to demand a explanation of henrietta  i am afraid madam replied she that have been partly the cause of these delays  that is heartily said interrupted t countess have you seen my son lately  i have madam answered henrietta but your ladyship may be entirely easy  easy repeated the countess why do you imagine that i am so insensible of your merit  but you know my good girl lord b  is in honor engaged to miss cordwain  his lordships partiality for me said henrietta has induced him to carry this matter further than as he is circumstanced i think he should have done he has caused my uncle to be applied to but this has produced nothing madam i told lord b  upon what conditions my aunt had offered to settle her estate upon me and his lordship is convinced that i cannot comply with them my resolution is fixed my lord b  knows it is so and you have nothing to fear madam from any imprudence on his side or any ungenerosity on mine i ventured to promise that i would deserve the confidence you was pleased to place in me on this occasion and i hope i have and shall continue to deserve it  notwithstanding the delicate manner in which henrietta stated the affair between her and lord b  yet the countess discovered that her son had shown more prudence than generosity or even love in his behavior and by a strange contradiction in the human heart she at once approved and condemned was pleased with yet ashamed of his conduct but charmed with henriettas noble disinterestedness her candor and sincerity she embraced her with the tenderness of a mother and perhaps with the more tenderness because she was not likely she should not be her mother  i am impatient said she till i can have you with me that i may have it in my power to show you how greatly i both love and esteem you  henrietta thanked her with great politeness and then told her of lady d  s intentions to recommend her to a young lady a relation of here is  oh miss belmour you mean said the countess my sister mentioned it to me she is an agreeable young woman has a very good fortune and is entirely mistress of herself she will be much better pleased to receive you in the character of a companion that a servant when she knows your birth and merit  i will owe obligations of that kind to non but yourself madam replied henrietta and i beg this young lady may know no more of me than what is just necessary to recommend me to her good opinion as a servant  the countess contested this point with her for some time but finding her not to be dissuaded from her design well said she kindly you shall be indulged this once but remember i claim your promise to come to me when a certain objection is removed in the mean time we will settle you with miss belmour in the way you choose she will be with my sister tomorrow morning and if you come likewise lady d  will introduce you to her  henrietta said she would not fail to attend lady d  upon which the countess rose up kissed her at parting and desired she would look upon her as one of her most faithful friends  our fair heroine had reason to be satisfied with the kind manner in which lady d  recommended her to miss belmour as well as with the reception that young lady gave her she carried her home with her in her coach and behaved to her with an affability that henrietta could no otherwise account for than by suppossing the countess had discovered her true name and circumstances to her  in this however she was mistaken her young mistress was in love she had occasion for a confidant henriettas youth and gentleness promised her she would be an indulgent one besides her good sense and the elegance of her person and behavior so lessened the distance between the mistress and servant that her pride was not wounded by the familiarity with which she condescended to treat her as the necessary prelude to the confidence she was resolved to repose in her  henrietta listened with complaisance to the overflowings of a heart tender by nature and wholly possessed as she thought by a deserving object but when miss belmour in the course of frequent conversations on this exhaustless theme gave her to understand that this lover of whom she boasted was the husband of another lady from whom he had been parted several years surprise horror grief were so strongly impressed on her countenance that her lady began to repent of a confession she had made it full confidence that her sentiments whatever they were must needs be approved by her servant  but it being now useless as well as dangerou to retract what she had said she was under  necessity of submitting to the mortifying a of defending her conduct to one whole duty well as interest she had a moment before coceived it to be to acquiesce in or rather appla all she did  she began with telling henrietta that mr campley had when very young been forced by an avaricious father to marry a woman whom he could not love and with whom he had been so miserable that a separation was agreed to by the relations on both sides  henrietta sighed sympathetically at this account miss belmour encouraged by this mark of her sensibility proceeded with great fluency of language to expatiate on the resistless power of love her lovers sophistry had furnished her with arguments to prove that the marriage he had been forced into was not binding in the sight of heaven and that he was at liberty to bestow his affections elsewhere she treated marriage as a mere human institution adopted the sentiments of eloisa talked of a union of hearts eternal constancy generous confidence  henrietta heard her with patience but being out of breath at last she stopped and seemed to expect a reply  our fair heroine with all the humility becoming her station but at the same time with all the ness of virtue opposed the specious arguments she had urged with others which reason religion and the purity of her own sentiments suggested to her these however made very little impression on miss belmour she yawned smiled contemptuously and was several times ready to interrupt her with an authoritative air but refrained from the consideration that her woman was now by the participation of her secret become her companion if not something more  henrietta despairing to rescue her unhappy mistress by motives of piety from the snares that were laid for her sought even to interest her passions in the cause of virtue  you depend madam pursued she upon your lovers constancy but what security can you have that he will be constant  what security interrupted miss belmour roused to attention by so interesting a question his vows  these vows madam said henrietta will expire with the passion that caused them he will be constant as long as he loves but how long he will love is the doubt  i am really vain enough to imagine replied miss belmour bridling that those few attractions i have received from nature since they have gained will fix his heart i am quite free from any apprehensions of that sort i can assure you  you have charms madam said henrietta that entitle you to a worthier conquest than of a man who not having it in his power to marry you yet dishonourably seeks to ensnare your affections  it is natural to wish to be beloved by those we love replied miss belmour i am convinced mr campley loves me  if he loved you sincerely madam said henrietta he would not make you unhappy true love never seeks the ruin of its object disinterestedness is the test of love try mr campleys by that  mr campley has no mean selfish designs upon my fortune cried miss belmour  his designs are mean and selfish in the highest degree replied henrietta since he expects that to make him happy you should sacrifice your peace your honor and your reputation and should he succeed in these designs which heaven forbid the neglect he will soon treat you with will convince you that love when not founded on esteem cannot be lasting for the contempt which even libertines feel for those whom they have seduced is a proof of that secret homage which all men pay to virtue  if i thought mr campley would ever fail in the respect and adoration he pays me now said miss belmour i should hate him  the only way to preserve that respect madam replied henrietta is not to allow him to encourage any presumptuous hopes if you wish to keep his heart engage his esteem he may one time or other perhaps be at liberty to offer you his hand  ah henrietta interrupted miss belmour sighing that time is very distant i fear but you have put strange thoughts into my head i have been to blame to suffer mr campley to talk to me so freely of his passion indeed i think he has been less respectful since i suffered him to perceive that i presered him to all the men i ever saw i own to you freely that it was my apprehensions of losing him that made me listen to his arguments for i thought if i reduced him to despair he would conquer his passion for me but what if the very means i have used to keep his heart should prove the cause of his slighting me  oh you do not know what anxious uneasy doubts you have raised in my mind  however i am resolved to behave with more reserve to him for the future i will try whether his passion is strong enough to subsist of itself for you have convinced me that the hopes with which i have hitherto fed it have been less likely to nourish than to cloy  henrietta would have been better pleased if sentiments more pure had suggested this design but it was a great point gained to prevail with her on any terms to discourage the addresses of a man whose love was a crime she flattered herself likewise that this unexpected severity in miss belmour would produce an alteration in her unworthy lovers behavior which might favor her views of exciting her resentment against him and in this she was not mistaken  mr campley thought fit to be offended at the new plan of conduct miss belmour had laid down for herself and complained of it at first with that mixture of haughtiness and submission which a man who is sure he is beloved thinks he has a right to use but finding this had not the effect he desired he had recourse to a personated indifference in order to alarm her with the fear of losing him  henrietta whom she acquainted with every change in his behavior told her that this was the time to humble her imperious lover you must either give him laws madam said she or be contented to receive them of him his aim was to degrade you to a mistress he will love you you see upon no other condition  i see it i see it plainly interrupted miss belmour bursting into tears where is now that aweful love he professed for me when a look a smile was a sufficient reward for all his sufferings  dear henrietta tell me what i shall do to show him how much i hate and despise him  avoid him madam as much as possible replied henrietta when you happen to meet him in company suffer him not to speak to you apart and receive no letters from him persist in this conduct and you will convince him that you are resolved not to purchase the continuance of his affection by the sacrifice of your honor if he is capable of a sincere and generous passion he will esteem and reverence that virtue which opposes his desires and his esteem will strengthen his love  yes cried miss belmour he shall find that he is not so sure of me as he has the presumption to imagine i will tell him so myself and see him again but it shall be only to declare that i will never see him more  give me pen and ink my dear henrietta i will appoint him a meeting at lady d  s this evening and while the company is engaged at cards i shall have an opportunity to tell him the resolution i have formed and doubt no but i will speak to him in the severest term my resentment can suggest he shall know to his confusion that i am in earnest  indeed madam said henrietta that is not the way to persuade him that you are in earnest let your actions speak for you shun him carefully and then he must be convinced that you do not feign  i have thought of a way to torment him said miss belmour after a little pause i will go to paris last year some ladies of my acquaintance proposed to me to go there with them and i had almost consented but the wretch who braves me so insolently now declared then that he could not support my absence and seemed so overwhelmed with grief that i put off my journey for that time but now were he to offer to stab himself at my feet it should not alter my purpose i will write to him this moment and let him know my design  let me entreat you madam said henrietta not to do that go first and write to him afterward  and yet i could recommend a better way of punishing this insolent lover  tell me what better way cried miss belmour eagerly  it is to marry madam replied henrietta choose out of that crowd of lovers who address you him whom you think most deserving marriage will secure your peace your honor and reputation and effectually punish the man who made the sacrifice of all these the necessary condition of his love for you  this expedient was not at all approved of by miss belmour she declared she hated the whole sex for mr campleys sake and henrietta had no difficulty to believe her however she prevailed with her to promise that she would keep her intended journey secret till she was just ready to depart that it might not seem as if she meant only to alarm her designing lover this promise she observed so ill that she declared that very day at lady d  s her intention to spend a few months in paris mr campley who was there and who still kept up his assumed indifference instead of endeavoring to alter her purpose as she expected coldly congratulated her on the pleasures she would enjoy in that enchanting metropolis miss belmour came home ready to burst with rage and disappointment  i knew how it would be madam said henrietta if you talked of your design mr campley thinks he sees through the artifice of it all you can do now is to hasten your departure  i am resolved i will set out tomorrow morning said miss belmour no matter for preparations pack up a few necessaries to take with us in the coach and leave directions for my trunks to be sent after when we come to dover if there is not a packetboat ready to sail i will hire one at any price i shall not be at rest till i have convinced this man i am really determined to avoid him  henrietta kept up this spirit and after she had given proper directions to the housekeeper and sent orders for the coach to be ready early in the morning she busied herself in packing up her lady assisting in a violent flutter of spirits and wishing impatiently for the hour of departure  our fair heroine had some objections to taking this journey herself but her concern for miss belmour overruled them all she was not willing to leave unfinished the good work she had begun and she was apprehensive that if the young lady was left to the guidance of her own passions this sudden sally of resentment would end in a reconciliation fatal to her virtue  she would have been glad to see the countess before she went but there was no time for this visit therefore she contented herself with writing to that lady and to her friend mrs willis the countess received the news of this journey with great pleasure because she hoped that absence would effectually cure her sons passion for henrietta the consequences of which she was still apprehensive of notwithstanding he had shown an extraordinary prudence in the conduct of it  but mrs willis was very uneasy lest any thing should happen that might make her repent the removing herself thus from all her friends and putting herself entirely in the power of a stranger had there been time for it she would have endeavored to dissuade henrietta from going but recollecting that mr bale was in france and that they might possibly meet she resolved to write to the old gentleman and give him a full account of every thing relating to the situation of his fair persecuted ward not even omitting his sons doubtful behavior with regard to her for she knew that if they met henrietta would be silent upon that article and yet it was necessary he should know it that he might be convinced her misfortunes were chiefly owing to his sons treachery and this consideration she hoped would produce something to her advantage  henrietta book the fifth chap i contains an adventure in which our heroine is more than ordinarily interested  in the mean time our fair travelle having regulated their affairs in the  manner the extreme hurry they were in world admit set out for dover in miss belmours coach that young lady still agitated with the violence of her resentment which henrietta took care should not abate and elated with the hope of reducing her lover to despair by thu leaving him thought the horses went too slow for her impatience she wished for wings to convey her at once far from him and declare that she never desired to see him more y henrietta observed that she frequently looked out of the windows with an air of anxious expectation and would sigh when she drew in her head again as if she had been disappointed  doubtless she had conceived hopes that her lover would follow her and considering this neglect as a new proof of his indifference it redoubled her rage and strengthened a resolution which reason and virtue had very little share in  this thought gave henrietta great concern her conversion promised no great permanency since it was founded on such motives but all she could now do was to manage her passions for the time was not yet come to touch her heart by sentiments of piety and virtue  on their arrival at dover they found the calais packetboat ready to sail miss belmour who would fain have lingered at dover a day was not much pleased with this circumstance but her pride was concerned not to betray any irresolution accordingly she embarked with a tolerable good grace and the wind continuing fair they soon landed at calais  miss belmour having made the journey before was under no embarassment how to conduct herself the customary ceremonies at landing being over she proceeded to the inn she had formerly been at and having hired a postchaise for herself and henrietta and a horse for her servant she set out immediately after dinner and reached boulogne that ing  as the chaise stopped at the inn they put up at two gentlemen alighted from their horses at the same time one of whom hearing they were english ladies advanced and respectfully offered them his hand to help them out miss belmour pleased with the graceful appearance of this stranger politely accepted his assistance which he likewise tendered to henrietta whose charms at the first glance made a powerful impression on his heart  his eyes told her this so intelligibly that she was under some confusion yet she found in herself a kind of satisfaction at the attention with which he gazed on her and was now for the first time sensible to the pleasure of chaing but accustomed to watch carefully over the motions of her own mind she checked this ing vanity and a little ashamed of the folly she discovered in herself she hastily withdrew he hand which he still held as not  maste enough of himself to part with it though she was already out of the chaise and think  him by a graceful courtesy for his civility she followed miss belmour into the room the land lady had conducted her to  the young gentleman stood gazing after her as long as she was in sight then turning to his friend who was giving some orders to their footmen  oh charles cried he with a look half serious half gay my fatal hour is come  what i will warrant you said the other you are shot through the heart with the glances of the younger of those ladies i observed how you gazed on her  is she not a charming creature exclaimed the first what features what a complexion what elegance in her whole form  i am sure she has wit i saw her soul in her eyes  faith i am half concerned for you interrupted charles with an affected seriousness this will be an unfortunate encounter i am afraid  can we not think of some method to introduce ourselves to them cried the other without minding what he had said i shall not rest till i find out who they are  what will it signify to you to know replied charles they are going to paris and we to london  why aye that is true said the other we shall go different ways in the morning and yet  what think you my dear charles of going back to paris for a few days and we shall have an opportunity of escorting these fair travelers  come it will be but a frolic and i know you are no enemy to them  i dont like this frolic replied charles it has too serious an air sure you are strangly charmed with this girl  just upon the point of seeing your father and your family after a long absence and so suddenly to resolve upon protracting your stay from them  i dont half like it i confess and this once my lord i must oppose your inclinations  oh sir you are grave replied his lordship a little sullenly you have a mind to exert the governor too but let me tell you that considering the equality of our years and the terms we have hitheto lived upon this wisdom is very unseasonable  the young lord having said this with some emotion hastily entered the house and calling to the innkeeper to show him a room went away without taking any farther notice of his governor who stood musing for some time after he was gone and then followed him with an intention to bring him if possible to reason  upon his entering the room he found his pupil leaning on a table with a discontented air he just raised his head to see who it was that came in and immediately resumed his former posture without speaking a word  the governor looked at him a moment in silence at last  this pensiveness said he and this causeless resentment are they not strong arguments against my complying with your proposal the impression this girl has made on your heart must needs be very great since it can make you already forget that friendship you have vowed for me and in which i placed so much happiness  it is you not i who seems to have forgot our mutual friendship replied the young nobleman melted at those last words why did you my dear charles lose the beloved friend and companion in the austere governor is not this strange affectation  indeed my lord replied the governor i should be unworthy the title of your friend if i was not attentive to your interest  was there ever any thing so absurd interrupted his lordship to make a serious affair of a little idle curiosity  dont you make a serious affair of it replied the governor and i shall be contented  well then you consent to go back to paris with me said the pupil  if you are resolved to go answered the governor to be sure i will go with you  now you are my friend again said the young lord hugging him i promise you i will not stay long in paris but we must be freeman and melvil again my dear charle  ah how many pleasant adventures have we had under those names  if this proves of no greater consequence resumed the young governor i shall not regret coming into your scheme but i confess i am alarmed at your eagerness to follow the young woman she seems to have made n slight impression on your heart there is danger in these sort of attachments how do you know how far this may lead you  what strange notions have entered you head said the young nobleman it  hardly worth while to make a serious answer to them but this you may depend upon the i never will follow my inclinations in oppotion to the duty i owe my father and not what do you think will become of th dangerous attachment but added he smiling we must make our fellowtravellers a visit these inns are charming places for shortening the ceremonies of a first introduction he rang the bell without waiting for his friends answer and one of his servants appearing he ordered him to present mr freemans and his compliments to the two english ladies with a request that they would permit them to wait upon them  henrietta felt her heart flutter at this message et her natural reserve made her wish miss belmour would decline the visit of these young gentlemen however that lady returned a civil answer and permission for them to come  henrietta sensible of an agitation which she had never known before would have chose not to have shared this visit but it was not possible to avoid it miss belmour had obliged her  throw off the character of a servant and to ve with her upon the footing of a friend and companion to which henrietta was inuced to consent by the hope she had that his familiarity would furnish her with opportunities to guard her unhappy mistress against the evils into which her blind passion was hurrying her  to this mark of consideration and esteem miss belmour added a most affectionate behavior which entirely won the heart of the tender and grateful henrietta for nothing so much resembles true friendship as those connexions which lovers form with persons whom they make the confidants of their passion  thus circumstanced henrietta was obliged to receive the compliments of mr melvil and his friend as well as her lady who soon after fell into a fit of musing that made it necessary for our fair heroine to keep up the conversation with the two gentlemen which she did with that sprightliness and vivacity so natural to her  the graces of her wit the easy elegance of her manners and the modest dignity of her deportment formed new chains for the heart of melvil he looked on his friend with an exulting air his eyes challenged his admiration of the woman whose merit justified the sentiments he entertained for her  at parting he told the ladies that sin he was going to paris as well as they h hoped they would allow him the pleasure of  scorting them and that he would regulate h journey entirely by theirs  henrietta who well remembered to have seen these travelers taking the very contrary route was a little surprised at this declaration but miss belmour absorbed in her own reflections was wholly ignorant of that circumstance and considering this offer in no other light than that of general politeness she received it with her usual complaisance  the youth and beauty of the two ladies made their apparent independent situation a matter of curiosity to mr freeman as well as the profound melancholy in which one of them seemed buried  melvil was little concerned in these enquiies all his thoughts were taken up with the perfections he found in her who had charmed him and he was much less solicitous to discover who she was than how to make himself agreeable to her he found she was not married by the other ladys giving her the title of miss when she spoke to her and he was perfectly satisfied with this knowledge conscious of the ardor with which he already loved this fair stranger he was apprehensive of awakening the fears of his friend by dwelling too long on her praises but he received the testimony which freeman could not help giving to her merit with such an undisguised transport as drew from him some serious admonitions which he rallied off with a sprightly air and then changed the discourse to a less interesting subject  chap ii which shows that it is easier to be wise for others than ourselves  though miss belmours melancholy ha hindered her from taking any great sha in the conversation during this visit yet he mind was still free enough to observe tha henrietta had made an impression upon the heart of mr melvil she congratulated he smiling upon her conquest nor did her railery even spare her for henrietta who for a full hour had appeared animated with a extraordinary vivacity became all on a sudd pensive and silent this change exactly commenced at the time mr melvil went away but she did not perceive it herself and started as from a dream when miss belmour reproach her with it  concerned that she had given room for suspicion of this nature she began as soon she was alone to examine her own heart miss belmour had praised the personal graces of mr melvil and it was but justice to own that he was eminently handsome but was she weak enough to be dazzled with the beauty of a man no certainly his countenance pleased her because it was a picture of his mind candor sweetness benevolence shined in every feature the politeness of his address his gentle manners that air so noble yet so peculiarly soft and engaging his good sense and above all the justness and purity of his sentiments which she had time enough to discover during their conversation were not these qualities which a modest young woman might esteem and is love a necessary consequence of esteeming one of that sex must she deny herself the pleasure of approving virtue and merit for fear of loving it too much it was thus she argued and soon dispelled those doubts which miss belmours raillery had raised in her mind  while henrietta under the notion of barely esteeming what was indeed truly worthy of esteem was insensibly giving way to more tender sentments mr melvil who loved with all the tenderness and ardor of a first passion as his really was burned with impatience for the hour when they were to join the fair travelers freeman directed his attention to miss belmour which gave the young lover an opportunity of employing his whole care and assiduity about his mistress who ascribed all to his natural politeness and remained in a perfect tranquillity as well with regard to his sentiments as her own miss belmours experience however soon let her into the secret of their hearts melvils passion was indeed apparent enough notwithstanding the pains he was at to conceal it through fear of his friends troublesome remonstrances but henriettas though hid from herself was open to miss belmours discerning eyes and she exulted in the discovery  this rigid censurer of her conduct this inflexibly virtuous maid was entangled in the snares of love she perceived that she herself was ignorant of her own danger and she was resolved not to draw her out of this false security by any unseasonable railleries for however useful the strict principles of henrietta had been to her yet she could not  the superiority they gave her and she rejod in the hope that a passion perhaps as unfortunate placed as her own would reduce  to a equality with her  their journey now drew near a period melvil trembled at the thoughts of parting he had indeed laid the foundation of an intimacy with the two ladies which would give him a right to visit them in paris but he had been used to see the object of his passion continually from the first moment of his acquaintance with her and although they never separated till the evening yet he thought the time amazingly long till they met again how then would he be able to support an absence of two or three days which decorum would oblige him to make the interval of his visits besides she was still ignorant of the sentiments she had inspired him with hitherto he had never found an opportunity of speaking to her alone but if one should offer how could he declare himself to a woman for whom he felt as much respect as love yet one whose birth he was ignorant of who seemed to be in a dependent situation whom he could not think of marrying and whom he durst not wish to seduce  the difficulties he could not remove he endeavored to banish from his thoughts and without considering what must be the event of the passion he was thus indulging he for the present confined all his wishes to the pleasure of seeing her  miss belmour had often wondered that this young lover showed so little solicitude to make opportunities of speaking to his mistress in private she could not impute this behavior to want of ardor every look he gave her was expressive of the tenderness his soul was filled with it was then respect it was awe it was fear of offending that laid him under this restraint how glorious this for henrietta how humiliating for her who had scarce escaped falling a sacrifice to the dishonorable attempts of her lover was she then less capable of inspiring a respectful passion than her woman or did her charms act more powerfully on the heart she had subdued than those of henrietta this question her selflove easily decided and from the same sentiment she was persuaded that henrietta with all her boasted virtue would defend herself as weakly against the lover her inclinations declared for as the had done her present triumph she thought was  oweing to her own strength than her lovers weakness who had not yet made a formal attack upon her heart curiosity to know what effect the declaration of his passion would have made her resolve to give him an opportunity of speaking to her in private they were now within a days journey of paris on their arrival at the house where they were to dine mr freeman as usual went to give orders for their entertainment and left melvil with the two ladies miss belmour pretending that she had a mind for some particular dish ran after him and kept him in conversation that he might not interrupt the lovers who being now for the first time alone together were both equally embarrassed  henrietta cast down her eyes surprised at the confusion in which she found herself and shocked at the intelligence this new emotion gave her of the true state of her heart mr melvil approached her trembling he could not resolve to lose so favorable an opportunity of declaring his sentiments to her but the natural goodness and rectitude of his mind suggesting to him that it was a kind of fraud to seek encouragement of a passion the design of which he was not himself able to answer for he remained a few moments in suspense  this silence increased henriettas embarrassment but suddenly reflecting upon the advantage it gave mr melvil over her she turned her eyes toward him with a look in which she endeavored to throw as much indifference as possible but which nevertheless had an unusual coldness in it so that melvil partly withheld by his extreme delicacy and partly by the awe which this severe glance inspired him with dropped for that time all thoughts of declaring his passion and immediately entered into an indifferent conversation  henrietta seemed as if relieved from a painful load her countenance resumed its former sweetness and she talked to him with her usual vivacity yet miss belmour at her return saw some remains of her late uneasiness in her eyes she observed too that she spoke less to mr melvil and more to his friend than she did before that she studiously avoided the looks of the former and that her behavior to him was less free and obliging than it used to be all this she looked upon as the play of coquetry and in mr melvils apparent melancholy she saw its purpose and effect  but henrietta taught by what passed in her own heart during the few moments she was alone with mr melvil that she not only considered him as a lover but a  by his engaging qualities  to strengthen her prepossession in  by continuing to see and converse  lord b  s behavior had given  of the disinterestedness of men  at her own imprudence in so  the humble station that providence had placed her in as to entertain sentiments of tenderness for a man who from the inequality there was between them might think himself authorized to form expectations injurious to her honor though her weakness was so lately known to herself yet she fancied it had been perceived by others before and that even mr melvil had discovered the preference with which she regarded him it was this thought which made her so suddenly alter her behavior but as indifference is of all dispositions of the mind the hardest to feign melvil imputed the apparent constraint in her manner to some disgust he had unhappily given her and miss belmour to the artifice of a coquet  henrietta who was far from imagining she overacted her part continued during the whole time they were at dinner to avoid her lovers looks so carefully that he had no opportunity to make her comprehend by them how much he was concerned at her extraordinary coldness however she could not without affectation refuse him her hand when they left the inn but they followed mr freeman and miss belmour so close that it was not possible for him to speak to her without being overheard and he in vain sought her eyes they were always directed another way he sighed when he helped her into the chaise and if she had not turned her face from him that moment the blush with which it was overspread would have shown him that she took but too much notice of that sigh  you are melancholy henrietta said miss belmour after looking at her in silence for a long time attentive to the motions of her mind which might be easily read in her countenance  am i madam replied she with a sigh half suppressed and a gentle smile  yes indeed are you resumed miss belmour mimicking the languid accent in which she spoke and i dont remember that i ever saw you so before  and yet i have many causes for melancholy madam replied henrietta whose heart was full and she eagerly grasped at this opportunity to relieve herself by tears tears which she supposed she gave to the remembrance of her misfortunes without asking herself why that remembrance was more poignant now than before  ah henrietta said miss belmour shaking her head your heart has undergone a great change within these few days  you are  love my dear is it possible madam cried henrietta hastily her fair face all crimsoned over that you have discovered  do you think that  then to be sure mr melvil  she stopped abruptly and cast down her eyes the mention of that name seemed to lead her to a consciousness that she had betrayed herself  miss belmour was affected with her beautiful simplicity dont be ashamed my dear henrietta said she taking her hand to speak freely to me from me added she sighing you may be sure of indulgence  no madam no interrupted henrietta with great earnestness i would not seek indulgence for my weaknesses but i conjure you madam pursued she with tears that in spite of her endeavors would force their way suffer me to return to that humble station from which your partial kindness raised me  you have made me forget i was a servant  it does not become me to view with sensibility the merit of persons so greatly above me but you shall find madam that i will repair this error and that my conduct shall be such as may render me not unworthy your esteem  notwithstanding the delicate turn which henrietta gave to a declaration which showed she was determined early to conquer her passion yet miss belmour considered it as a triumph over her who had not been capable of acting with equal prudence  it is happy for you said she coldly that you need no assistance to help you to keep your passions in subjection but i owe you too many obligations for the good counsel you have given me to permit you to appear in any other character than that of my friend  henriettas mind was in so much agitation that she did not take in the full sense of this answer but struck with the obliging purport of the last words of it she expressed her gratitude in terms full of tenderness and respect  the sight of paris drew them both out of a long silence which had succeeded a conversation with which neither had been pleased henrietta because it had discovered so much weakness on her side miss belmour because it had shown so little  their chaise as miss belmour h directed stopped at the house of her banker in pis th two gentlemen were already at the side of it mr melvil as if he was afraid henrietta would refuse him her hand seized it with trembling haste and as he led her into the house ventured to press it with his lips unperceived by any one else henrietta imputing this boldness to the discovery he had made of her sentiments pulled her hand away hastily giving him a look at the same time that expressed her resentment but all her anger could not prevent her from being affected with the soft languor that appeared in his face and the submissive manner in which he had yielded to the effort she made to withdraw her hand  miss belmour at parting told them she hoped to see them again in a day or two when she should be settled her parisian friend soon procured her convenient lodgings and at her desire recommended to her a femme de chamber among the other servants he provided her which henrietta in vain opposed but fixed in her design to avoid mr melvil she took care to be seldom in the way when he came  miss belmour blamed her for this conduct you will make the man think you love him and are afraid of him said she by flying him  if i loved him madam replied henrietta blushing is it not prudence to avoid him  why i dont know said miss belmour mr melvil certainly loves you and whatever inequality there may be in your conditions yet love is a great leveller he may possibly intend to marry you  it is not fit i should suppose he has any such design madam resumed henrietta since it is highly improbable and i will not expose myself to the danger of being deceived i have somewhere read added she smiling that in love flight is victory and this way at least i shall be sure to conquer  miss belmour who knew how difficult it was to be in love and be wise laughed at a resolution which she did not think it would be always in her power to maintain poor henrietta who had so artlessly laid open her heart was often exposed to the most poignant raillery from her but at length she was delivered from this kind of persecution by a surprising alteration in miss belmour herself  this young lady who had fled from her lover rather with a hope of stimulating his passion than of subduing her own though she endeavored to impose upon herself in believing the latter to be the true motive of her conduct fell into a most violent despair when she found that far from following her he did not even seek a reconciliation by writing to her sick of herself the world and tired of her existence she mistook the agitations of a heart tortured by jealousy disappointment and the pangs of slighted love for the motions of grace and the genuine marks of repentance she neglected her dress took no pleasure in any amusement avoided company and spent whole hours in her closet where she wept and prayed by turns  she told henrietta that the world and all its pleasures were grown insipid to her that her whole soul was filled with divine love and that the thoughts and exercises of religion made up all her happiness she then passionately regretted that there were no religious communities among the protestants where a mind that was weaned from this sublunary world and all its vanities might freely indulge its pious contemplations and devote itself entirely to heaven oh how happy are the nuns she exclaimed how i envy them sure nothing can be more delightful when persons are truly pious than to live in a religious society excluded from all commerce with a world they must certainly despise i think i should be perfectly happy if i was in a cloister  henrietta congratulated her upon her new sentiments but endeavored to prove that there was more merit in passing through life with innocence and in rightly performing  than in flying to the gloomy solitude  ister where virtue is secured by bolts and rs and the exercises of religion performed as a penance she recommended to her the study of the scriptures and put some practical treatises of religion written by the best authors on that subject into her hands but the zeal of this new convert was so flaming that nothing would serve her but a total retirement from the world and she made such frequent visits to a convent where a friend of here is had lately taken the veil that henrietta was apprehensive the nuns would discover the true state of her mind and take advantage of her passions to pervert he principles and secure her to themselves  while these whims possessed her she was so inaccessible to all visiters that mr melvil could with difficulty get admittance freeman saw the progress of his passion with great uneasiness and finding that he could not be prevailed upon to leave paris resolved to write to his father and give him a hint of the dangerous attachment his son had formed that he might se him a peremptory command to return to england but before he could execute this design melvil to his great surprise told him that he would leave paris in two days the poor youth expected his friend would have expressed some joy at this news and being disappointed at his receiving with indifference what had cost him so many pangs to resolve upon  you make me no compliments said he with a tender smile upon the conquest i have gained over my inclinations do you think i can banish myself from miss benson without concern  i am sure i cannot hear you speak in this manner without concern replied freeman is it fit for a young man of your rank to entertain a serious liking for a woman to whose birth and character you are an absolute stranger  there is not a man in the world resumed melvil eagerly who need to blush for loving miss benson her person beautiful as it is is the least of her charms that mingled sweetness and dignity in her manners that graceful modesty which distinguishes every word and action of here is exalt her above all the women i have ever seen you have heard her talk and you could not help owning that you thought her very sensible  well but what is all this to the purpose interrupted freeman what signifies attributing such goddesslike perfections to an obscure girl whom if you were at liberty to dispose of yourself you would not i suppose be so mad as to marry your fortune would enable you to make other proposals less unworthy of yourself though advantageous enough for a young woman in her dependent situation  may i perish replied melvil with some emotion if i would degrade such excellence to a mistress but if i were capable of such a design her virtue i am sure is incorruptible have you not observed with what care she shuns me she knows i love her but she knows not with what purity i love her and conscious of her situation she is afraid i should take advantage of it to declare myself in a manner that would wound her delicacy  charming creature how i love her  indeed my dear freeman it is time to be gone  i see it plainly replied freeman you are grown quite romantic  we will set ou tomorrow if you please for with the strang notions you have entertained i think you ought not to trust yourself here any longer  the lover consented with a sigh but at the same time put his friend in mind that civility obliged them to go and take leave of the ladies freeman could not reasonably oppose his making this visit and after he had given proper directions to the servants for their journey the next day he accompanied him to miss belmours lodgings  chap iii in which miss belmour acts the part of a true female friend  they found the two ladies together henrietta could not without affectation avoid her lover that day as she was in the room when he came in and he who had not been so fortunate for several days before found so much delight in looking at her and hearing her speak that he forgot he came to pay a farewell visit which mr freeman observing took care to mention their design of leaving paris the next day  melvils gaiety was immediately overcast henrietta turned pale freeman was attentive to his friends emotions and only miss belmour had freedom of mind enough lest to speak she said some civil things upon the occasion which freeman answered for melvil continued silent with his eyes fixed upon henrietta who had bent here is toward the ground conscious of the emotion with which she had heard the news of their intended departure she durst no look up lest the person from whom she was most solicitous to hide her concern should read it  plainly in her countenance  recovering herself at length upon miss belmours taking occasion to thank them anew for the civilities she had received from them during their journey from calais she added a few word to her compliment but in doing so her eye slightly glanced over mr melvil and directed their looks full upon his friend  the conversation was dull enough during tw hours that they stayed and freem  the young gentleman wanted resolution to  an end to the visit rose up first mr melvil di so likewise though with apparent reluctance and having saluted miss belmour approache henrietta trembling she turned pale and  successively a soft sigh stole from her melv was in too much emotion to observe here is he saluted her with an air of solemn respect but as she retired a step back a sudden impulse which he could not resist made him take her hand he pressed it to his lips with passionate tenderness and sighing quitted the room with the utmost precipitation  henriettas eyes overflowed she made haste to wipe them before miss belmour who attended the gentlemen as far as the door of her antichamber returned  ah my poor henrietta said that young lady who perceived she had been weeping i pity you  what sordid wretches are these men melvil loves you and yet he is able to leave you nay i am persuaded he has discovered your tenderness for him  what monstrous ingratitude you ought to hate him my dear  you bid me hate him madam replied henrietta smiling yet say every thing that can confirm me in a favorable opinion of him if he loves me and has seen any weakness in me he gives the best proof of his love in not seeking to take advantage of that weakness  miss belmour who thought this a strange way f reasoning answered no otherwise than by a ignificant smile which seemed to say she was reolved to justify him at any rate while henrietta finding in her lovers behavior a delicac which agreeably flattered her esteem of him cherished his remembrance with a tender grief an perhaps for the first rhyme repined at her unhappy fortune which had placed such a d between them  as soon as the two gentlemen and left the lodgings melvil who found hself ver lowspirited proposed to his friend to spen the evening at a noted hotel with some young englishmen of fashion who were newl arrived freeman consented but observed wit uneasiness that his pupil who till then ha been remarkably abstemious pushed about the bottle with great velocity and could not be persuaded to go home till the night was far advanced  mr freeman saw him in bed and then retire to his own chamber full of apprehensions le this sudden intemperance should have any  effect on his health as soon as it was light i went to his bedside and found him with all the symptoms of a feverish disorder upon him which the agitations of his mind had contribute more perhaps than the liquor of which he  drank so freely  all thoughts of their journey were now lai aside physicians were sent for who pronounc at he was dangerously ill freeman full of nxiety sat close to his bed holding one of his ning hands tenderly pressed between his he eard him sigh frequently and from thence took ccasion to ask him if any secret uneasiness ocsioned his indisposition  the young gentleman attributed his illness tirely to the debauch he had made the night fore but his fever increasing he grew delious and then the name of miss benson was ontinually in his mouth  freeman judging by these ravings of the deep pression this young woman had made on the eart of his pupil blamed himself for so obstitely opposing his passion and judging from enriettas situation that she would not refuse to en to such proposals as his fortune enabled him  make her he resolved to attempt something  his friends favor  his curiosity having led him to make some enries concerning miss belmour of several per that had lately arrived from england he and she had but a doubtful character her concions with mr campley having exposed her to at censure of her companion he could learn thing but concluding from the friendship re appeared to be between them that she was  confidant in this amor he flattered himself that she would not be a very difficult conquest  he shut his eyes upon all that was wrong in this proceeding and considering nothing but the interest of his friend he thought it less dangerous to give him a mistress than to trust him to the fantastic power of his passion which might hurry him on to a clandestine marriage  the young gentleman was in a few days entirely out of danger from the fever but his sighs and the pensive air of his countenance shewe that his mind was not at ease  if you were able to go abroad said freeman to him we would visit our english ladi once more before we leave paris they imagine we are in london by this time and w be strangely surprised to see us again  then they do not know i have been ill replied mr melvil  not yet said freeman but if you w they should know i will wait on them this aternoon and tell them what has kept us  paris so much longer than we intended  melvil affected to receive this proposal w indifference but his friend observed that  was more cheerful than before and doubted  but he expected the news of his illness w have some effect on henrietta  he went at the usual hour and was immediately admitted you are in paris still then exclaimed miss belmour in a joyful accent as soon as freeman entered her apartment i am excessively glad of it i hope your agreeable friend is with you  freeman a little disappointed at not seeing henrietta with her answered coldly that mr melvil had been indisposed which obliged them to delay their journey  i fancy said miss belmour with an arch et that the air of paris is mighty necessary for your friend at this time you are in the wrong to hurry him away  you have a great deal of penetration madam replied mr freeman smiling you have guessed the cause of his illness i believe  i believe i have resumed miss belmour and perhaps i could tell him something that might contribute to forward his recovery  freeman began now to think his scheme was  a hopeful way to be sincere with you madam said he with a graver look and cent mr melvil is desperately in love with miss benson  poor man cried miss belmour laughing he is to be pitied truly for miss benson is most desperately in love with him likewise  how happy would this news make him exclaimed freeman am i madam at liberty to tell him  certainly replied miss belmour i told you for that purpose and now what do you think of my frankness  i adore you for it madam said freeman taking her hand which encouraged by her behavior he kissed with great liberty ah pursued he looking at her tenderly what additional charms does kindness give to beauty  i hear miss benson on the stairs said mis belmour withdrawing her hand i will give you an opportunity to plead your friends cause remember what i have told you and dont be discouraged by a little affectation  she stopped upon henriettas entrance wh started at the sight of mr freeman and immediately after her fair face was covered wit blushes  you see we have not lost our good friend yet said miss belmour henrietta on smiled i must desire you my dear pursu that young lady to entertain mr freeman i ordered some tradespeople to attend  about this time  she hurried out of the room when she had said this not without some confusion for the part she had acted to account for which it is necessary the reader should know that the mind of this young lady had undergone another revolution within the few days of mr melvils illness  a letter from her lover filled with tender complaints and new assurances of everlasting fidelity had banished all thoughts of devotion and a convent she had answered it immediately without communicating it to henrietta her transport at finding herself still beloved and the fear of disgusting him by any new coldness hurried her on to the most fatal resolutions she invited him to come to paris to her and not doubting but he would instantly obey her summons she was now only solicitous how to reconcile henrietta to her conduct and oblige her to keep her secret  the unexpected news of mr melvils being still in paris and mr freemans acknowledgment of his friends passion for henrietta answered all her views she imputed the reserve henrietta had been enabled to maintain less to her own virtue than to the unenterprising temper of her lover and was persuaded that the discovery she had made of her tenderness for him would put the affair upon such a footing as to make her less rigid in her remonstrances with respect to mr campley  chap iv which contains a very interesting discovery  freeman though persuaded that miss belmour was a woman of intrigue and by consequence entertaining no elevated idea of her companion yet found himself so awed by the modesty that shone in her countenance and the dignity of her person and manner that he was at some loss how to introduce the subject which had brought him thither henrietta however innocently led him to it by expressing her surprise to see him still in paris  you say nothing of my friend madam said freeman and this indifference with regard to him is a very bad omen  i hope mr melvil is well said henrietta gravely without seeming to take any notice o the strange speech he had made  he is better than he was three or four day ago replied freeman when his physcians despaired of his life  bless me cried henrietta with an emotion she could not suppress has mr melvil been so ill then i am extremely concerned to hear it  you would no doubt said freeman be more concerned if you knew you were the cause  this kind of raillery mr freeman replied henrietta a little confused is not at all agreeable to me i assure you  by heaven i am serious resumed freeman my friend loves you with the utmost ardor i am a witness to the birth and progress of his passion and to his fruitless endeavors to conquer it the effort he made to leave paris has almost cost him his life he was taken ill the evening before our intended departure oh miss benson had you heard with what tenderness he called upon your name when the violence of his fever had deprived him of his senses i am sure you must have pitied him  freeman perceived by the changes in henriettas countenance that she did not hear him without emotion he paused in expectation of some pretty affected answer that would give hope while it seemed to destroy it but henrietta with a composed look and accent replied  if i am to believe this account of your friends illness not exaggerated permit me to ask you sir what is your design by making me acquainted with his sentiments and what you expect from me upon this occasion  freeman was a little disconcerted by this speech and at the manner in which she delivered it but relying on the intelligence he had received from miss belmour  i expect you will have compassion on my friend said he and give him an opportunity to declare to you himself the passion you have inspired him with  i will be very free with you mr freeman replied henrietta your ready concurrence with your friend in the liking you say he has entertained for me is not consistent with your good sense and prudence mr melvil is a young man of rank and fortune i am poor and dependent my birth perhaps greatly inferior to his will his parents think you approve of such a choice  what has parents to do with a tender engagement interrupted freeman an engagement in which the heart only  consulted  were my heart ever so well disposed in favor of your friend resumed henrietta not willing to understand him i would not receive his addresses without the sanction of his parents consent  freeman could hardly help smiling at this formal declaration and supposing that the best way to drive these strange notions out of her head was to acquaint her with melvils quality which he likewise expected would have no small influence over her  it is not fit said he that you should be any longer ignorant of the rank of him whom your charms have subjected melvil is not the name of my friend he is the heir of an illustrious title and a great estate he loves you he will make your fortune do not throw away this opportunity of freeing yourself from poverty and dependence nor let a romantic notion of virtue deprive you of the advantages that are offered you  hold sir interrupted henrietta rising from her chair this insult is too plain i ought not to have listened to you so long she spoke this with tolerable composure but finding her tears begin to flow she turned aside to conceal them and hastily wiping her eyes she looked on him again with a kind of calm disdain  i know not said she what weakness you have discovered in my behavior to encourage you to make me such shocking proposal but i may venture to tell you though i am not the mistress of this apartment that the doors of it shall never be open to you again  she was hurrying out of the room when she had spoke this leaving freeman in so much confusion that he knew not what to say to her when miss belmour entered with a letter in her hand  do you know a gentleman of the name of bale said she to henrietta who is at present at montpelier  i do madam replied she looking eagerly at the letter  then this letter is for you i suppose said miss belmour it was enclosed in another to me and directed to my bankers  your name courteney you see the superscription is for miss courteney  the letter is certainly for me madam said henrietta blushing  oh then replied miss belmour smiling and giving it to her i have discovered a secret i find  henrietta retired immediately and miss belmour approached mr freeman who stood leaning over his chair with his eyes fixed on the ground  what is the matter with you said she you look excessively pale  where is miss benson madam said he starting out of his revery at the sound of her voice  she is in her own chamber i believe replied miss belmour but did you take notice of what passed about the letter i delivered it to her before you on purpose you see she in a manner owned that courteney is her true name is not this strange  i must beg leave to speak to her again said he interrupting her and making toward the door which way pray madam  miss belmour followed him surprised at the agitation he appeared to be in and pointing to a room just opposite you will find her there said she  freeman opened the door without any ceremony henrietta who was reading her letter looked up at the noise he made in entering this is extremely rude sir said she i desire you will instantly be gone and trouble me no more but apprehensive that he would not quit her so easily she rushed by him and was running to the room in which she had left miss belmour he took hold of her hand to prevent her leaving him and she was upon the point of expressing her resentment at the insolence of this treatment in harsher terms than any she had yet used when she saw tears gush in great abundance from his eyes me at this sight she stood still but endeavored to disengage her hand looking at him earnestly and in the utmost astonishment  o my sister cried he at last bursting into a fresh flood of tears my dear dear sister  he was not able to utter a word more but led her gently back to her chamber which she permitted trembling confused and full of anxious expectation  how strangely you look upon me said he do you doubt whether i am your brother  i know not what to think replied she shrinking from his embrace for he had folded his arms about her  dear girl cried he how amiable is this sweet reserve  these modest doubts  but it is certain i am your brother my henrietta is it possible your memory retains no traces of my features in yours methinks i see a lively resemblance of my dear mother how dull was i that i did not discover it before but how could i expect to meet you in france in such a situation and under a disguised name oh my dear sister these circumstances distract me  good heaven what a part have i acted  i perceive you are still perplexed pursued he after a little pause and taking a miniature picture out of his pocket you will certainly be able to recollect your mothers picture said he which she gave me at parting  henrietta looked at the picture kissed it and then threw herself in tears upon her brothers neck  forgive my doubts said she it is many years since i have seen you we were children when we parted but now i am convinced you are my brother my heart tells me so without this dear testimony pursued she kissing again the picture of her mother which she still held then suddenly clasping her hands together and lifting up her fine eyes which were swimming in tears i thank thee my god said she for restoring to me my brother and turning again to him with an affectionate look a few moments ago said she i thought myself very unhappy but now you will be a friend and protector to me  he tenderly kissed her cheek  what a wretch have i been said he sighing  indeed my dear sister i never shall forgive myself for having ignorantly practiced on your virtue  oh that my brother replied henrietta would be taught by this accident never more to form designs against innocence and in cases like mine to consider every virtuous young woman as a sister  mr courteney for so we shall now call him was extremely moved at these words he gazed at her some moments with mingled tenderness and delight but all on a sudden as if struck with some painful reflection  henrietta said he with a look and accent greatly altered from his former sweetness why came you to france and how has it happened that you are so intimately connected with thi woman this miss belmour  why do you know any harm of mis belmour said henrietta frighted at h sternness  you dont answer my question replied he peevishly  alas my dear brother said henrietta i have a long and melancholy story to tell you i have been reduced to great distress my aunt with whom you supposed me so happily settled has treated me unkindly i must confess indeed i have not been wholly free from blame but you shall know all some other time as for miss belmour i was recommended to her  i would not shock you brother but i have been obliged to go to service and i was recommended to miss belmour by two ladies of quality her near relations  mr courteney sighed deeply at this account and remained for several moments silent at length recovering himself  miss belmour it seems said he did not always know your real name  you appear to be on the footing of a companion  miss belmour was pleased to take a liking to me said henrietta and though ignorant of my birth would not suffer me to continue with her in the character of a servant  i have been greatly obliged to her  yes you are obliged to her interrupted mr courteney kindling into rage at the remembrance of what had parted between them infamous wretch she has done her part toward betraying you to ruin you have been very imprudent henrietta you have talked to her of mr melvil too freely she believes you are in love with him and told me so to encourage my attempts upon you  henrietta blushed at the mention of mr melvil and presently after burst into tears at this discovery of miss belmours baseness and ingratitude but uttered not a word of complaint or resentment  i will not suffer you to remain any longer with her resumed mr courteney i will go directly and provide you lodgings in the house of a worthy english family i suppose you can have no objection to this proposal  why do you look and speak so coldly my dear brother said henrietta to be sure i can have no objection dispose of me as you please you are in the place of my father i will obey you as such  forgive me my dear said he tenderly pressing her hand my temper is warm i have spoke to you harshly indeed i am greatly alarmed at the disagreeable circumstances i find you in you have been to blame you own alas my dear sister what have you done to be thus abandoned by your aunt i shall be on the rack till i have heard all your story but this is not a proper place  take a civil leave of miss belmour but do not acquaint her that you have discovered your brother for i know not yet what measures i shall take i will call for you in less than an hour in a coach  henrietta promised to be ready he took a tender leave of her and departed  chap v the history continued  our fair heroine continued some time alone in her chamber so transported at this unexpected meeting with her brother that she sometimes doubted whether her happiness was real and whether all that had part was not an illusion of her fancy when her spirits were a little composed she began to consider what reason she should give miss belmour for quitting her so suddenly she rightly judged that the secrecy her brother had recommended to her proceeded from his embarrassment with regard to mr melvil and she resolved however strange her going away might appear to miss belmour to follow his directions punctually  the treachery this young lady had been guilty of toward her excited less resentment than grief for the conviction it brought her that her principles were not changed several circumstances now rushed upon her memory which served to convince her she was relapsing into her former indiscretions and she doubted not but miss belmour would be rejoiced to be delivered from her presence this thought gave her courage to go to her immediately and acquaint her with her intention  a strange alteration has happened in my affairs madam said she entering her apartment within this hour  that letter has brought you some good news i suppose said miss belmour coldly  it came from a dear and worthy friend madam replied henrietta and i have indeed heard some good news which i little expected but i am obliged to leave you and so suddenly that i am afraid you will thin me ungrateful for your kindness in submitting to this necessity  pray make no apologies interrupted miss belmour with great indifference you are entirely at your own liberty  henrietta who thought she had reason for this behavior was studying for some answer which without revealing the secret motive of her conduct might tend in some measure to excuse it when a servant introduced a gentleman into the room who though she had seen but once she knew immediately to be mr campley she turned eagerly to observe how miss belmour was affected by this visit and discovering no signs of surprise or anger in her countenance but an excess of joy and satisfaction she concluded this meeting was concerted and retired immediately in great concern to her own room  here while she waited her brothers return she employed herself in writing to miss belmour in this letter she repeated what she had often urged before to guard her against the base designs of her lover she recalled to her remembrance the resolution she had made and the vows with which she had sealed it never more to listen to his destructive addresses and conjured her by every motive of religion honor and virtue to banish from her sight a man whose only aim was to ruin her  she had scarce finished her letter when a servant came to tell her that some company waited for her in a coach she made haste to seal it and gave it to miss belmours maid with orders to deliver it to her lady at the door she found her brother who helped her into the coach and came in after her he asked her smiling how she had parted with miss belmour  henrietta told him she had left her with company it is indifferent to me what company she sees now you are not with her said he but my heart will not be at rest till i hear all your story sister  henrietta promised to satisfy him when they were arrived at her new lodgings i am also impatient said she to know your adventures why you called yourself freeman and what was the cause of your not writing to me for so many months past  to say the truth my dear sister said he i have been guilty of a little neglect in no writing to you oftener however some of my letters must certainly have miscarried for wrote to you both from brussels and genoa and i dont remember i had any answer the account you gave me of mr bals kindne in taking upon him the office of your guardian and your happy settlement with lady meadows made me perfectly easy with regard to you i had informed you that i was appointed governor to the marquis of  this young nobleman had contracted a friendship with me during his stay at leyden where his governor dying he wrote to his father the duke of  in such pressing terms in my favor which joined to the knowledge of my birth and very high recommendations from the university had so much weight with him that his grace notwithstanding my youth appointed me governor to his son with a salary of five hundred pounds a year i have endeavored to acquit myself faithfully of this trust my pupil and i have always lived together like brothers and i flatter myself his father will have no cause to repent his having consigned him to my care  but why did you take the names of melvil and freeman interrupted henrietta  the marquis replied mr courteney had an inclination to travel without the parade of quality that he might as he wrote to his father make nearer and more useful observations upon men and manners and being indulged in this scheme we have traveled through france and italy under those names and with a very small equipage and now henrietta that you know the quality of my friend i expect you will not entertain any ridiculous hopes from the liking he has expressed for you i will do him the justice to own that he never formed any dishonorable designs upon you the character of the woman you lived with encouraged me to make you some shocking proposals you behaved very properly but my dear sister no words can express my anguish and confusion when i heard you own the name of courteney and your connexions with mr bale  good heaven what did i not suffer at that moment  what a wretch did i seem in my own eyes  let not this cruel remembrance disturb you now my dear brother said henrietta i am so happy in finding you that i forget all my past uneasinesses  her looks bore delightful witness to the truth of what she said joy sparkled in her charming eyes heightened the rosy bloom of he complexion and animated her whole air but clearly as she loved her brother the assurance he gave her that her lover had no part in the dishonorable proposals he had made her was circumstance that greatly increased her satisfaction in this meeting  mr courteney looked at her with admiration and delight while a tender sense of the misfortunes she had been exposed to almost melted him into tears as soon as the coach stopped he told her that the master of the house they were going into was a very worthy man with whom he was intimately acquainted and whose prudence he could depend upon his wife pursued he is a virtuous sensible woman i know no family so proper to place you in as this and it was extremely lucky that i thought of them upon this occasion for it was not fit you should stay with miss belmour and in so short a time it was difficult to dispose of you properly  as soon as they alighted mrs knight came to receive henrietta and presented her husband to her both seemed greatly charmed with her appearance and politely thanked mr courteney for bringing them so agreeable a guest  after a few compliments they withdrew supposing the brother and sister would be glad of an opportunity to converse together in private mr courteney immediately drew his chair near his sisters and with a look of impatience demanded the account she had promised him  henrietta blushed and begged him not to judge her errors too severely she then gave him a candid relation of all that had happened to her from her mothers death till the time she met him at the inn concealing nothing from him but miss belmours passion for mr campley  mr courteney was variously affected during the course of her little story he often changed countenance but would not interrupt her he observed with pleasure that she laid no stress upon any part of her conduct which might with justice challenge esteem and admiration but appeared nicely conscious of every little imprudence and when she had ended waited for his reply with an anxiety that showed she rather expected censure than praise  my dear henrietta said mr courteney at length with tears in his eyes you have acted nobly you cannot imagine how much your sufferings endear you to me since you have behaved under them with such becoming fortitude  how happy you make me cried henrietta by your approbation  indeed i wa afraid you would have chidden me severl for leaving my aunt in the manner i did  it was a rash step replied mr courteney but your subsequent conduct has effaced it and i see not how you could have otherwise avoided being in the power of that viliainpriest  after some farther conversation on different parts of her story he looked at his watch how fast the minutes fly said he smiling my dear henrietta i must leave you now yet i have a thousand things to say to you but i will see you tomorrow morning you will be very happy continued he with mrs knight and i shall have no scruple to trust you to her care till i have conducted the marquis to london we shall go in a day or two and after i have delivered my charge safe to his father i will come back to paris and fetch you  henrietta turned pale at these words then we are to part again soon said she in a melancholy accent  it would be highly improper for you replied he to take this journey with us on several accounts i shall be concerned to leave you but it must be so  could you not stay till mr bale comes interrupted henrietta and taking his letter out f her pocket see here how affectionately he writes to me added she he proposes to be in paris in three weeks and insists upon my going to england with him  mr courteney read the letter with great pleasure mr bale addressed her in it by the tender name of daughter and assured her that he would in every respect act like a father toward her he praised her conduct in terms of the highest admiration and begged her not to be uneasy at her aunts desertion of her since it was in his power to make her easy and he was resolved to do so  this letter said mr courteney after a pause will make some little alteration in my plan i had resolved not to take any notice to the marquis that i had discovered you to be my sister but to make some excuse for your disappearing however i see it will be necessary to wait for mr bale i congratulate you my dear henrietta on the friendship o so worthy a man  but will you stay till he comes to paris interrupted the tender anxious henrietta  may i depend upon your prudence sister said mr courteney it is possible the maquis may talk to you of love if you give hi the least encouragement you will forfeit  esteem for ever it shall never be said the i took advantage of his youth to draw him into a marriage with my sister  oh do not suspect me of such meanness said henrietta blushing if the marquis was a thousand times more amiable than he is and were i ever so much prejudiced in his favor i have too just a sense of what i owe to my birth to your honor and my own to admit of a clandestine address  you may be entirely easy upon this article  i am satisfied replied mr courteney tenderly pressing her hand and now my dear henrietta adieu for this evening  dont fail to come tomorrow said she following him to the door he smiled assentingly and having taken leave of mrs knight who met him as he was going in search of her he hurried home to his pupil by whom he was expected with extreme impatience  chap vi farther continuation of the history  the marquis as soon as he entered his chamber perceived that something extraordinary had happened to him  sure said he smiling you have met with some strange adventure freeman you look pleased and yet there is a thoughtful air in your countenance  i have had an adventure indeed replie mr courteney entering abruptly into an affai which could not be concealed from him  have met with my sister here in paris  your sister repeated the marquis yo did not expect her did you  no faith replied mr courteney n did i know her when i saw her  that is not surprising said the marquis she was very young when you parted i ha heard you say i hope you will allow me  pay my respects to her but added he i patiently how does miss belmour and  fair friend  her fair friend as you are pleased to call her replied mr courteney is my sister whom for so many weeks i have seen almost every day without knowing her  is it possible cried the marquis surprised miss benson your sister sure you are not in earnest  indeed i am said mr courteney i discovered her by the oddest accident miss belmour herself did not know who she was but while i was there she brought her a letter which had been enclosed to her it was directed for miss courteney and came from mr bale my sisters guardian she owned the name and by that means i found out my sister i see you are astonished added mr courteney poor henrietta has told me all her story the repetition would be tedious but   how can you think so interrupted the marquis eagerly can you doubt that i am extremely interested in every thing that concerns you  excuse me my dear marquis said mr courteney i really cannot enter into particulars just now  fortune still persecutes my dear father in his children i thought my sister was happily settled with her aunt lady meadows who has no child and adopted her but the old lady being a rigid roman catholic pressed her very much to change her religion and was at last so strangely influenced by an artful priest who is her chaplain that she had formed a design to send my sister under the conduct of this fellow to be shut up in a nunnery the poor girl who was as i can collect by her account extremely apprehensive of being so entirely in the power of this sly priest had no way to avoid this misfortune but by leaving her aunt privately who absolutely refused to be reconciled to her on any other condition than her changing her religion thus deserted her guardian being abroad and having nothing to expect from her relations she chose to go to service and was recommended to miss belmour by the countess of  her kinswoman  what a wretch must your uncle be said the marquis with tears in his eyes to permit such excellence  he stopped a moment then suddenly grasping his hand o my dear freeman pursued he you have it in your power to make me happy  you know how ardently i love your charming sister   this i was apprehensive of interrupted mr courteney i beg my lord that you will banish these thoughts  what cried the marquis hastily have you any objection to my passion for your sister  indeed i have and a very strong one replied mr courteney and that is the certainty of the duke your fathers disapprobation of it  it is possible indeed said the marquis after a little pause that in the choice of a wife for me my father will be influenced by the same motives that most fathers are he will expect a large fortune with the person i marry therefore my dear charles you see the necessity there is for not consulting him in this case  sure you forget my lord interrupted mr courteney coolly what you once declared that you would never enter into an engagement of this kind contrary to the dukes inclinations  i remember i said so replied the marquis and were i to make a choice which he could reasonably object to certainly it would be wrong very wrong to disobey him but if the want of a fortune can make my father disapprove of my affection for a young lady of miss courteneys birth and merit must i be governed by such sordid motives  the marquis went on to prove by a great many arguments common enough on such occasions that in the article of marriage a parent had no right to lay any restraint upon the uch nations of his child mr courteney did not think proper to enter into a dispute with him upon this subject the patience with which he listened to him made the young nobleman conclude he was not unwilling to come into his measures  my dear charles added he after a short pause will you not be my advocate with your charming sister i die with impatience to throw myself at her feet and offer her my heart and hand  you cannot doubt my lord said mr courteney but that i think my sister highly honored by the esteem you express for her but she would be very unworthy of it if she was capable of admitting your addresses either unknown to your father or in opposition to his will i may venture to answer for her that she will not by so unjustifiable a conduct expose her brother to censure and it gives me great concern to find you are no better acquainted with my sentiments than to imagine i will so basely betray the trust the duke has reposed in me and be accessory to your disposing of yourself in a manner which i am very sure he will not approve  then i am to expect nothing from your friendship on this occasion mr courteney replied the marquis with an air of displeasure you are determined to raise difficulties to my design instead of removing them is this acting like a man whom i have loved like a brother and whom it would be my highest happiness to call so  to call you brother with your fathers consent my lord said mr courteney is an honor i cannot hope for and which without it i do not wish  as noble and disinterested as you imagine this conduct to be said the marquis rising it will have another name perhaps with persons less romantic in their notions than you are however sir you are no more than the brother of miss courteney if i am happy enough to prevail with her to receive my addresses i shall not think your consent necessary he passed by him with a cool bow as he pronounced these words and retired to his own chamber  chap vii in which we are afraid some of our readers will think mr courteney acts a very silly part  mr courteney saw plainly that by refusing to comply with his pupils desires he should entirely lose his friendship but in a case where his honor was so greatly concerned this consideration had no weight with him and although he had a high opinion of his sisters candor and integrity yet the intimation miss belmour had given him of her regard for mr melvil made him apprehensive that she might be prevailed upon to listen to the vows of the marquis of  he resolved therefore to keep the place of her abode a secret for he knew he could depend upon the prudence of mr knight and his wife and to use his utmost endeavors to hasten the young lords departure from france  the marquis mean time was forming very different designs it is so rare a thing for a man in love to be either reasonable or just on occasions where the interest of his passion is concerned that it is not surprising the marquis should impute his governors conduct with regard to his sister to peevishness and caprice and think himself extremely ill used by his not accepting his offers he conceived miss courteney to be equally injured by the opposition her brother made to the advancement of her fortune and flattering himself that if his person was not disagreeable to her he should soon overcome any scruples mr courteney might have suggested on account of the duke his fathers disapprobation he determined to consult him no further in the affair but to address himself directly to her  he spent part of the night in writing a letter to her in which he declared his passion in the most tender and respectful terms and begged she would allow him to wait upon her the remaining hours were not spent in sleep but in impatient longings for the morning which was to confirm or destroy his hopes as soon as it was light he rose and walked about his room he read over the letter he had written he thought it but poorly expressed the ardor of his love he sat down and wrote another which he liked still less and had recourse again to the first after adding a postscript in which he earnestly repeated his request to be indulged with a few moments private discourse with her  he sealed up his letter and directed it for miss courteney her brother had not mentioned to him his having removed her from miss belmour he supposed she was still with her but a doubt occurring to him whether she was willing to assume her real name yet he thought it best to put it in another cover superscribed for miss benson  it was still too early to send to a ladys lodgings he counted the hours with anxious impatience and at length rung his bell for his servant as soon as he appeared he gave him the letter recommending secrecy and charging him not to return without an answer  the valet when he came back brought him word that miss benson was gone and this was all the intelligence he could get miss belmours woman indeed had added with a sneer that she went off with mr freeman and it was strange that his friend mr melvil should not know where she was this part of the message the fellow prudently suppressed for he judged the business to be an amor and that the young gentlemen were rivals and he was afraid of making mischief  the marquis however easily guessed that this sudden removal of miss courteney was her brothers act he dismissed his servant and beginning now to be sensible how much it was in his governors power to traverse his designs and how obstinately he was bent upon doing so he resigned himself up to the most violent transports of rage and during a few moments all his thoughts ran upon revenge  mr courteney came into his chamber while he was under these agitations and seeing him walking about with a furious pace for heavens sake my lord said he what is the matter with you  the marquis turned short upon him and with a voice broken with passion exclaimed may i perish courteney if i forgive you  mr courteney who supposed this resentment was the consequence of their conversation the night before replied calmly you are angry my lord  this is no time to talk  he was going out of the room but the marquis hastily stepping between him and the door shut it with great violence  if it is not your time to talk sir it is mine said he  very well my lord replied mr courtney with a composed look and accent i am ready to hear you  the young nobleman continued to walk in a fullen silence as if resolved to be angry and knew not well what cause to assign for it when suddenly stopping  i insist upon your telling me sir said he why you have secreted your sister do you suspect i have dishonorable designs upon her  dishonorable designs upon my sister repeated mr courteney kindling at the expression my lord no man while i have life shall incur such a suspicion with impunity  this spirit becomes one of your birth replied the marquis but let me tell you mr courteney your conduct is not altogether consistent why must your sister be hurried no body knows whither and concealed with such wonderful caution  are you sure this is the case my lord said mr courteney  yes very sure answered the marquis hastily  since it was not i who gave your lordship this information resumed mr courteney you must have taken some trouble to come to the knowledge of it and the motive that set you upon these enquiries sufficiently justifies my caution with regard to my sister  then i am not worthy it seems to pay my addresses so your sister said the marquis peevishly  indeed my lord this is a very childish speech replied mr courteney you know your addresses would do honor to any woman but the depressed state of my sisters fortune leaves her no right to expect a man of your quality for a husband and she has too just a pride to submit to make a clandestine marriage nor will i be branded with the imputation of having seduced my pupil into a marriage with my sister  what have you to do with the affair at all replied the marquis eagerly leave miss courteney to act as she thinks proper you need not make yourself answerable for my conduct on this occasion i loved her before i knew her to be your sister cannot your romantic honor satisfy itself with being passive in this business  i should but ill perform my engagements to your father my lord interrupted mr courteney if i did not use my utmost endeavors to prevent you from displeasing him in a matter of so great importance as your marriage  how are you sure my father will be displeased said the marquis miss courteneys merit will justify my choice  put it upon that issue replied mr courteney ask his consent  well sir i will ask his consent resumed the marquis and now am i at liberty to visit your sister  if you intend my lord to be governed by the dukes advice said mr courteney you will certainly be contented to wait his answer and you cannot suppose that knowing your sentiments so well as i do i will permit my sister to receive your visits while we are ignorant of the dukes intentions  the marquis lost all patience at this unreasonable obstinacy as he conceived it i renounce your friendship from this moment said he for ever and had you not a sister i would resent this behavior in another manner  he flung out of the room when he had said this and shutting himself up in his study gave his valet orders to allow no body to disturb him  mr courteney was not so much offended at the harshness of his language as to hinder him from feeling great concern for the uneasy state of his mind and notwithstanding his own temper was vehement enough yet he was able to make some allowances for the transports of a young man who saw himself so resolutely opposed in a point he had set his heart upon but despairing to pacify his pupil without entering into his design he determined to place his sister effectually out of his reach and then if he could not prevail upon him to return to england nothing remained but to make the duke his father acquainted with the whole affair  he waited some time in expectation that the marquis would come down to breakfast as usual but finding that he had ordered his chocolate to be brought to him in his study he went to visit his sister as he had promised  the marquis heard him as he passed by his door call for his hat and sword and his valet entering a moment afterward with the chocolate he asked him if mr freeman was gone out being answered that he was it suddenly came into his head that he was going to see his sister  follow him instantly said he to the fellow and bring me word to what place he goes and here is something to purchase your secrecy and diligence  the fight of two louis d ors which the marquis gave him left the valet no inclination to be discreet any longer he ran out of the room with officious haste fully determined to execute his commission with the utmost exactness when he got into the street he perceived mr courteney walking leisurely on he followed him at a distance took particular notice of the house he entered and after waiting a few moments to see whether he came out again he went back to the marquis with his intelligence  the young lover did not doubt but he had discovered his mistresss abode and in the joy this thought gave him he bestowed many praises on his valets ingenuity together with a reward of two louis d ors more which he liked still better he then ordered him to give directions for his chariot to be got ready while he assisted him to dress his looks discovered such an excess of satisfaction that the valet under no apprehensions that what he had done would produce any disagreeable consequences entered with vast delight upon his new post of confidant to his master the marquis ordered him to stay at home till mr freeman came in and then immediately to come to him at the hotel de   chap viii in which mr courteney gives more instances of his folly  while henrietta thus innocently sowed the seeds of discord between the two friends she herself enjoyed a perfect composure of mind and indulged the most pleasing reflections on the happy change of her fortune  she was no longer in the humiliating condition of a servant or what to her was far more mortifying a dependant upon the bounty of another an unknown wanderer without friends or protectors she was now under the care of a brother whom she tenderly loved whose merit could not fail of distinguishing him and of forcing that respect and consideration due to a noble birth and which he though in a deprest fortune so nobly supported  she was assured that her guardian was not only free from any unfavourable prejudices on account of her aunts desertion of her but that she might expect all the tender offices of a parent from him and what afforded the nice sensibility of her soul a more delicate satisfaction than all this the only man in the world whom she was capable of regarding with a preference to the rest of his sex though in so elevated a rank had loved her in indigence and obscurity with honor and justified the tender sentiments she entertained for him  her smiles when she saw her brother appear and the gaiety of her behavior convinced him her mind was at ease but his features still retained that impression of chagrin he had so lately felt from the marquiss causeless rage and there was a solemnity in his manner that in an instant changed the innocent cheerfulness of henrietta into anxiety and concern  the presence of mrs knight was a restraint upon them both she perceived it and as soon as the teatable was removed for the ladies were at breakfast when mr courteney came in she retired and left them at liberty  the moment she was gone henrietta eagerly asked him if any thing had happened to give him uneasiness since she saw him  yes replied he abruptly the marquis and i have quarrelled  quarrelled repeated henrietta trembling and pale as death have you quarelled  mr courteney who observed her emotion continued to look at her so earnestly that she blushed and cast down her eyes you seem greatly affected with this accident said he at last i wish i had not mentioned it to you  could you suppose said henrietta in an accent which had at least as much of grief as tenderness in it that i could hear with indifference what must necessarily be very afflicting to you  your indifference perhaps on this occasion said mr courteney would be more welcome to me than the concern i see you under  henrietta having pondered a little on the meaning of these words replied in a firmer tone place some confidence in me brother you will find i shall deserve it  my dear henrietta resumed mr courteney affected with the manner in which she spoke and her expressive look you ought to forgive my doubts when you reflect on what miss belmour told me the merit of my noble pupil has made an impression on your heart but your marriage with him sister will bring everlasting infamy upon me  have i not already declared my resolution to you upon this head replied henrietta  the marquis loves you resumed mr courteney he is rash and inconsiderate he has no hope and indeed it would be strange if he had that the duke his father will consent to such an unequal match yet he presses me to introduce him to you as a lover and to favor his designs of marrying you privately you may easily imagine what answer i gave him the consequence is that he has declared himself my enemy we are upon very bad terms but this is not my greatest concern the marquis if he can get access to you will teaze you with solicitations and disposed as you are in his favor have i not cause to apprehend you will listen to him but too readily  although i should confirm your suspicions said henrietta with tears in her eyes yet i must again repeat i am grieved at this difference between your pupil and you nay i will own pursued she avoiding with a sweet bashfulness the earnest looks of her brother that i am not insensible of this young noblemans affection for me but after this candid confession you ought to believe me when i assure you that i will enter into no engagement with him without your approbation and to make you easy i will comply with any measures you think proper to avoid his pursuits  i see i may rely upon you said mr courteney charmed with her amiable frankness but my dear henrietta i hope you will not allow this prepossession to take too deep root in your heart sure your good sense and the delicacy of your sentiments will hinder you from giving way to a hopeless passion  i beg you not to talk to me on this subject interrupted henrietta tears in spite of her endeavors to restrain them flowing fast down her face only tell me what you would have me do to avoid the marquis have you formed any plan doubt not of my readiness to comply with it  have you any objections to boarding in a convent till mr bale comes said mr courteney  no replied henrietta half smiling for i cannot suspect you have a design upon my religion as my aunt had and mean to confine me all my life  no really resumed mr courteney smiling likewise but it will be more difficult for the marquis to get access to you in a convent than here and as it is probable enough that this affair will make some noise it will be more for your reputation to have it known that you lived in such a respectable society where there were so many witnesses of your conduct and such exact regularity required than in private lodgings where you were accountable to no body for your actions  then you intend to leave me before mr bale comes said henrietta sighing  to be sure replied mr courteney i will force the marquis away if possible and if i find all my remonstrances ineffectual the duke must interpose his authority  you intend to write to him then said henrietta  certainly replied he dont you think i ought to do so sister  indeed i do answered she  i am glad of it resumed mr courteney yet this procedure will embroil me more with the marquis but i see no help for it unless mr bale should happen to come sooner than we expect and take you with him to england i hope to prevail upon my pupil to have paris in two or three days and if i have not the satisfaction to leave you under mr bales care convent is the fittest place for you to retire to  henrietta having reflected on her brothers proposal found it so reasonable and so much t the advantage of her reputation that she readily yielded to put it in immediate execution  mrs knight being desired to return mr courteney told her their design and requested her assistance she expressed some concern at being so soon to lose her agreeable guest but undertook to transact the affair and it was resolved that she should go that day and procure the young lady to be admitted as a pensioner in the augustine nunnery of english ladies in paris  mr courteney having promised his sister to come and conduct her to the convent the next day took leave of her highly satisfied with her docility and returned home he was surprised to hear that the marquis was gone abroad but having no suspicion of his intention to visit henrietta whose abode he concluded was still a secret to him he was only concerned left his health should suffer by venturing out before it was fully reestablished  the marquiss valet no sooner saw mr courteney return than he ran immediately to acquaint his master who set forwards with a beating heart to visit his mistress the valet had given so exact a direction that the coachman had no difficulty to find the house the marquis alighted the moment the door was opened and asking the servant for miss courteney was instantly introduced into a parlour where henrietta was sitting alone mrs knight having just left her to go and execute her commission  the sight of the marquis threw her into the utmost confusion she rose however and received him with great respect he approached her bowing and made her a genteel compliment upon her happy meeting with her brother  henrietta would not suffer this subject to be dwelt upon long left it should lead to circumstances too interesting she changed the conversation to indifferent matters and took care that it should not flag a moment so that the marquis partly embarrassed by that awe which always accompanies a sincere passion and partly by the prudent management of henrietta found he had protracted his visit to a considerable length without drawing any advantage from it  alarmed at the thoughts of losing an opportunity which the rigid and inflexible temper of his governor might prevent him from meeting with again he suddenly assumed courage  make her a declaration of his passion but  terms the most tender and respectful and wi an explicitness that became one of his rank a fortune to use toward a young lady in her delicate circumstances whom he would not for a moment leave in doubt of the sincerity of his professions and his firm resolution to adhere to them  henrietta listened to him with a graceful modesty and when he earnestly pressed for her answer she assured him that she was very sensible of the honor he did her and should always think herself obliged to him for having entertained such favorable sentiments of her as could make him overlook the inequality there was between them as for the rest she referred him to her brother who she said was in the place of a father to her and by whose advice and direction she was determined to be governed entirely  the marquis would have had no reason to be dissatisfied with this answer if he had not known that he had nothing to expect from an application to her brother and the apprehension that she also knew it and therefore took this method to free herself from his importunities gave him so much concern that he turned pale and sighing fixed his eyes upon the ground his air his attitude his looks were all so moving so expressive of tenderness anxiety and grief that henrietta durst not trust herself to behold him lest he should turn his eyes toward her and discover in here is the too great interest she took in his uneasiness  some moments passed in an affecting silence on both sides during which the marquis remained immoveably fixed in the same pensive posture till rouzed by the opening of the door and the appearance of mr courteney henriettas face was in an instant covered with blushes the marquis seemed greatly embarrassed mr courteney showed some surprise at first but recovering himself he spoke to his pupil with an easy air and relieved both him and his sister from their confusion by entering immediately into an indifferent conversation  the marquis drew a favorable omen from this behavior his looks resumed their usual sweetness and vivacity and during a who hour that they continued together nothing cou be more spirited and lively than the discou between three persons who had the most perfect tenderness for one another yet from the several circumstances were obliged mutually oppose and give pain  the marquis at length with apparent relutance put an end to his visit as did mr courteney likewise though he was  ds talking to his sister in private when they were in the chariot together the young lord was several times upon the point of pressing his governor again upon the subject of his love as he seemed to be less inclined than formerly to oppose him but he was restrained from entering into any explanation by his apprehension of destroying those hopes he had so lately began to entertain and of rendering his access to henrietta more difficult for the future mr courteney also had his reasons for preventing any such explanation and industriously amused him with other discourse  the marquis could not help thinking it strange that he took no notice of the visit he had made his sister but as love is ever ready to flatter its own wishes he began to imagine that mr courteney had relaxed in the severity of his resolutions but knew not yet how to yield with a good grace he favored his embarrassment therefore for the present and they passed the remaining part of the day in their usual company and diversions  when they came home at night the marquis desired to have an hours conversation with him but mr courteney complaining of a sudden headache excused himself and retired to his own chamber  the next morning before his pupil was up he repaired to mrs knights she told him that every thing was agreed on for the reception of the young lady and he had the satisfaction to find his sister making preparations for her removal without any appearance of discontent she acquainted him with what had passed in the conversation between the marquis and her  i have no doubt of his affection for you said mr courteney we must leave the event of it to providence and act so as that whatever happens we may not incur censure  as soon as breakfast was over henrietta accompanied by mrs knight and her brother went in a coach to the convent where she was very civilly received by the prioress mr courteney promised to visit her soon and took leave of her to wait upon mrs knight home after which he returned to the marquis who had enquired for him several times  chap ix in which the reader it is presumed can make no discoveries concerning the event of this history  the marquis when he saw him enter his chamber approached him with an obliging air and affectionately pressing his hand  may i hope my dear courteney said he that you have overcome your fantastic scruples and that you will favor my pretensions to your charming sister i will make you no apology for stealing a visit to her you would i am sure have done the same in my situation indeed charles you must either resolve to give me miss courteney or to see me miserable she referred me to you my happiness depends upon a single word of yours can you be so cruel to refuse me this instance of your friendship  you know my lord replied mr courteney that there is not any thing you can desire of me consistent with my honor which i would refuse but unless i would make myself infamous i cannot yield to your marrying my sister without the dukes consent hear what i have to propose continued he perceiving him to be in a violent emotion let us return to england immediately you have often told me that the duke is a most tender father you are an only child it is possible he may be prevailed upon to yield to your desires if you tell him you cannot be happy without my sister let us make the trial at least  i agree to it interrupted the marquis eagerly provided you will promise me that if my father is so unreasonable as to refuse his consent you will no longer oppose my marriage i am of age it is fit that in a matter of such importance to the future happiness of my whole life i should be at liberty to follow my inclinations speak charles will you make me this promise  indeed i will not my lord replied mr courteney you must not expect it  detested obstinacy cried the marquis flinging his hand away which he had held till this moment what a wretch am i to have my happiness depend upon the will of a capricious man who mikakes his romantic whims for honor but observe what i say courteney added he turning hastily toward him you shall not hinder me from visiting your sister nothing but her absolute commands shall prevent my seeing her  my sister said mr courteney will stay no longer in france than till mr bale to whose care her mother left her at her death returns from montpelier he is to conduct her to england and she is gone to board in a convent till his arrival  gone to a convent repeated the marquis this is your scheme i suppose  i hoped to prevail upon you said mr courteney since you are quite recovered to leave paris immediately and i thought a convent the properest place for my sister to reside in till her guardian comes  the marquis instantly running over in his thoughts the use that might be made of this intelligence replied that he had no inclination to leave paris yet and broke off all farther conversation by quitting the room  in effect he had resolved to make an application to mr bale supposing that since he had not the same foundation for scruples as his governor he would readily listen to an offer so advantageous for his ward  mr courteney penetrated into his views and doubtful how mr bale would act and whether his sister having the sanction of his approbation might not give way to the motions of he own heart and encourage the addresses of the marquis he concluded it necessary to make the duke acquainted with the whole affair that  might take such measures as he judged proper  restrain his son from an action which might in his displeasure  he wrote accordingly that day and having thus discharged his duty his mind was more at case  the marquis full of hope that his new scheme would be successful made no effort to see henrietta for fear of raising suspicions in her brother but the coldness and reserve with which he treated him sufficiently showed how much he resented his conduct  henrietta was soon reconciled to a retirement in which she had full liberty to indulge her reflections for she was in love enough to find more satisfaction in being alone than in the gayest and most agreeable society her brother did not fail to visit her every day he found her satisfied with her situation and in appearance no otherwise affected with his approaching departure which he gave her room to expect than what her tenderness for him might well allow of  in the mean time the duke of  having received mr courteneys letter was greatly pleased with the nobleness and generosity of his behavior he wrote to him immediately in terms of the highest friendship and regard and acquainting him with the purport of his letter to his son recommended it to him to hasten his departure assuring him he had the firmest reliance upon his integrity and honor  the packet to avoid suspicion had been directed as usual to the marquis who was not surprised to find a letter in it for mr courteney to whom his father was accustomed to write often he sent it to him immediately and after reading his own he went to mr courteneys chamber holding it still in his hand  my father writes to me said he to leave paris as soon as possible he does not expressly say that he is ill but from some hints in his letter i can collect that this is the cause of his extreme earnestness to see me you cannot imagine how much i am affected with this accident pursued he sighing i love my father i did not know how much i loved him till i feared his loss i am determined to set out tomorrow from paris but i must see your sister first courteney nor ought you to refuse me the satisfaction of telling her that i depart with a firm resolution never to be but here is  well my lord replied mr courteney after a little pause we will go together and take leave of my sister  i was to blame said the marquis to expect any indulgence from you we will go together then since it must be so he retired again to his own apartment to write to his father and in the mean time mr courteney gave the necessary orders for their journey the next morning  henrietta had been prepared by a billet from her brother for the visit that was intended her the news of their departure had cost her some tears but when she was informed they waited for her in the parlour of the convent she appeared before them with all that soft composure and dignity of manners which never forsook her in the most trying situations  mr courteney watched the turn of his countenance when the marquis accosted her and was pleased to see it equally free from embarrassment and affectation and that notwithstanding all the expressive language of her lovers eyes she had so much command over herself as to seem the least interested person in company  politeness obliged the marquis to shorten his visit that the brother and sister might be at liberty to take a private leave of each other he rose from his seat and approached henrietta with an air that left her no room to doubt of his intention to say something particular to her and now for the first time her looks betrayed some little confusion  i cannot go away madam said he without renewing the declaration i made you some days ago and i take this opportunity to assure you before your brother who knows the sincerity of my heart that my sentiments for you will ever be the same and if you do not forbid it i will carry away with me the dear hope of being able one day to merit your esteem  henrietta courtefied in silence but her blushes and the soft confusion she was in seemed no unfavourable omen for the marquis he bowed respectfully and retired  mr courteney affecting not to perceive his sisters concern entered immediately after his pupils departure into other discourse he recommended it to her to improve her guardians esteem for her and assured her he would visit lady meadows and use his utmost endeavors to remove her prejudices and restore her to the place she formerly held in her affection at her desire likewise he promised to call upon mrs willis to whom she had been so greatly obliged he charged her to keep up no sort of intimacy with miss belmour though she should seek it but permitted her in company with mr bale to pay her a farewell visit and indeed the conduct of that young lady since the arrival of mr campley justified these precautions  henrietta promised to follow all his directions he said a thousand affectionate things to her and then desiring to see the prioress he tenderly recommended his sister to her care took a short leave and went home while henrietta retired to her chamber to weep  the marquis was not visible till the next morning when he was informed that the postchaise was at the door his extreme melancholy during the whole journey gave his governor great concern but he in vain attempted to amuse him for though the marquis behaved to him with all imaginable respect yet he was so cold and reserved that he found it impossible to renew his former freedom with him  the duke of  had informed them that he should be at his countryseat and immediately upon their landing in england they repaired thither the duke received his son with the most tender transports and his governor with every mark of esteem and regard  the morning after their arrival he sent for mr courteney into his closet and thanked him in very affectionate terms for having so faithfully and honorably discharged his trust he politely avoided mentioning the affair of the young lords passion for his sister because she was his sister but said enough to convince him that he had the most grateful sense of his disinterested conduct upon that occasion he settled on him during his life the sum he had allowed him while he traveled with the marquis and offered him in the most cordial manner all his interest toward procuring him an establishment suitable to his birth  mr courteney received these instances of the dukes friendship for him with respect and gratitude but he was more touched with the old noblemans delicacy with regard to his sister than with all the favors conferred on himself  the interest of this sister whom he loved with the most tender affection made him hasten his departure from the dukes seat that he might wait on his aunt who he had heard was in london the duke embraced him tenderly at parting and obliged him to promise that he would return as soon as possible the marquis lost all his reserve and coldness when he took leave of his governor his friend and what was more than all the brother of his adored henrietta  you have used me unkindly said he in a low voice yet pressing him tenderly to his breast but i shall always love you  mr courteney let fall some tears but made no answer and immediately after mounting his horse he set out for london attended by his own servant and one of the dukes whom his grace had ordered to escort him  chap x which leaves the reader still in doubt  mr courteney when he came within a short distance of london dismissed the dukes servant with compliments to his grace and the marquis and proceeded  his journey it came into his head to alight  the house of mrs willis from whom it was possible he might receive some intelligence that would be of use to him the good woman received him with great civility but when he told her his name she was in transports and enquired for her beloved miss courteney with the tender anxiety of a mother  mr courteney told her that his sister would soon be in london with her guardian he took occasion to thank her for her friendly care of her which henrietta had mentioned with the utmost gratitude and assured her he should always consider himself as highly obliged to her  how largely do i share in my dear miss courteneys joy said she for so happy a meeting with her beloved brother heaven will i doubt not shower its blessings on her for sure if ever mortal deserved them she does o sir your sister is an angelic creature   mrs willis indulging the tender effusions of her heart continued to expatiate on henriettas virtues till mr courteney though not displeased to hear her interrupted her to ask some questions concerning his aunt  i was going to write to miss courteney today sir replied she for i have great news to acquaint her with that vile priest who was the cause of all her uneasiness has at length shown himself in his true colors the sanctified hypocrite was detected in an amor with lady meadowss woman this affair has opened her eyes she thinks her niece has been greatly injured by the misrepresentations of this wretch whom she has discarded with infamy and the first proof she has given of her favorable disposition toward miss courteney was her taking again her former woman whom she had dismissed on account of her attachment to the young lady i had this intelligence  mrs white herself for so your aunt woman sir is called she says she does not doubt but her lady will write to miss courteney in the most tender manner and invite her home again  this news gave mr courteney great satisfaction he resolved not to delay a moment visiting his aunt his portmantua had been carried into a chamber by mrs williss directions and thither he retired to dress as soon as he was ready he got into a hackneycoach and fraught with a thousand kind wishes from this faithful friend of his sister he proceeded to the house of lady meadows  he was so lucky as to find her at home and sent in his name without any hesitation the old lady in a violent flutter of spirits advanced as far as the door of her apartment to meet her nephew his graceful form and polite address prejudiced her instantly in his favor and she received him with all the tenderness he could have wished and with much more than he expected  her first enquiries were for henrietta mr courteney was pleased with this solicitude but he observed that during the course of their conversation her attention with regard to his sister decreased considerably he praised her with all the modesty yet with all the affection of a brother  lady meadows who had heard a very advantageous account of her niece from the countess her good friend assured him that she knew his sisters merit and had restored her to that tenderness and esteem which some little errors of here is and some unjust suspicions of her own which had been artfully infused into her had robbed her of she expressed great satisfaction at hearing of her guardians kindness but her words i hope he will do something for her gave mr courteney great concern who from the first moment that he had heard henrietta was likely to recover her favor had formed a scheme to make her and the marquis happy  lady meadows perceived that he was affected with that expression she therefore added that his sister might depend upon a welcome reception from her whenever she returned to england  though there was nothing to object to the words of this declaration yet there was a great deal to the manner of it in the coldness with which she made it he saw the disappointment of his hopes in reality lady meadows had begun to entertain a prodigious fondness for her nephew and henrietta had now but the second place in her affection the longer she conversed with him the more this fondness increased women are ever readier to discover merit in the other sex than their own henrietta had as many amiable qualities as her brother but lady meadows was not so sensible of them and mr courteney made as great a progress in her affections in three hours as his sister had done in as many months  when he rose up to take his leave she declared with some vehemence that he must have no other home than her house you have an aunt added she smiling though you have no uncle nor any other relations mr courteney reddened with indignation at the mention of his unworthy uncle but recovering himself he made her suitable acknowledgments for her kindness and at her desire immediately dispatched a messenger to mrs willis to acquaint her that he should not return and at the same time sent orders to his servant to bring his portmantua  lady meadows having given directions for an apartment to be prepared for mr courteney they passed the evening together with great satisfaction particularly on the part of the old lady who thought herself extremely happy in having so accomplished a youth for her nephew all her thoughts ran upon the pleasure she should have in showing him to her friends and acquaintance and of piquing his unnatural uncle by openly professing her regard for him  more than a week after his arrival was spent in a continual succession of visits to all which he attended her and so absolutely had he won her heart in that time that she determined on nothing less than the making him her sole heir mr courteney who was desirous of improving the favor he was in to his sisters advantage took all opportunities to revive his aunts affection for her so that to please him she expressed an impatience to see her he received letters from her and from the duke of  the same day henrietta informed him that she had heard from mr bale and that she expected him in paris in a few days that the affairs he had to settle there would detain him but a short time after which they were to set out immediately for england she added that the marquis had wrote to her and gave him a brief recapitulation of his letter which seemed to be dictated by the most ardent affection and the strictest principles of honor  the dukes letter contained only an earnest request to see him as soon as possible lady meadows was very unwilling to part with him though he assured her he would return in two or three days he spent part of the night in answering his sisters letter and set out the next morning in a postchaise for the duke seat he reached it in the evening at support time  he found only the duke and his son at table in the countenance of the latter he observed a profound melancholy which sensibly affected him the duke received him with great kindness the marquis spoke little but seemed pleased to see him the next morning the duke sent for mr courteney into his closet  what shall i do with my son said he to him abruptly as soon as he entered you see the way he is in he will certainly break my heart i made him a very advantageous proposal three days ago he tells me positively his heart is engaged yet he knows i am very desirous the match i mentioned to him should take place this is such an instance of obstinacy and disobedience as i know not how to pardon little did i imagine that his return which i so passionately wished for would be productive of so much uneasiness to me  the duke paused here and looked earnestly at mr courteney who not knowing what it was he expected from him or to what aim his words were directed continued silent with his eyes fixed on the ground  i see you are concerned resumed the duke for the trouble this unlucky affair gives me  indeed i am my lord most sincerely replied mr courteney  then i may depend upon your readiness to assist me in removing it said his grace hear what i have to propose  your sister allowing for the warmth of an admirers imagination appears to me by my sons count of her to have a great deal of merit such a young lady cannot be without pretenders to her heart it would give me great pleasure to contribute to her establishment if you have a match in view for her let me know if i can forward it either by my purse or my interest i heartily confess to you that mere generosity is not my motive for making you this offer my sons passion is strengthened by hope when your sister is married i may find it less difficult to prevail upon him to yield me the obedience i require and which i have a right to expect  you do not answer me mr courteney added his grace after a little pause is there any thing disagreeable in this proposal  thus pressed my lord replied mr courteney it becomes me to speak with plainness and sincerity  i have no power over my sisters inclinations and no consideration whatever should oblige me to hurry her into a marriage which her own choice did not direct her to besides i am not without suspicions that the merit of the marquis has made some impression on her heart and though she has sacrificed it to her honor and duty yet it will for some time no doubt render her deaf to any offer that could be made her i am very certain my lord that she will never encourage the addresses of the marquis without your graces consent but were she capable of acting differently from my hopes and expectations my honor is concerned to prevent it and i most solemnly assure your grace that my sister shall never be the wife of the marquis without your express approbation  the duke could not help being pleased with the candor and spirit of this reply we must leave this affair then as we found it said he i am so well convinced of your integrity and honor that i rely upon you entirely to prevent any consequences that may be disagreeable to me  the duke that moment perceiving his son crossing the terrace opposite to his window desired mr courteney to join him you have still great influence over the marquis said he try what your persuasions can do to make him alter his behavior this obstinacy of his both afflicts and offends me  mr courteney bowed and quitted the dukes closet immediately the marquis when he saw him coming toward him stopped to wait for him  you have been closeted with my father said he to him smiling may i know the subject of your conversation  i dare engage your lordship guesses replied mr courteney smiling likewise  i believe i do said the marquis the duke has been complaining of me for my disobedience has he not  his grace tells me he has made you a proposal my lord which you have rejected answered mr courteney and he is under great concern about it  well i am sorry for his uneasines interrupted the marquis but there  help for it  ah my lord said mr courteney have i not cause to be very uneasy also i who know your motive for disobliging the duke in a point he seems to have so much at heart  you are mistaken resumed the marquis i should act as i do though i had never seen miss courteney but tell me my dear charles have you heard from your sister  i have my lord replied he  she is well i hope resumed the marquis sighing  she says nothing to the contrary answered mr courteney but i find your lordship has wrote to her  then she mentions me in her letter cried the marquis eagerly i did indeed write to her but she would not favor me with an answer but dear charles continued he have you not miss courteneys letter about you let me see that part where i am mentioned show me only my name written by her dear hand you know not what pleasure it will give me to see it  upon my honor i have not her letter here said mr courteney why why my lord pursued he in great concern will you indulge this fatal passion for my sister you must by this time be convinced that it can produce nothing but uneasiness to the duke yourself to me and even to her  to her repeated the marquis o charles your sister is wrapped up in indifference and reserve she has not the least sensibility for what i suffer upon her account  you are too generous my lord replied mr courteney to wish my sister should encourage any sentiments for you but those of respect and esteem it would be presumption in her to hope for the dukes approbation of your passion and were she too sensible of it she must be unhappy  it is enough for me to be unhappy resumed the marquis sighing unhappy in the avarice of my father to whom i have laid open my whole heart the want of a fortune is all the objection he has to miss courteney for he appeared charmed with her character and her birth he knows unhappy too in a rigid friend who sacrifices me to the fantastic notions he has formed of honor o charles little did i imagine once that you would have contributed all in your power to make me miserable  indeed my lord replied mr courteney this reflection is cruel this very moment all my thoughts are employed on the means to make you happy  now you are again my friend interrupted the marquis embracing him eagerly will you then at last give me your charming sister all that duty can require i have performed i have implored my fathers consent he has had the cruelty to refuse it me and this on a motive so sordid that i am justifiable in following my inclinations without soliciting him any more  you mistake my intentions my lord interrupted mr courteney no never expect that i will consent to your marrying my sister without the dukes approbation  what then did you mean said the marquis by the hopes you gave me just now  to prevail if possible upon the duke to consent to your marriage replied mr courteney  the marquis sighed and cast down his eyes as if hopeless that this expedient would succeed but would not say any thing to divert him from his purpose yet he thought it strange that he should undertake a task which interested as he was seemed less proper for him than any other person  mrcourteney guessed his thoughts but would not explain himself any farther in reality what the marquis had said of his fathers having no other objection to his choice but the want of a fortune confirmed him in his design of using the favor he was in with lady meadows to the advantage of his sister and he was not without expectations of prevailing upon her by the prospect of so honorable a match for her niece to do as much for her as she had formerly promised in case she had married the old baronet  the marquis who beheld him earnestly perceived something was laboring in his mind and he began to entertain hopes of success though he knew not on what reasonably to found them i cannot said mr courteney observing the tender solicitude with which he gazed on him communicate to you the scheme i have formed to reconcile the duke to your wishes for reasons which will be obvious enough hereafter only thus much i will say to satisfy you that i think it is highly probable i shall succeed but there is one condition which you must yield to and which i tell you plainly is the price i set upon my endeavors to serve you in this affair  name it interrupted the marquis eagerly it must be a strange one indeed if i do not comply with it  you must give me a solemn promise my lord resumed mr courteney not to seek my sisters consent to a clandestine marriage if i should fail in my endeavors to procure the dukes approbation and you must make the same promise to his grace likewise  nay my lord pursued he observing that he hesitated you risk nothing by entering into this engagement for i am bound by oath as well as by honor to prevent my sister from being yours upon any terms but the dukes express consent and depend upon it you will never gain here is but on the same condition  well replied the marquis you have my promise and i will make the same declaration to my father it will be time enough to tell him if your scheme proves unsuccessful my fixed resolution never to marry at all if i do not marry miss courteney  mr courteney had already gained so important a point that he did not think it necessary to combat this resolution at that time they walked together into the house and the marquis conceiving that it might be of some advantage to mr courteneys scheme to take an early opportunity of making the promise he required of him the duke had that satisfaction in his next private conversation with his son and was charmed with this new instance of mr courteneys integrity  the marquis after having long puzzled himself with conjectures about the design mr courteney had formed at length concluded that he had some expectations from the earl of  his uncle in favor of his sister and he was so unfortunately circumstanced between his fathers avarice and mr courteneys strict principles of honor that he was reduced to wish earnestly for the success of an expedient which he would have disdained if he had been master of his own actions mr courteney at parting which was in a few days begged him to rely securely upon his friendship and to be mindful of the promise he had given him which the young lord again confirmed  chap xi in which the history draws near to a conclusion  mr courteney found his short absence had rather endeared him to his aunt than lessened the ardor of her fondness encouraged by her behavior he was several times upon the point of laying open to her the whole affair of his pupils passion for henrietta and the difficulties which obstructed so advantageous a match difficulties which she could so easily remove but he hoped a great deal from the presence of henrietta which it was highly probable would revive the old ladys tenderness for her and from the interposition of mr bale who it was not to be doubted would enter heartily into the interest of his ward for whom he expressed so tender an affection  while he waited in anxious expectation of a letter from his sister to acquaint him when she was to leave paris with her guardian he was pleasingly surprised with a billet from mr bale himself requesting him to meet miss courteney and him at the house of mrs willis where they were just arrived  mr courteney without communicating this news to lady meadows hastened to see his beloved sister the moment he entered the room where she was sitting with her guardian and mrs willis she flew to receive him with a transport of joy he embraced her tenderly and mr bale advancing to salute him he in the politest manner thanked him for his generous care of henrietta  mr bale was extremely pleased to hear that she might depend upon an affectionate reception from her aunt and now my child said he for so he tenderly affected to call her since i have delivered you safe into the hand of your brother i will leave you and a day or two hence i will visit you at your aunts and settle your affairs in a manner which i hope will not be disagreeable to you  henrietta who from some past conversations with him well knew the kind purport of these words by a grateful look and a respectful courtesy expressed her acknowledgment mr courteney seeing him prepare to leave them begged he would favor him with a few moments private conversation mr bale readily consented upon which mrs willis showed them into another room and returned to load her dear miss courteney with a thousand tender caresses  mean time mr courteney gave the friendly guardian of his sister a brief account of the marquiss passion for her and the conduct he had observed in that affair he added that he believed it would be easy to engage the dukes consent to his sons marriage with henrietta provided her aunt would act as generously toward her as she had formerly given her reason to expect  from several hints said he which lady meadows has thrown out and from the great kindness she expresses for me i am apprehensive that she intends to transfer her bounty from my sister to me but as my circumstances though not affluent are easy and as i have nothing so much at heart as the happiness of my friend and my sister i will most cheerfully relinquish in her favor all my expectations from lady meadows the prospect of so advantageous a match will probably have some weight with her aunt and the mention of it will come with propriety from you sir as the guardian of henrietta lady meadows will then explain herself clearly and we shall have an opportunity given us of pressing her to remove by her generosity the only obstacle that obstructs my sisters advancement  mr bale was prodigiously affected with the uncommon nobleness of this proceeding he took the young gentlemans hand and giving it an affectionate shake i shall love and honor you while i live said he for this generous proposal doubt not of my ready concurrence in every measure for your sisters advantage i love her as well as if she was my own daughter and the inconveniences she has suffered through the folly and imprudence of some of my family require that i should make her amends by doing every thing in my power to make her happy  i will wait upon lady meadows pursued he tomorrow in the afternoon and then we will talk over this affair mr courteney told him he would prepare his aunt for the visit he intended her after which mr bale went away and he joined his sister and her friend a coach being ordered they took leave of mrs willis whom henrietta promised to visit again very speedily mr courteney had some discourse with his sister as they went concerning the marquis but carefully avoided mentioning his design to her lest he should raise hopes which might be unhappily disappointed  henrietta was under some perturbation at the thoughts of appearing before her aunt whose displeasure against her and unjust suspicions all recurred to her memory but the reception the old lady gave her immediately effaced those impressions it was perfectly kind and affectionate without the least mixture of upbraiding or reproach  i had a mind to surprise you madam said mr courteney who with infinite pleasure beheld his sister so tenderly embraced by her aunt lady meadows assured him that he had surprised her very agreeably and again embracing henrietta told her that her good friend the countess of  had been very lavish in her praise and had acquainted her with several circumstances of her conduct which had raised her highly in her opinion  i suppose you will not be very much grieved added the old lady smiling to hear that your former lover lord b  is married to the citizens daughter  no indeed madam replied henrietta they seemed to be formed for each other  they are not very happy i hear said lady meadows who having fallen upon the article of domestic news related a great number of anecdotes concerning her acquaintance some of which henrietta had oftenheard before the old ladys fondness for talking at length gave way to her curiosity to hear every thing that had happened to her niece during their separation  henrietta gratified it with discretion suppressing whatever might tend to revive disagreeable remembrances she was now put into possession of her former apartment and had an opportunity that night to congratulate her old friend mrs white who assisted her to undress upon her being reinstated in the favor of her lady  chap xii which concludes the history  the next day mr courteney informed lady meadows that mr bale intended to wait on her and hinted that he had a match to propose for henrietta which he hoped she would approve  lady meadows who had already taken her resolution with regard to both brother and sister told him that she was very desirous of seeing her niece settled and that she was determined never to oppose her inclinations being convinced that her virtue and prudence were to be entirely depended upon  mr bale came according to his appointment and being soon after left alone with lady meadows he acquainted her with the whole affair between the marquis of  and henrietta as he had received it from mr courteney and observing that the old lady was dazzled with the prospect of her niece becoming a duchess added that the want of a suitable fortune should not hinder the advancement of henrietta for whatever you design for her madam said he i will double so great is my regard for her and admiration of her virtues  lady meadows with reason thought this a very generous proposal she complimented him upon it and stepping to her cabinet took out a box that contained her will and another deed which had been drawn up while mr courteney was in the country with the duke of  but were not yet executed she put these papers into mr bales hands and desired him to read them saying you will there see sir what i intend to do for my nephew and his sister  mr bale opened the first which was the will he found she had constituted mr courteney her heir leaving him her whole estate charging it only with the sum of five thousand pounds to be paid his sister on the day of her marriage the other paper contained a settlement of three hundred pounds a year upon mr courteney during her life  mr bale who knew the young gentlemans sentiments proposed to lady meadows to send for him and acquaint him with her intentions to this she readily agreed mr courteney turned pale when he heard the moderate sum designed for his sister and after expressing his gratitude to lady meadows for the favor she showed him in terms the most respectful and affectionate he earnestly conjured her to let henrietta be at least an equal sharer with him in her kindness he urged as a motive to her to comply the very advantageous match that was proposed to his sister he expatiated on the marquiss tender and faithful passion for her and touched with great delicacy upon the sentiments henrietta could not avoid entertaining for a young nobleman who had loved her with honor even when ignorant of her birth and when she was under very humiliating circumstances  lady meadows interrupted him with the most flattering praises of his disinterestedness but declared that her resolution was unalterable your sister will have ten thousand pounds said she this is no despicable fortune and since there is so much love on the side of the marquis there is no doubt but it will be thought sufficient  mr bale explained the old ladys meaning by telling him what he proposed to do for miss courteney and preventing the young gentlemans acknowledgments you have sufficiently shown your regard for your sister said he and i am of opinion we ought not to press lady meadows any more on this subject she has acted nobly by you both  the lady was extremely flattered by the praise mr bale gave her and to prevent any more solicitations from her nephew she signed the papers immediately which mr bale at her request witnessed  mr courteney said every thing that gratitude and politeness could suggest upon her presenting him the settlement yet there was an air of concern upon his countenance which mr bale observing took an opportunity to desire him in a whisper to meet him at a coffeehouse which he named to him that evening having something to say to him which he hoped would make all things easy  mr courteney promised to attend him he then begged lady meadows not to let henrietta know what had passed with regard to the marquis at present said he she considers this marriage as impossible to be effected and so i would have her consider it till i am sure that the duke will make no objection to the fortune that is designed her lady meadows approved of his caution and mr bale was desired to visit her in her own apartment and acquaint her with the dispositions made by her aunt  henrietta expressed the highest satisfaction at what had been done for her beloved brother and with the greatest sweetness acknowledged her obligations to her aunt for the provision she had made for her but when mr bale acquainted her with the addition he designed to make to the fortune her aunt would give her tears of tenderness and gratitude overspread her face and she could utter no more than o sir how generous  how kind is this  how shall i repay such unexampled goodness   mr bale interrupted her soft exclamations to lead her down stairs to her aunt to whom she paid her acknowledgments with inimitable grace and congratulated her brother with so sincere a joy that he who knew how much she was likely to lose by his good fortune was moved almost to tears  mr bale a short time afterward took his leave and went to the coffeehouse where he had appointed mr courteney to meet him he was soon followed by the young gentleman whose mind was under great agitations on his sisters account  one would hardly imagine said mr bale to him smiling that you have just been declared heir to a good estate you look like one disappointed and unhappy  i am indeed disappointed sir replied mr courteney i had laid a plan to make my sister and my friend happy but my aunts partiality has broke all my measures for the present  then you intend said mr bale who had taken particular notice of his last words to make some addition to your sisters fortune when the estate comes into your hands  certainly sir replied mr courteney i should but ill deserve it if i did not  it must be confessed resumed mr bale that you are a very good brother  all that i can do for my sister sir said he will be but bare justice but your generosity t her can never be enough admired  no more of that interrupted mr bale i love your sister she is a worthy young woman i am grieved to think so noble a match for her should meet with any obstruction for the want of a fortune what do you think the duke will expect  the lady he has proposed to his son sir said mr courteney has twenty thousand pounds and it would have been my pride and happiness to have prevailed with my aunt to make my sisters fortune equal to that  is it possible cried mr bale surprised why fifteen thousand pounds is at least one third of your aunts fortune  my sister said mr courteney has a right to expect it the whole would have been here is but for some unlucky accidents and the strange partiality of lady meadows for me all that i can now do is to let the marquis know that my sister will have ten thousand pounds paid on the day of her marriage and ten thousand more on the death of her aunt the duke loves money and i greatly doubt whether all his sons solicitations will make him relish this reversionary ten thousand pounds  we will not put it to the hazard interrupted mr bale since you are determined to act thus generously by your sister i will lay down the money myself and all the security i require is your bond for the repayment of it when your aunts estate comes into your possession  mr courteney was so overwhelmed with surprise joy and gratitude for this unexpected noble offer that during some moments he was unable to utter a word but this silence accompanied with looks the most expressive that can be imagined was more eloquent than any language could be recovering himself at last he was beginning to pay the warmest acknowledgments but mr bale would not suffer him to proceed  i am impatient said he for the conclusion of this affair write to your friend immediately and let him know that your sisters guardian will treat with the duke his father whenever he pleases  mr courteney at his reiterated request took leave of him and went home in order to communicate this joyful news to his friend hearing that lady meadows and his sister were engaged in company he went to his own apartment and wrote a short letter to the marquis in which he acquainted him that his sister being restored to the favor of her aunt he had it now in his power to assure him that if he continued in the same sentiments toward her and could prevail with his grace to authorize them by his consent he was empowered by her aunt and her guardian to declare that her fortune would be twenty thousand pounds  having sealed and dispatched this letter to the post he joined the company below stairs with looks so full of satisfaction and a behavior animated with such extraordinary gaiety that lady meadows was more than ever delighted with him concluding that the noble provision she had made for him was the source of his joy but henrietta who knew her brother better and who besides saw something particular in those looks which he from time to time gave her felt strange flutterings in her gentle bosom hopes checked as soon as formed wishes suppressed as they rose in these perturbations she passed that night and the three following days  mean time the marquis having received mr courteneys letter was so surprised at this sudden change in the fortune of henrietta that he read it over several times before he could persuade himself what he saw was real his first emotions were all transport every obstacle to his marriage was now removed and he might solicit his fathers consent with a certainty almost of not being denied yet a sentiment of delicacy and tenderness made him regret that it was not in his power to convince henrietta of the disinterestedness of his love and for some moments rendered him insensible of his present happiness  the duke came into his chamber while he was reading the letter the twentieth time and so intently that he did not perceive his entrance when suddenly raising his eyes and seeing his father who suspecting that this letter which he seemed to read with so much emotion came from his mistress was looking earnestly on him  o my lord cried he there is nothing wanting to make me perfectly happy but your consent to my marriage with miss courteney see my lord what her brother writes her brother who till now has so obstinately opposed my passion  the duke took the letter out of his hands and having read it returned it to him again without speaking a word and walked to the other end of the room the marquis who saw nothing unfavourable in his looks followed him and throwing himself at his feet conjured him not to oppose his happiness any longer the duke desired time to consider but his son would not give over his solicitations till he had obtained leave of him to visit miss courteney and to declare that his addresses had the sanction of his consent  the happy marquis gave orders instantly for his postchaise to be got ready which his father at first did not oppose but after reflecting a little  can you not rein in your impatience for a few days said he to him i intend to be in town next week i shall then have an opportunity of seeing the young lady and since you are so obstinately bent upon the match of talking to her aunt and her guardian  the marquis would not disoblige his father by making any objections to this little delay grievous as it was to him but retired to write to mr courteney whom he acquainted with the dukes intentions and anticipating the tender name of brother poured out his whole heart in the warmest expressions of love friendship joy and every soft emotion with which he was agitated  mr courteney having communicated this letter to mr bale he agreed that it was necessary to make lady meadows acquainted with the steps they had taken in the affair she entered with a good grace into the generous designs of her nephew in favor of his sister  if i had done more for her said she to him smiling you would not have had an opportunity of doing so much mr courteney kissed her hand with a tender and respectful air  go said she with a look that showed she was highly pleased go and tell your sister this good news and tell her also that i am impatient to embrace and congratulate her  mr courteney willingly obeyed her he went to henriettas apartment and seeing her sitting pensive and melancholy he began to rally her upon her tenderness for the marquis she bore it with great sweetness but not without some surprise for her brother was used to be very delicate and reserved upon that subject by degrees he assumed a more serious tone and at length gave her to understand that the marquis was now permitted by his father to pay his addresses to her  henrietta blushed and trembled from the moment her brother began to speak to her in a serious manner her emotions increased as he proceeded yet she labored to conceal them till mr courteney explaining to her what mr bale had done for her which necessarily included his own generous gift that innate delicacy which had forced her joy to be silent suffered her gratitude to show itself in the most lively expressions lady meadows came into the room and gave a seasonable interruption to these tender effusions of her heart which mr courteney had listened to with a kind of painful pleasure she embraced her niece and congratulated her on her happy fortune  miss courteney who had now reason to expect a visit from the marquis was not much surprised a few days afterward to see his equipage at the door after a few moments conversation with mr courteney he was introduced to lady meadows who received him with great respect henrietta blushed a little when he appeared but recovered herself and received the tender and respectful compliment he made her with her usual grace  a great deal of company coming in soon afterward he found means to engage her apart for a quarter of an hour their conversation was such as might be expected between persons of their sense and politeness who loved each other with the utmost tenderness and now for the first time saw themselves at liberty to declare their sentiments henrietta did not scruple to own to the man who had so nobly merited her esteem that her heart had received a most tender impression for him and this soft acknowledgment completed her lovers felicity  mr courteney waited upon the duke the next morning and had the pleasure to hear from his own mouth that he was entirely satisfied with his sons proceedings his grace visited lady meadows the same day and was so charmed with henrietta that he scarce discovered less impatience than his son for the conclusion of the marriage every thing being agreed on between the duke and mr bale with regard to settlements the writings were drawn up with all convenient speed and a day appointed for the marriage  lady meadows though a roman catholic allowed the ceremony to be performed at her house after which the newmarried pair with the old lady the duke mr bale and mr courteney set out for his graces country seat  the charming marchioness did not make her first public appearance in town till late in the ensuing winter when her beauty her sufferings her virtue and her good fortune were for a long time the subjects of conversation  mr courteney happy in the conscious integrity of his heart happy in the ardent affection of his sister and the marquis and the esteem of all who knew him was by the death of lady meadows which happened a few months after his sisters marriage enabled to discharge his obligations to mr bale his generosity was not long unrewarded an opulent heiress fell desperately in love with him she was related to the duke who interested himself so warmly in the affair that the marriage was soon concluded  lord b  as has been observed already lived very unhappy with his plebeian lady the sight of the charming henrietta renewed his passion tortured with remorse disappointment and despair he had recourse to the bottle and fell an early sacrifice to intemperance  miss woodby who had always a violent passion for a redcoat listened to the sighs of a young cadet and married him in a week after their first acquaintance her excuse for this precipitancy was that the lovely youth would certainly have stabbed himself if she had delayed his happiness any longer with part of her fortune he bought a commission and spent the rest in a few months after which he went abroad with his regiment leaving her in an obscure retirement to bewail his absence and sooth her lovesick heart with hopes that he would return more passionate than ever and lay all his laurels at her feet  miss belmour forsaken by her lover became a proselyte to the roman catholic religion and retired to a convent where the nuns wrought her up to such a degree of enthusiasm that she settled her whole fortune upon the community and took the veil but soon afterward repenting of this rash step she died of grief remorse and disappointment  mrs willis was generously rewarded by the marchioness for the many kind and faithful services she had received from her and mr bale who highly esteemed her for her behavior to his beauteous ward settled her husband in such an advantageous way that in a few years he made a considerable fortune  the younger mr bale found in the incessant clamours of a jealous wife a sufficient punishment for his treacherous designs on henrietta and it was not without great difficulty that he was restored to his fathers favor  every branch of the courteney family made frequent advances toward a reconciliation with the marchioness and her brother but generous as they were they had too just a sense of the indignities they had suffered from them to admit of it and in this steady resentment they had as it usually happens with successful persons the world on their side  the end
