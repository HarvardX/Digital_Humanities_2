observations on the increased population healthiness etc of the town of maidstone  the arms of maidstone   printed and sold by j blake sold also by j file parish clerk mdcclxxxii  observations etc maidstone is situated upon the banks of the river medway nearly in the center of the county of kent the country around it is remarkably fine highly cultivated and exceedingly rich and fertile and from its continual diversity of surface affords as great a variety of pleasing views and beautiful landscapes as can well be conceived the soil is dry firm and rocky abounds with excellent water nor are there any putrid marshes or stagnant pools within or without to corrupt its atmosphere the air is therefore pure and salubrious and a lofty ridge of hills serves as a screen against the unwholesome vapors and pernicious blasts of the north and north east  the population and of course the trade and prosperity of the town seem to have been greatly advanced during the present century the inhabitants were numbered in the year      by the reverend mr innys with a minuteness and particularity which descended to the prefession sex and age of each individual and there were at that time in the town and parish      persons in march      a very careful and there is reason to believe not inaccurate survey again was taken when the number was      consequently an increase of  0   inhabitants in the course of about    years from a strict and fair examination of the parish register it appears at least with a strong degree of probability that the greater part of this addition of more than half the original number has been made during the last go years the very period when ingenious and speculative men have believed and asserted that the depopulation of great britain has been uncommonly rapid and that we have as it were been sinking fast into absolute annihilation  before we proceed to our intended observations it may not be amiss to illustrate the advantages to be derived from accurate registers of mortality in the words of dr percival the establishment of a judicious and accurate register of births and burials in every town and parish would be attended with the most important advantages medical political and moral by such an institution the increase or decrease of certain diseases the comparative healthiness of different situations climates and seasons the influence of particular trades and manufactures on longevity with many other curious circumstances not more interesting to physicians than beneficial to mankind would be ascertained with tolerable precision in a political view exact registers of human mortality are of still greater consequence as the number of people and progress of population in the kingdom may in the most easy and unexceptionable manner be deduced from them they are the foundation likewise of all calculations concerning the values of assurances on lives reversionary payments and of every scheme for providing annuities for widows and persons in old age in a moral light also such tables are of evident utility as the increase of vice or virtue may be determined by observing the proportion which the diseases arising from luxury intemperance and other similar causes bear to the rest and in what particular places distempers of this class are found to be most fatal percivals essays vol  d  the parish registers of this kingdom indeed have not generally been kept with that degree of minute and accurate discrimination necessary for all the useful and curious deductions here suggested nor can it be pretended that that of maidstone in particular has it appears however that the insertion of baptisms marriages and burials in it after the common and ordinary way has been always so extremely regular as to afford in conjunction with actual surveys at different periods much pleasing and satisfactory information nay it may be truly added that during the last  0 or  0 years it has some peculiar recommendation which will be apparent from the tables subjoined should the matter engage the attention of the medical gentlemen of the town who are certainly best able to assist and direct in an undertaking of this kind it will probably for the future have every requisite distinction and be annually published as regular bills of mortality the cities of norwich and carlisle the towns of northampton eccles and some others have set the example maidstone need not be ashamed to follow as it will appear that in some respects she is little inferior to any and greatly superior to most of them in the mean time and till the register acquires this desirable perfection we will make the best use we can of it in its present state  table i baptisms burials and marriages in the town of

many curious conclusions the first  0 years that is during the reigns of james the  d of william the  d and of queen ann we observe that both the baptisms and burials and of course the number of people were considerably diminished notwithstanding that the thread manufacture which is now dwindled to almost nothing was then in its most flourishing state  from this era quite through the reign of george the  st and to the latter end of george the  d the baptisms were continually increasing the burials however advanced in a much greater proportion and at intervals with singular inequality insomuch that in the  0 years beginning with      they were the more numerous by above  00 or almost one  th of the whole we cannot therefore certainly conclude that the inhabitants were much augmented but only that the mortality of the town from whatever cause was greatly increased from that time to the present the baptisms have been almost continually gaining on the burials till in the  0 years now immediately past they have got nearly  00 before them which probably indicates the double advantage of multiplied numbers and diminished unhealthiness upon casting an eye over the annual lists of burials we see that before the modern improved practice of inoculation was introduced every   or   years the average number was almost constantly doubled and it is found upon enquiry that at such intervals nearly the small pox used to repeat its dreadful periodical visits the numbers which died of this distemper were not particularly noticed in the register till the year      when they amounted to  0 persons out of the  0  that died in that year and  0  out of     in    0 and    out of     in       prior to these instances it broke out in the year      and twice more in the course of about    years immediately subsequent to that at each of which times it raged with greater violence and made much more terrible havoc than in either of the periods abovementioned we may therefore very fairly conclude that in the short space of  0 years it deprived the town of between   and  00 of its inhabitants whereas in the    or    years that have elapsed since the general inoculation it has occasioned the death of only about  0 ample and satisfactory evidence of the vast benefit the town has received from this salutary invention and it appears with a high degree of probability upon proofs similar to the above that from the same causes in the kingdom at large not less than   or  00000 lives were lost in the former of the periods now stated and that nearly half that number has been saved in the latter  in the year      the inhabitants were only as before observed      the annual burials on an average of  0 years immediately preceding were     and the annual mortality   in    of the whole population in      the people were      the annual burials upon an average of the same number of years taken in the same relation only     and the proportionate mortality about   in    of course a diminution thereof has happened of more than a  th since the former era this may perhaps in some small degree be ascribed to the greater care and cleanliness observed in our prisons the bettered condition of many of our inhabitants as well as houses the improvements in physic and surgery and the generally more skilful treatment of various disorders but principally and chiefly to that

avera                from this table we may conjecture the progress of population during the last  0 years in the prodigious increase both of marriages and baptisms the annual average of baptisms for the   years beginning with      was only     but for the   years now immediately past it has been     the marriages in the former period were annualy    in the latter    making the one or the other the standard of computation or both united the town seems to have acquired almost of its present inhabitants since the year      and after every fair deduction it can scarcely be less than   or  00 persons and it may here be observed that the marriage register while supported by correspondent baptisms is at once a presumptive evidence of the past and the present and a faithful promise with regard to the future  the marriage register considered in another point of view bears very honorable testimony in favor of the inhabitants one of the best and most accurate of the french writers on the subject of population estimates the average proportion of marriages to the whole number of people in france at about   to   0 and in the city of paris at   to almost   0 when it is considered what multitudes their ecclesiastical institutions absurdly condemn to celibacy we may naturally suppose that the proportion with us is much higher by the following table we see that in maidstone it is as   to  0  which is not only higher than the french average with all the prodigious advantage derived from he country parishes but superior to most other towns of similar description though inferior size even in england  table iv proportion of the number of annual marriages to the total population in the following places respectively counties parishes no of inhabitants proportion of marriages essex

marriages for the  0 years beginning with      were considerably less than the  0 years immediately preceding now this was the very period in which the marriage act took place and this decrease of weddings may at first sight suggest a conclusion greatly to its disadvantage and induce one to suppose that it has operated as a powerful restraint upon matrimony but nothing can be more fallacious than such a supposition the marriage act has doubtless promoted regularity and order has sometimes restrained folly and prevented misery but scarcely a shadow of evidence has yet been produced that it has at all obstructed judicious connections encouraged illicit intercourse or diminished legal population the diminution of marriages in the instance before us evidently arose from hence a surrogate constantly resided in the town before the marriage act he had often no doubt influence sufficient to engage the parties to whom he granted a license to grant him in return the privilege of marrying them but this was afterward effectually prevented by their being obliged to have the solemnity performed in the parish to which one of them belonged hence the surrogate missed the additional advantage of the marriage see and the weddings in the town were immediately diminished but unquestionably they are to be found in the registers of the neighboring parishes for taking a vast number and variety of parishes of every size situation and description it appears that the aggregate proportion of marriages and burials has been considerably greater since the marriage act took place than before which if it be not absolute demonstration is at least strong presumptive evidence that instead of discouraging matrimony it has greatly promoted it and been a powerful check to licentiousness  table v

in the former period was about as   to   in the latter nearly as   to   of marriages to baptisms alone in the former period as   to    0 0  in the latter as   to    0 00 of marriages to burials alone in the former period as   to     00 in the latter as   to     00 the fairest conclusion from this is that the wise and judicious regulations of the abovementioned act have greatly increased the number and proportion of marriages by rendering it more difficult for any persons to enjoy the reputation of matrimony without being really and actually married  a very striking circumstance offers itself in the register of burials by the survey of      it appears that the number of maies was     fewer than the females and yet on an average of the last  0 years the male burials were annually about   more than the female and it will be found upon making the requisite computations that only   in more than  0 have annually died of the females and almost   in    of the males and the same proportion has probably held throughout the  00 years as the total of male deaths are to the female nearly as    to    what can this prodigious difference be owing to some allowance is doubtless to be made for the great number of female servants who come principally from the country at perhaps the most healthy period of human life and who by the late survey alone amounted to     of the     by which the females exceed the males but this circumstance will not account for the  th part of the disproportion before us  both french and english philosophers seem to concur in opinion that women are naturally longer lived than men but it may perhaps be doubted whether this be founded upon evidence sufficiently various and extensive from mere analogical reasoning just the contrary might be concluded men are a greater number of years in coming to their full perfection both in body and mind and it is a general law of nature that by how much longer any animal or vegetable is in growing by so much the longer it is in decaying men are also of a constitution more firm and robust nor are they liable to an equal number and variety of diseases on every account therefore they appear fitted for a more extended duration and agreeable to this obvious inference it is a wellknown and generally acknowledged fact that some men have lived to a greater age than even any women have done  the very ingenious dr heysham of carlisle has remarked that the constitutions of males are fitted for laborious exertions and that their muscular and nervous fibers may therefore be supposed to become stiff rigid and incapable of performing the functions necessary to health and life sooner than those of females both on account of their original texture and the friction which must necessarily occur from laborious exercise but this reasoning however plausible cannot perhaps be admitted because in country parishes where the laborious exertions of the men are beyond comparison the greatest the difference respecting the mortality we are speaking of is vastly the least and some times likewise much in savor of the male inhabitants as is eminently the case in the parish of brightling in sussex and many other instances similar to it might easily be produced  men it is true are sometimes exposed to greater dangers and more numerous hardships than women yet excepting soldiers failors fishermen colliers and miners and probably a few manufacturers this circumstance has a very confined and trivial operation  there is one cause still behind universally allowed to operate and which alone perhaps is funy adequate to the effect men are in general especially in large and populous towns more intemperate than women both in eating and drinking and are likewise more commonly chargeable with every other irregularly and licentiousness of conduct to these therefore may their greater mortality be most frequently imputed and thus this singular circumstance of register evidence becomes a serious topic of

the first beginning with year      the second with      and it is wonderful to observe the perfect correspondence not only between the mortality of the respective seasons in the two periods but almost of the respective months that season which is most fatal to human life in one period is exactly so in the other in this melancholy preeminence winter takes the lead autumn follows next then comes spring and summer last of all the skilful physician perhaps might deduce from hence many curious useseful and important conclusions but the most superficial inspector cannot but remark that the great disadvantage of our situation seems a deficiency of heat for besides the distinctions just now made respecting the seasons it is apparent that of any two months immediately contiguous to each other the months of december and january in each period have the most numerous deaths july and august the fewest the former couple in the usual course of things have the greatest degree of cold the latter of heat  with regard to the great increase of population above demonstrated we need not indulge the gloomy idea that it has arisen from the depopulation of the country around on the contrary very few parishes excepted it has multiplied its people in full proportion the increase of the one has perhaps been at once the cause and the consequence of the increase of the other allowing for extraordinary cases where ever you have a large and flourishing town you will soon have a well cultivated and populous country and where you have a well cultivated and populous country you will soon have a large and flourishing town and it is amazing how the opposite apprehension could ever have become so generally prevalent as it has their mutual riches encourage their mutual industry their mutual industry supply their mutual wants the wealth of the town flows into the country and the products of the country return into the town their communication is eagerly rendered more and more easy by every possible means new roads are made or old ones improved fens and marshes are drained waste grounds and commons are enclosed manured and cultivated bridges are built rivers are navigated canals are cut more hands are employed and every quarter becomes at once more populous more healthy and animated this in some measure and with the exception of a few particulars has been the case with maidstone and its vicinity for the last  0 or  0 years but it has been so in the fullest and amplest degree with respect to more than half the kingdom and it may be safely affirmed upon satisfactory evidence that notwithstanding the temporary and local checks we have received from the burdens of the present war england has multiplied her numbers almost twice as much in the short period now mentioned as france has doe since the beginning of this century and if we have but spirit and resolution to carry us through the difficulties into which we are plunged so as to secure us a safe and honorable peace it is not to be doubted but that our population and its natural concomitants trade wealth and prosperity will again advance with as great or greater rapidity than ever  table vii an accurate survey of the

our numbers appearing to advantage as some of our people are doubtless absent in different parts of the circumjacent country upon harvestwork and other labors of the season a few we have unquestionably furnished to the public service of the kingdom both in the army and navy and the peculiar unhealthiness of the last winter and spring as well as the general hardship and pressure of the times must each have somewhat checked our growth yet notwithstanding all these disadvantages our inhabitants now amount to      which is    more than they were in march      and after due attention to the several considerations now suggested our actual permanent population can scarcely have been less augmented during the last    months than  00 persons  to the evidence already adduced in proof of the extraordinary healthiness of the town may be added from the present survey the high proportion of children under    and of men and women above  0 years of age as no unequivocal testimony of the same pleasing fact in the city of chester the salubrity of which has with justice been considered as very highly distinguished the number of persons in the year      above  0 was about   in    of the
