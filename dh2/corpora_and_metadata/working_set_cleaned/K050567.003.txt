playhouse pantheon concertroom and cornelys with an account of the master of the ceremonies but while these little wounds of the heart were curing there were others of a more dangerous and malignant nature breeding in the constitution of shenstonegreen  no sooner had i given my permission or more properly speaking no sooner had the ladies drawn from me my slow leave to establish their projects of amusement than the greatest vigor was employed to dispatch the execution by which means the village was again covered with confusion the ardour of the female association was indeed so intense that every scheme was begun at the same time and upon going into the green a few months after the first fatal idea was started i had the misery to behold the sudden growth of evils very remarkably illustrated a pantheon a playhouse a concertroom a cornelys and a temple for the reception of masks were all pretty nearly in the same forwardness and public curiosity was already so much attracted that shenstonegreen was become the gape and stare of all the surrounding countries the children of expectation who are ever upon the catch to subsist upon the projects of local luxury came rolling down upon us in torrents players fiddlers singers dancers and every other instrument of voluptuous expense spread themselves over the plain and anticipated their future salary and in order to subsist in the mean time they set the women upon coaxing me out of consent to their erecting several temporary booths to entertain the pensioners till the more regular buildings should be finished accordingly having put refusal out of my reach i shook my head and gave up the point so that all the fooleries of a fair were now every night practiced on shenstonegreen poor seabrooke grew so thoroughly disgusted with these doings that he scarce ever went out of the mansion house unless it was to lay upon the grassplats in the garden or seek the shade of the wood by a private path and whenever any body spoke on the subject he whistled  i must not conceal from the reader that mr danby took a very active part in this business since he dismissed the woman he was a great favorite with the ladies of the green the mind of that young man was in truth so turned to expense and magnificence his natural spirits were so excessive and his imagination so expanded that every new idea which was set off by gaiety commanded his whole attention and drove him to the last extremities several striking instances of this appeared in the course of carrying on the new buildings as the ladies had now unanimously chosen him to be master of their ceremonies and director in chief of all their plans he thought his character at stake in doing justice to every thing that had been put under his care to this end he flew up from wales to london and from london to paris and so down again to the green with almost incredible rapidity and presently after these excursions we had such wagon and boatloads full of beautiful bagatelles which though they cost the most serious fums of money did real honor to the taste of this handsome agent who had the art of dissipating so very delicately that every lady protested it would be an honor to leave herself pennyless rather than damp the superb choice of decorations which so characterised their favorite can i dear reader confess to thee without a fatherly blush that even the innocent matilda was quite captivated with the brilliant extravagance of her accomplished danby the fact seems to be that women are more easily dazzled with the qualities of such men than they are convinced of their imprudence the elegant spirit of a mr danby though it brings ruin and desolation along with it has i doubt more charms for the women than all the punctual precisions of prudence or the regulations of economy matilda saw in this youth an excellent heart joined to a most amiable form  she saw that every action was animated and every idea grand he had fought he had conquered in her cause the very nature of his rencontre flattered her selflove in a word her object was lovely and she loved with all her soul  i was perhaps the only person except the steward for seabrooke became a recluse who felt particularly the extraordinary conduct of this gentleman being neither blind to his virtues nor follies i beheld with real anxiety the great mixture of good and bad in his character and wished it were possible to separate them for unless that could be done i shuddered at the very thought of trusting him with the guardianship of matildas happiness his present habit of profusion countenanced and even courted as he was to indulge it would have led him to impoverish a nation instead of a village and i therefore determined to take some seasonable opportunity to remonstrate with him before it might be too late  chap xlvi being as gay and gallant a chapter as any in the book such an opportunity as i desired however not immediately happening i was obliged to pospone my intention in regard to mr danby who in the mean time was running the same career and gathering fame amongst the ladies in proportion as he squandered their money i carry you reader from hence into the midst of things and desire you will conceive the appearance of shenstonegreen no longer under the form of a little circumscribed village but under that of a town enriched by a regular theater a regular pantheon a regular masquerade and a regular musickroom when all these were fit for exhibition mr danby in the triumph of his labors which were now drawing to a period gave a very grand ball and supper in the pantheon by way of celebrating the completion of such a cluster of magnificent projects on this occasion i received a card which invited seabrooke matilda and myself but seabrooke had taken a stroll into the country and told me he should whistle and wander for some days so that i had no opportunity of even showing him the note for he had set out the morning before obstinately refusing all attendance and taking with him one of the volumes of shenstone and his hazle walkingstick though i promised myself poor entertainment matilda persuaded me to accept the invitation  there is no splendor of language can overdescribe the richness nor the delicacy of this banquet which might very properly have been given by any young monarch on his accession to the throne you will draw your own inference therefore how far it was consistent with the situation of things at shenstonegreen the goddess of prodigality  if any such there be  seemed to have laid her finger on every part of the entertainment and yet mr danby had so contrived the matter as to reconcile avarice himself to the scene and make it impossible to upbraid the ball was opened by mr danby and matilda who danced a minute with such inexpressible grace and so much to the joy and amazement of the whole company that  pray forgive me reader  i was quite flattered into an obilvion of consequences and joined in the pleasures of the evening as heartily as the rest exclusively indeed of the pride of the parent exulting at the applauses which an only child had very innocently acquired there were many other things to keep up the gaity of the season and nurse that forgetfulness which is sometimes so necessary to pleasure in about five minutes after my arrival a noble band of music put itself in order to play an occasional hymn to gratitude which was to be sung by the pensioners and was the production of mr danby the turn the conduct and the sentiment of this little composition discovered at once the good heart and fine genius of the author who while it was performing came from his chair and held over my head a radiant canopy on which were displayed the figures of benevolence and charity next advanced all the female pensioners adorned with chaplets of roses and strewed the way for the fair matilda with flowers scarce was this ceremony over before the general joy was yet increased by the appearance of mr edward elixir who came into the room by a private folding door with the machine of his wife who sat therein like the image of plenty and was drawn round the room twice in state by the apothecary who laughed tagged and capered incessantly till he was obliged to draw off the caravan and go peaceably home to his bed but the scene which succeeded this was of such a nature and contrived with a grace so admirable that had mr danby ruined the universe that very evening there are few readers who would not pardon it in consideration of what is going to be told them  matilda and this young gentleman being engaged in the same plot which both had projected and carried on with the utmost secrecy i was not prepared for the surprise that i felt on beholding hackney oldblade dressed in a seaofficers new uniform enter the room between mr henry hewit on the one hand and his daughter fanny dressed in white on the other they were no sooner come in than mr danby and matilda walked up and began a ceremony which they had prepared immediately the musicians exerted their utmost skill in doing all possible justice to a nuptial ode which mr danby had written the words of which were divinely sung by matilda during the ode mr danby spread a white banner before henry hewit while matilda dispalayed another in honor of fanny then the wreaths and garlands were entwined round their heads and a silver label held up to the view sparkling with the following inscription the newmarried couple or the celebration of an union betwixt honor and beauty while the company were expressing their surprise at this spectacle in came the reverend mr cusheon whose frailty is i trust a good natured secret reader betwixt me and thee mr cusheon paid his compliments to the newmarried folks whom it seems he had very lately attended to the altar and they were then presented to me by my daughter  whatever ugly whispers might have gone abroad to poor fannys disadvantage prior to this circumstance they were all effectually done away by this generous maneuver insomuch that all the ladies followed the fair example of matilda and the gentlemen took their pattern from my behavior  thus was the deepwound in the heart of our soldier suddenly healed up and the honor of his family totally redeemed  it is not necessary to enquire whether this respect to poor fanny oldblade was real or affected on the part of the ladies we had so absolutely shut the lips of detraction that the power of her opening them again maliciously was taken away and from that night this lovely young woman with honest henry hewit lived the happiest and perhaps the most virtuous pair in the precincts of shenstonegreen  the evening concluded with a morsel of eloquence pronounced by mr danby on the nature of the diversions which were then about to commence and in this discourse which might have graced the mouth of a member of the belles lettres at his being admitted into the french academy our young president showed himself to be as able a reasoner and as perfect an orator as he was before known to be a man of elegance and dissipation  at the end of his speech he adjusted the times and seasons for opening and shutting the places of diversion and in short fixed every thing on a plan in which would be offered not only the greatest variety but in which also each amusement would be crowned with the eclat of the company  by such means mr danby made one of the most expensive evenings pleasure too agreeable to admit the obtruding idea of what it cost and by artfully ornamenting the cause blinded the spectator till it was impossible for him to look forward to the effect  chap xlvii the glory of shenstonegreen promises to fade away the talisman however which bound up our senses was broken to pieces the very next morning and the charm was no more stripped of her sparkling decorations folly appeared full in view and justice with scourges in her hand and terror in her eye pursued her close  the distress began with the appearance of mr samuel sarcasm who gave me a fresh packet of papers every one was of tremendous length and the sum total threatened with bankruptcy or imprisonment  upon a stricter scrutiny they appeared to be a bundle of claims which were made upon certain of the pensioners for work done and goods furnished to the gross amount of many thousand guineas  but what are these to me samuel said i laying down the papers  we will examine first the premises and then draw our inference if your honor pleases answered samuel  here samuel put on his spectacles and read aloud  the second petition of the female pensioners to their patron sir b beauchamp  shows  that your petitioners do not at all doubt but the execution of their several projects under the superintendance of d danby esquire has been honored with your warmest approbation  that shenstonegreen is now so exceedingly crowded with company in expectation of the first opening of the diversions that it is with the utmost difficulty either beds or accommodations of any kind can be found your petitioners observe moreover faces and forms moving about of all sorts sizes cuts and countries which they take to be so many proofs of the great popularity the green must already be in  that the uncommon improvements made within a few months last past are of such a nature as must soon give the pattern of perfection to europe of which shenstonegreen will be at once the glory and the surprise in consequence of which your petitioners willing to do poetical justice in the fullest degree earnestly recommend an immediate alteration of the name of their new paradise  that instead of shenstonegreen which seems only to imply a petty piece of ground with a few cottages scattering about and some goslings grazing thereupon your petitioners humbly propose it should assume a magnitude of sound agreeable to the pomp it it has received by the labors of your petitioners to this end they offer two titles for consideration  namely shenstonecity or the city of shenstone  that your petitioners beg leave to take down the figure of the late william shenstone esquire from a pedestal which they conceive disgraces him in order to replace a statue to his memory worthy of such an angel of a man and to make the city of shenstone or shenstonecity all of a piece  that zealous to do every thing which may merit your applause your petitioners intend ordering their poet to be cast in a mould of solid silver properly embellished with the emblem of a large fountain of the same metal running a stream of gold at the bottom of his feet to show his unbounded generosity underneath the fountain we propose the following motto taken as mr danby says from a contemporary poet behold the genial current of his soul  that your petitioners humbly beg they may be honored with your image also which though already engraven upon the tablet of their hearts they are ambitious of seeing publicly exhibited as a new ornament of their city they propose to have sir benjamin beauchamp represented in the attitude of opening his arms wide to the universe and the following inscriptions on the front of the pedestal come unto me all ye who are heavy laden see beauchamps plan unfolds the soul of shenstone   that filled with the warmest gratitude which can possibly affect the human heart your petitioners are not perfectly contented with the simple titles of sir benjamin beauchamp and william shenstone esquire but understanding that most of the persons now canonized have been sainted for things of less note than the present magnificent circumstance they wish the pedestals to signify the following intelligence for example  saint shenstone the sage who wrote out the finest plan for the finest town in the world  saint beauchamp the benevolent who built upon the plan of saint shenstone a whole city which from a small beginning arose to be the wonder of the world and the whole by the voluntary bounty of one man viz  saint beauchamp large was his bounty and his soul sincere these statues of solid silver erected by those whom his liberality protected in the year of their supreme felicity  and of our lord god   that lastly your petitioners having now completed their views do subscribe with all their souls to defray the expenses as much as in them lies and beg saint beauchamp will advance on the pension of all the females the sum of twenty thousand pounds to be paid back to saint b by installments allowing to the pensioners in the mean while by way of annuity i e to each person only the neat yearly sum of   here i interrupted mr sarcasm by very vehemently exclaiming  mighty god man why this is downright frenzy  frenzy from the beginning to the end  twenty thousand pounds quotha   why your saintship knows answered the steward that   a truce with your foolery mr sarcasm cried i again interrupting him i perceive plainly that too much indulgence has let loose upon me all the violent passions of human nature what samuel do thou suppose or do these foolish women suppose i built me a neighborhood to bring into it all the vices and luxuries of a large city no samuel let them be told that i raised up the walls of my little town to reclaim error and protect distress to fill the forlorn heart with innocent gladness to conceal the blushes of unpremeditated mistake and screen from the fury of the world such objects as were lest defended from its rapacity fie upon them they have lost my paradise already tell them so from me samuel tell them they have brought sin and shame into my eden and deserve to be driven out like the original offenders  i will report what your honor desires me said samuel putting his spectacles with the most provoking sangfroid into their case and then walking off  chap xlviii some of the figures on shenstonegreen disappear it is incredible to conceive the confusion and the uproar which this angry message produced in the village every creditor was up in arms and mr danby the unfortunate president who had been the acting member in all the buildings and their ornaments was obliged to take refuge in the house of hackney oldblade who with sword in hand guarded him from the threats of the clamourous multitude till midnight matilda no sooner heard of danbys situation than she fell at my feet and with an energy which could come only from the heart begged that i would sacrifice her thousand pounds a year to a man whose freedom was much dearer to her than fortune and which she said ought to be purchased with every thing she had in the world but before i had time to answer this extravagant effusion of tenderness a man appeared on horseback at my door who presented a letter to the first servant he saw and then rode off again at full speed the epistle was without date and evidently written by a trembling hand  to sir benjamin beauchamp at beauchamp mansion house etc etc sir that i may not seem as contemptible as prodigal i catch up a sorry pen at an inn on the road to tell you that i leave shenstonegreen more to shun the horror of appearing again under the just reproaches of your eye than from any event that could take place to my own personal inconvenience i have offended the two only persons whose esteem ought ever to have been most facred  i have offended too myself i am ashamed  convinced and in despair   d danby   over this letter i hurried my eye and put it into my pocket to prevent its being discovered by my daughter who was but too much agitated already i promised every thing she wished and had the good fortune to pacify her so far as to dry her tears and persuade her to withdraw to her chamber  scarce had she retired when the steward came again to the mansionhouse with new burdens of petition and remonstrance the examination of these i would then have avoided upon almost any conditions but the steward said the salvation of shenstomegreen absolutely depended on my giving to every one the most serious and immediate attention sir said samuel your honor can have no conception of the present state of your village or that of your villagers unless you will dedicate this whole morning to the full examination of all those parcels now before you  alarmed at this intelligence and still more at the aweful manner by which it was introduced i sat down tremblingly to the scrutiny  to particularize the articles contained in this fresh catalogue of follies which now extended themselves over the green would be equally tedious and distressing i shall therefore for the readers peace of mind compress all the facts together and offer him a general idea of the whole by means of the following abridgements of each address  first several pensioners complained that they had been illused by their neighbors in points either of fame or fortune property or character the consequence of which was either that i must openly countenance duels put the law into every mans hands with pistol and poignard or else i must establish a court of justice in which causes should be heard and crimes punished secondly that the spirit of private gaming had arisen to so fatal an excess in shenstonegreen that most of the pensioners had caught the contagion and some had even mortgaged their annuities to a fellow who purchased lives and enriched himself by impoverishing others so that all the practices of change alley had traveled down to whenstonegreen thirdly bailiffs and their attendants were busy in every quarter of shenstonegreen to serve their special originals and their running writs upon the bodies of insolvent pensioners so that officers of justice picked a very pretty fortune out of the pockets of the shenstonians fourthly executions were laid on several houses by some who imagined furniture might supply the want of ready money fifthly the actors fiddlers etc finding their hopes thus blasted all at once walked over the green in a solitary manner and at length took themselves away very heartily cursing sir benjamin beauchamp and william shenstone esquire as two silly fellows whom they thought to be utterly ignorant in the ways of the world and who had vainly attempted to subvert civil government by realizing a parcel of incoherent chimeras too ridiculous even for blank verse or ten syllable rhyme shenstonegreen was looked on by the gentry as the greatest farce that ever was acted and  damned sixthly one of the pensioners to wit  alexander spur esquire having sold his annuity and spent all the profits very naturally rode his own horse shenstone on the welsh road where by very uncommon chance he met a rich person of whom he borrowed two hundred and ten pounds rather against the rich persons will which occasioned his being pursued and overtaken just as he was putting poor shenstone into the stable so it was very soon expected that on this sweet paradise of a green a gallows would be erected for the use first of mr alexander spur and then for the other pensioners as occasion offered seventhly the ladies of pleasure who formerly had the too great honor to associate with the lovely fanny oldblade now mrs hewit finding every thing in their way gone to wrack and ruin had returned to london to their several paddingplaces in the most notorious parts of that city where they entertain all their friends with the merry and mournful history of shenstonegreen a scheme which did not take eighthly several petitions appeared very regularly drawn out by an attorney who it seems found his presence more necessary at shenstonegreen than in chancery lane amongst other things appeared the following proposals for converting the pantheon into a court of equity  the concert room into a court of conscience   the masqueradehall into dr commons and  the theater into a court of kings bench  from the above account it appeared so evidently my whole project was a mere castle in the air that i was quite dispirited then there is not a folly of any kind samuel said i which does not at this time flourish upon shenstonegreen pray samuel what is your opinion of all these fine doings  that it is the history of poor human nature spoiled by human art when both are left at large to their own inventions ant please your honor said the steward  but my village mr sarcasm is ten times worse than any other spot in christendom  because ant please your honor every other spot in christendom but your village is regulated by laws penal whereas shenstonegreen is builded and conducted wholly upon a poetical model yours sir is fairy land we are obliged to go to the next town for justice  here the sudden entrance of one of the pensioners who delivered me a petition on his knee with a grave air and then withdrew put a stop to the stewards observations  chap xlix an academy of dispute is established on shenstonegreen the petition now brought was in effect to the follow purpose viz  that a society of pensioners accustomed to public disputation and to speak their sentiments on important subjects found themselves so incapable of relishing the frivolity and froth of those other pensioners who were attracted only by gewgaw and glitter that they found the time insufferably long upon shenstonegreen  that in order to compensate for this dearth of intellectual entertainment they proposed with my permission to institute an academy of dispute where science and the belles lettres and morality were to be debated encouraged and cultivated  that no expense whatever should attend the prosecution of this project except that of fitting up a few benches or forms for the audience and a rostrum for the president who was of course to be sir benjamin beauchamp  this matter seemed to me in comparison with others which had been received so exceedingly innocent and rational that i wrote a grant without hesitation and ordered the steward himself to deliver it to the learned body of my pensioners with the best respects of their patron  chap l the whistler exalts his voice in this chapter the steward had scarcely stepped over the threshold when my old and excellent friend mr seabrooke besprent with dust and burnished by the tan of that sun upon which he so much doated made his appearance  i ran to him with that ardour which denotes an affection founded upon a long experience of admirable qualities  qualities which his innocent oddities served only to render the more endearing  he shook me heartily by the hand and then whistled his loudest note to summon matilda who however was indisposed in her chamber she was indeed too ill to stir from her apartment so without any more ceremony seabrooke took two or three strides up the stairs and was soon dandling his little favorite in his arms and asking all the tender questions that could possibly come from a man of his tenderness  but matilda came and asked me softly if mr danby was at liberty  i said in the same undertone of voice that he was upon which the poor girl caught such spirits that she ran to seabrooke and chided him for his cruel excursion at a time too said she when i wanted my old playfellow more than ever i did in my life and such sunny weather too  then let us have all our different adventures since parting related over a dish of good tea said seabrooke whew  quick  whew   in the bowwindow if you please papa which looks toward shenstonegreen because then you know if any person should happen to come we shall all be ready to receive him and fetch a cup in a moment  the idea of danbys freedom had so well recovered her that she tripped down stairs as agil as a hare and the teaequipage was prepared without delay  i took the lead in the present conversation and circumstantially related without any other reserve than that of concealing mr danbys name every transaction that had passed since mr seabrooke set off on his ramble  at the close of this lamentable account seabrooke gave a long whistle and said with an emphasis highly marked that he was now convinced of what he had before suspected whew  said he  it is now clear it is absolute sunshine  i desired the assistance of his friendship showing very pathetically by a fear which then flowed from my heart to his hand that i was as deeply affected as deceived  matilda ran softly on the opposite side to kiss my cheek and mr seabrooke addressed me thus sir benjamin beauchamp you are i find a man to be looked at but not followed as soon as i heard of your project i came to see how human nature would behave under the execution of such a whim in glamorganshire said i to myself upon reading your plan resides a man whom i would travel seven times seven over the alps in the dead of winter to know his heart must be the noblest in the world accordingly i traveled on foot to shenstonegreen where i found your disposition even greater than i imagined and i resolved to pass some time with you in paradise but a very few days elapsed before i was obliged to stretch myself on the grassplats in the eye of the sun that i might not see too much of my fellow creatures i every hour remarked that modern man without the rod often snaken over his head and the whip smacked in his ear was as an horse of spirit without any bridle the poor animals whom  to carry on the allusion  you had taken from the barren heath where they were starving upon thistles to place of a sudden in the luxuriant pasture where the corn and grass came mantling to their chests  were turned too rapidly loose to become steady they first grew fat then indolent next restive and last vicious i heard them snort disdain and i saw them lift the hoof against the very benefactor who put on their shoes and gave the vigor to kick yet i pitied rather than blamed i considered whether this was pure baseness or the inevitable consequence of situation operating on peculiar temperament and character  too happy creatures said i are these steeds of sir benjamin beauchamp for which reason they must soon be too miserable  had they been timely broken to the bit and taught an early obedience to the curb had they been put into proper training there is no motive to suppose they would not have been most of them serviceable animals  and   does nothing then but rigid discipline create virtue said i mr seabrooke  no replied seabrooke discipline has no influence over henry hewit hackney oldblade matilda beauchamp nor some other persons of our acquaintance good and gentle characters require no other impulse to virtue than the dictate of the heart which is their unerring rule of right but the majority being neither gentle not good it is necessary to prevent the force of bad habit or bad nature by the interposition of wholesome laws but in shenstonegreen none of these could be established consistently with the proprietors delicacy  you have seen you have felt the consequence sir benjamin  i sighed bitterly in echo to a sigh from matilda and then mr seabrooke continued  chap li in which the whislers pipe is particularly in tune hurt and disgusted with seeing how impossible it is to leave human beings to their own discretion in the present state of society and really concerned so early to perceive the absolute madness of establishing a system of pure obligation and benevolence on the one hand and of gratitude on the other i wanted yet to try if there was no way for a man to be liberal without doing at the same time as much harm as good two or three days did i contemplate this subject as i lay in the sun upon your grassplats my friend and at length an idea came across which set me upon my legs to some purpose for i have measured near sixty miles in my sauntering way sir benjamin since i left the mansion house and now i am returned thoroughly satisfied that i can oppose our friend shenstone in every part of his scheme nay i am at this time able to set one of his observations against another pray compare that notion of his from whence you took your hint and which was indeed the foundation of the village with what follows i have been formerly so silly as to hope says our poet in one of his egotisms that every servant i had might be made a friend i am now convinced that the nature of servitude bears a contrary tendency it is the nature of servitude also to discard all generous motives to obedience and to point out no other than those scoundrel ones of interest and fear  now take my word for it continued mr seabrooke that all pensions upon the shenstone principle are too generously and too largely bestowed not to reduce the person thereby benefitted to a state of slavery and obligation which unless such person happens to have the heart of a henry hewit must of necessity introduce idleness which will beget voluptuousness which will terminate in vice  had we been convinced of these facts some time ago mr seabrooke said i how many pangs of heart as well as purses of solid gold might have been spared  i was not clear in the point myself answered seabrooke till i had more particularly proved it in my late excursion of which i will now give you and matilda an account he paused and then went on  as i grasped my hazlestick on the morning of my departure surely said i it is possible for a man to be at once wise and generous let us see to this purpose i bent my way over the mountains resolved to stop at every hut or hamlet that should rise up in the road my scheme was to do what i fear the shenstonian plan does not permit  namely to try the worth of my object before i administered relief pigmy as i am i stood upon the galled shoulders of that giant of generosity sir benjamin and so saw farther to forward this my stratagem i tore off a corner of my hat as you see to make myself look properly miserable i cut a couple of slits in my shoes picked a few holes in the most obvious parts of my coat taking care that the buttons should in several places be wanting  because there is nothing more denotes penury than the disappearance of a button particularly if the old threads are suffered to hang about  and shaking the powder out of my wig which you know has not been acquainted with combs since i came into your poetical country sallied into the poorest part of wales under pretense of being the poorest fellow in it thus accoutered i entered every cottage whose mud walls were either bleaching on the hills or skulking amongst the valleys i knocked without ceremony at every door and often let myself in by means of a latch without the least ceremony i took a chair or if chairs were scarce a stool and set myself down with the family if they were at dinner i dined also if they were at work i joined in the bustle and would take mop or broom out of the damsels hand without saying a syllable you know matilda what a proud odd sort of saucy beggar i am it will be impossible to tell you half the singular events which trod upon the heel of this singular conduct  some thought i was mad others merry some believed i was a conjurer others an impostor what of that i had my plan before me and i pursued it without deviation whether i was well or ill treated i stayed always long enough to find out the history of the hut its misfortunes its prosperities hence the characters of the present possessors were developed of course sometimes i have entered a wretchedlooked cottage where penury seemed to sit staring in a useless chimneycorner without a faggot to call the blood into her fingers and i have on enquiry found the inhabitants so rich in content that i dared not venture to leave with them more than half a crown or at most five shillings for fear i should overwhelm them with sudden independence and so ruin the family had i left a whole guinea in such a hut the prosperity would have been so great that four girls who were then singing at their wheels would not have returned to spinning till idleness and dissipation had made them almost forget how to wind the wool round their lazy fingers at other times i have gone into a house where by the diligence of the cottagers all sorts of penury seemed to be banished where the floor was nicely sanded the pewter shone like mirrours and the goodly rows of crockery mended at top and bottom garnished the chimneypiece and yet before i took my leave i have found the family so truly poor and so absolutely prudent that it might be trusted with the enormous sum of five pounds although it came pouring upon them in a sudden shower of gold such a sum did i give to such a family sir benjamin and what reason have i more than you yet know think you to assure myself my bounty was wellplaced why you shall hear i took out the money just after we had been banqueting on some excellent potatoes without butter and as soon as i had told the five pounds  guineas in fact i ought to say  here said i to a good woman who sat opposite these are to pay you for some of the best potatoes dressed in the nicest way and served up in the cleanest manner i ever saw as i chucked the cash across the table one of the guineas tumbled on a farthing platter and broke it in two after curtesying many times too often and putting the money into her pocket she gave the broken plate to her husband and said  here robin  a farthing is a farthing and the good gentleman has  god bless him  given us five guineas that is no reason why we should grow more extravagant than usual so pray robin mend the platter this robin who was the family mechanic did in a very little time and at night it bore the weight of the potatoes warmed up a second time as well as ever i must not forget to tell you though that sometimes i have made my passage into huts through all the sauciness and brutality that was ever practiced even by the pampered children of shenstonecreen i have met fellows that would neither suffer me to sit upon stool or chair who have opposed my entering into any conversation and refused to give me a crust when i affected to be in the misery which my appearance justified but having authority in my hand i always in such cases i e after i found them reprobate  put my hand quietly into my pocket and then took from my purse eight or ten guineas under pretense of wanting change then having thoroughly opened every mouth with wonder and silenced every tongue with shame i was generous enough to give the ungrateful rascals a whistle and set off for fresh adventures  matilda here leaped on mr seabrookes knee and kissed him with all her heart  mr elixir whom i forgot to tell the reader had come into the room just as the teakettle was brought cried laughed skipped and bounded at mr seabrookes relation  for my own part i held my tongue and spoke nothing  chap lii wherein the tones of the whistler go thrilling through the heart thus continued mr seabrooke have i proved my fellow creatures before i trusted them  would to god mr seabrooke i had done the same  let me see here is my notebook answered seabrooke taking a sheet of paper folded in the form of a memorandumbook out of which he read as follows charges of mr seabrooke during his journey over some of the welsh mountains performed on foot  two couples made happy for life with the sum of l s d         n b three pounds more would have ruined both families  to four spinners  l s d 0   0 to a deaf hedger  l s d 0    0 n b found the hedger whistling in a ditch at his work but the sum made him grave and so he left off whistling the gift should not have exceeded   s   d which would have made him whistle louder than before this however was the only extravagance i committed in my whole journey but alas the hedger was at the alehouse for three days and nights i am always partial to whistlers  to setting up a young man with four sheep two hogs a horse a cart and a cow  l s d   00 n b very sober and going to be married to a young woman who has a fortune of twenty guineas the girls father refused his consent before but he is now thought a very good match  to a woman who was prudent enough to mend her farthing platter just after she had received five guineas as a present  l s d   0 to a traveller who gave me the largest half of an oaten cake as i sat by the road side and brought me some spring water in his hat  l s d  00 n b all in crown pieces because i wished him to have the largest money i had about me  to an odd little man with whom i walked near three miles because he said he was richer than me after i had pulled out my purse and showed him the contents l s d  00 n b this creature turned out the linings of his pockets and dropped on the ground only two sixpences he said he was always poor when he had money and rich when he had none for i drink like a fish sir said he and you have put me as it were into the mouth of a mug for at least a week yes yes continued he with a good many jokes and stories looking at the guinea you will last for a week but come sir as you did not give it me to make a beast i will even make a man of myself as he said this we were just entering a welsh town where seeing a secondhand suit of clothes that hit his fancy hanging at a shop he struck his bargain and laid out his whole guinea the first prudent thing i ever did in my life sir said he tucking the clothes into his bundle pray god no ill luck may come out but i have not let you put your money to a bad use which is the case but with too many worthy gentlemen and so here i go with my guinea over my shoulder and my two sixpences in my pocket  to a stout blade who triumphantly compared his hands with mine and swore i had too fair a fist to have done much for my livelihood alleging ledging that it was no wonder i was a beggar and be cursed to me l s d 0  0   to a little girl who as i i sat on a joint stool darned a hole in my stocking and cut smooth the torn corner of my hat without being asked l s d 00  to another who amused herself with making my coat still more ragged and buttonless  a box on the ear to a multitude of saucy folks who insulted me diverse ways and who would have starved me when they thought me penniless and gorged me when they perceived i had money a whistle each whew  said mr elixir oh jesus how i should like to whistle after the manner of mr seabrooke how monstrously i should like to whistle  chap liii a more interesting discovery than could be imagined from this account mr seabrooke said i it appears that with the small sum of one years payment of your pension  nay scarce the half of it you have done more rational and more real service to society than poor silly sir benjamin beauchamp with all his thousand pounds and fair snow of shenstonian houses and the annuity settled upon their inhabitants  before any answer or remark could be made upon this reflection a servant opened the door of our apartment to introduce under cover of the night which was then come on assisted by a disguise a man who fell at my feet the moment he could reach me  sir said the disguised person i cannot rest till i have personally demanded pardon for the   gracious providence exclaimed seabrooke in the most violent emotion  that voice should belong to   mr danby  cried matilda  danby  answered seabrooke with perfect amazement  yes  it may be so  that may perhaps be the name which   i have taken upon me said the man to conceal the faults which disgraced the family of   whom cried seabrooke staggering against the wainscot the family of whom   of sir matthew davies replied the gentleman unmuffling his face and discovering mr danby  my nephew here cried seabrooke by what accident is he arisen from the dead  the dead said i  your nephew mr seabrooke demanded matilda your nephew mr seabrooke did you say  call me not seabrooke any more madam i am that unhappy sir matthew davies who fed and nursed that fictitious danby upon my knee when his parents were in their graves but his extravagant benevolence drove him from my arms to some foreign shore where it was afterward reported he died speak danvers davies am i not relating facts  they are too true answered the young man i had committed excesses which i deemed impossible for you to forgive and that i might never be thought of more determined to abscond for ever and feigned myself dead  since which time i suppose said sir matthew you have been more prudent  not a whit sir replied young davies this gentleman can tell you that i have been the most prodigal most thoughtless   fie sir said matilda half drowned in her tears it is no such thing  this gentlemans bounty sir found me in the retreat i had sought to hide myself and he took me under his protection upon the credit of some good feelings and in pity to many weaknesses but scarce was i put into paradise before my unfortunate passions   lookee danvers answered sir matthew that you are a mixture of weeds and flowers i do not want to be told nor do i desire to hear the history of half the mad things you have committed or by what multiplied stratagems you have sheltered yourself from my enquiry since you parted six years ago from my house i shall only tell you that i have thought about you as seldom as my heart would let me and that now you appear unexpectedly before me the weak part of my nature is too much melted to do any thing worse than shed over you the tears of pity and affection  the uncle and nephew were weeping in the neck of each other  the disordered and halfdying matilda ran into her fathers arms for that consolation which he had not the power to give her  the apothecary threw himself across two chairs and sobbed with sorrow and joy  i felt a mixture of sensations of which if the reader would wish to gain the true idea it is necessary that he has been at some period of his life in the same instant inexpressibly wretched and inexpressibly happy  it was such a transaction as the tender heart would neither seek when unoffered nor reject when it came  chap live essential matters when it was possible to speak again i related to sir matthew all the fair parts of his nephews character since he came to shenstonegreen and observed that the other side of his picture was only too bright to be looked at  yes papa said matilda that is all the fault he has  and what can be done poor fool said sir matthew taking his nephew by the hand to make it an honest lad and less of a simpleton but between ourselves sir benjamin yours was the very worst school this young fellow could have gone to he never could help wanderings of the imagination before and here you and your mr shenstone bring him to a place where there in nothing but generous chimeras from one end of the village to the other why you sir benjamin and my nephew would in conjunction ruin any set of people in the world whew a thousand pounds are gone out of your hands to do nothing at all effectually while i am absolutely contriving to spend about an hundred guineas to make the best part of half a dozen villages perfectly rich and happy whew  money is a mere jack of the lanthern in your hands it is dancing about in a fascinating manner and is nothing but a sparkling vapor which may bring those who are lighted by it into a hole after all but no matter i have a cure for all yet tremble nephew i have a cure for all yet  during this whole scene young davies the nephew behaved with a contrition so sincere and so modest yet so perfect a sense of his impropriety that i never saw him so truly to advantage and it plainly appeared by every look and action of matilda that with all his errors he was more beloved by his mistress than ever  but the mystery of the traveling mr seabrooke who was so suddenly metamorphosed into sir matthew davies the real uncle of the imagined mr danby sat still uneasy on my mind till sir matthew himself cleared up the whole extraordinary affair by first writing and then disclosing to me the following letter which was addressed to the very friend who had recommended him to me  to p peckham esquire dear peckham our stratagem has been successful as far as has been necessary and i have passed upon your friend benjamin as seabrooke the bankrupt and beggar till this very day all my curiosity has been abundantly satisfied and by means of my plot in my own way but within these four hours have fallen out two very extraordinary revolutions which will not easily get from the memory first i have seen that a village built upon poetical principles will never stand the batter of the passions which you know blows an hard gale from every corner and secondly i shall ever have reason to bless the name of the dear chimerical shenstone who has been the means of restoring to me that young rake of a nephew whom we thought dead by some quondam interest or other he got in his name or rather his name nominal for the pension and it seems he has contributed very liberally toward bringing all manner of those ministers upon the green which are necessary to create fear and fairdealing but the boy has a fine soul and i believe is so thoroughly ashamed of himself that he may yet come to something if he does not i shall whistle him off with a whew i now wish you would write an account of my affairs in london just as they really are for the mask of seabrooke is taken off from this moment and i have some masterstrokes to strike in the character of  your ever sincere friend matthew davies shenstonefolly p s the reports transmitted from shenstonegreen to the mansion house were in general so different from what a theoretic head and heated heart might be led to imagine that i have not set my foot in the village more than four or five times and have indeed chiefly led the life of a recluse had it not been for our patrons daughter  a warm sun a couple of excellent garden grassplats and my consolitary whistle i should have dropped my purpose long ago never build a shenstonegreen peckham send me something to put on i have some of the old suits still     having by order of sir matthew read this epistle aloud he desired matilda and his nephew to amuse themselves in the garden till he spoke in private to me  chap lv in the paradise of shenstonegreen the weeds shoot up apace when these young folks were retired  to do which required much awkward and delicate difficulty  sir matthew took hold of my hand and exclaimed aloud  lookee sir benjamin i see plainly the design which your daughter has upon my nephew the point has been palpable ever since i found out the young rascal but it is a match i do not approve and if you please i will tell you why  however let them play their little tricks upon one another for the present and in a day or two i will settle their love story i warrant the first matter is the mischief which my young rakeshame had done in the village let us see how that matter stands  i was about to reply to all the articles of this peculiar address when the apothecary cried out here is worthy mr sarcasm coming into the courtyard now for some news here reentered matilda and sir matthews nephew both blushing rosy red  i have the honor to wait upon you at this time upon sundry businesses said samuel as he bowed in his methodical manner to the company imprimis you must know that the builders and fittersup of the several houses of amusement have consented to take them into their own hands partly indeed because most of the pensioners concerned therein have betaken themselves to flight and the said builders and co do intend speedily advertising the same for sale by auction  and i will be a bidder cried sir matthew samuel smiled upon the imagined seabrooke and went on  secondly there are about thirteen houses vacated which naturally drop to my honored master sir benjamin beauchamp  excellent cried sir matthew that is the most promising news i have heard yet those houses for the future shall be more prudently occupied  mr samuel gave a second look at the supposed seabrooke and proceeded  thirdly mr hackney old blade the lame soldier lately preferred by your honor in conjunction with mr henry hewit and squire sidney have dipped their pensions pretty deep to do an action which seemed wise in their eyes though it seemed otherwise in mine  to wit they have paid off certain claims made by the real creditors of the young gentleman whom if mine eyes fail me not sits now by the side of that young lady  my claims mr sarcasm did you say answered young davies rising my claims  in troth sir rejoined samuel they were just debts and would have gone abroad to your disadvantage so the above gentlemen have bought up your character with the best part of their annuities  whew said sir matthew there is for you yet do they pretend that you have still the balance on your side  now how far that is really the case is   hush  hush  cried young davies  as to that sir continued samuel it is fit that every gentleman should have his due and as you have a sort of character that cannot be hurt by telling the good with the  the  the not quite so good i should humbly conceive   hush i say replied davies if you go on i must absolutely leave the room  lord how strange you are danby i should say davies said matilda  pray mr sarcasm tell every syllable that you know to his advantage and i will bear you harmless  pshaw cried sir matthew we all know that my nephew has gold amongst his dross so drop that subject and get on to another samuel  the steward pricked up his ears at the word nephew and gave sir matthew a third glance before he went on  in the next place sir said samuel addressing himself to me i have to acquaint your honor as in duty bound of a very long and illwritten petition that i have received from the shenstonian mechanics which in substance is  for i would not vex your honor with seven sheets full of nonsense   that as your honor has suffered shenstonegreen to be turned upside down by the whims of the independent pensioners they think you will not object to a very reasonable proposition which they have to make viz  that you will humbly please to put them upon a par with those other shenstonians who have done nothing for their money and fix some annual stipend to each trader independent of the drudgery of business  labor they say is no inheritance and they pretend that in a republic like that of shenstonegreen all should be upon an equality not that they lay particular stress upon this your honor  not that they will refuse to stick the knife into the throat of the lamb nor put the dough into the oven nor hew the wood nor fetch the water any more than when their livelihood wholly depended upon these occupations but because seeing things take rather a curious turn they suppose they have a natural right to join the chorus of that emulation which seems to be the grand passion of the good people of your honors green upon this principle  which your honor will allow is still poor human nature  they pray for the sinecure of a pension or annuity exclusive of the mere profits of selling their commodities by which indeed it does already appear that they cannot get so comfortable a subsistence as might be expected since the better sort of pensioners let their accounts with tradesmen run to a genteel size and in the hurry of quitting a paradise of which they are tired have by mistake forgotten to settle them  tradesmen said sir matthew have as good a title to take advantage of your incaution as any other people for ought i see what a lesson for you danvers continued he what an example see danvers the noble pile in ruins see shenstonegreen a mere town of the world see the utility of laws and weep to think what a wild colt is a man when he but imagines himself wholly his own master  samuel now looked more earnestly than before and could not help saying jocularly that the gentleman had in his opinion wonderfully improved upon his whew  sarcasm sarcasm said i there wanted but this stroke of the tradesmen to finish the whole putting all things together then sir matthew   sir matthew cried the steward  putting i say my dear sir matthew all things together it is clearly proved that the only reasonable address which has been made to my bounty has come from the pensioners who are now instituting the academy of dispute  whew  said sir matthew  odso answered samuel i have a card to deliver your honor from the gentlemen concerned in that matter here it is  the scientific society of shenstonian academicians who have been indefatigably laboring to sweeten the village by some rational and solid pleasures have now brought their scheme to such perfection that tomorrow evening their athenian entertainments will be opened on the public at half past six oclock the business of the first night which can only be a sort of general introduction will be for every member to state his principles and sentiments upon the noblest of all subjects  namely that of religion because as our motto is be ye of one mind it is thought proper only to adopt such into the society as are steady in their faith and distinguished by their good works this society being for universal good every body both in and out of the village will be admitted at least for that night and every man will have full liberty to utter his whole heart whatever be its bias or its prepossession  sir b beauchamp and his family are most humbly invited to partake this attick gratification which it is expected will reclaim the unhappy disturbances lately created and give a new form to the village  chap lvi which carries on the plot to the readers satisfaction mr elixir and samuel were sent away with my compliments to the academicians letting them know that i and my party would certainly wait upon them at the time appointed  when these men had left the room sir matthew davies turned about to his nephew and in the presence of matilda spoke thus  lookee danvers i see your design is to get the affections of that young lady now i must honestly tell you that i love her myself and though i am ten years or perhaps fifteen too old for her yet i have cherished serious thoughts of asking her to be my wife now this is to give you notice that i shall most formidably stand between you and the accomplishment of your wishes  nay i shall very solemnly be your rival till by a course of rational conduct you have got better arguments on your side to supplant me than a fair face and the prime of your youth  do not think young gentleman that such a girl as matilda is to be thrown away upon a fellow who has already contributed not a little to aid her father in squandering her natural inheritance i say dont you think this for be assured   dear sir answered the beautiful youth with the tears shining in his eyes  dear uncle if you could see now into my converted heart  if   it is too early to make professions replied sir matthew in the same commanding tone i had rather look at your heart than hear your words i make you a very generous offer i will sacrifice my affection to yours when it is clear to the ladys father that you deserve the preference that may easily be danvers for you have only to check your vile passion for magnificence and you will be just what you ought to be for my little playmate there  indeed sir matthew cried matilda running to his knee as usual i so well know the goodness of his heart  that   hush  whew  hush hussy  said the baronet he knows the conditions let him consider them so now go and tell him from me that he is a very handsome fellow and that though he is my rival i will neither run him through the body nor blow out his brains  here the good heart of sir matthew melted as he spoke and he ran into his nephews arms begging him for gods sake to make matilda amends for having fooled away so much of her fortune i take all this pains with thee danvers said sir matthew tenderly taking his hand because thee have a heart but i oppress thee poor fellow go then go and let matilda  what do you say though to this freedom sir benjamin  i say sir matthew said i that we have tortuned them enough and cannot do better than leave them together till they recover themselves  aye replied the baronet i see plainly that you are all in a plot against poor seabrooke i shall be thrown out of my chance and the young rogue will run away with his uncles mistress at last  sir matthew gave me his hand and we went out of the room tenderly admiring and esteeming one another  chap lvii the philosophy of fools agreeable to promise we all went at the appointed hour to the scientifick society which was held in the room that had been intended for masquerading i was mightily pleased at the pomp with which i was serenaded from the door to the chair of state which was emblematically decorated and on which i was seated as president every thing was neat clean and had methought an air truly classical a paper was given me which contained a list of those gentlemens names who designed to speak that evening and as the opening of the entertainment was a kind of present made to the public it is easy to conceive what a multitude of people were collected a person appointed to the office of announcing the business now read aloud in a tone like the clerk of the papers in a court of justice the following notice  o yes this is to give notice that all philosophers divines and moralists who have any questions to propose or subjects to start which may tend to the enlargement of human knowledge are now desired to propose and start them freely and such as are deemed worthy of discussion shall be enrolled by the deputy in the repository or register of the society for future debate and elucidation this being the business of the present evening  a general hum murmured through the assembly after the clerk had whined out this notice and then a bell rang to inform the audience that such as chose to speak might begin and address the president in consequence of which i was spoken to in the following manner while a man on the left hand side was taking his minutes of what past  i am one of those very poor creatures called a man mr president said the first person that got upon his legs i was born without power knowledge or instinct i wanted force and cunning to get the nipple of my mothers bosom into my mouth and without assistance i must have died for want of suck though the milk was full in my view i grew higher and stronger till i was twentytwo years old and i got into my head new ideas every day at twentytwo years old my reason became so strong that i set myself at work to find out the mechanic power or natural stimulus  or what you will  by which i was able to gather so many ideas and so much strength of body thirty years have been passed mr president in this important study and i am as ignorant upon the subject as if i were yet in my swathing clothes i beg therefore this matter may be registered for the future consideration of this learned society  registered  he sat down and gave place to  philosopher the second  i shall only trouble you with a single sentence mr president namely that i may be informed when the society have leisure  what i am from whence i came  what the duce i came for  and what is to become of me when i am not permitted to stay here any longer  registered  philosopher the third  pray mr president let me be informed how it is that i am able to think  registered  philosopher the fourth  i am a philosopher upon the principle of the profound yet modest mr lock and i should be glad to hear any man mr president in this assembly have the hardyhood to oppose his system i say mr president with mr lock that i have always existed that there are no such innate ideas  that i am free when i am able to act as i think proper  in short i am a lockist from top to bottom  registered  philosopher the fifth  register me mr president if you please as a friend to spinosa and an enemy to every man who can support the futile arguments of lock  registered  philosopher the sixth  my notion is mr president that the sublimest system in the world is that of the bramins i believe implicitly with them that this wretched existence is only a death of a few years which when passed will be exchanged for a glorious state where we shall live for ever with the deity mr president i beg you will permit me to be registered as a man who means tooth and nail to support the bramin opinions  registered  philosopher the seventh  down with me mr president as an hobbist or hobbesist just sir as you choose to settle the orthography for i hold with mr hobbes that the great law of the world is the law of convention i hold that it is perfectly conformable to the law of nature that every man should have a right to take the life of a fellow creature because every man has a right to every thing  registered  whew said sir matthew  carrying matilda and his nephew out of the assembly  philosopher the eighth  mr president i am a follower of aristotle  registered  philosopher the ninth  it would make me happy mr president to know in the course of the learned debates which are to be agitated within these walls what are really the philosophical and metaphysical import of the following words which i have so very often read about without being a whit the wiser  namely  infinity incomprehensibility eternity plastic forms monades reason instinct substance ignorance and wisdom  registered  philosopher the tenth  my principle sir is above all things to take care of my parents never to break my promise to be abstemious to doubt when i am not certain of the propriety of an action and to be as charitable as my fortune will permit let me therefore be put down in the list as an admirer of zoroaster what are called his superstitions mr president i am ready and able to defend i do not admit that any of his dogmas were erroneous but i will take upon me to prove that he is superior to every man that went before or shall come after him  registered  philosopher the eleventh  epicurus for my money mr president i will defend his charming doctrine to the last drop of my blood  registered  philosopher the twelfth  mallebranche is my man mr president and i will enter the list with any gentleman of this society who will attempt to prove that pleasure is not able to make us happy  registered  philosopher the thirteenth  the person who spoke last mr president will find a powerful antagonist in me for i profess the principles of arnauld and i do with all the force that is in me firmly deny that pleasure can make us happy  registered  philosopher the fourteenth  i despise pleasure of all kinds mr president i have the greatest contempt for pain grief has no sort of influence either upon my soul or body i scorn life i scorn death insert me therefore as a man who will maintain the system of epictetus of cato and of every other illustrious stoic like myself  registered  philosopher the fifteenth  about eight and twenty years ago mr president i took up a book which lay snug in a corner of my uncle purepuzzles study and i found it contain a religion which i have ever since adopted the great founder hereof mr president enjoins that we should be modest and humiliated that to do no harm is not sufficient we must do good he bids us pardon injuries and never forget benefits to correct to day the faults of yesterday to stand as it were sentinel over our own hearts to cultivate every tenderness and curb every passion without pride or pageantry to bestow and never to receive but in cases of the last necessity and then to accept a favor without stooping to meanness i stand up then mr president and i will for the future stand up while i have a leg to stand upon a warm advocate of confucius  registered  philosopher the sixteenth  i am one mr president who neither pin my faith upon the old tattered sleeve of lock spinosa hobbes zoroaster epicurus mallebranche arnauld epictetus or confucius  i do not care what these say the snap of my finger because superior to all leaders or leadingstrings mr president i am a young fellow who thinks for myself but alas i have hitherto thought to so little purpose that i am almost as much in the dark as if i had read the two and twenty thousand million philosophical books which i understand have been written to explain what is perhaps after all incomprehensible the subjects mr president which i want to have treated are indeed such as foolish folks are in general afraid to enter upon and therefore we have as yet no society which comes up to my idea of an academy of dispute i hope this mr president which is opened upon your green under your suffrage will be such it is with these expectations that i have come from the remotest part of cornwall to shenstonegreen where i will regularly attend the debates of this honorable house till my soul is satisfied not however mr president to take up more of your time than i perceive is on the present evening allowed to one person i shall briefly direct my hints to the ear of mr deputy that he may insert them in his treasury of metaphysical materials  first  let me be instructed how reason differs either externally or internally from instinct and upon what principle it is that every beast of the field has so strong a sense of obedience gratitude aversion and shame i would wish to know if my dog has not the faculty of combining and comparing does he think always or does he never think does he  in fact what is the precise difference betwixt him and your humble servant  here a general laugh ensued produced partly by the droll manner of the present speaker and partly by the singularity of his harangue  secondly  i desire it may be debated whether human science is not a very absurd thing and whether the wisdom of the wisest sage is not foolishness i maintain mr president that it is neither convenient nor necessary for man to know much and i suspect that we are every hour running our noses against matters that are wholly out of our line pray therefore let me be told whether knowledge is necessary or whether ignorance is not bliss  you have proposed questions enough friend said i for at least a twelvemonths debate and i therefore advise that you reserve the rest for more leisure as it begins to get late  the philosopher assented and his questions were  registered  philosopher the seventeenth  i should be glad to have it proved mr president at the very next meeting whether it would not be more politic more moral and more to the honor of shenstonegreen to turn the academy of dispute into an academy for keeping pigs suckling calves breeding chickens or for any other use equally innocent rather than suffer it to stand upon its present foundation  here a loud laugh burst from the multitude and a growl muttered amongst the metaphysicians but the speakers question appeared to me so apposite that i ordered it to be  registered  philosopher the last  though i perceive mr president that the book of the deputy is about to be closed i hope you will allow me who am one of your regular pensioners and who have seen all the disorders of shenstonegreen from the  upon his center while a kind of sarcastic smile pervaded a set of features naturally keen and rigid the philosophical pensioner began  chap lviii the folly and wickedness of philosophers to avoid giving offense mr president to any of the worthy and learned gentlemen who have this evening enriched the academy with stores of religious and metaphysical hints for future ratiocination i shall not address them with any remarks of my own but simply tell them a story which was told to me by a celebrated french philosopher and which is doubtless as well known to the learned shenstonians as to me it was found amongst the posthumous papers of an ancient rabbi  the story runs thus when the most powerful sagacious and wise deity had in six days put the finishing stroke to his work  no less a performance than that of composing the world  when he had properly arranged the heavenly bodies adjusted the music of the spheres and fitted every star to its orbit when the secret springs which moved and regulated this sublime machine were curiously concealed from the acutest examiner and when an impenetrable veil was thrown over the arcana of nature it is said that the great author of the whole in the ineffability of his indulgence amused himself with observing the progress of those ingenious little contrivers who call themselves philosophers  to this end says the story he summoned all those who on this speck of earth had distinguished themselves as the founders or inventors of any particular faith sophists doctors and all the proud sons of harangue and disputation were there scot bonaventure gassendi thomas of aquin descartes and every other illustrious name which has either been trusted to the wing of posterity or dropped into the vale of oblivion  they approached the starincircled throne of the universal father who considering them as they really were stooped from his unrivalled dignity and conversed upon equal terms  lookee my friends let us see which of you has the most intimate acquaintance with the governor of nature tell me what i am how i am made and what is my secret tell me by what force or management the comets are sustained and why in that globe upon which you once crawled one ounce of good is by a destiny too fatal mixed up with fifty ounces of evil when you have settled these points you may if you please by way of supplement tell me who and what you yourselves are speak freely  it is a day of absolute liberty speak to me with the same confidence you have spoken and written to your fellowatoms i am aware that prizes have been proposed by way of encouraging you to these matters be it so i will for once adopt the rule of your academies and give to him who shall offer the best and clearest idea a great deal of money and his salvation into the bargain  he said the philosophers applauded the proposal and friend thomas rose first  thomas who always gets so well through the thick and thin of an argument and replies to every thing without having a doubt of any thing  thou art said he the existence and the essence the pure substance and the simple attribute thou were in time out of time before time and after time the beginning the middle and the end the great principle and the great effect thou art present every where without being any where  the eternal at these words said courage noble thomas courage and covered the natural awe of his countenance by a smile  after some little bustle descartes got up  descartes who was ever in search of the whirlwind that he could not meet with  whose head was as it were bepowdered with subtle matter and who went blundering on without even having read so much as the evangelist  since i am permitted to speak said descartes behold an argument which i take to be uncontrovertible to be it is enough that you are possible with respect to your universe it is a striking thing enough but whenever you think proper i will make quite anotherguessaffair of it  i am able  yes i descartes am able to form elements animals light and whirlwinds out of a little piece of matter who knows the laws of motion so well as descartes  the deity smiled with pity for the second time then rose the uncertain and hesitating gassendi he tremblingly proposed to god his crooked atoms although out of fashion and decayed but not venturing to say any thing of the supreme essence he stammered out a few more words about his crooked atoms and sat down  next stepped forth with measured pace a little longnosed jew poor modest happy satisfied and retired his complexion was pale his understanding subtle  he was more celebrated than read and he concealed himself under the mantle of his master descartes  pardon me said he  addressing himself to the throne and speaking very low  pardon me  but i think between ourselves that you have no existence at all this do i believe is proved by my mathematics  some feeble schoolmen and bad critics have opposed me but you are able to judge how far i have been in the right you only are able to determine the limits of the genius of spinosa  the solid earth and azure heavens trembled at these words with horror and affright thomas of aquin stepped back all the philosophers looked alarmed but the clement and good deity lamented the infidelity of spinosa ordered his poor brain to be cured and gently commanded that he should be excluded from the senate of science  spinosa withdrew under the support of a few partisans  our philosophers perceiving with what unbounded indulgence the deity deigned to compassionate their extravagances immediately held out in oftentatious pomp an hundred fair chimeras and noble efforts of the human understanding they spoke disputed opposed supported cried and shouted all together the heavens and the earth were in an uproar  chaos was come again thus when to dine with some withered witch of a woman who erects her reputation upon feeding men of letters fifteen or twenty beaux esprits family authors rhymsters compilers songmakers and translators are gathered together the house reechoes with the howlings of the hungry rabble and the wandering passengers stand gaping in the street  and now uprose with a conscious air the redoubted mallebranche speak to the letter speak to the word and then i will answer said he in opposition to him arnauld started from his seat and furiously said that the sovereign bounty created the human race propensely to damn it leibnitz announced to the turk and the christian that in his harmony they would not be able to comprehend his meaning that god the world and us little creeping creatures are nothing without monades every philosopher discovered his system and sported his opinion  the deity by no means enraged  he is the best of fathers  permitted his children without imposing laws too rigid to amuse themselves like libertines as they were with the work of his hands but as none of them had answered the questions quite to his satisfaction he put off the prize to another year  on the very same day however continues the tale he dispatched his angel gabriel the ambassador of peace  the firm friend of pure hearts and the messenger of good actions  with a particular commission down to earth immediately the winged agent took a flight into twenty provinces and paid a visit to saints popes princes cardinals and inquisitors most of whom were in past ages devout persecutors  gentlemen said he the benign father of all mercies orders you to divert yourselves without oppressing any other person be happy yourselves but do not make others miserable he knows very well that there are a set of pretenders in in the world  a kind of literary empyricks very wise and very profound  who are like yourselves egregrious blockheads but as they have neither the power nor the will to do any harm the good god my master is too full of compassion to arm his omnipotence against the imbecility of flesh and blood  because poor atoms who have a glimmering faculty of thinking think wrong ought they to be roasted for that alas human philosophy is of such a nature that one should not too rigidly mark what it does amiss believe me the book of a metaphysician is no very dangerous matter as it is born so dies it in feebleness the arguments which ye can make use of against the most high are as arrows shot from a loosened bow that is pulled by the arm of an infant they must needs drop short of their mark and when that mark is the glorious majesty of earth and heaven judge how very wretched must be your most aspiring attempts  to talk and to scribble is the privilege of the thing which has most vanity and the least reason to be vain  imitate your tender father who does nothing but smile and forgive    here ends my story mr president and it is now easy to determine whose system is the best  chap lix philosophy contributeth to the destruction of shenstonegreen the whole assembly was up in arms at this story at the relation of which i perfectly shuddered  the philosophers deemed it absurd  the wits applauded it as a fine morsel of fun  the auditors in general declared it was impious and profane but the murmurs of the partisans so violently increased that i rose with indignation from my chair and darting a look of contempt at the storyteller went out of the academy exclaiming that i neither liked the institution nor the principles on which it was to move and that they should never meet with my concurrence till they were likely to be conducted more to the honor of my village my country and my god  notwithstanding these declarations the disputants went on with all the vigor and violence of bigoted controversy and the passion for declaiming grew to such a size that it seemed to lord it over every other it was in vain that i combated this with all the little authority i had left myself i argued upon the score of its involving us in religious dissentions the fatal effects of which i pathetically pointed out in reply to this they insisted that it was curtailing a generous liberty and inflicting upon them a scandalous servitude which implied a desire to tyrannize and how said they can sir benjamin beauchamp pretend to forbid those establishments taking place in a free village which have always flourished in all large and polished cities to think they said characterized men much less than to give language to thought speech was in their opinion the cardinal distinction of humanity and if shenstonegreen was not above all other villages or towns upon earth the properest for fair and full debate they did not conceive rightly the idea of the liberty of sir benjamins subjects  in proportion as i resisted the philosophers preached up with vehemence the tolerating spirit and when my consent was by no means to be gained to the contrivance of the systematick academy the members publicly told me that i had no power to repeal an act i had voluntarily made and that as i had no right to tax the human understanding they should proceed in the investigation of truth though to get at her temple it might be necessary to shake the very roof of the academy with the solid powers of a metaphysical argument  thus obliged to give up the point the meetings became so frequent that the folly spread itself about till it fairly begirt my unfortunate village like a surrounding pestilence in a little time all sorts of religionists sects and systemmongers crept into a community sufficiently divided before parties were formed and sustained with an animosity which denoted the most inveterate prejudice and hatred of each other some combated for the epicurean some for the platonic system and it was no uncommon thing to see a number of my people gathered together to observe fair fighting with tongue and fist betwixt a stoic and a sceptick a materialist and a roman catholic a bramin and a spinosian the infection presently ran to tradesmenscorner and my mechanics first hurried their work and then fairly left it to get to the academy many of them who had weak heads and strong lungs were exalted by the force of such accomplishments from hearers to speakers and by such means those who were formerly honest men and industrious traders  who were perhaps raised from the hard fall of unavoidable bankruptcy or set up newly in the shops i had provided  turned out blind enthusiasts or absurd religionists each of whom had just knowledge as well as just religion enough to make them enemies but not enough to make them friends  in short shenstonegreen was now in an uproar both from civil and religious misfortunes it was miserably divided against itself and you may be sure reader the total subversion of my little empire was not far off  the new paradise was fairly lost  chap lx agreeable events and much innocence during these absurdities amongst the greater part of the inhabitants the better few were laboring to compensate for the disorders of less worthy spirits affairs stood thus sir matthew davies was exerting every tender maneuver to form his nephew to a regular system of moral and steady conduct  henceforth my dear danvers said the baronet consider that the established gentleman is too well acquainted with sinery to regard it  as we now tread poetical ground which is perhaps built on the most romantic passage in the works of william shenstone i will give you a maxim more reasonable from that author  have an heart superior with economy suitable to your fortune but i have said enough my nephew continued sir matthew will be worthy the love of matilda beauchamp  mr sidney and miss elliot were engaged in little bickerings which did not affect their mutual tenderness  mr elixir was perfectly happy in trundling his wife over the green in her gilt gocart  henry hewit as he was the best so was he the most blessed of men in the arms of his now saithful fanny  hackney oldblade was blessing his good stars even for the loss of his limbs in the field of battle since it was to the wounds there occasioned he was indebted for his present felicity  had not i been thus gloriously mangled said the veteran i should never have traveled upon my stumps to shenstonegreen nor ever have found my daughter  the generous expenses which the above parties had incurred on account of young davies were all adjusted  in the midst of these circumstances mr sarcasm the steward sent me the following letter which not a little disconcerted me  to sir benjamin beauchamp my worthy master in very sorrow of foul i set me down at my desk to tell your honor that we must needs part for the business of the green does so blacken and thicken that it is too much for a man in years who has till lately lived in a land properly secured by wife and salutary laws  pray your honor think a little of the life i am leading there are more petitions pass through these my feeble hands than if i were a lord chancellor and every petitioner who does not succed honors me with abusive language but waving this point there are others which render mine office at this place insupportable and with which it behooves your honor to be made acquainted  shenstonegreen is by being built after a wrong model  your honor will pardon me  become the most reprobate and disagreeable place i know  we are overrun with lawyers peace officers and usurers who have scented their prey even in this once still corner of wales  we have no religion no manners and people are every hour buying an ounce of justice with a ton of gold nor do i in troth think your honor has any further occasion for a steward in this village for pensioners are every day leaving their shells behind them i e vacating your honors houses and those who remain imagine their patron to have so little authority that it is only for the sake of preserving appearances that they teaze him with petitions  these truths sir added to the great objection i have to babble and noise urge me to hope you will gently dismiss me from a post which can be no longer held with service to your honor nor credit to  your peaceloving faithful humble servant samuel sarcasm stewardslodge  on reading this letter to sir matthew davies he said he must have some conversation with sarcasm and begged he might be sent for  while these orders were giving an express arrived at the mansion house for sir matthew who received a small chest and a large packet of letters one of these said he examining the hand so particularly concerns me that i must retire to read it  he withdrew to the next room beckoning his nephew to follow him  matilda and i were alone  hang it papa said she this shenstonegreen is but a poor place after all  a very poor place indeed matilda  lord lord how much better had i been feeding my linnets nursing my sick canary and driving the kite from my chickens in cumberland  heigho matilda  and yet papa it has its charms too i am sure i love this flower that i have got in my hand ten thousand times better than all the flowers that ever grew in cumberland  how long is it my dear since sir matthews nephew went into the garden and cut with your scissars   pshaw  now you think papa that i like the flower upon that account  now i protest   but this village my dear i declare it is grown detestable to me  oh i hate it so papa i never desire to set my foot in it again  i thought matilda you said just now that it had more charms than   no not shenstonegreen sir i meant this house and that garden and the wood and the little bench in the alcove where there is scarce room enough for  for   sir matthews nephew and you i suppose matilda  hey  lord papa your head runs of nothing but sir matthews nephew  but since we are alone matilda let me frankly confess to you that i blush to think how deep i have plunged my fortune in a foolish scheme and injured thereby my dear matilda through my absurdity my dear you will not have near so much money as you ought to have had  then i shall have less occasion for it you know papa for danvers will be a good oeconomist   danvers did you say matilda   yes papa and i do assure you he yesterday declared to me upon his knees   upon his knees matilda  yes yes i say he declared upon both his knees while he put up his dear white hands thus and laid his sweet cheek to my face   his cheek to your face matilda   just for all the world as it might be thus   lord papa how rough your skin is to his  well and he swore that since his last visit to the mansion house he valued one shilling more than ever he did a guinea before   do you indeed said i danvers i do by my soul replied he i do by this kiss  by this kiss matilda did you say  kiss papa why if you had seen him kiss me that time it was so different from every other   every other matilda  that you never could have forgot it  for the tears fell upon the poor things face and there was so much grief about his eyes and his dear lips turned so pale that i thought we should have both died upon the spot  then you love him matilda more than ever to be sure i do papa and is not there good reason for it is not danvers quite a tame gentle creature and dont he love me with all his soul  but if after all matilda he should gain your affections and then prove faithless  then papa will i be so good humoured and so faithful that i will touch his fine heart and win him back again  you are resolved then to have him matilda at all events  i would make myself very miserable to please my father  come to your fathers arms  your fathers heart matilda for you are dearer to me than   here sir matthew and his nephew who were in the next room rushed in  not dearer benjamin cried sir matthew to you than she is to me and you are not much more her relation  dont suppose you have a greater share of her than myself  lookee nephew if you do not promise me to make it matildas duty to call me uncle by this day week i will leave you and this house with a whew   oh my god said young davies what shall i do why do my tears refuse to relieve me in this excess of my happiness  suppose matilda said i you and mr davies were to go and court the stars this fine evening as you sit on the little bench in the alcove where there is scarce room for two persons  that papa said matilda slyly would incommode the young gentleman but as it is your desire we should take advantage of so heavenly a night it would be rude not to   well said hypocrite cried sir matthew as matilda was going out you will spoil my nephew i doubt at last  chap lxi a proposal for the newmodelling of shenstonegreen by this time entered mr samuel sarcasm in obedience to the summons  and so mr samuel said sir matthew you would wish to quit the green  your honors both know my reasons replied the steward  to tell you the truth my friend said sir matthew i am as tired of it as yourself and i think i may answer for sir benjamin into the bargain say the truth sir benjamin is not your frolic over are you not convinced that master shenstone and you have only started a project whose execution has furnished inconveniences proper only for a lively novel  i am indeed said i groaning forth my profound conviction  that being the case answered sir matthew suppose we make the best of a bad necessity and turn as much as possible our misfortune to advantage  surely said i  putting up therefore with the loss of the several irrecoverable pensions and the sums that have been jerked away upon other subjects equally useless i have a plan to settle every thing else on a decent footing  heavens said i what plan is that  first  let your traders live here as in any other town continuing to work and sell to the best advantage they can if they are rich enough to cockfight let them cockfight but at all events let them pay a trifling yearly rent to you for their houses which if they choose to quit so much the better then you may get better tenants if they like to stay so be it they will know the conditions if they are insolent compel them into civility by law  and must shenstonegreen come to this said i  it must come to this or worse replied sir matthew  in troth your honor whistles my tune to a t cried samuel smiling  secondly  let you i and samuel continued sir matthew buy if it is to be done cheaply all the public buildings which stand upon your ground sir benjamin and let us convert them into the following uses viz  the concertroom into a charityhouse for poor welsh orphans to be educated and clothed at our expense till the age of twelve years  the pantheon into a free school for boys  the theater into an almshouse for all old people past labor  humph cried samuel a little costively this note does not suit my organs your honor quite so well as the last  thirdly  let such pensioners houses as are vacated be let to any body who chooses to hire them and shenstonegreen is become too popular not to attract inhabitants the profits of these may go toward the maintenance of the charities it would be well to cultivate commerce and invite all people to settle in this village which may be easily done if the grand articles of life come cheap to them at first setting out  samuel shook his head  fourthly  let matters said sir matthew go on just as they will do you take care sir benjamin to be paid for every thing that is claimable and i charge you to let the laws take their course for the future from one corner of shenstonegreen to the other  but how sir matthew said i are all these things to be done i have laid out already an immense sum of money and must continue to pay off those cursed annuities  read that letter then answered sir matthew  to sir matthew davies my dear sir matthew your wandering whim has not injured your fortunes for i considered your interest as mine and have looked vigilantly after every thing that belonged to sir matthew davies while he was humourously vagabonding it as mr seabrooke your immense adventures which you hazarded abroad are returned safe with such cargoes and freights as must swell your large fortune into almost an immensity the success of a certain baronet who traded to the indian shores is this very day blazing in the papers so that your presence becomes necessary as indeed nothing effectual can be done without you it is well your traveling name is no longer necessary for it is so proper for you to come to town and assume your real self that had shenstonegreen been really a paradise instead of a mere mortal village built with mens hands and polluted by mens vices you could not consistently have delayed your departure your captains will all want you in ten days which must be the very longest date of your absence from london  your old friend p peckham   i congratulated sir matthew on his acquisitions  you see replied he that money cannot be wanting and i am determined us three will get this town again into our own hands or else we will contrive to make those pay handsomely who stay in it  chap lxii the proposal accepted i hold that reader to be a villainous drawback upon thy pleasure which delays unnecessarily the concluding events of an interesting book if this is not a book to interest i have disappointed myself if it is thou will doubtless think it the more so for conducting thee hastily through the stops and demurs with which authors are too apt to block up their catastrophe for my part i shall lead thee by the nearest way to those things thou want most to know  understand therefore that the plan of sir matthew was with the amendments of mr samuel put into execution without delay  the traders were obliged to submit and shenstonegreen shrunk down to a village as villages go  not worse nor better not any longer romantic but real  the charities were all instituted and all that part of wales you will naturally believe was the better for them  samuel sarcasm remained still the steward but upon a very different principle  he is to let the premises to the best advantage  should thou reader choose to become a tenant it is only necessary for thee to take a journey into glamorganshire and make the best bargain thou art able with my old friend samuel  in that thou art an admirer and purchaser of this book he will i doubt not be the more favorable to thee  but should mere curiosity lead thee to see this celebrated town thou have only to find it out and gratify thine heart  should thou be so lucky as to hit upon the spot fail not to say to thyself alas poor shenstonegeeen alas poor human nature  chap lxiii containing what you might expect i have settled all the business of the last chapter while sir matthew was dressing himself for a ceremony which there can be no one so ignorant as not to guess  thou see reader the whole remaining matters before thee and it may be thou expectest a very fine description of silks sattins and soft sayings  how will thou be mistaken for my good friend i shall only take thee by the hand into the largest room of the mansion house and present thee to mr davies and my matilda with mr sidney and his eliza each of whom thou may should it so please thee wish much joy on their marriage in the middle of the room thou will pay thy compliments to mrs elixir who is sitting in her chair of state and to her husband the apothecary who is crying very heartily for happiness possibly thou will on the other side like to make thy bow  and i desire thee to make it with reverence  to the gentle fanny hewit and her spouse sir matthew davies will meet thine eye dressed for once like himself and samuel sarcasm who is tatling in the corner to master hackney oldblade will not pass thy attention if thou have really any serious thoughts of visiting shenstonegreen  chap lxiv which is more than was bargained for the moral to be adduced from this work is clearly to prove the absolute chimera of forming any society which is to associate any number of people to enjoy one mans benefaction under the eye of the benefactor it is impossible to introduce restricting regulations amongst men who expect that a favor should be as delicate as it is generous so that no such societies can exist without being thrown into disorder  the benefactor may indeed make restrictions but he is upon the shenstonian principle in too nice a situation to enforce their practice thus his lenity will produce evils which he cannot punish and his severity and indulgence are equally dangerous  it therefore follows that good order amongst men can be expected only under the check of governments where wealth and preferment depend on the industry and care of every single individual where the interest of one is deeply involved in that of another where hope fear desire and gratification and all the chain of tumultuous and gentle passions are excited by due degrees so that any excess in either is not with impunity to infringe the rights of a neighbor where few are overladen with obligation but every man struggles for a little so that obligations are pretty equally given and bestowed and where in fine there is a regular code of laws which pervades the empire and provides equably reward and punishment to guard the privileges of one man from the violations of another  the end
