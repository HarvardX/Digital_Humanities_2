every body and cuckold every body oh what a delightful thing it is to be quality  but i wonder mr chapeau is not up yet he does not use to be so late a sweet fellow  has more of the man of fashion about him than any servant in town  i wish i was like him i strive all i can but i cannot get his manner a servantmaid crosses the stage with a pail etc harkee my dear is captain bevil at home  maid who sir   robin what is there nobody up yet   maid up yet no sir i believe they are not long gone to bed why sure you must be as great a stranger here as i am to think of finding any one stirring at this time of the day   robin a stranger what then you are a new comer  i dont remember having had the pleasure of seeing you before my dear   maid no sir i have been here but a week and i dont know yet who it is i live with mrs sudds the washerwoman recommended me mayhap you may know her   robin i am acquainted with the family but i have not the honor of knowing her  takes snuff maid and here i

chapeau oh we have had the cursedest run of ill luck that ever people had  and how to raise money upon earth we dont know there is not a usurer not a thief between this and the monument but we have brought to a standstill not a penny will they lend us  i believe  though it is the devil to think of that too  but i believe we must marry somebody we cannot keep our heads above water much longer if we do not   robin i should suppose mr chapeau that your master had well nigh spent all his fortune by this time   chapeau spent his fortune why we did not begin to make a figure or be at all known in the world till we had lost all we had   robin why you dont tell me so   chapeau you may stare but it is very true  we did not begin to have credit till we had not a farthing left in the world ah robin london is the place for credit pluck up but a good resolution and you may run in debt as much as you please why the tradesmen are all playing as deep a game as our masters william bring chocolate

some time  a certain married woman that  shall be nameless  whose husband is monstrous rich and keeps a shop in a certain street  that shall be nameless  you have seen her my little robin  a monstrous fine girl  she danced with me at the last masquerade  we were both monstrously well dressed  after which we went to a certain house that  shall be nameless  the husband is damned jealous though and between you and i i am afraid he wants to get rid of her so that of late we are grown more circumspect  for though i should like the eclat of a divorce  yet the money at present the money my little robin you know is convenient   robin o yes damme  the money to be sure  sipping chapeau robin dont you remember meeting me in the park about ten days since with a lady dressed in chintz ha   robin o

whites is so full of blacks the poor lads cannot keep a farthing for them i suppose they want the oldest to lend   robin not my master i warrant you he is a good manager sticks close to the law why he is to be called to the bar next term devilish clever he is ant he   chapeau o devilish clever  a monstrous genius robin   robin very true mr chapeau he is very monstrous  the house maid crosses the stage again chapeau oh jenny do you know has any body called upon me or my master to day   maid yes sir there have been two ladies and an old clothes man to you and two thin ugly men asked for my master i believe they be jews   chapeau jews gadso they must not be neglected did they say they would call again   maid yes one i think did say he would call again and another on em left a paper parcel i put it on the drawing room table  exit chapeau it is very well jenny bell rings well robin you may tell your master that mine is just awake if he has any business this is the time to see him

awkward toad  bell rings i hear you sir  what a damned situation after all a servants is taking snuff never at ease always attending other peoples motions  i begin to be monstrous sick of it as my master is pretty near ruined i take it he will soon either hang or marry himself i shall then beg leave to retire and enjoy the fruits of my industry purchase some genteel sine cure take a snug box in the country and kill my own mutton  exit scene  a drawing room  a couch  french chairs  books  and dress clothes as if taken off the night before enter george bevil in his nightgown and chapeau g bevil my brother harrys man here do you say   chapeau yes sir he came from mr bevils in the square to know if you were upon duty or not   g bevil my brother i suppose then will call here i am glad of it i shall have an opportunity of letting him into my situation aside any body else   chapeau the house maid says sir two jews were here before i was up they said they would call again and one of them left this parcel   g bevil oh very well the writings i suppose  ay it is so  lay them down  if they come again i must see them  and if any body is with me show them into my dressing room  there is no living without these israelites i am an absolute bankrupt with every christian creature and if my luck does not change shortly they will find me out at dukes place too   enter harry bevil h bevil so george you are just up i see you are as regular in your irregularities i find as ever  st jamess dial does not better show the hour of the day than you do the life of a modern fine gentleman   g bevil st jamess dial sir is not as constant to the sun as i am to my course of life but how comes it that you are dressed so soon are you going to dine with any of your patronizing attorneys in chancery lane   h bevil no i dine at this end of the town but i have businese on my hands  business which perhaps may occasion business for my patronizing attorneys as you are pleased to call them in short george i am upon the brink of matrimoney   g bevil indeed why that is the very business i was wanting to open to you i have thoughts of marrying too  in short harry such is my situation at present that formidable as it may be i must marry i must find out a wife whose fortune may set me afloat again for faith as matters go i am sinking very fast   h bevil but the question is where will you find one that can answer your purpose i am sure she must be handsome or you will never like her and her fortune must be very handsome i am very sure or it will be of no use to you   g bevil in both these points harry i have been lucky enough to succeed  during the course of my sauntring duty in the park with the nursery maids i met with a very fine girl who has a considerable fortune in her own power but may expect a much greater if she marries with the consent of the old folks  of them i know nothing  the young thing is entirely mine  and i am foolish enough to be in love with her   g bevil simple indeed and her name is    g bevil there you must excuse me  i must be surer of carrying my point before i open myself farther even to you  but what pray is your situation   h bevil why faith odd enough you will say you have always laughed at me for sticking so close to the old ladies but at last i am rewarded for it one i have often seen at lady matchems assemblies has taken it seems so violent an inclination to me that she has made me an offer of her daughter  it is true i am not acquainted with the girl i have only seen her at a distance but she is reckoned handsome and as i am sure her fortune has numberless charms i have made up my mind and am resolved   g bevil and her name is    h bevil there you must excuse me as you said i must be surer of my point before i open myself even to you  lady matchem has given me the characters of the family which stand thus  the girl amiable and handsome with a considerable fortune in her own power but as you said of yours if papa and mama consent may have a much greater the father is a man who has all his money in the stocks and though he lives on this side temple bar is as ignorant of good company as if he had never removed from thames street all his time is taken up in listening to news picking up intelligence and buying in and selling out accordingly  the mothers only joy is cards and governing her family which she does with as much authority as her husbands obstinacy will let her she has undertaken to open the matter to him and this afternoon i am perhaps to have the honor of an introduction to him more i will tell you when i know more   g bevil have you opened this business yet to my brother frank   h bevil not yet does he know your plan of operations   g bevil no  i went to him the other day with an intention of telling him all and begging his advice and assistance but unluckily the conversation turning first upon my losses at play put us both so heartily out of humor that company coming in i took the first opportunity of retreating and have not seen him since it will be time enough to tell him when i am a little surer of success the day wears though and i have a great deal of business upon my hands besides dressing i am laying some of my burdens upon the tribe of issachar   h bevil who will take care to exonerate themselves i warrant how many jews may your hohour have in hand now   g bevil umph why faith i believe about a round dozen but if i marry i will discard them all and play a more christian kind of game for the future   h bevil well success attend you  perhaps i may look in upon you at almacks abut eleven  exit g bevil chapeau get my things ready to dress  exit scene changes to grubs house enter grub alone what a miserable man i am with a wife that is positive a daughter that

glad i was so fortunate as to get acquainted with this gentleman  a fine fortune in parliament and an oeconomist three things very much to my mind  if i can but get my confounded wife to agree to it  but she is the devil to deal with  it was lucky i happened to meet with this man for the women are so agog nowadays that you cant provide too soon for them and a fine young girl with thirty thousand pounds in her own power is so tempting an object in this town that the sooner you can get her married and safe out of your hands the better  ah  now if i could but double my capital and bury my wife sighs but there is no such thing as real happiness on this side the grave  exit end of the first act act ii enter grub now for this wife of mine  i suppose i shall have a fine piece of work with her to make her approve of this match  nay ten to one but as i have found out the man she for that reason only will set herself against the business  but here she comes hum  i must break it to her by degrees  bring it coolly and cunningly about  by degrees   enter mrsgrub oh mrs grub my dear how do you do  what is the news  mrs grub news heavens mr grub will you never leave off that filthy vulgar city custom of yours of asking every body you see for news news as if one was a hawker of lloyds chronicle or the public ledger now you are removed to this end of the town why dont you do like the rest of your neighbors when you are at rome do as rome does was always the saying of my poor dear brother sir tympany tar barrel   grub your poor dear brother might say what he pleased but he would never do as i have leave the city and all his old friends and begin the world as it were over again only to oblige his wife you could never get him to stir out of gutterlane   mrs grub oh hideous name it not but if you are at a loss for friends why dont you do as i do take pains to make them  but no  i must do every thing for the honor and credit of our name and if i did not go about to the watering places in the summer with my child and pick up fashionable company and make a point of playing high at their assemblies in the winter neither i nor my poor child would have a friend or acquaintance on this side ludgate  mrs deputy this and mrs deputy the other and alderman goose and alderman gander pretty creatures to introduce a young lady with the fortune that miss grub will have   grub why it is very true as you say you have taken great pains about her acquaintance that is certain  but now you talk of acquaintance my dear who do you think is dead  poor alderman marrowfat   mrs grub oh the filthy wretch i am mighty gla dont  he ought to have died twenty years ago  what was the matter with him   grub apoplexy  eat as hearty a dinner at gird lershall as man could eat and was dead before he could swallow church and state stiff before the second toast could go round ah the new paving of the streets killed him  ah the fatal effects of luxury they will never leave their curfed improvements till they have killed us all  but my dear there is rare news from the alley india stock is mounting every minute   mrs grub i am very glad to hear it my dear   grub yes i thought you would be glad to hear it i have just sent consol to the alley to see how matters go  i should have gone myself  but  i  wanted to  open an affair of some importance to you    mrs grue ay ay you have always some affair of great importance   grub nay this is one  i have been thinking my dear that it was high time we had fixed our daughter it is high time that emily was married   mrs grub you think so do you i have thought so any time these three years and so has emily too i fancy  i wanted to talk to you upon the same subject   grub you did well i declare that is pat enough he he he i vow and protest i am pleased at this  why our inclinations do seldom jump together   mrs grub jump quotha no on my conscience i should wonder they did  and how comes it now to pass what i suppose you have been employing some of your brokers as usual or perhaps advertizing as you used to do  but i expect to hear no more of those tricks now we are come to this end of the town   grub no no my dear this is no such matter the gentleman i intend    mrs grub you intend   grub yes i intend   mrs grub you intend  what do you presume to dispose of my child without my consent  look you mr grub as i have always faid mind your money matters look to your bulls and your bears and your lame ducks and take care they dont make you waddle out of the alley as the saying is  but leave to me the management of my child  what things are come to a fine pass indeed i suppose you intend to marry the poor innocent to some of your city cronies your factors supercargoes packers and drysalters but thank my stars i have washed my hands of them and i will have none of them mr grub no i will have none of them  it never shall be said that after coming to this end of the town the great miss grub was forced to trudge into the city again for a husband   grub why zounds are you mad mrs grub   mrs grub no you shall find i am not mad mr grub that i know how to dispose of my child mr grub  what did my poor dear brother leave his fortune to me and my child and shall she now be disposed of without consulting me   grub why the devil is in you certainly if you will but hear me you shall be consulted  have i not always consulted you was i not inclined to please you to marry my daughter to a lord and has she not been hawked about till all the peerage of the three kingdoms turn up their noses at you and your daughter  did i not treat with my lord spindle my lord thoughtless and my lord maukin and did we not agree for the first time in our lives that it would be better to find out a commonner for her as the people of quality only marry nowadays for a winter or so   mrs grub very well we did so  and who pray is the proper person to find out a match for her  who but her mother mr grub who goes into company with no other view mr grub  who flatters herself that she is no contemptible judge of mankind mr grub  yes mr grub i know mankind as well as any woman on earth mr grub   grub that i believe from my soul mrs grub   mrs grub who then but me should have the disposal of her  and very well i have disposed of her  i have got her a husband in my eye    grub you got her a husband   mrs grub yes i have got her a husband   grub no no no mrs grub that will never do  what the vengeance have i been toiling upwards of fifty years  up early down late shopkeeper and housekeeper made a great fortune which i could never find in my heart to enjoy and now when all the comfort i have in the world the settlement of my child is in agitation  shall i not speak shall i not have leave to approve of her husband   mrs grub hey day you are getting into your tantrums i see   grub what did i not leave the city every friend in the world with whom i used to pass an evening  did i not to please you take this house here nay did i not make the damnedest fool of myself by going to learn to come in and out of a room with the grown gentlemen in cowlane  did i not put on a sword too at your desire and had i not like to have broke my neck down stairs by its getting between my legs at that diabolical lady what do you call ems route and did not all the footmen and chairmen laugh at me   mrs grub and well they might truly an obstinate old fool    grub ay ay that may be but i will have my own way  i will give my danghter to the man i like  i will have no sir this nor lord the other  i will have no fellow with a waist down to his knees and a stirt like a monkeys jacket  with a hat not so big as its button his shoe buckles upon his toes and a queue thicker than his leg   mrs grub why mr grub you are raving

  grub oh mrs grub mrs grab  this is the blessed effect of your jauntings and journies  with as snug a box upon clapham common  which i think by far the finest part of england and every thing handsome about you you could not be contented  and because there is not a foolish body of quality now adays lives a summer in their own houses as they ought to do you must be driving away to all the watering places too and slap dash all on a sudden when i least think on it away i am hyd the devil knows where  ha  then such plungings and pumpings such divings and dippings as if you had been bit by all the mad dogs in the kingdom   emily my dearest father hear me  chance brought me acquainted with a gentleman who is i am certain if you did but know him the man in the world you would wish me to have  a man amiable in the highest degree   mrs grub yes yes very likely truly   grub ay ay a very pretty fellow to be sure   emily yes i must own he has infinuated himself into my heart and made on it the most indelible impression    mrs grub very fine truly i say impression indeed  after all our indulgence    grub ay after all our indulgence  who was ever better dressed at my lordmayors balls  but who

dear mama is it possible   grub ay by the lord is it so say no more but kiss your own dear papa you sweet little cherubim   mrs grub but my dear it is very odd he should be acquainted with the child and never once hint it to us   grub oh not at all i see through it i see through it he is a notable one i see he wants to have all our consents separately that he may be the more certain of our affections   mrs grub nay it must be so and did he never say that he had met with your papa or me   emily never i am very much surprised at it but i am so happy in your concurrence with my wishes that

note from him about two hours since telling me that he would be here about seven i must own thinking you would be out of the way i permitted him to come here for the first time   grub and he never said a syllable to either of us and pretended not to know us ha ha ha that is very good  looks at his watch  but it is time he was come  though perhaps the business of the house may detain him  i dont

george you know me too well too doubt of my being in the same sentiments   grub my dear what do you think of this business   mrs grub why i think my dear that as we cannot help ourselves we may as well make the best on it what is done cannot be undone and it is well it is no worse as was always the saying of my poor dear brother sir tympany   grub egad i believe he was right and i may as well make the best on it for if i dont give her away she will throw herself away but i hope you will not follow the example of the great there is such work among them   g bevil dear sir dont nourish such strange prejudices the great have their follies it is true but they have also their virtues as well as the rest of mankind and there are among them many shining objects of inmitation we should consider sir that the greatest couple in the nation is the best and happiest in it   finis
