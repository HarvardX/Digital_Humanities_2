an essay on the study of literature  written originally in french by edward gibbon jun esquire  now first translated into english  london printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand mdcclxiv  to edward gibbon esquire dear sir no performance is in my opinion more contemptible than a dedication of the common sort when some great man is presented with a book which if science be the subject he is incapable of understanding if polite literature incapable of tasting and this honor is done him as a reward for virtues which he neither does nor desires to possess i know but two kinds of dedications which can do honor either to the patron or author the first is when an unexperienced writer addresses himself to a master of the art in which he endeavors to excel whose example he is ambitious of imitating by whose advice he has been directed or whose approbation he is anxious to deserve  the other sort is yet more honorable it is dictated by the heart and offered to some person who is dear to us because he ought to be so it is an opportunity we embrace with pleasure of making public those sentiments of esteem of friendship of gratitude or of all together which we really feel and which therefore we desire should be known  i hope dear sir my past conduct will easily lead you to discover to what principle you should attribute this epistle which if it surprises will i hope not displease you if i am capable of producing any thing worthy the attention of the public it is to you that i owe it to that truly paternal care which from the first dawnings of my reason has always watched over my education and afforded me every opportunity of improvement permit me here to express my grateful sense of your tenderness to me and to assure you that the study of my whole life shall be to acquit myself in some measure of obligations i can never fully repay  i am dear sir with the sincerest affection and regard your most dutiful son and faithful servant e gibbon junior may the   th      an essay on the study of literature i the history of empires is that of the miseries of humankind idea of literary history the history of the sciences is that of their splendor and happiness if a thousand other considerations render the study of the latter interesting to the philosopher this reflection alone is sufficient to recommend it to every friend of mankind  ii how ardently do i wish a truth so consolatory admitted of no exception but alas the man too often intrudes on the retirement of the student and hence even in his closet that asylum of contemplative wisdom he is still misled by his prejudices agitated by his passions or debased by his follies  the influence of fashion is founded on the inconstancy of man the causes of its despotism being as frivolous as the effects of its tyranny are fatal men of letters are nevertheless afraid to cast off its yoke and though reflection causes some delay in their submission it serves to render it but the more disgraceful  all ages and countries have given a preference not seldom unjustly to some particular science while they permitted others to languish and sink into a contempt equally unreasonable thus logic and metaphysics under the successors of alexander this age was that of those philosophical sects who battled for the systems of their respective masters with all the obstinacy of polemical divines  a fondness for systems necessarily produces an attachment to general principles and this of course brings on a contempt for an attention to particulars  the fondness for systems says mr freret which possessed the successors of aristotle made the greeks abandon the study of nature and stopped the progress of their philosophical discoveries subtlety of argument took place of experiment the accurate sciences geometry astronomy and the true philosophy disappeared almost entirely none gave themselves the trouble to acquire new principles but all were employed in ranging combining and modelling those they imagined they knew into systems hence arose so many different sects the greatest geniuses lost themselves in the abstruseness and obscurity of metaphysics wherein words generally supplied the place of things and thus logic denominated by aristotle an implement of the understanding became among his followers the principal and almost the sole object of their attention their whole lives were spent in studying the art of reasoning without ever reasoning at all or at least without reasoning on any other than trivial and unimportant subjects  mem de lacad des b l tom vi p   0    polity and elocution during the roman republic history and poetry in the augustan age grammar and jurisprudence in that of the lower empire the scholastic philosophy in the thirteenth century and the belles lettres till within the times of our fathers have all in their turns shared the admiration and contempt of mankind  natural philosophy and the mathematics are now in possession of the throne their sister sciences fall prostrate before them are ignominiously chained to their car or otherwise servilely employed to adorn their triumph perhaps their reign too is short and their fall approaching  it would be a task worthy a man of abilities to trace that revolution in religion government and manners that has successively bewildered wasted and corrupted mankind it were prudent for him therein not to seek hypotheses but much more so not to avoid them  iii if the greeks had never been reduced to slavery restoration of the belles lettres the romans had been still barbarians the public taste for them constantinople falling before the sword of mahomet the muses were abandoned to fortune till assembled and patronized by the medici this illustrious family encouraged literature erasmus did still more he cultivated letters himself while homer and cicero became familiar to climes unknown to alexander and nations unconquered by rome in those days it was thought a fine accomplishment to study and admire the ancients by turning over the latin bibliotheque of fabricius the best of mere compilers we shall see that in the space of forty years after the invention of printing almost all the latin authors issued from the press some of them more than once it is true the taste of the editors was by no means equal to their zeal the writers of the augustan history appeared before livy and an edition of aulusgellius was given before any body thought of virgil  in ours it is judged more easy and polite to neglect and despise them i am apt to think there is some reason on both sides the soldier then read them in his tent the statesman studied them in his closet even the fair sex usually content with the empire of the graces and willing to resign superior knowledge to ours were subject to the contagion and every delia wished to find a tibullus in the person of her lover it was from herodotus that elizabeth a sovereign whose name is revered in the annals of literature learnt to maintain the rights of humanity against another xerxes it was in aeschylus aeschylus has written a tragedy wherein he has painted in the most lively colors the triumph of the greeks and the consternation of the persians after that fatal battle see le theater des grecs du p brumoy tom ii p     etc she saw her magnanimity celebrated under the names of the victorious heroes of salamis the president henault in speaking of that princess says she was a great scholar and that being one day in conversation with calignon afterward chancellor of navarre she showed him a latin translation she had made of some tragedies of sophocles and of two orations of demosthenes she permitted him also to take a copy of a greek epigram of her own composition and asked his opinion concerning some passages of lycophron which she had then in her hands and from which she intended to translate some particular parts  abreg chronolog  to paris      p       christina preferred knowledge to the government of a kingdom for which the politician may despise and the philosopher will probably blame her the man of letters however cannot fail to cherish the memory of that princess who not only studied the ancients herself but even rewarded their commentators it was by her that saumaise was honored with marks of distinction who though he did not deserve the admiration in which his cotemporaries held him was above that contempt thrown upon him by his successors  iv this princess that taste carried too far without doubt carried her regard for such writers too far for my part though sometimes their advocate never their partisan i will freely confess i think them as coarse in their manners as they were minute and trifling in their works a pedantic erudition cramping the efforts of their imagination they were rather dull compilers than ingenious scholiasts the age was just enlightened enough to perceive the utility of their researches but neither sensible nor polished sufficiently to know what advantages they might have reaped by the light of philosophy  v at length the day appeared when it became more reasonable descartes indeed was not eminent in letters polite literature however is extremely obliged to him an acute philosopher mr le clerc in his excellent treatise on the art of criticism and in many other of his works  who inherited his manner investigated the true elements of criticism bossu boileau rapin and brumoy informed the public also of the value of those treasures it had in its possession one of those societies that have better immortalized the name of lewis xiv than all the pernicious triumphs of his ambition had already begun its researches societies in which we see erudition precision of sentiment and politeness united in which we meet with so many important discoveries and sometimes what hardly yields to discoveries a modest and learned ignorance  if men employed their reason as much in their actions as in their conversation the belleslettres would not only engage the esteem of the wise but become equally the object of vulgar admiration  vi it is from this era we may date the commencement of their decline the decline of the belles lettres le clerc to whom both freedom and science are indebted complained of it above sixty years ago but it was in the famous dispute concerning the ancients and the moderns that letters received the mortal blow never sure was carried on so unequal a combat the strict logic of terasson the refined philosophy of fontenelle the elegant and happy manner of de la motte the sprightly raillery of st hyacinthe all joined in concert to reduce homer to a level with chapelain the adversaries of this formidable band answered them only by an attention to trifles with i know not what pretensions to natural superiority in the ancients with prejudice abuse and quotations the laugh was entirely against them while the ancients who were the subject of the dispute came in for a share of the ridicule that burst on their defenders that agreeable nation which had unthinkingly adopted the principle of lord shaftesbury not making any distinction between the false and the ridiculous  our philosophers have ever since affected to be astonished that men can pass their whole lives in acquiring the knowledge of mere words and facts in burthening the memory without improving the understanding at the same time our men of wit are sufficiently sensible of the advantages they derive from the ignorance of their readers and therefore load the ancients with contempt as well as those who make them their study fontenelle in his digression concerning the ancients and moderns and elsewhere  ouvres de gresset tom ii p        vii to this picture let me subjoin a few reflections greatmen men of letters which may fix a just estimation on the belles lettres  the examples of great men prove nothing cassini before he acquired a name for his astronomical discoveries had busied himself with judicial astrology fontenelle dans son eloge  voltaire tom xvii p       when such examples however are numerous they prejudice the mind in favor of an enquiry the event of which they serve fterwards to confirm one must immediately conceive that a mind capable of thinking for itself a lively and brilliant imagination can never relish a science that depends solely on the memory yet of those whose superior talents have successively instructed mankind many have applied themselves entirely to the study of the belles lettres still more have encouraged and in a less degree cultivated them but not one at least hardly one of them all ever held them in contempt all antiquity was known to grotius a knowledge that enabled him to unfold the sacred oracles to combat ignorance and superstition to soften the calamities and mitigate the horrors of war  if descartes devoted entirely to his philosophy despised every kind of study that had not an immediate affinity with it newton newton discovered mistakes of   or   hundred years in the common chronology and reformed it accordingly see my critical remarks on that chronology did not disdain to form a system of chronology which has had both its advocates and admirers gassendi the greatest philosopher among the men of letters and the greatest man of letters among the philosophers not only defended the doctrines of epicurus but critically explained his writings leibnitz laid aside his profound researches into history to employ himself in the more abstruse researches of the mathematics had his edition of the capella appeared his example alone in that valuable acquisition to the literary world had justified the conduct of all those who apply themselves to letters see the life of leibnitz by de neufville prefixed to his theodocea  an eternal monument exists however of the united efforts of erudition and genius in the dictionary of mr bail  viii if we confine ourselves to such as have devoted almost all their time and study to literature men of letters great men the reader of taste will always know how to distinguish the subtle and extensive wit of erasmus the accuracy of casaubon and gerard vossius the readiness of justuslipsius the taste and delicacy of taneguylefebvre the resources and fertility of isaac vossius the daring penetration of bentley the agreeable manner of massieu and de fraguier the solid and ingenious criticism of sallier and the profound philosophical genius of le clerc and freret he will never confound these trulygreat men with such mere compilers as gruter saumaise masson and many others whose works though not altogether useless seldom gratify taste never excite admiration and in general only lay claim to the lowest kind of approbation  ix the ancients have left models for such writers as dare to copy after them taste three sources of beauty and lectures to others from which they may deduce the principles of true taste and learn to employ their leisure in the study of those valuable productions wherein truth appears embellished with all the graces of the imagination  it is the province of poets and orators to paint the beauties of nature the whole universe supplies them with tints of that infinite variety however which on every side presents itself the images they employ may be ranged in three classes those relating to man to nature and to art the images of the first class or those which compose the picture of man his greatness his manness his passions his caprices these are they which conduct the writer in the surest path to immortality every time one reads euripides or terence one discovers new beauties it is not however to the disposition or conduct of their performances which are in this respect often defective nor is it to their delicacy or simplicity of style that these poets owe their reputation no the heart beholds the picture of itself in their just and lively descriptions and confesses it with pleasure  nature vast and extensive as it is has furnished the poets with but few images confined by the nature of the object or the prejudices of mankind to the exterior of things they have succeeded only in painting the successive variety of the seasons a sea agitated by storms the zephyrs wafting love and pleasure on the breeze and the like a few writers of genius were enough to exhaust these images  x those of art remained artificial images by the images of art i mean all those things by which men have embellished defaced or diversified nature religion laws or custom the poets have universally made free with all these and it must be owned they were in the right their fellowcountrymen understood them with ease and perused them with pleasure they were pleased to see the genius of their great men exercised on things which had made their ancestors respectable on subjects they revered as sacred or practiced as useful  xi the manners of the ancients were more favorable to poetry than ours the manners of the ancients favorable to poetry which is a strong presumption they surpassed us in that sublime art  in proportion as the arts grew more perfect in the military art they grew less complex in war in politics in religion the most important effects have proceeded from the most simple causes  doubtless a marshal saxe and a duke of cumberland i did not here seek for an opportunity of paying a compliment to his royal highness the duke of cumberland whose birth and rank i respect without presuming to judge of his military talents if it be considered that the following lines are taken from a poem on the battle of fontenoy the reader will see it is rather mr voltaire than myself that here speaks understood the art of war better than an achilles or an ajax  tells ne parurent point aux rives du scamandre sous ces murs tant vantes que pyrrhus mit en cendre ces antiques heroes qui montes sur un char combattoient en disordre and marchoient au hazard oeuvres de voltaire tom ii p  00  are the battles however which are described by the french poet diversified like those of the greek are his heroes equally interesting the single combats of the chiefs the long conversations held with the dying the unexpected rencounters we meet with all betray the imperfection of the military art but furnish the poet with the means of making us acquainted with his heroes and interesting us in their good or ill fortune at present armies are vast machines animated by the breath of their general the muse denies her assistance in the description of their evolutions she is afraid to penetrate the clouds of powder and smoke that conceal from her sight alike the coward and the brave the private sentinel and the commander in chief  xii the ancient republics of greece were ignorant of the first principles of good policy in government the people met in tumultuous assemblies rather to determine than to deliberate their factions were impetuous and lasting their insurrections frequent and terrible their most peaceful hours full of distrust envy and confusion see thucydides book iii also diodorus siculus from the xith book to the xxth almost throughout also the preface of the abbe terasson to the  d vol of his translation of diodorus siculus  also humes political essays  the citizens were indeed unhappy but their writers whose imaginations were warmed by such dreadful objects described them naturally as they were felt a peaceable administration of the laws those salutary institutions which projected in the cabinet of a sovereign or his council diffuse happiness over a whole nation excite only the poets admiration the coldest of all the passions  xiii the ancient mythology in religion which attributed life and intelligence to all nature extended its influence to the pen of the poet inspired by the muse he sung the attributes the adventures and misfortunes of his fabulous deities that infinite being which religion and philosophy have made known to us is above such description the sublimest flights become puerile on such a subject the almighty fiat of moses strikes us with admiration see the pieces of huet and despreaux in the  d vol of the works of the latter  but reason cannot comprehend nor imagination describe the operations of a deity at whose command alone millions of worlds are made to tremble nor can we read with any satisfactory pleasure of the devil in milton warring for two whole days in heaven against the armies of the omnipotent the golden compasses with which the creator in milton measures the universe excite surprise perhaps however it is puerile in him though such an image had been truly sublime in homer our philosophical ideas of the deity are injurious to the poet the same attributes debase our divinity which would have extolled the jupiter of the greeks the sublime genius of milton was cramped by the system of our religion and never appeared to so great an advantage as when he shook it a little off while on the contrary propertius a cold and insipid declaimer owes all his reputation to the agreeable pictures of his mythology   the ancients knew their advantages and profited by them accordingly of this the masterly performances we still admire are the best proofs  xiv but we the means of perceiving their beauties who are placed in another clime and born in another age are necessarily at a loss to see those beauties for want of being able to place ourselves in the same point of view with the greeks and romans a circumstantial knowledge of their situation and manners can only enable us to do this the superficial ideas the poor information we glean from a commentary assist us only to seize the more palpable and apparent beauties all the graces all the delicacies of their writings escape us and we are apt to abuse their contemporaries for want of taste in lavishing such encomiums on those merits we are too ignorant to discover an acquaintance with antiquity is the only true comment on the writings of the ancients but what is still more necessary is a certain turn of mind which is generally the result of it a sentiment not only making things known but familiarizing them to our ideas and inducing us to regard them with the eyes of ancients the famous example of perrault may serve to illustrate my meaning the rudeness of the heroic ages shocked the delicacy of the parisian it was in vain that boileau remonstrated to him that homer designed and ought to describe greeks and not frenchmen his judgment was convinced it was right but he could not be persuaded to be pleased see despreauxs remarks on longinus  a small portion of antique taste if i may so call it would have done more than all the reasonings of his antagonist  xv i have said that the poets were in the right to make use of artificial images artificial images depend on love of fame but i know not whether at the tribunal of fame it will be allowed me we are all fond of reputation but nothing is more different than the nature and degree of our passion for fame every man has different notions in his desire of reputation one writer for instance seeks only the praise of his contemporaries death puts an end to his hopes and fears of censure or applause he cares not if in the tomb that encloses his body be buried also his name such a man may without scruple employ familiar and temporary images in writing for those whom only he desires to please another on the contrary bequeaths his name to latest posterity see mallets life of bacon p     and pleases himself in thinking that a thousand years after his death the indian on the banks of the ganges and the laplander on his hills of snow will read his works and envy the happy clime and era that produced so extraordinary a genius  these who are ambitious to please universally must deduce their images from the common resources of mankind from the human heart and the representations of nature pride only can induce writers to exceed these bounds they may presume indeed that the occult beauties of their writings will always secure a family of burmans to labor in their explication and to admire the text the more because they themselves have written the comment  xvi it is not and on the nature of the subject however the character of the author altogether but that of his work which influences him in this particular the sublimer species of poetry the epopeia the tragedy the ode seldom employ the same images as comedy and satire because the former are chiefly descriptive of the passions and the latter of manners horace and plautus are almost unintelligible to those who have not learnt to live and think as the romans the rival of the latter the elegant terence is better understood because he has sacrificed pleasantry to taste whereas plautus has even prostituted decency to mirth terence one is apt to think imagined he was describing the athenians his pieces are all over greek excepting the language see teren eunuch act ii sc   heauton act i sc   the cupedinarii terence speaks of disprove not the truth of this reflection that word though we should not adopt the conjecture of sumaise was become from a proper name an appellative see terence eunuch act ii sc    plautus knew that he wrote for the entertainment of the romans and therefore with him we find at thebes at athens at calydon the manners laws and even the public buildings of rome amphytrion act i sc   quid faciam nunc si tresviri me in carcerem compegerint etc   xvii in heroic poesy contrast between the infancy and splendor of the romans although manners be not the principal objects of the piece they are made use of as ornamental in the remote and distant shadowings of the picture it is impossible to comprehend the design the art the circumstantial beauties of virgil without a perfect knowledge of the history the government and the religion of the romans of the geography of ancient italy the character of augustus and of that particular and singular relation he bore to the senate and the people see the dissertations of mr de la bleterie on the authority of the emperors in the memoirs of the academy of the belleslettres vol xix p     vol xxi p     etc vol xxiv p     etc p     etc  nothing could be more striking or interesting to this people than the contrast between rome with its three thousand citizens living in hovels thatched with straw varro de lingua latina lib iv  dionysius halicarnas lib xi p    plutarch in romans  and the same rome the metropolis of the universe whose houses were palaces whose citizens princes and whose provinces were extensive empires as florus has remarked this contrast it is not to be thought virgil was regardless of it he has struck it off in a most masterly manner evander conducts his guest through that village where every thing even its monarch was all rusticity he explains its antiquities while the poet gives artfully to understand for whom this village this future capitol concealed beneath tufts and briars was reserved virgil aeneid lib viii ver     to   0 hinc ad tarpeiam sedem et capitolia ducit aurea nunc olim sylvestribus horrida dumis  armenta videbant romanosque foro et lautis mugire carinis     how lively and striking a picture how speaking how expressive is this to a man versed in antiquity how lifeless and unmeaning to those who are no otherwise prepared to read virgil than by a natural taste for letters and a knowledge of the language  xviii the better one is acquainted with antiquity the address of virgil the more one admires the art and address of the poet his subject it must be confessed was flat enough the flight of a band of refugees their squabbles with a few villagers and the settling of a paltry town these were the boasted labors the great exploits of the pious aeneas but the poet has dignified them and in so doing has had art enough to render them interesting by an illusion too refined not to have escaped the generality of readers and too excellent to displease the critic he has embellished the rude manners of the heroic ages but has done it without disguising them nothing is more difficult for a writer educated in scenes of luxury than to describe simplicity without meanness read the epistle of penelope in ovid and you will be disgusted with that rusticity which gives so much delight in homer in the writings of madam scudery you will be as disagreeably surprised to find in the court of tomyris the splendor of that of louis the xivth one must be formed for such manners to hit off their genuine simplicity reflection has supplied the place of experience in virgil and perhaps in fenelon they knew it was necessary to elevate them a little in conformity to the delicacy of their age and country but they knew that delicacy would be shocked at too taudry embellishments  the herdsman latinus and the quarrelsome turnus are indeed elevated into great monarchs all italy trembles for the cause of liberty and aeneas triumphs over gods and men virgil knew how to reflect all the glory of the romans on their trojan ancestors the founder of rome eclipses that of lavinium it is a fire that kindles and presently blazes over the face of the earth aeneas if i may so venture to express myself contained the germe of all his descendants when besieged in his camp he naturally calls to mind a caesar and an alexis we cannot divide our admiration between them  but virgil never displayed greater address than when descended with his hero to the shades his imagination seemed at full liberty yet here he neither created new nor imaginary beings romulus and brutus scipio and caesar appeared such as they had been in life the admiration or terror of rome  xix one reads the georgics with that lively taste the beautiful excites of the georgics and that exquisite pleasure the charms of the subject naturally inspire in a susceptible mind it is easy to conceive however that our admiration would be increased by discovering in the poet a design equally noble and elevated as the execution of it is highly finished i constantly draw my examples from virgil his fine verses and the precepts of his friend horace fixed the standard of taste among the romans and may serve to convey instruction to the most distant posterity but to explain my sentiments more clearly it is necessary to trace things a little farther  xx the romans first fought for

aristotle criticism an idea of it who introduced light amidst the obscurity that clouded the works both of nature and art was the father of criticism time whose justice slow yet sure distinguished at length truth from error has demolished the statues of the philosopher but has confirmed the decisions of the critic destitute of observations he has advanced chimeras instead of facts formed in the school of plato and by the writings of homer sophocles euripides and thucidides he has drawn his rules from the nature of things and a knowledge of the human heart illustrating them by examples from the greatest models of antiquity  it is now two thousand years since the days of aristotle the critics have since improved their art they are not however as yet agreed concerning the object of their pursuit le clerc cousin desmaiseaux st martha clerici ars critica lib i c    have all defined it differently for my part i think every one of them too partial or too positive criticism is in my opinion the art of forming a judgment of writings and writers of what they have said of what they have said well and what they have said truly historically so the truth of their evidence not of their opinions the latter is in the province of logic rather than of criticism  under the first head are comprehended grammar a knowledge of languages and manuscripts a capacity of distinguishing supposed from genuine performances and of restoring the true reading of corrupted passages under the second is included the whole theory of elocution and poesy the third opens an immense field the enquiry into

with some accidental and striking passage to confirm the discoveries of the critic or stagger his hypotheses and here ends the business of the scholar the superficial reader looks no farther but admires the reading and memory of the commentator who is not less the dupe of the encomium and mistakes the materials of building for the edifice itself  xxv but the true critic is sensible his task is only begun the task of a critic he deliberates compares hesitates and decides impartial as exact he submits only to reason or to authority that is to say authority combined with experience  which is reason with regard to facts the most respectable names yield sometimes to the testimony of writers who owe all their weight to momentary circumstances the true critic ready and fertile in resources but void of false refinement scruples not to sacrifice the most brilliant the most specious hypotheses to truth nor presumes to talk to his masters in the language of mere conjecture a professed advocate for the truth he seeks that kind of proof his subject admits of and is satisfied he employs not the desperate scythe of analysis in gathering those delicate flowers that shrink and fade at the least ungentle touch at the same time as little content with insipid admiration he searches into the most secret emotions of the human heart to discover the causes of his pleasure or disgust diffident and sensible he deals not out conjectures as truths reasonings for facts or probabilities for demonstrations  xxvi geometry has been called a good species of logic criticism good logic which has been thought also a great encomium on that science as it is certainly more noble to display and improve the faculties of the human mind than to trace the limits of the material universe but has not criticism also the same pretensions to logic it has more geometry is employed only in demonstrations peculiar to itself criticism deliberates between the different degrees of probability it is by comparing these we daily regulate our actions and often determine our future destiny it is the elements of geometry and criticism that are here principally intended  let us examine here some critical probabilities  xxvii the present age controversy on the roman history which imagines itself destined to introduce change into every thing has adopted an historical skepticism as dangerous as it may be useful m de pouilly a sprightly and superficial genius who generally quoted more than he read was dubious concerning the certainty of the five first ages of rome a clear and precise definition of the certainty in dispute might have abridged the controversy it was an historical certainty this certainty however varies in different ages thus i believe in general in the existence and exploits of charlemaine but my assurance thereof is not equal to that i have of the actions of henry the fourth  but little adapted for such kind of researches he readily gave up the point to the erudition and criticisms of m freret and the abbe sallier mem de lacad des belles lettres tom vi p      0  m de beaufort revived this controversy and the roman history has suffered not a little from the attacks of a writer who not only knew to doubt but to determine  xxviii a treaty of a treaty between rome and carthage concluded between the romans and carthaginians became in the hands of this author a most powerful objection dissertation sur lincertitude de lhist romans p         this treaty is found in polybius an historian accurate as sensible polyb hist lib iii c     the original was in his time at rome and yet this authentic monument contradicted all the historians it appeared by this that l brutus and m horatius were consuls at the same time although horatius was not invested with the consulship till after the death of brutus again a people are therein called roman subjects who were at that time only allies and we hear of the marine of a nation that began to construct ships only in the time of the first punic war two hundred and fifty years after the consulship of brutus what mortifying conclusions might not be drawn from these contradictions how greatly to the disadvantage of the historians  xxix this objection of mr de beausort greatly embarrassed his adversaries this treaty cleared up they suspected the authenticity of the pretended original they even altered its date let us see if by a probable explanation we cannot reconcile this monument with the historians to do ths we shall begin by separating the date from the body of the treaty the former agrees with the time of brutus the latter resembles the manner of polybius or that of his roman antiquaries but the names of their  consuls were never inserted in their solemn  in the foedera consecrated by all the ceremonies of their religion the ministers of that religion the feciales only signed them and in this consisted the distinction between the foedera and the sponsiones the account of this circumstance for which we are indebted to livy spoponderunt consules legati quaestores tribuni militum nominaque eorum qui spoponderunt adhuc exstant ubi si ex foedere acta res esset preterquam duorum fecialium nomine extarent tit live lib ix c    obviates the difficulty the antiquaries mistook the feciales for the consuls and without thinking of the mistake as nothing obliged them to be precise in their explanation of their public monuments they distinguished the year of the expulsion of their kings by the celebrated names of the author of their liberty and the founder of the capitol it little concerned them whether they were consuls at the same time or not  xxx the people of ardea of the roman subjects antium and terrainia were not then subjects of rome at least if they were historians have given us very false ideas of the extent of that republic let us imagine ourselves existing in the time of brutus and we shall deduce from the politics of the romans a definition of the term ally very different from what we should lay down at present rome although the last colony of the latins begun very early to form the project of subjecting the whole nation to its laws its discipline and police its heroes its victories soon manifested its incontestible superirity the romans not le politic than bold made use of this superiority with a discretion worthy of their good fortune they knew well that cities baly subjected would stop the progress of their arms would waste the treasures and corrupt the manners of the republic under the more specious name therefore of allies they reconciled the vanquished to the yoke of submission while the latter consented with pleasure to acknowledge rome as the capital of the latin nation and to furnish it with a quota of troops in its wars the republic in return afforded them only bare protection the mark of that sovereignty which cost its vassals so dear these people were indeed denominated allies to rome but they soon found themselves no better than her slaves  xxxi this explication it may be said diminishes the difficulty but does not remove it  the word polybius in this place makes use of taken in its proper sense signifies a subject i will not dispute it but it must be observed we have only a translation of this treaty and though we should conditionally admit the copiests to be depended on as to the main substance and tenor of it their expressions ought not to be strictly taken according to the letter the association of our ideas is so extremely arbitrary their various shades so indistinct and languages so different and changeable that the most able translator may long look for equivalent expressions and find at last none but what are barely similar the language of this treaty was antique polybius trusted to the roman antiquaries whose vanity was apt to magnify their subject foederati said they does not directly signify allies as of people upon an equal footing let us render it therefore by the word subjects  xxxii again their marine the roman marine is an object of no little embarrassment to the critics polybius himself however assures us that the fleet of duillius polybius lib i c  0 was their first essay of this kind polybius therefore must be in one case or the other mistaken since he contradicts himself which is all the conclusion i shall draw from the matter but even admitting the truth of his relation the roman history does not therefore fall to the ground the following hypothesis affords a probable solution of this paradox and that is as much as can be reasonably expected of an hypothesis tarquin oppressed both his subjects and the army he seized and appropriated to himself their plunder which gave them a disgust to military expeditions they fitted out therefore small sloops and went to cruize at sea the infant republic protected them but by this treaty laid a restraint on their depredations the continual wars in which it was afterward engaged and wherein the land forces were well paid made this marine neglected and in an age or two it was even  that it had ever existed i shall say nothing of the fleet that appeared before tarentum as i imagine those vessels belonged to the inhabitants of thuricum  see frensheim supplem livian lib xii c      polybius may have only spoken in too indistinct and general terms  xxxiii it may be further remarked that this first marine of the romans could be composed only of vessels of no more than fifty oars galen and hiero constructed much larger ships arbuthnots tables p     histoire du commerce des anciens par huet c      the greeks and carthaginians followed the example and in the first punic war the romans fitted out vessels of three or four tier of oars a circumstance that astonishes the antiquaries and mechanics to this day so different an armament was sufficient to make them forget their former rude essays the celebrated mr freret has offered a different hypothesis agreeable enough for its simplicity but it appears to me not quite so reasonable see memoires de lacad des belles lettres tom xviii p  0  etc   xxxiv i have with pleasure undertaken the defense of an useful and interesting history reflections on this dispute my principal view however is to show by these reflections the nicety of critical discussions in which the business is not to produce demonstration but to make a comparison between opposite probabilities as also to show how little confidence ought to be placed in the most specious and dazzling systems since there are so few that can bear a free and attentive examination  xxxv a further consideration involves criticism in a new difficulty criticism though practical not to be acquired by rote there are some sciences which are purely theoretical their principles consisting only of speculative truths and not of practical maxims it is more easy barely to comprehend a proposition than to render it familiar to ones thoughts to apply it with propriety to make use of it as a guide to our studies or as a light to show us the way to new discoveries  the art of criticism is not to be acquired by rote or practice its elements are just but of themselves dry and fruitless the writer who knows these only is equally mistaken whether he determines to follow or ventures to forsake them a great genius fertile of invention master of critical rules and at the same time of the reasons on which those rules are founded will often appear to hold them very cheap new and enterprising in his attempts he will seem to have thrown off their restraint but follow him to the end and you will always find him an admirer though not an implicitone of those rules and that he always makes them the basis of his investigations and discoveries would the sciences were all legum non hominum respublica such would be the wish of a learned and wise nation the accomplishment of that wish would also constitute its felicity but it is too well known that the happiness of a people and the glory of those who instruct or govern them are different and sometimes contrary objects our literary champions apply themselves only to studies resembling the spear of achilles adapted to the arm and strength of heroes shall we try a little how we can manage it  xxxvi a legislator in criticism has pronounced that the poet should ever represent his heroes such as we find them in history  aut famam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge scriptor homerum see bentley and sanadon on verse   0 of horaces art of poetry si forte reponis achillen impiger iracundus inexorabilis acer jura neget sibi nata nihil non arrogat armis hor ars poet v     and seq  etc shall we then reduce the poet to the situation of a frigid anna is it shall we deprive him of that grand resource invention of the power of contrasting his characters and of placing them in those critical and unexpected situations in which we admire the hero or tremble for the man or shall we not rather attached to beauties more than rules be more ready to pardon a writers anachronisms than his dullness  xxxvii to charm to move to elevate the soul are the great objects of poetry its particular laws therefore should never make us forget they were framed to aid and not embarrass the efforts of genius we have seen philosophy so environed with demonstrations as hardly to admit the most obvious of received opinions these however are the peculiar province of poetry we are pleased at taking a review of the heroes and events of antiquity when they are travestied in the representation we are struck with surprise but it is a surprise that revolts against the innovation if a writer has a mind to risque any thing new he should reflect whether the beauties of the alteration or novelty be striking or trivial whether they will compensate for that violation of the rules which they only can justify  the anachronisms of ovid greatly displease us in matters of geography and chronology no dependence is to be made on ovid that poet being grossly ignorant in both these sciences read the description of the voyages of medea metamorph lib vii v   0 to  0  and the xivth book of the same metamorph the one passage abounds with geographical errors that offend even the commentators and the other is full of chronological blunders  as truth is violated without embellishment how different is that of virgil respecting mezentius who dies by the hand of ascanius serve ad virg aeneid lib iv v   0  dion halicarnass antiq romans lib i  but what reader can be so cold and insensible as to attend a moment to this circumstance when he sees aeneas the minister of divine vengeance become the protector of oppressed nations dart the thunder of his rage on the head of the guilty tyrant but melt with pity over the unfortunate victim of his resentment the youthful and pious lausus worthy another father and a better fate had the poet been confined to historical truth how many beauties had he not lost encouraged by this success however he wanders from it when he should have pursued it aeneas arrives at the longwishedfor shores of italy the latins run together to defend their habitations and every thing

foretold who brought with him from asia his gods a race of heroes and a promise of universal empire latinus offered him an asylum and his daughter livy lib i c    what a subject this for the drama how worthy the majesty of the epopeia and the pen of virgil let any one who will venture compare this with the embassy of ilioneus the description of the palace of latinus and the discourse of that monarch virg aeneid lib viii v       xxxviii the poet explanations and restrictions i say again may safely venture to depart from truth provided the reader finds in his fiction the same pleasure which truth and consistency would give him not that it is permitted to subvert the annals of an age for the sake of introducing an antithesis nor will this rule i am persuaded be thought severe upon the rights of invention if we reflect that all mankind are possessed of some degree of sensibility but that knowledge is the portion only of a few it is to be observed also that beauty of sentiment operates more powerfully on the soul than that of truth on the understanding the writer however should always remember that there are some liberties which must not be taken not even the sublime imagination of a milton joined to the harmonious versification of a voltaire could ever reconcile the reader to a cowardly caesar a virtuous catasine or henry the th subduing the romans in foring a just association of ideas the chacters of great men should doubtless be held sacred but poets in writing their history may be indulged in giving it us rather as it ought to have been than as it actually was pure invention is less disgusting than essential alterations because the latter seems to infer error and the former only simple ignorance it is besides much easier to reconcile times than places  great indulgence ought certainly to be given to the ancients whose chronology depended in a great measure on the poets who modelled it almost as they pleased whoever condemns the episode of dido must have more philosophy or less taste than i have it may nevertheless be doubted whether this episode is so irreconcilable to chronological truth as has been imagined according to the plausible system of sir isaac newton aeneas and dido were cotemporaries see newtons chronology of ancient kingdoms reformed p     the romans certainly ought to know the history of carthage better than the greeks the archives of carthage were removed to rome universal history vol xviii p          the punic language was well enough understood there plaut penul act v sc    the romans readily consulted the africans concerning their origin sallust in bell jugurth c    ammian marcell lib xxii mem de lacad des belles lettres tom iv p      besides virgil adopts a chronology more agreeable to the computations of a newton than to those of eratosthenes which is of itself a sufficient disculpation my readers will not be displeased perhaps to see the proofs of what is here advanced seven years

romans  hic jam ter centos totos regnabitur annos gente sub hectorea idem lib i v      these are the expressions virgil has put in the mouth of jupiter but our chronologists give themselves no concern to make the thunderer keep his word they represent the city of alba as destroyed by tullus hostilius almost  00 years after its foundation and about  00 years after that of rome see les tables chronolog dhelvicus  the system of sir isaac newton however makes all easy the destruction of troy placed in the year  0  and followed by an interval of     years brings us down to      0 years after the palilia an epoch that agrees much better with the reign of the third successor of romulus newtons chronology p    etc  there is an ancient tradition preserved by plutarch see plutarch in numa  which exactly coincides the books of nama were found ann ante chr     four hundred years after the death of that king and the commencement of the reign of hostilius numa died then     years before the christian era how artful was it in the poet to lay hold of the time aeneas arrives at carthage to reply to his critics in the only manner the rapidity of his course and the greatness of his subject would permit him he makes it appear that according to his theory this rencounter of dido and aeneas is not a poetic license virgil is not the only one who has called in question the vulgar chronology of the latin kings i imagine i can trace the same ideas in his contemporary pompeius that historian the rival of livy and sallust flav vopisc in proem aurelian  attributes the same period of duration  00 years to the kingdom of alba had not his universal history been lost we should probably have there found particular and circumstantial proofs of this opinion as it is we must be satisfied with the simple exposition of his abbreviator albam longam condidit quae trecentis annis caput regni fuit justin lib xliii c    livy himself that father of roman history who sometimes shows so great an attachment to the vulgar chronology but generally runs over the difficult passages in a manner that betrays his credulity and ignorance seems to distrust his guides in those early ages tit live lib i c    and elsewhere  nothing was more natural than for him to take notice how long those kings reigned whom he mentions livy lib i c    yet is he entirely silent on this head nothing was more necessary than to ascertain at least the interval between aeneas and romulus which he has notwithstanding neglected nor is ths all the destruction of alba he says happened  00 years after it was founded idem lib i c     in retrenching an  00 years for the reigns of romulus and of numa and for the half of that of hostilius there remain just  00 instead of  00 as is given by the chronology of eratosthenes livy therefore nearly agrees with virgil the little difference between them serving rather to confirm than dissolve their agreement  i foresee an objection but as it is one of the most trivial to reply to it would be only to form monsters for the sake of subduing them i shall therefore finish this digression already too long     xxxix the farther we advance in the sciences the more we are convinced of their intimate connection their prospect resembles that of a thick and extensive forest at first view the trees of which it is composed appear separate and distinct but pierce the surface of the soil and their roots are all intermixed and connected  there is no study even the most contemptible and least cultivated that does not sometimes fall upon facts strike out lights or raise objections closely connected with the most sublime and distant branches of science it is pleasing to dwell on this consideration different people and professions ought to be made acquainted with their reciprocal wants display to an englishman the advantages of a frenchman represent to a naturalist the benefits of literature by these means philosophy extends itself humanity is a gainer men heretofore rivals become brothers  xl in all the sciences we depend on reasonings and facts the connection between physics and literature without the latter the objects of our study would be chimerical and without the former our most scientific acquirements would be implicit and irrational thus it is the belleslettres are miscellaneous and thus every branch of natural philosophy the study of which under an apparent meanness often hides its real importance is equally so if physics has its buffoons it has also to speak the language of the times its erudits its pedants the knowledge of antiquity presents both to the one and the other a plentiful harvest of facts proper to display the secrets of nature or at least to prevent those who make them their study from embracing a cloud instead of a goddess what information may not a physician draw from the description of the plague that depopulated athens i can admire with him the majesty and force of thucydides thucydides lib i  the art and energy of lucretius lucretius de re nature lib vii v      etc  but he goes farther and learns from the miseries of the athenians to alleviate those of his countrymen  i know the ancients applied themselves but little to the study of nature that destitute of instruments and single in their experiments they were able to collect only a small number of observations mixed with uncertainty diminished by the injuries of time and scattered up and down at random through a number of volumes m freret thinks the philosophical observations of the ancients more exact than is commonly imagined those who are acquainted with this authors arguments and talents will know the weight of his authority see mem de lacad des belleslettres tom xviii p     but should their scarcity induce us to neglect them the activity of the human mind is usually increased by difficulties and strange would it be if relaxation and negligence should be the offspring of necessity  xli the most zealous advocates for the moderns the advantages of the ancients i think dont deny the superior advantages which the ancients in some respects possessed the representations on their amphitheatre i shudder at the recollection of the bloody spectacles of the romans those savage combats of wild beasts which cicero so much despised and detested cicero envies the happiness of his friend marius who spent his time in the country during the magnificent diversions of pompey he speaks with sufficient contempt of the other representations but particularly of the combats of wild beasts reliquiae sunt venationes says he binae per dies quinque magnifice nemo negat sed quae potest homini esse polito delectatio cum aut homo imbecillus a valentissima bestia laniatur aut praeclara bestia venabulo transverberatur  solitude and silence were by him preferred to these masterpieces of magnificence horror and wretchedness of taste cicero ad familias lib vii epist    in fact to take delight in bloodshed is only worthy an herd of savages  the construction of palaces in which to exhibit the combats of wild beasts could be thought of only among a people who preferred the decorations and machinery of a theater to the finest verses and the most exquisite beauties of the drama horat lib ii epist   v      but such were the romans their virtues their vices and even their most ridiculous amusements were connected with their ruling passion the love of their country  those spectacles nevertheless so shocking in the eye of the philosopher so frivolous in that of a man of taste ought to be valued by the naturalist let us imagine the whole world ransacked to furnish subjects for these diversions the treasures of the rich the influence of the great all employed to find out creatures remarkable for their figure strength or rarity to bring them into the amphitheatre at rome and there to make a display of the whole animal see essais de mont vol iii p   0  this must certainly be an admirable school particularly for the study of that noblest branch of natural history which applies itself rather to the nature and properties of animals than to the minute description of their bones and muscles we must not forget that pliny frequented this school nor that ignorance has two daughters incredulity and implicit faith let us be equally cautious to defend ourselves against the one and the other  xlii if we leave this theater to enter on a more extensive one the countries in which the ancient physicians studied nature and enquire what countries were open to the researches of the ancient naturalists we shall find they had in this respect no reason to complain  navigation indeed has since discovered to us another hemisphere but the discoveries of the seaman and the voyages of the merchant do not always improve the world so much as they enrich it the limits of the known world are more confined than the material one while those of the enlightened world are still more narrow and contracted from

understand the least  xliv next to the talent of discernment of a genius for philosophy the rarest thing in the world says the judicious bruyere we may prize pearls and diamonds i will not scruple to place the talent for philosophizing above that of discernment pretensions to this talent there is nothing in the world more talked of less known or more rare there is not a writer of them all who does not aspire to it or would not readily give up his pretensions to science to make good his claim to this press him ever so little and he will admit that a nice judgment must embarrass the operations of genius but he will notwithstanding constantly assure you that the philosophical spirit which breathes throughout his writings is characteristical of the present age the philosophical turn and talents of a few great men have according to him formed the genius of the age this influence has extended itself over all the different ranks in the state and has trained up scholars worthy of such eminent masters  xlv if we take a survey what it is not however of the works of our philosophers their diversity will leave us in great doubt concerning the nature of this talent and this may not unreasonably lead us to doubt also whether it has fallen to their lot with some it consists in a humor for striking out into some new path and for exploding every established opinion whether that of a socrates or a spanish inquisitor for no other reason than because it is established with others again it is the same thing as a talent for geometry that haughty and imperious science which not content with absolute sovereignty itself has proscribed its sister sciences and pronounces all reasoning unworthy that name whose object is not confined to lines and figures let us do justice however to that enterprizing spirit whose errors have sometimes led the way to truth and whose very extravagancies like the rebellion of a people have inspired a salutary indignation against arbitrary power let us acknowledge every thing we owe to the mathematics but let us at present attend to the genius of philosophy an object more judicious than the former and less confined than the latter  xlvi those who are intimately acquainted with the writings of cicero what it is tacitus bacon leibnitz bail fontenelle and montesquieu will be able to form a more just and adequate idea of this talent than what i shall attempt to describe  a philosophical genius consists in the capacity of recurring to the most simple ideas in discovering and combining the first principles of things the possessor of this distinguishing faculty has a view as piercing as extensive situated on an eminence he takes in a wide extensive field of which he forms a precise and exact idea while a genius of an inferior cast though what he sees he distinguishes with equal precision is more contracted in his views and discovers only a part of the whole a philosopher may be a mathematician a musician an antiquary but in every thing he is still the philosopher and in consequence of his abilities to comprehend the first principles of his art he rises superior to every other artist placed among that small number of geniuses formed for so arduous a task he labors to complete that elementary science to which if once brought to perfection every other must submit taken in this sense a philosophical genius is very uncommon there are many men capable of forming particular ideas with precision but there are few who can comprehend in one abstract idea a numerous association of others less general  xlvii will it be asked the assistance it may gain from literature what study can form such a genius i know of none it is the gift of heaven which the greater part of mankind are ignorant of or despise it is the wish of the wise some have received but not one has acquired it i conceive however that the study of literature the habit of becoming by turns a greek a roman the disciple of zeno and of epicurus is extremely proper to exercise its powers and display its merit it is remarkable that throughout that infinite diversity of geniuses there is a general conformity of sentiment between those whom their age country and religion have led to take a view of the same objects in nearly the same manner we see that minds the most exempt from prejudice cannot altogether shake it off their ideas have an air of paradox and we perceive even by their broken chains that they have worn them it is among the greeks that i look for the abettors of democracy among the romans the enthusiasts to the love of their country among the subjects of commodus severus and caracalla for the apologists for arbitrary power and among the ancient followers of epicurus the enemies of the religion of their country epicurus had no sooner published his doctrines than some people expressed themselves freely on the established religion and began to regard it only as a political institution lucret de rer not lib i v    sallust in bell catilin c    cicero pro cluent c     what a retrospect is it to a genius truly philosophical to see the most absurd opinions received among the most enlightened people to see barbarians on the other hand arrive at the knowledge of the most sublime truths to find true consequences falsely deduced from the most erroneous principles admirable principles bordering on the verge of truth without ever conducting thither languages formed on ideas and yet those ideas corrected by such languages the springs of morality universally the same the opinions of contentious metaphysics universally varied and generally extravagant accurate only while superficial but subtle obscure and uncertain whenever they were profound a philosophical work written by an iroquois though full of absurdities would be to us an inestimable performance it would present us with a singular instance of the nature of the human mind placed in circumstances we have never experienced and influenced by customs and religious opinions totally different from ours sometimes it would surprise and instruct us by the contrariety of ideas that would thence necessarily arise we should be led to enquire into the reasons and trace the mind from error to error sometimes again we should see our own principles but deduced by different means and almost always peculiarly modified and altered we should hence learn not only to acknowledge but to feel the force of prejudice we should learn never to be surprised at apparent absurdity and often to suspect the truth of what might appear to want no confirmation  i must own i like to see the reasonings of mankind take a tincture from their prejudices to take a view of such as are afraid to deduce even from principles they acknowledge to be just conclusions which they know to be logically exact i like to detect those who detest in a barbarian what they admire in a greek and who would call the same history impious if written by an heathen and sacred if penned by a jew  without a philosophical knowledge of antiquity we should be induced to do too much honor to humankind the influence of custom would be little known we should every moment be apt to confound the incredible and the absurd the romans were an enlightened people and yet these very romans were not shocked at seeing united in the person of caesar a god a priest and an atheist if not in denying the existence at least in disbelieving the providence of the deity for caesar was a follower of epicurus those who have a mind to see how obscure a man of abilities may render the clearest

idle pomp he used to send for pansa and trebatius to laugh with him at the credulity of the vulgar and at those deities which were the effect and objects of their fear lucretius born with that enthusiasm of imagination which forms great poets and enterprizing missionaries was desirous of being both the one and the other i must pity the theologue however who cannot grant some indulgence to the latter for the sake of the former this philosopher after having proved a divinity in spite of himself by attributing the phenomena of nature to general causes proceeds to enquire how the notion he controverts came to be so universally entertained for this he discovers three reasons i our dreams for in these we conceive beings and effects that we never meet with in the material world and attribute to them a real existence and immense power ii our ignorance of the works of nature which makes us on every occasion recur to the hand of a divinity iii our fear which is the effect of that ignorance this induces us to submit to the calamities which happen to the earth and excites us to endeavor to appease by our prayers some invisible being that is supposed to afflict us lucretius expresses this last motive with an energy and a rapidity of style which bears all before it and will not give the reader time to examine its validity  praeterea cui non animus formidine divum contrahitur cui non conrepunt membra pavore fulminis horribili cum plaga torrida tellus contremit et magnum percurrunt murmura celum non populi gentesque tremunt regesque superbi conripiunt divum

history is to a philosophical genius what play was to the marquis dangeau fontenelle dans leloge du marq de dangeau  he saw a system regularity and connection where others only perceived the wanton caprices of chance the knowledge of history is to the philosopher that of causes and effects it deserves therefore that i should endeavor to lay down some rules not to enable genius to proceed but to prevent its wandering from the right path perhaps if things had been always duly considered subtlety had not been so often mistaken for ingenuity obscurity for profundity or a turn for paradox been misconceived to be the index of a creative genius  xlix rules for the choice of facts among a multitude of historical facts there are some and those by much the majority which prove nothing more than that they are facts there are others which may be useful in drawing a partial conclusion whereby the philosopher may be enabled to judge of the motives of an action or some peculiar features in a character these relate only to single links of the chain those whose influence extends throughout the whole system and which are so intimately connected as to have given motion to the springs of action are very rare and what is still more rarely to be met with is a genius who knows how to distinguish them amidst the vast chaos of events wherein they are jumbled and deduce them pure and unmixt from the rest  it will appear unnecessary to observe to those whose judgment is superior to their erudition that causes ought always to be proportioned to their effects that it is wrong to trace the character of an age from the conduct of an individual or to estimate from a single effort often forced and destructive the strength and riches of a state it will be needless to put such in mind that it is only by collecting and comparing facts any judgment is to be deduced from them that a signal action may sometimes dazzle like a flash of lightening but that we shall be able to gather little from it unless we compare it with others of the same kind the romans in making choice of cato showed they liked better to be corrected than flattered live lib xxxix c  0 plut in cato  and this they did in the same age in which they condemned the like manly severity in the person of livius salinator live lib xxix c      l trivial facts of consequence it is safer to yield to facts that of themselves unite to form a system than to such as one may discover in consequence of a preconceived hypothesis slight circumstances are also often more worthy notice than the most brilliant actions it being exactly the same thing with an age or a nation as with the individual alexander displays his character more in the tent of darius quintus curtius de reb gest alexandri lib iii c    than in the field of battle i discover as much the ferocity of the roman people in their condemnation of an unhappy criminal to be torn to pieces in the amphitheatre as in their strangling a captive king before the capitol there is no preparatory disguise to trivial actions we undress only when we imagine we are not seen but the curious will endeavor to penetrate the most secret retirement should i undertake to determine whether virtue prevailed in the character of a certain age or people i should examine into their actions rather than their discourse in order to condemn them as vicious the difference between virtue and vice i should attend rather to their words than their actions virtue is praised without being known known without being felt and felt without being practiced but the case is different with vice we are led to vice by our passions and defend it by subtlety of reasoning there are besides bad men in all ages and countries but if the depravation be not too general even these will show some respect to the times if the age itself is vicious and they are apt enough to discern this they hold it in contempt show themselves openly what they are and laugh at penalties which they flatter themselves will fall but lightly in this also they are never deceived the man who in the time of cato had detested vice would have contented himself with the simple admiration of virtue in that of tiberius  li the age of tiberius the most vicious of antiquity i have made choice of this age with design vice had then arrived at its highest pitch this i learn from the court of tiberius itself but there is a small circumstance related by suetonius and tacitus which gives me a still greater assurance of it it is this the virtue of the romans punished the inconstancy of their wives with death the romans entrusted the fidelity of their wives to the care and determination of their family the relations met if any one was accused judged condemned to death and executed their own sentence on the criminal the laws also pardoned the husband or father who in the transport of his passion killed the gallant particularly if of a servile rank see plut in romans  dionys halicarn lib

cicero excuses the debaucheries of his client and the exhortation of cato sufficiently explain the morals of the romans in this respect they censured debauchery only so far as it prevented the discharge of the essential duties of the citizen  nor were their ears more chaste than their actions the casina of plautus is little known but those who have read that miserable piece can hardly comprehend how it is possible that there should be but forty or fifty years between that farce and the andria it consists of a vile intrigue between a parcel of slaves heightened only by smutty jests and obscenities low as their condition none of plautuss comedies however were played so often nor received with so much applause as this wretched performance such were the roman manners at the time of the second punic war such that virtue which the posterity of ancient rome so much regretted and admired see terent adelph act i sc    cicero pro caelio c     hor sat lib i sat   v    prolog ad casin piaut    and in order even to regulate their irregularities formed them into a licensed body now it appears that under tiberius a great number of women of distinction did not blush to make public application to the ediles to get themselves enrolled among the number of privileged curtezans and thus though to their own infamy broke through that barrier which the laws opposed to their prostitution sueton lib iii c     tacit annal lib ii c      lii a parallel between tacitus and livy to select those facts which ought to form the principles of our reasonings is a task whose extreme difficulty is easy to be perceived the negligence or bad taste of an historian may probably have occasioned us to lose for ever a choice circumstance for the sake of stunning our ears with the noise of a battle if philosophers are not always historians it were at least to be wished that all historians were philosophers  tacitus is the only writer i know that comes up to my idea of such a philosophical historian even the interesting livy himself cannot in this sense be compared to him both indeed have soared far above those ignorant compilers who see nothing in facts but the circumstances of which they are composed but the one has written history as a rhetorician and the other as a philosopher not that either tacitus was ignorant of the language of the passions or livy in that of reason but the latter more earnest to please than instruct conducts us step by step in the retinue of his heroes and makes us alternately experience the effects of horror pity and admiration tacitus employs the force of rhetoric only to display the connection between the links that form the chain of historical events and to instruct the reader by sensible and profound reflections it is true i climb the alps with hannibal but i deliberate in the council of tiberius livy describes to me the abuse of power a severity that nature shudders at while it approves the spirit of resentment and patriotism which constitute that of liberty and the tyranny which fell before their united efforts livy lib iii c      0  but the laws of the decemvir their character their failings their conformity to the genius of the roman people to their own party to their ambitious designs all these he has entirely forgotten i do not find it accounted for in him why the laws made for the use of a small poor and halfcivilized republic should overturn it when the force of their institution had carried it to the highest pitch of greatness this i should have found in tacitus i think so not only from the known bent of his genius but from that striking and diversified picture he has given of the laws those children of corruption of liberty of equity and of faction tacit annal lib iii p    edit lips   liii remarks of an observation of mr dalembert an eminent writer who like fontenelle has united erudition and taste gives us a piece of advice which i would by no means have followed at the

however without fear of incurring the contemptible name of a mere scholar against the sentence of this enlightened but severe judge no let us carefully preserve every historical fact a montesquieu may discover in the most trivial connections unknown to the vulgar let us in this imitate the botanists every plant is not useful in medicine they proceed nevertheless in their search after new ones in hopes that some happy genius or experiment may discover properties in them hitherto concealed  live mankind are either too systematical or too capricious uncertainty is a state of constraint a contracted mind cannot fix itself in that exact equilibrium affected by the school of pirrho a bright genius is often dazzled by its own conjecture and sacrifices its liberty to hypotheses it is this disposition that is productive of systems design has been often observed to govern the actions of a great man a ruling principle has been perceived in his character hence theoretical minds have conceived the notion that mankind in general are as systematical in practice as in speculation they have pretended to discover art in our passions policy in our foibles dissimulation in our caprices in a word by their endeavors to enhance the merit of the understanding they have done little honor to the heart  justly disgusted at such excessive refinement and displeased to see those pretensions extended to mankind in general which should be confined to a philip or a caesar others of a more natural turn have run into the other extreme these have entirely banished art from the moral world in order to substitute accident in its room according to them weak mortals act altogether from caprice the phrenzy of a madman raises up the pillars of an empire and the weakness of a woman throws them down  lv of general and determinate causes the study of general and determinate causes should be agreeable to both parties as in this the one would with pleasure see the pride of man humbled the motives of his actions unknown to himself a puppet moved by foreign wires and from particular liberty would see the origin of general necessity the others also would find in the study of general causes that connection they so much admire and ample room for indulging these speculations for which their genius is turned  what a wide field opens itself to my reflection the theory of general causes would in the hands of a montesquieu become a philosophical history of man he would display these causes operating in the rise and fall of empires successively assuming the appearance of accident of prudence of courage and of cowardice acting without the concurrence of particular causes and sometimes directly against them superior to a fondness for his own systems that meanest passion in a philosopher he would discover that notwithstanding the extensive influence of those causes its effect must necessarily be confined and that it would principally display itself in general events in such whose slow but certain operation works imperceptibly a change on the face of things particularly on religion on manners and indeed every thing that depends on opinion such would in part be the lesson such a philosopher would give on the subject as to myself i only lay hold of it as an occasion just to exercise my thoughts to this end i shall point out some interesting facts and endeavor to account for them  lvi the system of paganism we are not ignorant of the pleasant and absurd system of paganism according to which the universe is peopled with whimsical beings whose superior power only serves to make them more unjust and ridiculous than ourselves what could be the nature and origin of these deities were they princes founders of societies or inventors of the arts did ingenuous genuous gratitude implicit admiration or an interested homage place those great men in heaven when dead who while they lived were esteemed as the benefactors of mankind on earth or may we not discover in those divinities so many different parts of the universe to whom the ignorance of primitive ages attributed life and sentiment this question is worth our attention and curious as it is is no less difficult to resolve  lvi the difficulty of coming to the knowledge of a religion we have no other method of coming at the knowledge of the heathen system than by means of their poets we must however distinguish homer hesiod pindar and the tragic poets who lived in an age when their tradition was more pure and priests both greatly addicted to fiction see on this article dr middletons free enquiry and the history of manichism by m de beausobre  the enemies of a religion never arrive at a just knowledge of it because they hate it and often hate it for that very reason because they are ignorant of it they eagerly adopt the most atrocious calumnies thrown out against it they impute to their adversaries even dogmas they detest and draw consequences which the accused never once thought of on the other hand the professors of a religion full of that implicit faith which makes a crime of doubt often sacrifice both their reason and virtue in its defense to invent prophecies and miracles to palliate those they cannot defend to allegorize those they cannot palliate and to deny stoutly those they cannot allegorize are means which devotees have never blushed to employ call to mind the christians and the jews and see what their enemies the magicians and idolaters tacit hist lib v  fleury hist eccles tom i p     tom ii p   with the apologies of justin and tertullian which are there cited have had to say against them against those whose worship was as pure as their manners irreproachable never was there a true mussulman who hesitated about the unity of god dherbelot bibliot orient artic allah p  00 et saless alcoran prelim disc p     and yet how often have our good ancestors accused the mahometans of worshipping the stars reland de rel mahomm part ii c   and    nay even in the center of these religions have started up an hundred different sectaries who accusing each other of having corrupted the common articles of their faith have excited the mob to zeal and fury and the discerning few to moderation these were notwithstanding a civilized people and had books which acknowleged to be written by the inspiration of divinity settled the principles of their faith but how were these principles to be discovered amidst a confused heap of fables which a single contradictory and diversified tradition had taught a few clans of savages in greece  lvii reason of little use reason is here of little use it is absurd to consecrate temples to those whose tombs are before our eyes but what is too absurd for mankind dont we know that there are very enlightened people who appeal to the evidence of sense as a proof of the truth of their religion while at the same time one of their principal dogmas is directly contradictory to that evidence if the gods of paganism however had been men the reciprocal homage warburtons divine legation vol i p   0      their worshippers had paid them had been something reasonable and a toleration something reasonable is not generally the fault of the multitude  lviii cresus sent to consult the oracle at delphos cresus sent to consult the oracle at delphos herodotus lib i  and alexander traversed the burning sands of lybia to know of jupiter ammon if he was not his son diodorus siculus lib xvii  quint curt lib iv c    arrian lib iii  but had this grecian jupiter this king of crete become possessed of the thunder would he not have let it loose to crush that ammon that lybian that new salmoneus who endeavored to wrest it from him if two rivals dispute the empire of the world is it possible to acknowledge both at once if indeed they were no otherwise distinguished than as the ether and the heavens the same divinity the greek and the african might describe it by these symbols which their manners and by those terms which their different languages should furnish them with to express its attributes but we have nothing to do with speculative argumentation we are to enquire only of facts  lix the religion of the greeks was of egyptian origin the greeks but wretched inhabitants of the forest proud as they were were obliged for every thing to strangers the phenicians taught them the use of letters for their arts for their laws for every thing that raises man above the brute they were indebted to the egyptians the latter brought over their religion and the greeks in adopting it paid that tribute which ignorance owes to wisdom their ancient prejudices made only a formal resistance and gave up the point without difficulty after hearing the sense of the oracle of dodona who determined in favor of the new religion herod lib ii  such is the relation of herodotus who was well acquainted both with greece and egypt while the age in which he lived being that interval between the grossness of ignorance and the refinements of philosophy renders his testimony decisive  lx the egyptian religion allegorical i see already a great part of the greek legends fall to the ground of their apollo born in the island of delos and their jupiter buried in crete if these deities were ever upon earth egypt and not greece was their habitation but if the priests of memphis understood their religion so well as the abbe bannier in his mythology explained by history  not egypt itself gave birth to their gods the light of reason shone too clearly through the obscurity of their metaphysics not to enable them to perceive that human beings could never become gods and that the gods never transformed themselves into mere men herodot lib ii  mysterious in their tenets as in their worship these interpreters of wisdom and the divinity disguised by a pompous style the truths of nature which an ignorant people had despised if delivered to them in their genuine majestic simplicity the greeks were ignorant of this religion in many respects they altered it by the introduction of foreign mixtures but the groundwork remained still the same and that being egyptian was consequently allegorical i am much indebted in these enquiries to the learned freret of the academy of belleslettres he has opened a route which appears obvious from all sides i conceive however that he reasons much better on facts than dogmas prejudiced greatly in his favor i eagerly ran over his reply to the chronology of sir isaac newton but may i venture to say it by no means answered my expectations i see nothing new in that piece if we except the principles of a new theology and chronology which however we already possessed in the mem de lacad des belles lettres tom v xviii xx xxiii  some defective and inconclusive genealogy a few minute researches into the chronology of sparta an ancient system of astronomy which i do not well understand and the elegant preface of m de bougainville which indeed i peruse every time with additional pleasure   lxi of the worship of heroes the worship of heroes so well distinguished from that of the gods in the primitive ages of greece proves that their gods were not heroes hist de lacad dea belleslettres tom xvi p    etc  the ancients believed that these great men admitted after their decease to the feasts of the gods enjoyed their felicity without participating of their power hence they assembled about the tombs of their benefactors celebrated their memory in songs of praise mem de litter tom xii p   etc et zech spanheim in callim  and this excited a salutary emulation of their virtue while they imagined the ghosts of the dead conjured up from the shades took pleasure in these offerings of their devotion it is true that this species of devotion became insensibly a religious worship but it was not till long after when the identity of these heroes became confused with that of the ancient deities whose name they bore or whose characters they resembled they were considered as distinct in the days of homer hercules is not one of his divinities he acknowleges aesculapius only as an eminent physician homer iliad lib iv v      and castor and pollux are with him two deceased warriors buried at sparta id lib v v       lxii the system of ephemerus superstition however had exceeded these bounds the heroes were become gods and the worship paid to them as deities had elevated them above the rank of men when an enterprising philosopher undertook to prove they had been mortals ephemerus the messenian advanced this paradoxical opinion lactant instit lib i

this relation of lactantius differs a little from that of diodorus    but instead of appealing to the authentic monuments of greece and egypt which might have preserved the memory of those celebrated men he launched forth and lost himself in the ocean an utopia held in derision by the ancients the rich the fertile superstitious isle of panchia known to himself only furnished him with a magnificent

always gathering something tells us that the inscription intimated that jupiter no longer thundered but had submitted to the fate of mortals   the system of ephemerus however notwithstanding the insufficiency of his proofs by degrees gained ground diodorus siculus searched the world over for traditions of different people to support it diodorus siculus in his first five books  but the stoics in their whimsical mixture of pure theism spinosism and popular idolatry adopted this paganism for which they were sticklers to the worship of nature divided into as many deities as it had different

can blame them say those pretended divinities were not in fact originally deified mortals they were now become so at least in the opinion of their worshippers and their opinions were all the fathers troubled themselves about  lxv a concatenation of errors let us go still further and endeavor to trace a connected series not of facts but of notions to sound the human heart and to lay hold of that chain of errors which from a sentiment so just simple and universal as that there is a power above us conducted by degrees to the conception of deities which a man would blush to resemble  sentiment is only a conscious appeal to ourselves the sentiments of uncivilized men confused our ideas relate to objects without us and by their number and diversity enseeble the sentiment it is therefore among uncultivated savages whose ideas are confined to their wants and whose wants are simply those of nature that the force of sentiment should be more keen and lively although at the same time confused and indistinct savage man must be every moment in agitations he can neither explain nor suppress ignorant and weak he is afraid of every thing because he can defend himself from nothing he admires every thing because he knows nothing the despicable opinion he justly entertains of himself for vanity is the creature of society makes him perceive the existence of some superior power it is this power whose attributes he is ignorant of that he invokes and of whom he asks assistance without knowing what pretensions he may have to hope it will be granted this sentiment indistinct as it was naturally produced the good deities of the primitive greeks and the divinities of most of the savage nations none of whom however knew how to ascertain their number attributes or worship  lxvi every thing he sees becomes an object of adoration this sentiment in time is modified into a notion savage man pays homage to every thing about him as every thing seems to him more excellent than himself the majestic oak that shelters him with its spreading boughs had afforded a shade to his ancestors down from the first of his race it lifted its head into the clouds while the towering eagle lost itself in its branches what was the duration the size the strength of an human creature compared to such a tree gratitude next united itself to admiration that oak which afforded him plenty of acorns the clear stream at which he quenched his thirst were his benefactors they made his life comfortable without them he could not subsist while at the same time they stood in no need of him in effect without these lights that enable us to see how much reason alone is superior to all those necessary parts of an intelligent system every one of them is superior to man but wanting such lights savage man attributes life and power to them all and prostrates himself before imaginary beings which he has thus created  lxvii his ideas are singular the ideas of uncivilized man are singular because they are simple to remark the different qualities of objects to observe those which are common to many and from that resemblance to form an abstract idea representative of the genus of objects without being the image of any one in particular this is the operation of the understanding which acts and reflects within itself and which overstocked with ideas thus endeavors to relieve itself by the forms of method in a primitive state the soul passive and ignorant of its faculties is capable only of receiving external impressions these impressions represent only single objects and in such a manner as they seem to exist in themselves the savage therefore sees himself surrounded with deities every field every forest swarms with them  lxviii he combines his ideas and multiplies his deities experience unfolds his ideas for individuals as well as societies owe every thing to experience a variety of objects becoming familiar to his perceptions he begins to discover their common nature and this nature becomes a new divinity superior to all particular deities but every thing that exists has its existence determined by time or place which distinguish its identity now the humanmind would be differently influenced with regard to these two modes of existence the one being plain and obvious to the senses the other transient metaphysical and perhaps nothing more than the succession of our ideas a common property varied only in the mode of time would eclipse all particular properties whilst those which should be diversified in the mode of place might subsist as distinct parts of a common property the god of rivers lays an indisputed claim to his local rights on the tiber and clitumnus hist de lacad des belleslettres tom xii p     plin epist lib viii epist    but the southwind that blew yesterday and that we feel today are both the same blustering tyrant that stirs up the mountainous waves of the adriatic hor carm lib iii od    neque auster dux inquieti turbidus adriae      lxix combination of ideas continued the more the mind exercises its thoughts the more it combines its ideas two species are different in some respects and alike in others they are destined to the same use they are part of the same element the stream of a fountain becomes a river the river loses itself in the sea this sea makes part of a vast ocean of waters that encompass the whole earth while the earth itself contains every thing that subsists by the principle of vegetation in proportion as mankind become enlightened their idolatry would refine they would become better able to perceive how the universe is governed by general laws and would approach nearer the unity of a sole efficient cause the greeks could never generalize their ideas beyond the elements of water earth and air which under the names of jupiter neptune and pluto comprehended and governed all things but the egyptians whose genius was better adapted to abstract speculations arrived at length to their osiris it is worth observing that this osiris and his sister were said to be the youngest of the deities it required a great many ages for the egyptians to arrive at this simplicity or principal divinity an intelligent principle which operated constantly on the material principle couched under the name and personage of isis his wife and sister those who believe in the eternity of matter can hardly go farther than this the worhip of the sun has prevailed in all nations i  give what appear to me the reasons of it it is  the only object in the world that is at once sole and perceptible perceptible to all the nations upon earth in the most brilliant and beneficent manner it is no wonder it should attract their homage sole and indivisible those who reasoned on the subject and were not too difficult discovered in it all the distinguishing marks of divinity   lxx the generation and hierarchy of gods jupiter neptune and gristly pluto were brothers the branches of whose posterity spread themselves infinitely wide and comprehended the whole system of nature such was the mythology of the ancients to the ignorant the idea of  was more natural than that  it was more easy for them to acquire and supposed less power exerted in the operation this generation however led them to establish an hierarchy which these beings though free yet limited could not possibly do without thus the three principal deities exercised a paternal authority over their children dispersed in the air over the earth and the sea the primogeniture of jupiter gave him also a superiority over his brothers which entitled him to the name of the king of gods and father of men but this king this supreme father was too limited and impotent in all respects to suffer us to do the greeks the honor of attributing to them the belief of a supreme being  lxxi the gods of human life this system illconstructed as it was accounted for all the physical effects of nature but the moral world man his destiny and actions were without divinities the earth or the air had been illadapted deities the want of new gods therefore forged a new chain of errors which joined to the former encircled the regions of theological romance i suspect the latter system must take its rise very late man never thinking of entering into himself till he had exhausted external objects  lxxii the systems of liberty and necessity there are two hypotheses which always have been and ever will subsist in the one man is supposed to have received from his creator reason and will that he is left to himself to put them to use and regulate his actions accordingly in the other he is supposed incapable of acting otherwise than agreeable to the preestablished laws of the deity of whom he is only the instrument that his sentiment deceives him and when he imagines he follows his own inclination he in fact only pursues that of his master the latter notion might be suggested to the minds of a people little removed from a primitive state little instructed in the movements of so complicated a machine the ancients adopted the latter they saw with admiration the great virtues the atrocious crimes the useful inventions of a few singular men and thought they surpassed the powers of humanity hence they conceived on every side active deities inspiring virtue and vice into weak mortals incapable of resisting their impulsive influence i am not very well satisfied with this passage i give the best reasons i can find but it seems to me that in such early ages sentiment must have been their guide and sentiment speaks always in behalf of the system of liberty  it was not prudence that inspired pandarus with the design of breaking the truce and of aiming a dart at the breast of menelaus it was the goddess minerva excited him to that attempt homer iliad lib iv v    etc  the unhappy phedra was not criminal no it was venus who irritated by the slights of hippolitus lighted up an incestuous flame in the heart of that princess which plunged her into guilt infamy and death   eurip hippol act i v  0   thus a deity was supposed to undertake the charge of every event in life of every passion of the soul and every order of society  lxxiii the union of the two species of divinities these deities of the moral world however these passions and faculties so generalized and personated had only a metaphysical existence too occult for the generality of mankind it became necessary therefore to incorporate them with the physical deities in doing which allegory has imagined a thousand fantastical relations for the mind always requires at least the appearance of truth it was natural enough for the god of the sea to be also that of the sailors the figurative expression of the eye that sees every thing at one view of those rays which

love why must she take her rise out of the foam of the ocean but we must leave these enigmas to such as may be able to interpret them no sooner were these moral deities assigned their several departments than it is natural to conceive they engrossed the homage of mankind they had to do immediately with the heart and the passions whereas the physical divinities to whom no moral attributes had been given fell insensibly into contempt and oblivion thus it is only in the earliest ages of antiquity that i descry the smoke on the altars of saturn i mean among the greeks his worship was long

injustice we are startled at this conclusion an heathen however did not hesitate to admit and in fact could not doubt it his gods often suggested very vicious designs to suggest them it was necessary they should concur and even take pleasure in them they had not the resource of a small quantity of evil admissible into the best of possible worlds see fontenelle dans leloge de m de leibnitz  the evil they were accessory to was not only permitted but authorized besides these several divinities confined to their respective departments were quite indifferent as to the general good with which they had nothing to do every one acted agreeable to his own character and inspired only the passions he was supposed to feel the god of war was fierce bloodthirsty and brutal the goddess of wisdom prudent and reserved the queen of love an amiable voluptuous goddess all charm and caprice subtlety and low cunning distinguished the god of trade and the cries of the unhappy were supposed to please the ear of the inexorable tyrant over the dead the gloomy monarch of the infernal shades  lxxv these deities respecters of persons a god the father of mankind is equally so to every individual of the

respective people the most distinguished favor of their protectors but as the interests of nations are not less opposite than their manners it became necessary that these gods should adopt the quarrels of their worshippers what shall i patiently behold a city that has erected a hundred temples to my divinity fall before the sword of the conqueror no rather will i  it is thus that among the greeks a war kindled on earth soon lighted up the torch of discord in the skies the siege of troy put all heaven into confusion the scamander reflected the rays that darted from the aegis of minerva

irresistible decrees of fate reestablished peace mythol de l abbe bannier tom ii p      ovid metamorph lib xv  but most generally the several deities mutually agreed to abandon each others enemies

to such a kind of deities the multitude required sensible objects the image of something to decorate their temples and fix their ideas the choice to be sure must be fixed on the most amiable but which is that the human form will doubtless be preferred by men should a bull have answered the question he would probably have determined in favor of some other cic de not deor lib i c        sculpture now

lxxvii were liable to corporeal pains and pleasures beauty is perhaps only founded on use the human figure being beautiful only because it is so well adapted to the functions to which it is destined the figure of the divinity the same should be certainly expressive of its properties and even of its defects hence came that absurd generation of deities who composed only a celestial family similar to those among mankind hence their feasts of nectar and ambrosia and the nourishment they were supposed to receive from the sacrifices hence also their quiet slumbers homer iliad lib i v  0   and their  id iliad lib v ver      the gods thus become only a race of superior men used often to make visits on earth inhabit their temples take pleasure in the ammements of mankind join in the chase mix

whose views situation and character are different there arises an unity of action or rather of effect it is perhaps only into general causes we must look for the springs of those  lxxix a mixture of causes in particular events in more particular events the process of nature is very different from that of the philosophers in nature there are few effects so simple as to owe themselves to one sole cause whereas our philosophers are generally attached to one cause sole and universal let us avoid this precipice on the contrary if an action appears ever so little complicated let us admit of general causes not excluding either hazard or design sylla resigned the sovereignty of rome caesar lost it with his life nevertheless their encroachments on liberty were alike preceded by their conquests before they became the most powerful they became the most famous among the romans augustus trod nearly in the same steps a sanguinary tyrant after the taking of perusa he sacrificed three

 the elevation of augustus he reached the throne and soon made those republicans forget they had ever been free indeed the disposition of those people diminishes my surprise equally incapable of liberty under sylla as under augustus they were ignorant of this truth in the time of the former a civil war and two proscriptions more cruel and bloody than that war itself had taught them by the time of the latter that the republic sinking beneath the weight of its greatness and corruption could not subsist without a master besides sylla one of the first of the nobles fought at the head of those haughty patricians who though they put a sword into the hand of despotism to avenge themselves of their enemies would not leave it there with the power of converting it to the destruction of themselves they had conquered with him not for him the harangue of lepidus sallust fragm p  0  edit thysii  and the conduct of pompey frensheim supplem lib lxxxix c    a     make it sufficiently clear that sylla chose rather to descend from his invidious situation than be thrown headlong from it but augustus after the example of caesar tacit annal lib iv p  0   sueton ubi infra  employed only those enterprising adventurers agrippa mecenas and pollio whose fortunes attached to his had been nothing divided among an aristocracy of nobles but were when united sufficient to crush a new pretender  lxxx the causes of it those fortunate circumstances of the debauchery of anthony the weakness of lepidus and the credulity of cicero operated in concert with the general disposition in his favor but it must be confessed that though he did not give birth to these circumstances he employed them with great art and policy the vast variety of objects that present themselves will not permit to display the nature of that refined government to describe the yoke that was borne without being felt the prince undistinguished from the citizens or the senate respected by its master it is with impatience i expect the continuation of those dissertations on this subject which m de la bleterie has promised us the system of augustus so often misunderstood will be laid down with the utmost minuteness this author has a peculiar delicacy and an amiable freedom of sentiment he is argumentative without dryness and expresses himself with all the graces of a clear and elegant style perhaps however this descartes of history reasons a little too much a priori and founds his conclusions less upon authority of particular facts than on general induction but this is the fault only of men of great genius  we will select however one circumstance  augustus master of the revenues of the empire and the riches of the world constantly distinguished between his own particular patrimony and the treasure of the public by which means he displayed his moderation in having bequeathed to his heirs effects of less value than the fortunes of many of his subjects augustus bequeathed to tiberius and livia only millies quingenties thirty millions of livres the augur lentulus died in his reign worth quater millies fourscore millions sueton lib ii c  0   seneca de benefic lib ii  and his love to his country in having given up to the service of the state two entire patrimonies together with an immense sum arising from the legacies of his deceased friends  lxxxi the same action both cause and effect an ordinary degree of penetration is sufficient to discover when an action is at once both cause and effect in the moral world there are many such or rather there are but few which do not more or less partake of both the one and the other  the corruption of all orders of men among the romans was owing to the extent of their empire and was itself productive of the greatness of the republic montesq consid sur la grandeur des romans i distinguish the greatness of the roman empire from that of the republic the one consisted in the number of provinces the other in that of its citizens   but it requires an uncommon share of judgment when two things are constantly united and seem intimately connected to discern that they are neither effect nor cause to one another  lxxxii the sciences do not arise from luxury the sciences it is said take their rise from luxury an enlightened must be always a vicious people for my part i cannot be of this opinion the sciences are not the daughters of luxury but both the one and the other owe their birth to industry the arts in their rudest state satisfied the primitive wants of men in their state of perfection they suggest new ones even from

soften them like to those prayers in homer which constantly pursue injustice to appease the fury of that cruel deity   homer iliad lib ix v  00     thus have i thrown together a few reflections
