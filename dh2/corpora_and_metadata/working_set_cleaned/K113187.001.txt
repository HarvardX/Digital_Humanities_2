the history of english poetry from the close of the eleventh to the commencement of the eighteenth century to which are prefixed two dissertations i on the origin of romantic fiction in europe ii on the introduction of learning into england  volume the first  by thomas warton b d fellow of trinity college oxford and of the society of antiquaries  london printed for and sold by j dodsley pall mall j walter charing cross t becket strand j robson new bondstreet g robinson and j bew paternoster row and messrs fletcher at oxford m dcc lxxiv  to his grace george duke of marlborough marquis of blandford knight of the most noble order of the garter a judge and a patron of the polite arts this work is most humbly inscribed  by his graces most obliged and most obedient servant thomas warton  preface in an age advanced to the highest degree of refinement that species of curiosity commences which is busied in contemplating the progress of social life in displaying the gradations of science and in tracing the transitions from barbarism to civility  that these speculations should become the favorite pursuits and the fashionable topics of such a period is extremely natural we look back on the savage condition of our ancestors with the triumph of superiority we are pleased to mark the steps by which we have been raised from rudeness to elegance and our reflections on this subject are accompanied with a conscious pride arising in great measure from a tacit comparison of the infinite disproportion between the feeble efforts of remote ages and our present improvements in knowledge  in the mean time the manners monuments customs practices and opinions of antiquity by forming so strong a contrast with those of our own times and by exhibiting human nature and human inventions in new lights in in unexpected appearances and in various forms are objects which forcibly strike a feeling imagination  nor does this spectacle afford nothing more than a fruitless gratification to the fancy it teaches us to set a just estimation on our own acquisitions and encourages us to cherish that cultivation which is so closely connected with the existence and the exercise of every social virtue  on these principles to develop the dawnings of genius and to pursue the progress of our national poetry from a rude origin and obscure beginnings to its perfection in a polished age must prove an interesting and instructive investigation but a history of poetry for another reason yet on the same principles must be more especially productive of entertainment and utility i mean as it is an art whose object is human society as it has the peculiar merit in its operations on that object of faithfully recording the features of the times and of preserving the most picturesque and expressive representations of manners and because the first monuments of composition in every nation are those of the poet as it possesses the additional advantage of transmitting to posterity genuine delineations of life in its simplest stages let me add that anecdotes of the rudiments of a favorite art will always be particularly pleasing the more early specimens of poetry must ever amuse in proportion to the pleasure which we receive from its finished productions  much however depends on the execution of such a design and my readers are to decide in what degree i have done justice to so specious and promising a disquisition yet a few more words will not be perhaps improper in vindication or rather in explanation of the manner in which my work has been conducted i am sure i do not mean nor can i pretend to apologize for its defects  i have chose to exhibit the history of our poetry in a chronological series not distributing my matter into detached articles of periodical divisions or of general heads yet i have not always adhered so scrupulously to the regularity of annals but that i have often deviated into incidental digressions and have sometimes stopped in the course of my career for the sake of recapitulation for the purpose of collecting scattered notices into a single and uniform point of view for the more exact inspection of a topic which required a separate consideration or for a comparative survey of the poetry of other nations  a few years ago mr mason with that liberality which ever accompanies true genius gave me an authentic copy of mr popes scheme of a history of english poetry in which our poets were classed under their supposed respective schools the late lamented mr gray had also projected a work of this kind and translated some runic odes for its illustration now published but soon relinquishing the prosecution of a design which would have detained him from his own noble inventions he most obligingly condescended to favor me with the substance of his plan which i found to be that of mr pope considerably enlarged extended and improved  it is vanity in me to have mentioned these communications but i am apprehensive my vanity will justly be thought much greater when it shall appear that in giving the history of english poetry i have rejected the ideas of men who are its most distinguished ornaments to confess the real truth upon examination and experiment i soon discovered their mode of treating my subject plausible as it is and brilliant in theory to be attended with difficulties and inconveniences and productive of embarassment both to the reader and the writer like other ingenious systems it sacrificed much useful intelligence to the observance of arrangement and in the place of that satisfaction which results from a clearness and a fullness of information seemed only to substitute the merit of disposition and the praise of contrivance the constraint imposed by a mechanical attention to this distribution appeared to me to destroy that free exertion of research with which such a history ought to be executed and not easily reconcilable with that complication variety and extent of materials which it ought to comprehend  the method i have pursued on one account at least seems preferable to all others my performance in its present form exhibits without transposition the gradual improvements of our poetry at the same time that it uniformly represents the progression of our language  some perhaps will be of opinion that these annals ought to have commenced with a view of the saxon poetry but besides that a legitimate illustration of that jejune and intricate subject would have almost doubled my labor that the saxon language is familiar only to a few learned antiquaries that our saxon poems are for the most part little more than religious rhapsodies and that scarce any compositions remain marked with the native images of that people in their pagan state every reader that reflects but for a moment on our political establishment must perceive that the saxon poetry has no connection with the nature and purpose of my present undertaking before the norman accession which succeeded to the saxon government we were an unformed and an unsettled race that mighty revolution obliterated almost all relation to the former inhabitants of this island and produced that signal change in our policy constitution and public manners the effects of which have reached modern times the beginning of these annals seems therefore to be most properly dated from that era when our national character began to dawn  it was recommended to me by a person eminent in the republic of letters totally to exclude from these volumes any mention of the english drama i am very sensible that a just history of our stage is alone sufficient to form an entire and extensive work and this argument which is by no means precluded by the attempt here offered to the public still remains separately to be discussed at large and in form but as it was professedly my intention to comprise every species of english poetry this among the rest of course claimed a place in these annals and necessarily fell into my general design at the same time as in this situation it could only become a subordinate object it was impossible i should examine it with that critical precision and particularity which so large so curious and so important an article of our poetical literature demands and deserves to have considered it in its full extent would have produced the unwieldy excrescence of a disproportionate episode not to have considered it at all had been an omission which must detract from the integrity of my intended plan i flatter myself however that from evidences hitherto unexplored i have recovered hints which may facilitate the labors of those who shall hereafter be inclined to investigate the ancient state of dramatic exhibition in this country with due comprehension and accuracy  it will probably be remarked that the citations in the first volume are numerous and sometimes very prolix but it should be remembered that most of these are extracted from ancient manuscript poems never before printed and hitherto but little known nor was it easy to illustrate the darker and more distant periods of our poetry without producing ample specimens in the mean time i hope to merit the thanks of the antiquarian for enriching the stock of our early literature by these new accessions and i trust i shall gratify the reader of taste in having so frequently rescued from oblivion the rude inventions and irregular beauties of the heroic tale or the romantic legend  the design of the dissertations is to prepare the reader by considering apart in a connected and comprehensive detail some material points of a general and preliminary nature and which could not either with equal propriety or convenience be introduced at least not so formally discussed in the body of the book to establish certain fundamental principles to which frequent appeals might occasionally be made and to clear the way for various observations arising in the course of my future

europe dissertation i that peculiar and arbitrary species of fiction which we commonly call romantic was entirely unknown to the writers of greece and rome it appears to have been imported into europe by a people whose modes of thinking and habits of invention are not natural to that country it is generally supposed to have been borrowed from the arabians but this origin has not been hitherto perhaps examined or ascertained with a sufficient degree of accuracy it is my present design by a more distinct and extended inquiry than has yet been applied to the subject to trace the manner and the period of its introduction into the popular belief the oral poetry and the literature of the europeans  it is an established maxim of modern criticism that the fictions of arabian imagination were communicated to the western world by means of the crusades undoubtedly those expeditions greatly contributed to propagate this mode of fabling in europe but it is evident although a circumstance which certainly makes no material difference as to the principles here established that these fancies were introduced at a much earlier period the saracens or arabians having been for some time seated on the northern coasts of africa entered spain about the beginning of the eighth century see almakin edit pocock p     of this country they soon effected a complete conquest and imposing their religion language and customs upon the inhabitants erected a royal seat in the capital city of cordoua  that by means of this establishment they first revived the sciences of greece in europe will be proved at large in another place see the second dissertation  and it is obvious to conclude that at the same time they disseminated those extravagant inventions which were so peculiar to their romantic and creative genius a manuscript cited by du cange acquaints us that the spaniards soon after the irruption of the saracens entirely neglected the study of the latin language and captivated with the novelty of the oriental books imported by these strangers suddenly adopted an unusual pomp of style and an affected elevation of diction arabico eloquio sublimati etc du cang gloss med inf latinitat tom i praef p xxvii     the ideal tales of these eastern invaders recommended by a brilliancy of description a variety of imagery and an exuberance of invention hitherto unknown and unfamiliar to the cold and barren conceptions of a western climate were eagerly caught up and universally diffused from spain by the communications of a constant commercial intercourse through the ports of toulon and marseilles they soon passed into france and italy  in france no province or district seems to have given these fictions of the arabians a more welcome or a more early reception than the inhabitants of armorica or basse bretagne now britany for no part of france can boast so great a number of ancient romances the reason on which this conclusion is founded will appear hereafter  many poems of high antiquity composed by the armorican bards still remain in the british museum is a set of old french tales of chivalry in verse written as it seems by the bards of bretagne mss harl      0   tristram a wales is mentioned f     b  tristram ki bien saveit harpeir in the adventure of the knight eliduc f     b en bretaigne un chevalier pruz e curteis hardi e fire again under the same champion f      il

launval under guigemar f      la chamber est peint tut entur venus de devesse damur futres bien en la paintur le traiz mustres e la nature coment hume deit amur tenir e lealment e bien servir le livre ovide ou il enseine etc this description of a chamber painted with venus and the three mysteries of nature and the allusion to ovid prove the tales before us to be of no very high antiquity but they are undoubtedly taken from others much older of the same country at the end of eliducs tale we have these lines f      del aventure de ces trais li auntien britun curteis firent le lai pour remember qhum nel deust pas oublier and under the tale of fresne f     li britun enfirent un lai at the conclusion of most of the tales it is said that these lais were made by the poets of bretaigne another of the tales is thus closed f      que cest kunte ke oi avez fu guigemar le lai trouvez q hum fait en harp en rote bone est a oir la note   and are frequently cited by father lobineau in his learned history of basse bretagne histoire de bretagne ii tom fol  this territory was as it were newly peopled in the fourth century by a colony or army of the welsh who migrated thither under the conduct of maximus a roman general in britain maximus appears to have set up a separate interest in britain and to have engaged an army of the provincial britons on his side against the romans not succeeding in his designs he was obliged to retire with his british troops to the continent as in the text he had a considerable interest in wales having married ellena daughter of eudda a powerful chieftain of

the welsh and so strong a resemblance still subsists between the two languages that in our late conquest of belleisle such of our soldiers as were natives of wales were understood by the peasantry milton whose imagination was much struck with the old british story more than once alludes to the welsh colony planted in armorica by maximus and the prince of meiriadoc et tandem armoricos britonum sub lege colonos mansus  and in the paradise lost he mentions indiscriminately the knights of wales and armorica as the customary retinue of king arthur   what resounds in fable or romance of uthers son begirt with british and armoric knights parad l i     compare pelloutier mem sur la langue celt fol tom i     this migration of the welsh into britany or armorica which during the distractions of the empire in consequence of the numerous armies of barbarians with which rome was surrounded on every side had thrown off its dependence on the romans seems to have occasioned a close connection between the two countries for many centuries this secession of the welsh at so critical a period was extremely natural into a neighboring maritime country with which they had constantly trafficked and which like themselves had disclaimed the roman yoke it is not related in any greek or roman historian but their silence is by no means a sufficient warrant for us to reject the numerous testimonies of the old british writers concerning this event it is mentioned in particular by llywarchen a famous bard who lived only one hundred and fifty years afterward many of his poems are still extant in which he celebrates his twentyfour sons who wore gold chains and were all killed in battles against the saxons  nor will it prove less necessary to our purpose to observe that the cornish britons whose language was another dialect of the ancient british from the fourth or fifth century downwards maintained a no less intimate correspondence with the natives of armorica intermarrying with them and perpetually resorting thither for the education of their children for advice for procuring troops against the saxons for the purposes of traffic and various other occasions this connection was so strongly kept up that an ingenious french antiquary supposes that the communications of the armoricans with the cornish had chiefly contributed to give a roughness or rather hardness to the romance or french language in some of the provinces toward the eleventh century which was not before discernible m labbe lebeuf recherches etc mem de litt tom xvii p     edit  to je pense que cela dura jusqua ce que le commerce de ces provinces avec les peuples du nord et de lallemagne et sur tout celui des habitans de larmorique avec langlois verse lonzieme siecle etc  and this intercourse will appear more natural if we consider that not only armorica a maritime province of gaul never much frequented by the romans and now totally deserted by them was still in some measure a celtic nation but that also the inhabitants of cornwall together with those of devonshire and of the adjoining parts of somersetshire intermixing in a very slight degree with the romans and having suffered fewer important alterations in their original constitution and customs from the imperial laws and police than any other province of this island long preserved their genuine manners and british character and forming a sort of separate principality under the government of a succession of powerful chieftains usually denominated princes or dukes of cornwall remained partly in a state of independence during the saxon heptarchy and were not entirely reduced till the norman conquest cornwall in particular retained its old celtic dialect till the reign of elizabeth see camd brit i    edit      lhuyds arch p       and here i digress a moment to remark that in the circumstance just mentioned about wales of its connection with armorica we perceive the solution of a difficulty which at first sight appears extremely problematical i mean not only that wales should have been so constantly made the theater of the old british chivalry but that so many of the favorite fictions which occur in the early french romances should also be literally found in the tales and chronicles of the elder welsh bards the story of le court mantel or the boy and the mantle told by an old french troubadour cited by m de saint palaye is recorded in many manuscript welsh chronicles as i learn from original letters of lhuyd in the ashmolean museum see mem anc chev i     and obs spenser i ii p       and from the same authority i am informed that the fiction of the giants coat composed of the beards of the kings whom he had conquered is related in the legends of the bards of both countries see obs spens ut supr p    seq but instances are innumerable  it was owing to the perpetual communication kept up between the welsh and the people of armorica who abounded in these fictions and who naturally took occasion to interweave them into the history of their friends and allies nor are we now at a loss to give the reason why cornwall in the same french romances is made the scene and the subject of so many romantic adventures hence in the armorican tales just quoted mention is made of totness and exeter anciently included in cornwall in chaucers romaunt of the rose we have hornpipis of cornewaile among a great variety of musical instruments v    0 this is literally from the french original v       in the meantime we may observe what indeed has been already implied that a strict intercourse was upheld between cornwall and wales their languages customs and alliances as i have hinted were the same and they were separated only by a strait of inconsiderable breadth cornwall is frequently styled westwales by the british writers at the invasion of the saxons both countries became indiscriminately the receptacle of the fugitive britons we find the welsh and cornish as one people often uniting themselves as in a national cause against the saxons they were frequently subject to the same prince who was sometimes chosen from wales and cornwall and sometimes from armorica borlase ubi supr p  0  see also p

some noble achievement at least by the name of that celebrated champion but to return  about the year   00 gualter archdeacon of oxford a learned man and a diligent collector of histories traveling through france procured in armorica an ancient chronicle written in the british or armorican language entitled brutybrenhined or the history of the kings of britain in the curious library of the family of davies at llanerk in denbighshire there is a copy of this chronicle in the handwriting of guttyn owen a celebrated welsh bard and antiquarian about the year    0 who ascribes it to tyssilio a bishop and the son of brockmaelyscythroc prince of powis tyssilio indeed wrote a history of britain but that work as we are assured by lhuyd in the archaeologia was entirely ecclesiastical and has been long since lost  this book he brought into england and communicated it to geoffrey of monmouth a welsh benedictine monk an elegant writer of latin and admirably skilled in the british tongue geoffrey at the request and recommendation of gualter the archdeacon translated this british chronicle into latin see galfr mon l i c   xii    0 ix   bale ii    thompsons pref to geoffreys hist transl edit land      p xxx xvi  executing the translation with a tolerable degree of purity and great fidelity yet not without some interpolations geoffrey confesses that he took some part of his account of king arthurs achievements from the mouth of his friend gualter the archdeacon who probably related to the translator some of the traditions on this subject which he had heard in armorica or which at that time might have been popular in wales hist brit galfr mon lib xi c i he also owns that merlins prophecies were not in the armorican original ib vii   compare thompsons pref ut supr p xxv xxvii the speeches and letters were forged by geoffrey and in the description of battles our translator has not scrupled frequent variations and additions  i am obliged to an ingenious antiquarian in british literature mr morris of penbryn for the following curious remarks concerning geoffreys original and his translation geoffreys sylvius in the british original is silius which in latin would

cynfarch should have been translated leo which is now rendered loath this has brought much confusion into the old scotch history i find no belinus in the british copy the name is beli which should have been in latin belius or belgius geoffreys brennus in the original is bran a common name among the britons as bran ap dyfnwal etc see suidas  it appears by the original that the british name of carausius was carawn hence tregaraun i e tregaron and the river caraun which gives name to abercorn in the british there is no division into books and chapters a mark of antiquity those whom the translator calls consuls of rome when brennus took it are in the original twysogion i e princes or generals the gwalenses gwalo or gwalas are added by geoffrey b xii c    to what is here observed about silius i will add that abbot whethamsted in his ms granarium mentions siloius the father of brutus quomodo brutus siloii filius ad litora angliae venit etc granar part i lit a mss cotton nero c vi brit mus this gentleman has in his possession a very ancient manuscript of the original and has been many years preparing materials for giving an accurate and faithful translation of it into english the manuscript in jesus college library at oxford which win pretends to be the same which geoffrey himself made use of is evidently not older than the sixteenth century mr price the bodleian librarian to whose friendship this work is much indebted has two copies lately given him by mr banks much more ancient and perfect but there is reason to suspect that most of the british manuscripts of this history are translations from geoffreys latin for britannia they have bryttaen which in the original would have been prydain geoffreys translation and for obvious reasons is a very common manuscript compare lhuyds arch p        it was probably finished after the year      thompson says      ubi supr p xxx geoffreys age is ascertained beyond a doubt even if other proofs were wanting from the cotemporaries whom he mentions such as robert earl of gloucester natural son of henry the first and alexander bishop of lincoln his patrons he mentions also william of malmesbury and henry of huntingdon wharton places geoffreys death in the year      episc assav p  0  robert de monte who continued sigeberts chronicle down to the year      in the preface to that work expressly says that he took some of the materials of his supplement from the historia britonum lately translated out of british into latin this was manifestly geoffreys book alfred of beverly who evidently wrote his annals published by hearne between the years      and    0 borrowed his account of the british kings from geoffreys historia whose words he sometimes literally transcribes for instance alfred in speaking of arthurs keeping whitsuntide at caerleon says that the historia britonum enumerated all the kings who came thither on arthurs invitation and then adds praeter hos non remansit princeps alicujus pretii citra hispaniam qui ad istud edictum non venerit alured bev annal p    edit hearne these are geoffreys own words and so much his own that they are one of his additions to the british original but the curious reader who desires a complete and critical discussion of this point may consult an original letter of bishop lloyd preserved among tanners manuscripts at oxford number      it is difficult to ascertain exactly the period at which our translators original romance may probably be supposed to have been compiled yet this is a curious speculation and will illustrate our argument i am inclined to think that the work consists of fables thrown out by different rhapsodists at different times which afterward were collected and digested into an entire history and perhaps with new decorations of fancy added by the compiler who most probably was one of the professed bards or rather a poetical historian of armorica or basse bretagne in this state and under this form i suppose it to have fallen into the hands of geoffrey of monmouth if the hypothesis hereafter advanced concerning the particular species of fiction on which this narrative is founded should be granted it cannot from what i have already proved be more ancient than the eighth century and we may reasonably conclude that it was composed much later as some considerable length of time must have been necessary for the propagation and establishment of that species of fiction the simple subject of this chronicle divested of its romantic embellishments is a deduction of the welsh princes from the trojan brutus to cadwallader who reigned in the seventh century this notion of their extraction from the trojans had so infatuated the welsh that even so late as the year      archbishop peckham in his injunctions to the diocese of st asaph orders the people to abstain from giving credit to idle dreams and visions a superstition which they had contracted from their belief in thedream of their founder brutus in the temple of diana concerning his arrival in britain the archbishop very seriously advises them to boast no more of their relation to the conquered and fugitive trojans but to glory in the victorious cross of christ council wilkins tom ii p  0  edit      fol  it must be acknowledged that many european nations were anciently fond of tracing their descent from troy hunnibaldus francus in his latin history of france written in the sixth century beginning with the trojan war and ending with clovis the first ascribes the origin of the french nation to francio a son of priam it is among the scriptores rer german sim schard tom i p  0  edit basil      fol it consists of eighteen books  so universal was this humor and carried to such an absurd excess of extravagance that under the reign of justinian even the greeks were ambitious of being thought to be descended from the trojans their ancient and notorious enemies unless we adopt the idea of those antiquaries who contend that europe was peopled from phrygia it will be hard to discover at what period or from what source so strange and improbable a notion could take its rise especially among nations unacquainted with history and overwhelmed in ignorance the most rational mode of accounting for it is to suppose that the revival of virgils eneid about the sixth or seventh century which represented the trojans as the founders of rome the capital of the supreme pontiff and a city on various other accounts in the early ages of christianity highly reverenced and distinguished occasioned an emulation in many other european nations of claiming an alliance to the same respectable original the monks and other ecclesiastics the only readers and writers of the age were likely to broach and were interested in propagating such an opinion as the more barbarous countries of europe began to be tinctured with literature there was hardly one of them but fell into the fashion of deducing its original from some of the nations most celebrated in the ancient books those who did not aspire so high as king priam or who found that claim preoccupied boasted to be descended from some of the generals of alexander the great from prusias king of bithynia from the greeks or the egyptians it it not in the mean time quite improbable that as most of the european nations were provincial to the romans those who fancied themselves to be of trojan extraction might have imbibed this notion at least have acquired a general knowledge of the trojan story from their conquerors more especially the britons who continued so long under the yoke of rome see infr sect iii p          but as to the story of brutus in particular geoffreys hero it may be presumed that his legend was not contrived nor the history of his successors invented till after the ninth century for nennius who lived about the middle of that century not only speaks of brutus with great obscurity and inconsistency but seems totally uninformed as to every circumstance of the british affairs which preceded cesars invasion there are other proofs that this piece could not have existed before the ninth century alfreds saxon translation of the mercian law is mentioned l iii c     charlemagnes twelve peers and by an anachronism not uncommon in romance are said to be present at king arthurs magnificent coronation in the city of caerleon l ix c     it were easy to produce

circulation in the world at the same time it contains many passages which incline us to determine that some parts of it at least were written after or about the eleventh century i will not insist on that passage in which the title of legate of the apostolic see is attributed to dubricius in the character of primate of britain as it appears for obvious reasons to have been an artful interpolation of the translator who was an ecclesiastic but i will select other arguments canutes forest or cannockwood in staffordshire occurs and canute died in the year  0   l vii c    at the ideal coronation of king arthur just mentioned a tournament is described as exhibited in its highest splendour many knights says our armoric fabler famous for feats of chivalry were present with apparel and arms of the same color and fashion they formed a species of diversion in imitation of a fight on horseback and the ladies being placed on the walls of the castles darted amorous glances on the combatants none of these ladies esteemed any knight worthy of her love but such as had given proof of his gallantry in three several encounters thus the valor of the men encouraged chastity in the women and the attention of the women proved an incentive to the soldiers bravery l ix c     here is the practice of chivalry under the combined ideas of love and military prowess as they seem to have subsisted after the feudal constitution had acquired greater degrees not only of stability but of splendour and refinement pitts mentions an anonymous writer under the name of eremita britannus who studied

reconciliation of the sons of lewis the feeble in the close of the ninth century and at the beginning of the tenth the coronation of the emperor henry was solemnized with martial entertainments in which many parties were introduced fighting on horseback yet it was long afterward that these games were accompanied with the peculiar formalities and ceremonious usages here described see infr sect

cannot answer for the innovations of a translator in such a description the burial of hengist the saxon chief who is said to have been interred not after the pagan fashion as geoffrey renders the words of the original but after the manner of the soldans is partly an argument that our romance was composed about the time of the crusades it was not till those memorable campaigns of mistaken devotion had infatuated the western world that the soldans or sultans of babylon of egypt of iconium and other eastern kingdoms became familiar in europe not that the notion of this piece being written so late as the crusades in the least invalidates the doctrine delivered in this discourse not even if we suppose that geoffrey of monmouth was its original composer that notion rather tends to confirm and establish my system on the whole we may venture to affirm that this chronicle supposed to contain the ideas of the welsh bards entirely consists of arabian inventions and in this view no difference is made whether it was compiled about the tenth century at which time if not before the arabians from their settlement in spain must have communicated their romantic fables to other parts of europe especially to the french or whether it first appeared in the eleventh century after the crusades had multiplied these fables to an excessive degree and made them universally popular and although the general cast of the inventions contained in this romance is alone sufficient to point out the source from whence they were derived yet i choose to prove to a demonstration what is here advanced by producing and examining some particular passages  the books of the arabians and persians abound with extravagant traditions about the giants gog and magog these they call jagiouge and magiouge and the caucasian wall said to be built by alexander the great from the caspian to the black sea in order to cover the frontiers of his dominion and to prevent the incursions of the sythians

a guard of fifty men to view it after a dangerous journey of near two months salam and his party arrived in a desolated country where they beheld the ruins of many cities destroyed by the people of jajiouge and majiouge in six days more they reached the castles near the mountain kokaiya or caucasus this mountain is inaccessibly steep perpetually covered with snows and thick clouds and

his victories that he ever came near the caspian gates the first and fabulous history of the eastern nations will perhaps be found to begin with the exploits of this grecian hero  one of the most formidable giants according to our armorican romance which opposed the landing of brutus in britain was goemagot he was twelve cubits high and would unroot an oak as easily as an hazel wand but after a most obstinate encounter with corineus he was tumbled into the sea from the summit of a steep cliff on the rocky shores of cornwall and dashed in pieces against the huge crags of the declivity the place where he fell adds our historian taking its name from the giants fall is called lamgoemagot or goemagots leap to this day lib i c     a no less monstrous giant whom king arthur slew on saint michaels mount in cornwall is said by this fabler to have come from spain here the origin of these stories is evidently betrayed l x c    the arabians or saracens as i have hinted above had conquered spain and were settled there arthur having killed this redoubted giant declares that he had combated with none of equal strength and prowess since he overcame the mighty giant ritho on the mountain

fictions about stonehenge were derived from the same inexhaustible source of extravagant imagination we are told in this romance that the giants conveyed the stones which compose this miraculous monument from the farthest coasts of africa every one of these stones is supposed to be mystical and to contain a medicinal virtue an idea drawn from the medical skill of the arabians see infr sect i p  0 and sect xiii p     infr  and more particularly from the arabian doctrine of attributing healing qualities and other occult properties to stones this chronicle was evidently compiled to do honor to the britons and their affairs and especially in opposition to the saxons now the importance with which these romancers seem to speak of stonehenge and the many beautiful fictions with which they have been so studious to embellish its origin and to aggrandise its history appear to me strongly to favor the hypothesis that stonehenge is a british monument and indeed to prove that it was really erected in memory of the three hundred british nobles massacred by the saxon hengist see sect ii infr p    no druidical monument of which so many remains were common engaged their attention or

scaly tail and wafts his rider to the clouds with great rapidity l vii c     arthur and charlemagne are the first and original heroes of romance and as geoffreys history is the grand repository of the acts of arthur so a fabulous history ascribed to turpin is the ground work of all the chimerical legends which have been related concerning the conquests of charlemagne and his twelve peers its subject is the expulsion of the saracens from spain and it is filled with fictions evidently cogenial with those which characterise geoffreys history i will mention only one among many others the christians under charlemagne are said to have found in spain a golden idol or image of mahomet as high as a bird can fly it was framed by mahomet himself of the purest metal who by his knowledge in necromancy had sealed up within it a legion of diabolical spirits it held in its hand a prodigious club and the saracens had a prophetic tradition that this club should fall from the hand of the image in that year when a certain king should be born in france etc j turpini hist de vit carol magn et rolandi cap iv f   a   some suppose as i have hinted above this romance to have been written by turpin a monk of the eighth century who for his knowledge of the latin language his sanctity and gallant exploits against the spanish saracens was preferred to the archbishopric of rheims by charlemagne others believe it to have been forged under archbishop turpins name about that time others very soon afterward in the reign of charles the bald see hist acad des inscript etc vii     edit  to  that is

hist genesis chapter viii oeuvr tom i p    edit genev       and it might easily be shown that just before the commencement of the thirteenth century romantic stories about charlemagne were more fashionable than ever among the french minstrels that is on the recent publication of this fabulous history of charlemagne historical evidence concurs with numerous internal arguments to prove that it must have been compiled after the crusades in the twentieth chapter a pretended pilgrimage of charlemagne to the holy sepulcher at jerusalem is recorded a forgery seemingly contrived with a design to give an importance to those wild expeditions and which would easily be believed when thus authenticated by an archbishop see infr sect iii p       there is another strong internal proof that this romance was written long after the time of charlemagne our historian is speaking of the numerous chiefs and kings who came with their armies to assist his hero among the rest he mentions earl oell and

twelfth century see infr sect iii p      and that the miraculous exploits performed in spain by charlemagne and earl roland recorded in this romantic history were unknown among the french before that

europe at once accounts for the nature and extravagance of its fictions and immediately points to their arabian origin innumerable romantic stories of arabian growth are to this day current among the common people of spain which they call cujentos de viejas i will relate one from that lively picture of the spaniards relation du voyage despagne by mademoiselle danois within the ancient castle of toledo they say there was a vast cavern whose entrance was strongly barricadoed it was universally believed that if any person entered this cavern the most fatal disasters would happen to the spaniards thus it remained closely shut and unentered for many ages at length king roderigo having less credulity but more courage and curiosity than his ancestors commanded this formidable recess to be opened at entering he began to suspect the traditions of the people to be true a terrible tempest arose and all the elements seemed united to embarrass him nevertheless he ventured forwards into the cave where he discerned by the light of his torches certain figures on statues of men whose habiliments and arms were strange and uncouth one of them had a sword of shining brass on which it was

declaration that there was a great impropriety in translating latin prose into verse we may conclude that at the commencement of the thirteenth century the french generally made their translations into verse  in these two fabulous chronicles the foundations of romance seem to be laid the principal characters the leading subjects and the fundamental fictions which have supplied such ample matter to this singular species of composition are here first displayed and although the long continuance of the crusades imported innumerable inventions of a similar complexion and substituted the achievements of new champions and the wonders of other countries yet the tales of arthur and of charlemagne diversified indeed or enlarged with additional embellishments still continued to prevail and to be the favorite topics and this partly from their early popularity partly from the quantity and the beauty of the fictions with which they were at first supported and especially because the design of the crusades had made those subjects so fashionable in which christians fought with infidels in a word these volumes are the first specimens extant in this mode of writing no european history before these has mentioned giants enchanters dragons and the like monstrous and arbitrary fictions and the reason is obvious they were written at a time when a new and unnatural mode of thinking took place in europe introduced by our communication with the east  hitherto i have considered the saracens either at their immigration into spain about the ninth century or at the time of the crusades as the first authors of romantic fabling among the europeans but a late ingenious critic has advanced an hypothesis which assigns a new source and a much earlier date to these fictions i will cite his opinion of this matter in his own words our old romances of chivalry may be derived in a lineal descent from the ancient historical songs of the gothic bards and scalds  many of those songs are still preserved in the north which exhibit all the seeds of chivalry before it became a solemn institution  even the common arbitrary fictions of romance were most of them familiar to the ancient scalds of the north long before the time of the crusades they believed the existence of giants and dwarfs they had some notion of fairies they were strongly possessed with the belief of spells and enchantment and were fond of inventing combats with dragons and monsters percy on ancient metr romans i p     edit       monsieur mallet a very able and elegant inquirer into the genius and antiquities of the northern nations mantains the same doctrine he seems to think that many of the opinions and practices of the goths however obsolete still obscurely subsist he adds may we not rank among these for example that love and admiration for the profession of arms which prevailed among our ancestors even to fanaticism and as it were through system and brave from a point of honor  can we not explain from the gothic religion how judiciary combats and proofs by the ordeal to the astonishment of posterity were admitted by the legislature of all europe for the judiciary combats as also for common athletic exercises they formed an amphitheatrical circus of rude stones quaedam saxa circos claudebant in quibus gigantes et pugiles duello strenue decertabant worm p    and again nec mora circuatur campus milite circus stipatur concurrunt pugiles p    it is remarkable that circs of the same sort are still to be seen in cornwall so famous at this day for the athletic art in which also they sometimes exhibited their scriptural interludes see infr sect vi p     frotho the great king of denmark in the first century is said to have been the first who commanded all controversies to be decided by the sword worm p    in favor of this barbarous institution it ought to be remembered that the practice of thus marking out the place of battle must have prevented much bloodshed and saved many innocent lives for if either combatant was by any accident forced out of the circus he was to lose his cause or to pay three marks of pure silver as a redemption for his life worm p       in the year     the ordeal was substituted in denmark instead of the duel a mode of decision at least in a political sense less absurd as it promoted military skill  and how even to the present age the people are still infatuated with a belief of the power of magicians witches spirits and genii concealed under the earth or in the waters  do we not discover in these religious opinions that source of the mavelous with which our ancestors filled their romances in which we see dwarfs and giants fairies and demons etc mallet introduction a l histoire de dannemarc etc tom ii p    and in another place the fortresses of the goths were only rude castles situated on the summits of rocks and rendered inaccessible by thick misshapen walls as these walls ran winding round the castles they often called them by a name which signified serpents or dragons and in these they usually secured the women and young virgins of distinction who were seldom safe at a time when so many enterprising heroes were rambling up and down in search of adventures it was this custom which gave occasion to ancient romancers who knew not how to describe any thing simply to invent so many fables concerning princesses of great beauty guarded by dragons and afterward delivered by invincible champions ib chapter ix p     tom ii   i do not mean entirely to reject this hypothesis but i will endeavor to show how far i

thesaur dissertat epistol p      various other instances might here be added some of which will occasionally arise in the future course of our inquiries  it is notorious that many traces of oriental usages are found amongst all the european nations during their pagan state and this phenomenon is rationally resolved on the supposition that all europe was originally peopled from the east but as the resemblance which the pagan scandinavians bore to the eastern nations in manners monuments opinions and practices is so very perceptible and apparent an inference arises that their migration from the east must have happened at a period by many ages more recent and therefore most probably about the time specified by their historians in the mean time we must remember that a distinction is to be made between this expedition of odins goths who formed a settlement in scandinavia and those innumerable armies of barbarous adventurers who some centuries afterward distinguished by the same name at different periods overwhelmed europe and at length extinguished the roman empire  when we consider the rapid conquests of the nations which may be comprehended under the common name of scythians and not only those conducted by odin but by attila theodoric and genseric we cannot ascribe such successes to brutal courage only to say that some of these irresistible conquerors made war on a luxurious effeminate and enervated people is a plausible and easy mode of accounting for their conquests but this reason will not operate with equal force in the histories of genghizcan and tamerlane who destroyed mighty empires founded on arms and military discipline and who baffled the efforts of the ablest leaders their science and genius in war such as it then was cannot therefore be doubted that they were not deficient in the arts of peace i have already hinted and now proceed to produce more particular proofs innumerable and very fundamental errors have crept into our reasonings and systems about savage life resulting merely from those strong and undistinguishing notions of barbarism which our prejudices have hastily formed concerning the character of all rude nations see this argument pursued in the following dissertation   among other arts which odins goths planted in scandinavia their skill in poetry to which they were addicted in a peculiar manner and which they cultivated with a wonderful enthusiasm seems to be most worthy our regard and especially in our present inquiry  as the principal heroes of their expedition into the north were honorably distinguished from the europeans or original scandinavians under the name of asae or asiatics so the verses or language of this people were denominated asamal or asiatic speech linguam danicam antiquam cujus in rythmis usus fuit veteres appellarunt asamal id est asiaticam vel asarum sermonem quod eum ex asia odinus secum in daniam norwegiam sueciam aliasque regiones septentrionales invexerit steph stephan praefat ad saxon grammat hist  their poetry contained not only the praises of their heroes but their popular traditions and their religious rites and was filled with those fictions which the most exaggerated pagan superstition would naturally implant in the wild imaginations of an asiatic people and from this principle alone i mean of their asiatic origin some critics would at once account for a certain capricious spirit of extravagance and those bold eccentric conceptions which so strongly distinguish the old northern poetry a most ingenious critic observes that what we have been long accustomed to call the oriental vein of poetry because some of the earliest poetical productions have come to us from the east is probably no more oriental than occidental blairs crit diss on ossian vol ii p     but all the later oriental writers through all ages have been particularly distinguished for this vein hence it is here characteristical of a country not of an age i will allow on this writers very just and penetrating principles that an early northern ode shall be as sublime as an eastern one yet the sublimity of the latter shall have a different character it will be more inflated and gigantic  nor is this fantastic imagery the only mark of asiaticism which appears in the runic odes they have a certain sublime and figurative cast of diction which is indeed one of their predominant characteristics thus a rainbow is called the bridge of the gods poetry the mead of odin the earth the vessel that floats on ages a ship the horse of the waves ice the vast bridge herbs the fleece of the earth a battle a bath of blood the hail of odin the shock of bucklers a tongue the sword of words night the veil of cares rocks the bones of the earth arrows the hailstnes of elmets etc etc  i am very sensible that all rude nations are naturally apt to cloth their sentiments in this style a propensity to this mode of expression is necessarily occasioned by the poverty of their language which obliges them frequently to substitute similitudes and circumlocutions it arises in great measure from feelings undisguised and unrestrained by custom or art and from the genuine efforts of nature working more at large in uncultivated minds in the infancy of society the passions and the imagination are alike uncontrouled but another cause seems to have concurred in producing the effect here mentioned when obvious terms and phrases evidently occurred the runic poets are fond of departing from the common and established diction they appear to use circumlocution and comparisons not as a matter of necessity but of choice and skill nor are these metaphorical colorings so much the result of want of words as of warmth of fancy in a strict geographical sense the original country of these asiatic goths might not be so situated as physically to have produced these effects yet it is to be observed that intercourse and vicinity are in this case sometimes equivalent to climate the persian traditions and superstitions were current even in the northern parts of tartary georgia however may be fairly considered as a part of persia it is equal in fertility to any of the eastern turkish provinces in asia it affords the richest wines and other luxuries of life in the greatest abundance the most beautiful virgins for the seraglio are fetched from this province in the mean time thus much at least may be said of a warm climate exclusive of its supposed immediate physical influence on the human mind and temperament it exhibits all the productions of nature in their highest perfection and beauty while the excessive heat of the sun and the fewer incitements to labor and industry dispose the inhabitants to indolence and to living much abroad in scenes of nature these circumstances are favorable to the operations of fancy   their warmth of fancy however if supposed to have proceeded from the principles above suggested in a few generations after this migration into scandinavia must have lost much of its natural heat and genuine force yet ideas and sentiments especially of this sort once imbibed are long remembered and retained in savage life their religion among other causes might have contributed to keep this spirit alive and to preserve their original stock of images and native mode of expression unchanged and unabated by climate or country in the mean time we may suppose that the new situation of these people in scandinavia might have added a darker shade and a more savage complexion to their former fictions and superstitions and that the formidable objects of nature to which they became familiarised in those northern solitudes the piny precipices the frozen mountains and the gloomy forests acted on their imaginations and gave a tincture of horror to their imagery  a skill in poetry seems in some measure to have been a national science among the scandinavians and to have been familiar to almost every order and degree their kings and warriors partook of this epidemic enthusiasm and on frequent occasions are represented as breaking forth into spontaneous songs and verses harold hardraade king of norway composed sixteen songs of his expedition into africa asbiorn pruda a danish champion described his past life in nine strophes while his enemy bruce a giant was tearing out his bowels i tell my mother suanhita in denmark that she

the most common occurrences  but the exercise of the poetical talent was properly confined to a stated profession and with their poetry the goths imported into europe a species of poets or singers

verses attended the festivals of heroic chiefs accompanied them in battle and celebrated their victories the sogdians were a people who lived eastward of the caspian sea not far from the country of odins goths quintus curtius relates that when some of that people were condemned to death by alexander on account of a revolt they rejoiced greatly and testified their joy by singing verses and dancing when the king enquired the reason of their joy they answered that being soon to be restored to their ancestors by so great a conqueror they could not help celebrating so honorable a death which was the wish of all brave men in their own accustomed songs lib vii c   i am obliged to doctor percy for pointing out this passage from the correspondence of manners and principles it holds forth between the scandinavians and the sogdians it contains a striking proof of odins migration from the east to the north first in the spontaneous exercise of the poetical talent and secondly in the opinion that a glorious or warlike death which admitted them to the company of their friends and parents in another world was to be embraced with the most eager alacrity and the highest sensations of pleasure this is the doctrine of the edda in the same spirit ridens moriar is the triumphant close of regner lodbrogs dying ode see keysler ubi infr p     i cannot help adding here another stroke from

neighboring continent compare keysler antiquitat sell septentrional p     seq   these scandinavian bards appear to have been esteemed and entertained in other countries besides their own and by that means to have probably communicated their fictions to various parts of europe i will give my reasons for this supposition  in the early ages of europe before many regular governments took place revolutions emigrations and invasions were frequent and almost universal nations were alternately destroyed or formed and the want of political security exposed the inhabitants of every country to a state of eternal fluctuation that britain was originally peopled from gaul a nation of the celts is allowed but that many colonies from the northern parts of europe were afterward successively planted in britain and the neighboring islands is an hypothesis equally rational and not altogether destitute of historical evidence nor was any nation more likely than the scandinavian goths i mean in their early periods to make descents on britain they possessed the spirit of adventure in an eminent degree they were habituated to dangerous enterprises they were acquainted with distant coasts exercised in navigation and fond of making expeditions in hopes of conquest and in search of new acquisitions as to scotland and ireland there is the highest probability that the scutes who conquered both those countries and possessed them under the names of albin scutes and irin scutes were a people of norway the caledonians are expressly called by many judicious antiquaries a scandinavian colony the names of places and persons over all that part of scotland which the picts inhabited are of scandinavian extraction a simple catalogue of them only would immediately convince us that they are not of celtic or british origin flaherty reports it as a received opinion and a general doctrine that the picts migrated into britain and ireland from scandinavia it is conjectured by wormius that ireland is

pedantic parade of authorities on this occasion nor can it be expected that i should enter into a formal and exact examination of this obscure and complicated subject in its full extent which is here only introduced incidentally i will only add that scotland and ireland as being situated more to the north and probably less difficult of access than britain might have been objects on which our northern adventurers were invited to try some of their earliest excursions and that the orkneyislands remained long under the jurisdiction of the norwegian potentates  in these expeditions the northern emigrants as we shall prove more particularly below were undoubtedly attended by their scalds or poets yet even in times of peace and without the supposition of conquest or invasion the scandinavian scalds might have been well known in the british islands possessed of a specious and pleasing talent they frequented the courts of the british scottish and irish chieftains they were itinerants by their institution and made voyages out of curiosity or in quest of rewards to those islands or coasts which lay within the circle of their maritime knowledge by these means they established an interest rendered their profession popular propagated their art and circulated their fictions in other countries and at a distance from home torfaeus asserts positively that various islandic odes now remain which were sung by the scandinavian bards before the kings of england and ireland and for which they received liberal gratuities torf hist orcad in praefat  they were more especially caressed and rewarded at the courts of those princes who were distinguished for their warlike character and their passion for military glory  olaus wormius informs us that great numbers of the northern scalds constantly resided in the courts of the kings of sweden denmark and england lit dan p     ed  to  hence the tradition in an ancient islandic saga or poetical history may be

conquered ireland gothland denmark and norway see galfrid monum ix    rob of glouc ed hearne p   0     what is said in the text must have greatly facilitated the saxon and danish conquests in england the works of the genuine caedmon are written in the language of the ancient angles who were nearly connected with the jutes hence that language resembled the ancient danish as appears from passages of caedmon cited by wanley hence also it happened that the later danosaxonic dialect in which juniuss poetical paraphrase of genesis was written is likewise so very similar to the language of the ancient angles who settled in the more northern parts of england and in this dialect which indeed prevailed in some degree almost over all england many other poems are composed mentioned likewise in wanleys catalogue it is the constant doctrine of the danish historians that the danes and angles whose successors gave the name to this island had the same origin  indeed it may be naturally concluded from these suggestions that the scandinavian tongue became familiar in the british islands by the songs of the scalds unless it be rather presumed that a previous knowledge of that tongue in britain was the means of facilitating the admission of those poets and preparing the way for their reception  and here it will be much to our present argument to observe that some of the old gothic and scandinavian superstitions are to this day retained in the english language mara from whence our nightmare is derived was in the runic theology a spirit or spectre of the night which seized men in

in that of edgar both christian champions against the pagan danes were originally subjects of the genuine saxon bards but i rather think they begun to be celebrated in or after the crusades the nature

edward fell for it was born within them even from the loins of their kindred to defend the treasures and the houses of their country and their gifts against the hatred of strangers the nation of the scots and the fatal inhabitants of ships fell the hills resounded and the armed men were covered with sweat from the time the sun the king of stars the torch of the eternal one rose cheerful above the hills till he returned to his habitation there lay many of the northern men pierced with lances they lay wounded with their shields pierced through and also the scots the hateful harvest of battle the chosen bands of the west saxons going out to battle pressed on the steps of the detested nations and slew their flying rear with sharp and bloody swords the soft effeminate men yielded up their spears the mercians did not fear or fly the rough game of the hand there was no safety to them who sought the land with anlaff in the bosom of the ship to die in fight five youthful kings fell in the place of fight slain with swords and seven captains of anlaff with the innumerable army of scottish mariners there the lord of the normans northernmen was chased and their army now made small was driven to the prow of the ship the ship sounded with the waves and the king marching into the yellow sea escaped alive and so it was the wise northern king constantine a veteran chief returning by flight to his

odes and songs now remaining are written in a meter much resembling that of the scaldic dialogue at the tomb of angantyr which has been beautifully translated into english in the true spirit of the original and in a genuine strain of poetry by gray the extemporaneous effusions of the glowing bard seem naturally to have fallen into this measure and it was probably more easily suited to the voice or harp their versification for the most part seems to have been that of the runic poetry  as literature the certain attendant as it is the parent of true religion and civility gained ground among the saxons poetry no longer remained a separate science and the profession of bard seems gradually to have declined among them i mean the bard under those appropriated characteristics and that peculiar appointment which he sustained among the scandinavian pagans yet their national love of verse and music still so strongly predominated that in the place of their old scalders a new rank of poets arose called gleemen or harpers gleeman answers to the latin joculator fabyan speaking of blagebride an ancient british king famous for his skill in poetry and music calls him a conynge musicyan called of

council spelman tom i p     edit      fol    these probably gave rise to the order of english minstrels who flourished till the sixteenth century  and here i stop to point out one of the principal reasons why the scandinavian bards have transmitted to modern times so much more of their native poetry than the rest of their southern neighbors it is true that the inhabitants of sweden denmark and norway whether or no from their asiatic origin from their poverty which compelled them to seek fortunes at foreign courts by the exercise of a popular art from the success of their bards the nature of their republican government or their habits of unsettled life were more given to verse than any other gothic or even celtic tribe but this is not all they remained pagans and retained their original manners much longer than any of their gothic kindred they were not completely converted to christianity till the tenth century see bishop lloyds hist account of church government in great britain etc chap i    page  to land      and crymog arngrim l i cap  0 p  0   hence under the concurrence however of some of the causes just mentioned their scaldic profession acquired greater degrees of strength and of maturity and from an uninterrupted possession through many ages of the most romantic religious superstitions and the preservation of those rough manners which are so favorable to the poetical spirit was enabled to produce not only more genuine but more numerous compositions true religion would have checked the impetuosity of their passions suppressed their wild exertions of fancy and banished that striking train of imagery which their poetry derived from a barbarous theology this circumstance also suggests to our consideration those superior advantages and opportunities arising from leisure and length of time which they enjoyed above others of circulating their poetry far and wide of giving a general currency to their mode of fabling of rendering their skill in versification more universally and familiarly known and a more conspicuous and popular object of admiration or imitation to the neighboring countries hence too it has happened that modern times have not only attained much fuller information concerning their historical transactions but are so intimately acquainted with the peculiarities of their character  it is probable that the danish invasions produced a considerable alteration in the manners of our anglosaxon ancestors although their connections with england were transient and interrupted and on the whole scarcely lasted two hundred years yet many of the danish customs began to prevail among the inhabitants which seem to have given a new turn to their temper and genius the danish fashion of excessive drinking for instance a vice almost natural to the northern nations became so general among the anglosaxons that it was found necessary to restrain so pernicious and contagious a practice by a particular statute see lambardes archaionom and bartholin ii c xii p      hence it seems likely that so popular an entertainment as their poetry gained ground especially if we consider that in their expeditions against england they were of course attended by many northern scalds who constantly made a part of their military retinue and whose language was understood by the saxons rogwald lord of the orcades who was also himself a poet going on

extensive jurisdiction and not only king of england but of denmark sweden and norway was not without the customary retinue of the northern courts in which the scalds held so distinguished and important a station human nature in a savage state aspires to some species of merit and in every stage of society is alike susceptible of flattery when addressed to the reigning passion the sole object of these northern princes was military glory it is certain that canute delighted in this mode of entertainment which he patronised and liberally rewarded it is related in knytlingasaga or canutes history that he commanded the scald loftunga to be put to death for daring to comprehend his achievements in too concise a poem nemo said he ante te ausus est de me breves cantilenas componere

irish bards are by some conceived to be strongly marked with the traces of scaldic imagination and these traces which will be reconsidered are believed still to survive among a species of poetical historians whom they call taletellers supposed to be the descendants of the original irish bards we are informed by the irish historians that saint patrick when he converted ireland to the christian faith destroyed three hundred volumes of the songs of the irish bards such was their dignity in this country that they were permitted to wear a robe of the same color with that of the royal family they were constantly summoned to a triennial festival and the most approved songs delivered at this assembly were ordered to be preserved in the custody of the kings historian or antiquary many of these compositions are referred to by keating as the foundation of his history of ireland ample estates were appropriated to them that they might live in a condition of independence and ease the profession was hereditary but when a bard died his estate devolved not to his eldest son but to such of his family as discovered the most distinguished talents for poetry and music every principal

essays part iv p      these are topics in which the runic poetry is said to have been greatly conversant  nor is it improbable that the welsh bards the bards of britain were originally a constitutional appendage of the druidical hierarchy in the parish of llanidan in the isle of anglesey there are still to be seen the ruins of an archdruids mansion which they call trer drew that is

day the hamlet of the bards rowlandss mona p       but so strong was the attachment of the celtic nations among which we reckon britain to poetry that amidst all the changes of government and manners even long after the order of druids was extinct and the national religion altered the bards acquiring a sort of civil capacity and a new establishment still continued to flourish and with regard to britain the bards flourished most in those parts of it which most strongly retained their native celtic character the britons living in those countries that were between the trent or humber and the thames by far the greatest portion of this island in the midst of the roman garrisons and colonies had been so long inured to the customs of the romans that they preserved very little of the british and from this long and habitual intercourse before the fifth century they seem to have lost their original language we cannot discover the slightest trace in the poems of the bards the lives of the british saints or any other ancient monument that they held any correspondence with the welsh the cornish the cumbrian or the strathcluyd britons among other british institutions grown obsolete among them they seem to have lost the use of bards at least there are no memorials of any they had nor any of their songs remaining nor do the welsh or cumbrian poets ever touch upon any transactions that passed in those countries after they were relinquished by the romans  and here we see the reason why the welsh bards flourished so much and so long but moreover the welsh kept in awe as they were by the romans harrassed by the saxons and eternally jealous of the attacks the encroachments and the neighborhood of aliens were on this account attached to their celtic manners this situation and these circumstances inspired them with a pride and an obstinacy for mantaining a national distinction and for preserving their ancient usages among which the bardic profession is so eminent   might have been acquainted with the scandinavian scalds i mean before their communications with armorica mentioned at large above the prosody of the welsh bards depended much on alliteration see infr sect x p     hence they seem to have paid an attention to the scaldic versification the islandic poets are said to have carried alliteration to the highest pitch of exactness in their earliest periods whereas the welsh bards of the sixth century used it but sparingly and in a very imperfect degree in this circumstance a proof of imitation at least of emulation is implied i am however informed by a very intelligent antiquary in british literature that there are manifest marks of alliteration in some druidical fragments still remaining undoubtedly composed before the britons could have possibly mixed in the smallest degree with any gothic nation rhyme is likewise found in the british poetry at the earliest period in those druidical triplets called englyn milwr or the warriors song in which every verse is closed with a consonant syllable see a metrical druid oracle in borlases antiquit cornwall b iii chapter   p     edit       there are moreover strong instances of conformity between the manners of the two nations which however may be accounted for on general principles arising from our comparative observations on rude life yet it is remarkable that mead the northern nectar or

smith they have both a physician a huntsman and other corresponding officers see temple ubi supr p      we must also remember that an intercourse was necessarily produced between the welsh and scandinavians from the piratical irruptions of the latter their scalds as i have already remarked were respected and patronised in the courts of those princes whose territories were the principal objects of the danish invasions torfaeus expressly affirms this of the anglosaxon and irish kings and it is at least probable that they were entertained with equal regard by the welsh princes who so frequently concurred with the danes in distressing the english it may be added that the welsh although living in a separate and detached situation and so strongly prejudiced in favor of their own usages yet from neighborhood and unavoidable communications of various kinds might have imbibed the ideas of the scandinavian bards from the saxons and danes after those nations had occupied and overspread all the other parts of our island  many pieces of the scottish bards are still remaining in the highlands of scotland of these a curious specimen and which considered in a more extensive and general respect is a valuable monument of the poetry of a rude period has lately been given to the world under the title of the works of ossian it is indeed very remarkable that in these poems the terrible graces which so naturally characterise and so generally constitute the early poetry of a barbarous people should so frequently give place to a gentler set of manners to the social sensibilities of polished life and a more civilized and elegant species of imagination nor is this circumstance which disarranges all our established ideas concerning the savage stages of society easily to be accounted for unless we suppose that the celtic tribes who were so strongly addicted to poetical composition and who made it so much their study from the earliest times might by degrees have attained a higher vein of poetical refinement than could at first sight or on common principles be expected among nations whom we are accustomed to call barbarous that some few instances of an elevated strain of friendship of love and other sentimental feelings existing in such nations might lay the foundation for introducing a set of manners among the bards more refined and exalted than the real manners of the country and that panegyrics on those virtues transmitted with improvements from bard to bard must at length have formed characters of ideal excellence which might propagate among the people real manners bordering on the poetical these poems however notwithstanding the difference between the gothic and the celtic rituals contain many visible vestiges of scandinavian superstition the allusions in the songs of ossian to spirits who preside over the different parts and direct the various operations of nature who send storms over the deep and rejoice in the shrieks of the shipwrecked mariner who call down lightning to blast the forest or cleave the rock and diffuse irresistible pestilence among the people beautifully conducted indeed and heightened under the skilful hand of a master bard entirely correspond with the runic system and breathe the spirit of its poetry one fiction in particular the most extravagant in all ossians poems is founded on an essential article of the runic belief it is where fingal fights with the spirit of loda nothing could aggrandise fingals heroism more highly than this mavelous encounter it was esteemed among the ancient danes the most daring act of courage to engage with a ghost bartholin de contemptu mortis apud dan l ii c   p     and ibid p   0 there are many other marks of gothic customs and superstitions

fascination yet it is probable that many of the scaldic imaginations might have been blended with the arabian in the mean time there is great reason to believe that the gothic scalds enriched their vein of fabling from this new and fruitful source of fiction opened by the arabians in spain and afterward propagated by the crusades it was in many respects cogenial with their own besides the general wildness of the imagery in both among other particular circumstances of coincidence which might be mentioned here the practice of giving names to swords which we find in the scaldic poems

were composed till the scandinavian tribes had been converted to christianity that is as i have before observed about the close of the tenth century these barbarians had an infinite and a national contempt for the christians whose religion inculcated a spirit of peace gentleness and civility qualities so dissimilar to those of their own ferocious and warlike disposition and which they naturally interpreted to be the marks of cowardice and pusillanimity regner lodbrog in his dying ode speaking of a battle fought against the christians says in ridicule of the eucharist there we celebrated a mass missu island of weapons  it has however been urged that as the irruption of the normans into france under their leader rollo did not take place till toward the beginning of the tenth century at which period the scaldic art was arrived to the highest perfection in rollos native country we can easily trace the descent of the french and english romances of chivalry from the northern sagas it is supposed that rollo carried with him many scalds from the north who transmitted their skill to their children and successors and that these adopting the religion opinions and language of the new country substituted the heroes of christendom instead of those of their pagan ancestors and began to celebrate the feats of charlemagne roland and oliver whose true history they set off and embellished with the scaldic figments of dwarfs giants dragons and enchantments percys ess metr romans p viii  there is however some reason to believe that these fictions were current among the french long before and if the principles advanced in the former part of this dissertation be true the fables adhering to charlemagnes real history must be referred to another source  let me add that the enchantments of the runic poetry are very different from those in our romances of chivalry the former chiefly deal in spells and charms such as would preserve from poison blunt the weapons of an enemy procure victory allay a tempest cure bodily diseases or call the dead from their tombs in uttering a form of mysterious words or inscribing runic characters the magicians of romance are chiefly employed in forming and conducting a train of deceptions there is an air of barbaric horror in the incantations of the scaldic fablers the magicians of romance often present visions of pleasure and delight and although not without their alarming terrors sometimes lead us through flowery forests and raise up palaces glittering with gold and precious stones the runic magic is more like that of canidia in horace the romantic resembles that of armida in tasso the operations of the one are frequently but mere tricks in comparison of that sublime solemnity of necromantic machinery which the other so awefully displays  it is also remarkable that in the earlier scaldic odes we find but few dragons giants and fairies these were introduced afterward and are the progeny of arabian fancy nor indeed do these imaginary beings often occur in any of the compositions which preceded the introduction of that species of fabling on this reasoning the irish taleteller mentioned above could not be a lineal descendant of the elder irish bards the absence of giants and dragons and let me add of many other traces of that fantastic and brilliant imagery which composes the system of arabian imagination from the poems of ossian are a striking proof of their antiquity it has already been suggested at what period and from what origin those fancies got footing in the welsh poetry we do not find them in the odes of taliessin or aneurin who flourished about the year   0 he has left a long spirited poem called gododin often alluded to by the later welsh bards which celebrates a battle fought against the saxons near cattraeth under the conduct of mynnydawe eiddin in which all the britons three only excepted among which was the bard aneurin himself were slain i will give a specimen the men whose drink was mead comely in shape hastened to cattraeth these impetuous warriors in ranks armed with red spears long and bending began the battle might i speak my revenge against the people of the deiri i would overwhelm them like a deluge in one slaughter for unheeding i have lost a friend who was brave in resisting his enemies i drank of the wine and metheglin of mordai whose spear was of huge size in the shock of the battle he prepared food for the eagle when cydwal hastened forward a shout arose before the yellow morning when he gave the signal he broke the shield into small splinters the men hastened to cattraeth noble in birth their drink was wine and mead out of golden cups there were three hundred and sixty three adorned with chains of gold but of those who filled with wine rushed on to the fight only three escaped who hewed their way with the sword the warrior of acron conan dacarawd and i the bard aneurin red with blood otherwise i should not have survived to compose this song when caradoc hastened to the war he was the son of a wild boar in hewing down the saxons a bull in the conflict of fight he twisted the wood spear from their hands gurien saw not his father after he had lifted the glistening mead in his hand i praise all the warriors who thus met in the battle and attacked the foe with one mind their life was short but they have left a long regret to their friends yet of the saxons they slew more than seven there was many a mother shedding tears the song is due to thee who have attained the highest glory thou who wast like fire thunder and storm o rudd fedell warlike champion excellent in might you still think of the war the noble chiefs deserve to be celebrated in verse who after the fight made the rivers to overflow their banks with blood their hands glutted the throats of the darkbrown eagles and skilfully prepared food for the ravenous birds of all the chiefs who went to cattraeth with golden chains etc this poem is extremely difficult to be understood being written if not in the pictish language at least in a dialect of the britons very different from the modern welsh see the learned and ingenious mr evanss dissertatio de bardis p         this reasoning explains an observation of an ingenious critic in this species of literature and who has studied the works of the welsh bards with much attention there are not such extravagant flights in any poetic compositions except it be in the eastern to which as far as i can judge by the few translated specimens i have seen they bear a near resemblance evans ubi supr pref p iv  i will venture to say he does not meet with these flights in the elder welsh bards the beautiful romantic fiction that king arthur after being wounded in the fatal battle of camlan was conveyed by an elfin princess into the land of faery or spirits to be healed of his wounds that he reigns there still as a mighty potentate in all his pristine splendor and will one day return to resume his throne in britain and restore the solemnities of his champions often occurs in the ancient welsh bards the arabians call the fairies ginn and the persians peri the former calls fairyland ginnistian

compositions of the welsh bards only who flourished after the native vein of british fabling had been tinctured by these fairy tales which the arabians had propagated in armorica and which the welsh had received from their connection with that province of gaul such a fiction as this is entirely different from the cast and complexion of the ideas of the original welsh poets it is easy to collect from the welsh odes written after the tenth century many signatures of this exotic imagery such as their assault was like strong lions he is valourous as a lion who can resist his lance the dragon of monas sons were so brave in fight that there was horrible consternation and upon tal moelvre a thousand banners our lion has brought to trallwng three armies a dragon he was from the beginning

    and his diss de bard p    compare aneurins ode cited above  these images are all drawn from their own country from their situation and circumstances and although highly poetical are in general of a more sober and temperate coloring in a word not only that elevation of allusion which many suppose to be peculiar to the poetry of wales but that fertility of fiction and those mavelous fables recorded in geoffrey of monmouth which the generality of readers who do not sufficiently attend to the origin of that historians romantic materials believe to be the genuine offspring of the welsh poets are of foreign growth and to return to the ground of this argument there is the strongest reason to suspect that even the gothic edda or system of poetic mythology of the northern nations is enriched with those higher strokes of oriental imagination which the arabians had communicated to the europeans into this extravagant tissue of unmeaning allegory false philosophy and false theology it was easy to incorporate their most wild and romantic conceptions huet is of opinion that the edda is entirely the production of snorros fancy but this is saying too much see orig roman p     the first edda was compiled undoubtedly with many additions and interpolations from fictions and traditions in the old runic poems by soemund sigfusson surnamed the learned about the year  0   he seems to have made it his business to select or digest into one body such of these pieces as were best calculated to furnish a collection of poetic phrases and figures he studied in germany and chiefly at cologne this first edda being not only prolix but perplexed and obscure a second which is that now extant was compiled by snorro sturleson born in the year       it is certain and very observable that in the edda we find much more of giants dragons and other imaginary beings undoubtedly belonging to arabian romance then in the earlier scaldic odes by the way there are many strokes in both the eddas taken from the revel ations of saint john which must come from the compilers who were christ ians     it must be confessed that the ideas of chivalry the appendage and the subject of romance subsisted among the goths but this must be understood under certain limitations there is no peculiarity which more strongly discriminates the manners of the greeks and romans from those of modern times than that small degree of attention and respect with which those nations treated the fair sex and that inconsiderable share which they were permitted to take in conversation and the general commerce of life for the truth of this observation we need only appeal to the classic writers in which their women appear to have been devoted to a state of seclusion and obscurity one is surprised that barbarians should be greater masters of complaisance than the most polished people that ever existed no sooner was the roman empire overthrown and the goths had overpowered europe than we find the female character assuming an unusual importance and authority and distinguished with new privileges in all the european governments established by the northern conquerors even amidst the confusions of savage war and among the almost incredible enormities committed by the goths at their invasion of the empire they forbore to offer any violence to the women this perhaps is one of the most striking features in the new state of manners which took place about the seventh century and it is to this period and to this people that we must refer the origin of gallantry in europe the romans never introduced these sentiments into their european provinces  the goths believed some divine and prophetic quality to be inherent in their women they admitted them into their councils and consulted them on the public business of the state they were suffered to conduct the great events which they predicted ganna a prophetic virgin of the marcomanni a german or gaulish tribe was sent by her nation to

account of their women than on their own and the romans availing themselves of this apprehension often demanded their noblest virgins for hostages tacit de morib germ page     ut supr  from these circumstances the women even claimed a sort of precedence at least an equality subsisted between the sexes in the gothic constitutions  but the deference paid to the fair sex which produced the spirit of gallantry is chiefly to be sought for in those strong and exaggerated ideas of female chastity which prevailed among the northern nations hence the lovers devotion to his mistress was increased his attentions to her service multiplied his affection heightened and his solicitude aggravated in proportion as the difficulty of obtaining her was enhanced and the passion of love acquired a degree of delicacy when controlled by the principles of honor and purity the highest excellence of character then known was a superiority in arms and that rival was most likely to gain his ladys regard who was the bravest champion here we see valor inspired by love in the mean time the same heroic spirit which was the surest claim to the favor of the ladies was often exerted in their protection a protection much wanted in an age of rapine of plunder and piracy when the weakness of the softer sex was exposed to continual dangers and unexpected attacks see instances of this sort of violence in the ancient

embossed with golden imagery which foretold future events this piece which is in runic capital characters was written before the year  000 many stories of this kind might be produced from the northern chronicles  it is easy to suppose the officious emulation and ardour of many a gallant young warrior pressing forward to be foremost in this honorable service which flattered the most agreeable of all passions and which gratified every enthusiasm of the times especially the fashionable fondness for a wandering and military life in the mean time we may conceive the lady thus won or thus defended conscious of her own importance affecting an air of stateliness it was her pride to have preserved her chastity inviolate she could perceive no merit but that of invincible bravery and could only be approached in terms of respect and submission  among the scandinavians a people so fond of clothing adventures in verse these gallantries must naturally become the subject of poetry with its fictitious embellishments accordingly we find their chivalry displayed in their odes pieces which at the same time greatly confirm these observations the famous ode of regner lodbrog affords a striking instance in which being imprisoned in a loathsome dungeon and condemned to be destroyed by venomous serpents he solaces his desperate situation by recollecting and reciting the glorious exploits of his past life one of these and the first which he commemorates was an achievement of chivalry it was the delivery of a beautiful swedish princess from an impregnable fortress in which she was forcibly detained by one of her fathers captains her father issued a proclamation promising that whoever would rescue the lady should have her in marriage regner succeeded in the attempt and

belonging to this particular story deserve to be pointed out here as illustrative of our argument such as it was like being placed near a beautiful virgin on a couch  it was like kissing a young widow in the first seat at a feast i made to struggle in the twilight that goldenhaired chief who passed his mornings among the young maidens and loved to converse with widows  he who aspires to the love of young virgins ought always to be foremost in the din of arms st              it is worthy of remark that these sentiments occur to regner while he is in the midst of his tortures and at the point of death thus many of the heroes in froissart in the greatest extremities of danger recollect their amors and die thinking of their mistresses and by the way in the same strain boh a danish champion having lost his chin and one of his cheeks by a single stroke from thurstain midlang only reflected how he should be received when thus maimed and disfigured by the danish girls he instantly exclaimed in a tone of savage gallantry the danish virgins will not now willingly or easily give me kisses if i should perhaps return home chron norveg p      but there is an ode in the knytlingasaga written by harald the valiant which is professedly a song of chivalry and which exclusive of its wild spirit of adventure and its images of savage life has the romantic air of a set of stanzas composed by a provencial troubadour harald appears to have been one of the most eminent adventurers of his age he had killed the king of drontheim in a bloody engagement he had traversed all the seas and visited all the coasts of the north and had carried his piratical enterprises even as far as the mediterranean and the shores of africa he was at length taken prisoner and detained for some time at constantinople he complains in this ode that the reputation he had acquired by so many hazardous exploits by his skill in single combat riding swimming gliding along the ice darting rowing and guiding a ship through the rocks had not been able to make any impression on elissiff or elisabeth the beautiful daughter of jarilas king of russia bartholin p      here however chivalry subsisted but in its rudiments under the feudal establishments which were soon afterward erected in europe it received new vigor and was invested with the formalities of a regular institution the nature and circumstances of that peculiar model of government were highly favorable to this strange spirit of fantastic heroism which however unmeaning and ridiculous it may seem had the most serious and salutary consequences in assisting the general growth of refinement and the progression of civilisation in forming the manners of europe in inculcating the principles of honor and in teaching modes of decorum the genius of the feudal policy was perfectly martial a numerous nobility formed into separate principalities affecting independence and mutually jealous of their privileges and honors necessarily lived in a state of hostility this situation rendered personal strength and courage the most requisite and essential accomplishments and hence even in time of peace they had no conception of any diversions or public ceremonies but such as were of the military kind yet as the courts of these petty princes were thronged with ladies of the most eminent distinction and quality the ruling passion for war was tempered with courtesy the prize of contending champions was adjudged by the ladies who did not think it inconsistent to be present or to preside at the bloody spectacles of the times and who themselves seem to have contracted an unnatural and unbecoming ferocity while they softened the manners of those valorous knights who fought for their approbation the high notions of a noble descent which arose from the condition of the feudal constitution and the ambition of forming an alliance with powerful and opulent families cherished this romantic system it was hard to obtain the fair feudatary who was the object of universal adoration not only the splendour of birth but the magnificent castle surrounded with embattelled walls guarded with massy towers and crowned with lofty pinnacles served to inflame the imagination and to create an attachment to some illustrious heiress whose point of honor it was to be chaste and inaccessible and the difficulty of success on these occasions seems in great measure to have given rise to that sentimental love of romance which acquiesced in a distant respectful admiration and did not aspire to possession the want of an uniform administration of justice the general disorder and state of universal anarchy which naturally sprung from the principles of the feudal policy presented perpetual opportunities of checking the oppressions of arbitrary lords of delivering captives injuriously detained in the baronial castles of punishing robbers of succouring the distressed and of avenging the impotent and the unarmed who were every moment exposed to the most licentious insults and injuries the violence and injustice of the times gave birth to valor and humanity these acts conferred a luster and an importance on the character of men professing arms who made force the substitute of law in the mean time the crusades so pregnant with enterprise heightened the habits of this warlike fanaticism and when these foreign expeditions were ended in which the hermits and pilgrims of palestine had been defended nothing remained to employ the activity of adventurers but the protection of innocence at home chivalry by degrees was consecrated by religion whose authority tinctured every passion and was engrafted into every institution of the superstitious ages and at length composed that singular picture of manners in which the love of a god and of the ladies were reconciled the saint and the hero were blended and charity and revenge zeal and gallantry devotion and valor were united  those who think that chivalry started late from the nature of the feudal constitution confound an improved effect with a simple cause not having distinctly considered all the particularities belonging to the genius manners and usages of the gothic tribes and accustomed to contemplate nations under the general idea of barbarians they cannot look for the seeds of elegance amongst men distinguished only for their ignorance and their inhumanity the rude origin of this heroic gallantry was quickly overwhelmed and extinguished by the superior pomp which it necessarily adopted from the gradual diffusion of opulence and civility and that blaze of splendour with which it was surrounded amid the magnificence of the feudal solemnities but above all it was lost and forgotten in that higher degree of embellishment which at length it began to receive from the representations of romance  from the foregoing observations taken together the following general and comprehensive conclusion seems to result  amid the gloom of superstition in an age of the grossest ignorance and credulity a taste for the wonders of oriental fiction was introduced by the arabians into europe many countries of which were already seasoned to a reception of its extravagancies by means of the poetry of the gothic salds who perhaps originally derived their ideas from the fame fruitful region of invention these fictions coinciding with the reigning manners and perpetually kept up and improved in the tales of troubadours and minstrels seem to have centered about the eleventh century in the ideal histories of turpin and geoffrey of monmouth which record the supposititious achievements of charlemagne and king arthur where they formed the groundwork of that species of fabulous narrative called romance and from these beginnings or causes afterward enlarged and enriched by kindred fancies fetched from the crusades that singular and capricious mode of imagination arose which at length composed the mavelous machineries of the more sublime italian poets and of their disciple spenser  on the introduction of learning into england dissertation ii the irruption of the northern nations into the western empire about the beginning of the fourth century forms one of the most interesting and important periods of modern history europe on this great event suffered the most memorable revolutions in its government and manners and from the most flourishing state of peace and civility became on a sudden and for the space of two centuries the theater of the most deplorable devastation and disorder but among the disasters introduced by these irresistible barbarians the most calamitous seems to have been the destruction of those arts which the romans still continued so successfully to cultivate in their capital and which they had universally communicated to their conquered provinces toward the close of the fifth century very few traces of the roman policy jurisprudence sciences and literature remained some faint sparks of knowledge were kept alive in the monasteries and letters and the liberal arts were happily preserved from a total extinction during the confusions of the gothic invaders by that slender degree of culture and protection which they received from the prelates of the church and the religious communities  but notwithstanding the famous academy of rome theodosius the younger in the year     founded an academy

provinces found many greek books which they read with infinite avidity and such was the gratification they received from this fortunate acquisition and so powerfully their curiosity was excited to make further discoveries in this new field of knowledge that they requested their caliphs to procure from the emperor at constantinople the best greek writers these they carefully translated into arabic see abulfarag per pocock dynast p   0 greek was a familiar language to the arabians the accounts of the caliphs treasury were always written in greek till the year of christ     they were then

their taste the greek poetry they rejected because it inculcated polytheism and idolatry which were inconsistent with their religion or perhaps it was too cold and too correct for their extravagant and romantic conceptions yet it appears from many of their fictions that some of the greek poets were not unfamiliar among them perhaps long before the period assigned in the text theophilus edessenus

leo might be permitted to settle in his dominions with a most ample salary as a teacher in that science the emperor by this means being made acquainted with leos merit established a school in which he appointed leo a professor for the sake of a specious excuse the caliph sent a second time to the emperor entreating that leo might reside with him for a short time only offering likewise a large sum

genius of this people it is owing that chemistry became blended with so many extravagancies obscured with unintelligible jargon and filled with fantastic notions mysterious pretensions and superstitious operations and it is easy to conceive that among these visionary philosophers so fertile in speculation logic and metaphysics contracted much of that refinement and perplexity which for so many centuries exercised the genius of profound reasoners and captious disputants and so long obstructed the progress of true knowledge it may perhaps be regretted in the mean time that this predilection of the arabian scholars for philosophic enquiries prevented them from importing into europe a literature of another kind but rude and barbarous nations would not have been polished by the history poetry and oratory of the greeks although capable of comprehending the solid truths of many parts of science they are unprepared to be impressed with ideas of elegance and to relish works of taste men must be instructed before they can be refined and in the gradations of knowledge polite literature does not take place till some progress has first been made in philosophy yet it is at the

valley of infinite depth length and breadth one side was formed by a prodigious sheet of fire and the opposite side filled with hail and ice both sides were swarming with souls o departed men who were for ever in search of rest alternately shifting their situation to these extremes of heat and cold the monk supposing this place to be hell was told hy his guide that he was mistaken the guide then led him greatly terrified with this spectacle to a more distant place where he says i saw on a sudden a darkness come on and every thing was obscured when i entered this place i could discern no object on account of the increasing darkness except the countenance and glittering garments of my conductor as we went forward i beheld vast torrents of flame spouting upwards from the ground as from a large well and falling down into it again as we came near it my guide suddenly vanished and left me alone in the midst of darkness and this horrible vision deformed and uncouth spirits arose from

considers ecclesiastical affairs we should remember that the building of a church the preferment of an abbot the canonisation of a martyr and the importation into england of the shinbone of an apostle were necessarily matters of much more importance in bedes conceptions than victories or revolutions he is fond of minute description but particularities are the fault and often the merit of early historians an ingenious author who writes under the name of m de vigneul marville observes that bid when he speaks of the magi who went to worship our savior is very particular in the account of their names age and respective offerings he says that melchior was old and had gray hair with a long beard and that it was he who offered gold to christ in acknowledgment of his sovereignty that gaspar the second of the magi was young and had no beard and that it was he who offered frankincense in recognition of our lords divinity and that balthazar the third was of a dark complexion had a large beard

in the course of our enquiries concerning the utility of monasteries i certainly do not mean to defend the monastic system we are apt to pass a general and undistinguishing censure on the monks and to suppose their foundations to have been the retreats of illiterate indolence at every period of time bt it should be remembered that our universities about the time of the norman conquest were in a low condition while the monasteries contained ample endowments and accommodations and were the only respectable seminaries of literature a few centuries afterward as our universities began to flourish in consequence of the distinctions and onours which they conferred on scholars the establishment of colleges the introduction of new systems of science the universal ardour which prevailed of breeding almost all persons to letters and the abolition of that exclusive right of teaching which the ecclesiastics had so long claimed the monasteries of course grew inattentive to studies which were more

mountainous countries usually produce are here very frequent the winds exceedingly tempestuous and the winters almost continually dark yet the air of the valley is so happily tempered as scarcely to be the cause of any diseases the monks sitting in the cloisters of the abbey when they choose for a momentary refreshment to cast their eyes abroad have on every side a pleasing prospect of mountains

peter lombard archbishop of paris and the celebrated abelard men whose consummate abilities were rather qualified to reform the church and to restore useful science than to corrupt both by confounding the common sense of mankind with frivolous speculation they both flourished about the year    0  these visionary theologists never explained or illustrated any scriptural topic on the contrary they perverted the simplest expressions of the sacred text and embarrassed the most evident truths of the gospel by labored distinctions and unintelligible solutions from the universities of france which were then filled with multitudes of english students this admired species of sophistry was adopted in england and encouraged by lanfranc and anselm archbishops of canterbury baccalaureus qui legit textum sc s scripturae succumbit lectori sententiarum parisiis etc rog bacon apd a wood hist antiq univ oxon i p    lombard was the author of the sentences  and so successful was its progress at oxford that before the reign of edward the second no foreign university could boast so conspicuous a catalogue of subtle and invincible doctors  nor was the profession of the civil and canonical laws a small impediment to the propagation of those letters which humanise the mind and cultivate the manners i do not mean to deny that the accidental discovery of the imperial code in the twelfth century contributed in a considerable degree to civilize europe by introducing among other beneficial consequences more legitimate ideas concerning the nature of government and the administration of justice by creating a necessity of transferring judicial decrees from an illiterate nobility to the cognizance of scholars by lessening the attachment to the military profession and by giving honor and importance to civil employments but to suggest that the mode in which this invaluable system of jurisprudence was studied proved injurious to polite literature it was no sooner revived than it was received as a scholastic science and taught by regular professors in most of the universities of europe to be skilled in the theology of the schools was the chief and general ambition of scholars but at the same time a knowledge of both the laws was become an indispensable requisite at least an essential recommendation for obtaining the most opulent ecclesiastical dignities hence it was cultivated with universal avidity it became so considerable a branch of study in the plan of academical discipline that twenty scholars out of seventy were destined to the study of the civil and canon laws in one of the most ample colleges at oxford founded in the year      and it is easy to conceive the pedantry with which it was pursued in these seminaries during the middle ages it was treated with the same spirit of idle speculation which had been carried into philosophy and theology it was overwhelmed with endless commentaries which disclaimed all elegance of language and served only to exercise genius as it afforded materials for framing the flimsy labyrinths of casuistry  it was not indeed probable that these attempts in elegant literature which i have mentioned should have any permanent effects the change like a sudden revolution in government was too rapid for duration it was moreover premature and on that account not likely to be lasting the habits of superstition and ignorance were as yet too powerful for a reformation of this kind to be effected by a few polite scholars it was necessary that many circumstances and events yet in the womb of time should take place before the minds of men could be so far enlightened as to receive these improvements  but perhaps inventive poetry lost nothing by this relapse had classical taste and judgment been now established imagination would have suffered and too early a check would have been given to the beautiful extravagancies of romantic fabling in a word truth and reason would have chased before their time those specter of illusive fancy so pleasing to the imagination which delight to hover in the gloom of ignorance and superstition and which form so considerable a part of the poetry of the succeeding centuries  the history of english poetry sect i the saxon language spoken in england is distinguished by three several epochs and may therefore be divided into three dialects the first of these is that which the saxons used from their entrance into this island till the irruption of the danes for the space of three hundred and thirty years the saxons came into england a d   0  this has been called the british saxon and no monument of it remains except a small metrical fragment of the genuine caedmon inserted in alfreds version of the venerable bedes ecclesiastical history lib iv cap   some have improperly referred to this dialect the harmony of the four gospels in the cotton library the style of which approaches in purity and antiquity to that of the codex argenteus it is frankish see brit mus mss

time of the norman accession and continued beyond the reign of henry the second he died        the last of these three dialects with which these annals of english poetry commence formed a language extremely barbarous irregular and intractable and consequently promises no very striking specimens in any species of composition its substance was the danish saxon adulterated with french the saxon indeed a language subsisting on uniform principles and polished by poets and theologists however corrupted by the danes had much perspicuity strength and harmony but the french imported by the conqueror and his people was a confused jargon of teutonic gaulish and vitiated latin in this fluctuating state of our national speech the french predominated even before the conquest the saxon language began to fall into contempt and the french or frankish to be substituted in its stead a circumstance which at once facilitated and foretold the norman accession in the year     it was the common practice of the anglosaxons to send their youth to the monasteries of france for education dugd mon i     and not only the language but the manners of the french were esteemed the most polite accomplishments ingulph hist p    sub ann  0    in the reign of edward the confessor the resort of normans to the english court was so frequent that the affectation of imitating the frankish customs became almost universal and even the lower class of people were ambitious of catching the frankish idiom it was no difficult task for the norman lords to banish that language of which the natives began to be absurdly ashamed the new invaders commanded the laws to be administered in french but there is a precept in saxon from william the first to the sheriff of somersetshire hickes these i par i page  0  see also praefat ibid p xv  many charters of monasteries were forged in latin by the saxon monks for the present security of their possessions in consequence of that aversion which the normans professed to the saxon tongue the normans who practiced every specious expedient to plunder the monks demanded a sight of the written evidences of their lands the monks well knew that it would have been useless or impolitic to have produced these evidences or charters in the original saxon as the normans not only did not understand but would have received with contempt instruments written in that language therefore the monks were compelled to the pious fraud of forging them in latin and great numbers of these forged latin charters till lately supposed original are still extant see

0    in the mean time we should have some regard to the general and political state of the nation the natives were so universally reduced to the lowest condition of neglect and indigence that the english name became a term of reproach and several generations elapsed before one family of saxon pedigree was raised to any distinguished honors or could so much as attain the rank of baronage see brompt chon p  0   abb rieval p      among other instances of that absolute and voluntary submission with which our saxon ancestors received a foreign yoke it appears that they suffered their handwriting to fall into discredit and disuse ingulph p     which by degrees became so difficult and obsolete that few beside the oldest men could understand the characters ibid p    sub ann  0    in the year  0   wolstan bishop of worcester was deposed by the arbitray normans it was objected against him that he was a superannuated english idiot who could not speak french matt paris sub ann  it is true that in some of the monasteries particularly at croyland and tavistocke founded by saxon princes there were regular preceptors in the saxon language but this institution was suffered to remain after the conquest as a matter only of interest and necessity the religious could not otherwise have understood their original charters williams successor henry the first gave an instrument of confirmation to william archbishop of canterbury which was written in the saxon language and letters h wharton auctar histor dogmat p     the learned mabillon is mistaken in asserting that the saxon way of writing was entirely abolished in england at the time of the norman conquest see mabillon de re diplomat p    the french antiquaries are fond of this notion there are saxon characters in herbert losingas charter for founding the church of norwich temp will ruf a d    0 see lambardes diction v norwich see also hickes thesaur i par i p     see also praefat p xvi an intermixture of the saxon character is common in english and latin manuscripts before the reign of edward the third but of a few types only  yet this is almost a single example that monarchs motive was perhaps political and he seems to have practiced this expedient with a view of obliging his queen who was of saxon lineage or with a design of flattering his english subjects and of securing his title already strengthened by a saxon match in consequence of so specious and popular an artifice it was a common and indeed a very natural practice for the transcribers of saxon books to change the saxon orthography for the norman and to substitute in the place of the original saxon norman words and phrases a remarkable instance of this liberty which sometimes perplexes and misleads the critics in anglosaxon literature appears in a voluminous collection of saxon homilies preserved in the bodleian library and written about the time of henry the second mss bodl ne f      cod membran fol  it was with the saxon characters as with the signature of the cross in public deeds which were changed into the norman mode of seals and subscriptions yet some norman charters have the cross  the saxon was probably spoken in the country yet not without various adulterations from the french the courtly language was french yet perhaps with some vestiges of the vernacular saxon but the nobles in the reign of henry the second constantly sent their children into france let they should contract habits of barbarism in their speech which could not have been avoided in an english education gervas tilbur de otiis imperial mss bibl bodl lib iii see du chesne iii p      robert holcot a learned dominican friar confesses that in the beginning of the reign of edward the third there was no institution of children in the old english he complains that they first learned the french and from the french the latin language this he observes to have been a practice introduced by the conqueror and to have remained ever since lect in libr sapient lect ii paris       to  there is a curious passage relating to this subject in trevisas translation of hygdens polychronicon x lib i cap    mss coll s johan cantabr but i think it is printed by caxton and wynkyn de word robert of gloucester who wrote about    0 says much the same edit hearne p      children in scole agenst the usage and manir of all other

three hundred and four score and five and of the second king richard after the conquest nine and in all the grammere scoles of engelond children lereth frensche and construeth and lerneth an englische etc about the same time or rather before the students of our universities were ordered to converse in french or latin in the statutes of oriel college in oxford it is ordered that the scholars or fellows siqua inter se proferant colloquio latino vel saltem gallico perfruantur see hearnes trokelowe page     these statutes were given    maii a d      i find much the same injunction in the statutes of exeter college oxford given about    0 where they are ordered to use romano aut gallico saltem sermon hearnes mss collect number     page    bibl bodl but in merton college statutes mention is made of the latin only in cap x they were given      this was also common in the greater monasteries in the register of wykeham bishop of winchester the domicellus of the prior of s swythins at winchester is ordered to address the bishop on a certain occasion in french a d      registr par iii fol      the latter was much affected by the normans all the norman accounts were in latin the plan of the great royal revenuerolls now called the piperolls were of their construction and in that language but from the declension of the barons and prevalence of the commons most of whom were of english ancestry the native language of england gradually gained ground till at length the interest of the commons o far succeeded with edward the third that an act of parliament was passed appointing all pleas and proceedings of law to be carried on in english but the french formularies and terms of law and particularly the french feudal phraseology had taken too deep root to be thus hastily abolished hence long after the reign of edward the third many of our lawyers composed their tracts in french and reports and some statutes were made in that language see fortescut de laud leg angl cap xlviii  although the same statute decrees in the true norman spirit that all such pleas and proceedings should be enrolled in latin pultons statut    edw iii this was a d      the first english instrument in rymer is dated      foed vii p      yet this change did not restore either the saxon alphabet or language it abolished a token of subjection and disgrace and in some degree contributed to prevent further french innovations in the language then used which yet remained in a compound state and retained a considerable mixture of foreign phraseology in the mean time it must be remembered that this corruption of the saxon was not only owing to the admission of new words occasioned by the new alliance but to changes of its own forms and terminations arising from reasons which we cannot investigate or explain this subject will be further illustrated in the next section   among the manuscripts of digby in the bodleian library at oxford we find a religious or moral ode consisting of one hundred and ninetyone stanzas which the learned hickes places just after the conquest ling vett these part i p     there is another copy not mentioned by hickes in jesus college library at oxford mss    infr citat this is entitled tractatus guidam in anglico the digby manuscript has no title  but as it contains few norman terms i am inclined to think it of rather higher antiquity in deference however to so great an authority i am obliged to mention it here and especially as it exhibits a regular lyric strophe of four lines the second and fourth of which rhyme together although these four lines may be perhaps resolved into two alexandrines a measure concerning which more will be said hereafter and of which it will be sufficient to remark at present that it appears to have been used very early for i cannot recollect any strophes of this sort in the elder runic or saxon poetry nor in any of the old frankish poems particularly of otfrid a monk of weissenburgh who turned the evangelical history into frankish verse about the ninth century and has left several hymns in that language see petr lambec comment de bibl caesar vindebon page          of stricker who celebrated the achievements of charlemagne see petr lambec ubi supr lib ii cap   there is a circumstance belonging to the ancient frankish versification which as it greatly illustrates the subject of alliteration deserves notice here otfrids dedication of his evangelical history to lewis the first king of the oriental france consists of four lined stanzas in rhyming couplets but the first and last line of every stanzas begin and end with the same letter and the letters of the title of the dedication respectively and the word of the last line of every tetrastic flaccus illyrius published this work of otfrid at basil      but i think it has been since more correctly printed by johannes schilterus it was written about the year   0 otfrid was the disciple of rhabanus maurus  and of the anonymous author of the metrical life of anno archbishop of cologn the following stanza is a specimen st xiv   send god biforen him man the hile he may to heuene for betere is on elmesse biforen danne ben after euene this is perhaps the true reading from the trinity manuscript at cambridge written about the reign of henry the second or richard the first cod membran  vo tractat i see abr wheloc eccles hist bed p        send god biforen him man the while he may to hevene for betere is on elmesse biforen thanne ben after sevene mss digb a   membran  that is let a man send his good works before him to heaven while he can for one almsgiving before death is of more value than seven afterward the verses perhaps might have been thus written as two alexandrines send god biforen him man the while he may to hevene for betere is on alms biforen than ben after sevene as i recollect the whole poem is thus exhibited in the trinity manuscript  yet alternate rhyming applied without regularity and as rhymes accidentally presented themselves was not uncommon in our early poetry as will appear from other examples  hickes has printed a satire on the monastic profession which clearly exemplifies the saxon adulterated by the norman and was evidently written soon after the conquest at least before the reign of henry the second the poet begins with describing the land of indolence or luxury  fur in see by west spaynge is a land ihote cokaygne there nis land under hevenriche heaven sax  of well of godnis hit iliche thoy paradis by miri merry cheerful although paradise is cheerful

there nis met bot fruit there nis halle bure buttry  no bench but watir manis thurst to quench etc in the following lines there is a vein of satirical imagination and some talent at description the luxury of the monks is represented under the idea of a monastery constructed of various kinds of delicious and costly viands  there is a well fair abbei of white monks and of grei there beth boures

saint margaret the structure of its versification considerably differs from that in the lastmentioned piece and is like the french alexandrines but i am of opinion that a pause or division was intended in the middle of every verse and in this respect its versification resembles also that of albions england or draytons polyolbion which was a species very common about the reign of queen elisabeth it is worthy of remark that we find in the collection of ancient northern monuments published by m biorner a poem of some length said by that author to have been composed in the twelfth or thirteenth century this poem is professedly in rhyme and the measure like that of the heroic alexandrine of the french poetry see mallets introd dannem etc chapter xiii  the rhymes are also continued

which we call alexandrine accidentally assumed their form merely from the practice of absurd transcribers who frugally chose to fill their pages to the extremity and violated the metrical structure for the sake of saving their vellum it is certain that the common stanza of four short lines may be reduced into two alexandrines and on the contrary i have before observed that the saxon poem cited by hickes consisting of one hundred and ninety one stanzas is written in stanzas in the bodleian and in alexandrines in the trinity manuscript at cambridge how it came originally from the poet i will not pretend to determine  our early poetry often appears in satirical pieces on the established and eminent professions and the writers as we have already seen succeeded not amiss when they clothed their satire in allegory but nothing can be conceived more scurrilous and illiberal than their satires when they descend to mere invective in the british museum among other examples which i could mention we have a satirical ballad on the lawyers mss ut sup f  0 b  and another on the clergy or rather some particular bishop the latter begins thus  hyrdmen hatieth ant vch mones hyne for ever uch a parosshe heo polketh in pyne ant clastreth wife heore celle nou wol vch fol clerc that is fayly wend to the bishop ant bugge bailey nys no wit in is nolle ibid f     the elder french poetry abounds in allegorical satire and i doubt not that the author of the satire on the monastic profession cited above copied some french satire on the subject satire was one species of the poetry of the provencial troubadours anselm fayditt a troubadour of the eleventh century who will again be mentioned wrote a sort of satirical drama called the heresy of the fathers heregia del preyres a ridicule on the council which condemned the albigenses the papal legates often fell under the lash of these poets whose favor they were obliged to court but in vain by the promise of ample gratuities fontenelle hist theatr fr p    dit       hugues de bercy a french monk wrote in the twelfth century a very lively and severe satire in which no person not even himself was spared and which he called the bible as containing nothing but truth see fauchett rec p       in the harleian manuscripts i find an ancient french poem yet respecting england which is a humorous panegyric on a new religious order called le order de bell eyse this is the exordium  qui vodra a moi entendre oyr purra e aprendre lestoyre de un order novel qe mout est delitous bell the poet ingeniously feigns that his new monastic order consists of the most eminent nobility and gentry of both sexes who inhabit the monasteries assigned to it promiscuously and that no person is excluded from this establishment who can support the rank of a gentleman they are bound by their statutes to live in perpetual idleness and luxury and the satyrist refers them for a pattern or rule of practice in these important articles to the monasteries of sempringham in lincolnshire beverley in yorkshire the knights hospitalers and many other religious orders then flourishing in england mss ibid f       when we consider the feudal manners and the magnificence of our norman ancestors their love of military glory the enthusiasm with which they engaged in the crusades and the wonders to which they must have been familiarised from those eastern enterprises we naturally suppose what will hereafter be more particularly proved that their retinues abounded with minstrels and harpers and that their chief entertainment was to listen to the recital of romantic and martial adventures but i have been much disappointed in my searches after the metrical tales which must have prevailed in their times most of those old heroic songs are perished together with the stately castles in whose halls they were sung yet they are not so totally lost as we may be apt to imagine many of them still partly exist in the old english metrical romances which will be mentioned in their proper places yet divested of their original form polished in their style adorned with new incidents successively modernised by repeated transcription and recitation and retaining little more than the outlines of the original composition this has not been the case of the legendary and other religious poems written soon after the conquest manuscripts of which abound in our libraries from the nature of their subject they were less popular and common and being less frequently recited became less liable to perpetual innovation or alteration  the most ancient english metrical romance which i can discover is entitled the geste of king horn it was evidently written after the crusades had begun is mentioned by chaucer rim thop   0  urr  and probably still remains in its original state i will first give the substance of the story and afterward add some specimens of the composition but i must premise that this story occurs in very old french meter in the manuscripts of the british museum mss harl     b f    cod membr  so that probably it is a translation a circumstance which will throw light on an argument pursued hereafter proving that most of our metrical romances are translated from the french  mury king of the saracens lands in the kingdom of suddene where he kills the king named allof the queen godylt escapes but mury seizes on her son horn a beautiful youth aged fiteen years and puts him into a galley with two of his playfellows achulph and fykenyld the vessel being driven on the coast of the kingdom of westnesse the young prince is found by aylmar king of that country brought to court and delivered to athelbrus his steward to be educated in hawking harping tilting and other courtly accomplishments here the princess rymenild falls in love with him declares her passion and is betrothed horn in consequence of this engagement leaves the princess for seven years to demonstrate according to the ritual of chivalry that by seeking and accomplishing dangerous enterprises he deserved her affection he proves a most valorous and invincible knight and at the end of seven years having killed king mury recovered his fathers kingdom and achieved many signal exploits recovers the princess rymenild from the hands of his treacherous knight and companion fykenyld carries her in triumph to his own country and there reigns with her in great splendour and prosperity the poem itself begins and proceeds thus  all heo ben blythe that to my song ylythe listen  a song yet ulle ou singe of alloff the god king king he was by weste

xxxiv the title hornchilde and maiden rinivel the beginning mi leve friend dear harken and ye shall here       it is the force of the story in these pieces that chiefly engages our attention the minstrels had no idea of conducting and describing a delicate situation the general manners were gross and the arts of writing unknown yet this simplicity sometimes pleases more than the most artificial touches in the mean time the pictures of ancient manners presented by these early writers strongly interest the imagination especially as having the same uncommon merit with the pictures of manners in homer that of being founded in truth and reality and actually painted from the life to talk of the grossness and absurdity of such manners is little to the purpose the poet is only concerned in the justness and faithfulness of the representation  sect ii hitherto we have been engaged in examining the state of our poetry from the conquest to the year   00 or rather afterward it will appear to have made no very rapid improvement from that period yet as we proceed we shall find the language losing much of its ancient barbarism and obscurity and approaching more nearly to the dialect of modern times  in the latter end of the reign of henry the third a poem occurs the date of which may be determined with some degree of certainty it is a satirical song or ballad written by one of the adherents of simon de montfort earl of leicester a powerful baron soon after the battle of jews which was fought in the year      and proved very fatal to the interests of the king in this decisive action richard king of the romans his brother henry the third and prince edward with many others of the royal party were taken prisoners  i sits all stille ant herkeneth to me the king of

influence in encouraging leicesters partisans and diffusing his fction there is some humor in imagining that richard supposed the windmill to which he retreated to be a fortification and that he believed the sails of it to be military engines in the manuscript from which this specimen is transcribed immediately follows a song in french seemingly written by the same poet on the battle of evesham fought the following year in which leicester was killed and his rebellious barons defeated f    it begins  chaunter mestoit mon ever le voit en un dure langage tut en pluraunt fust fet le chaunt de noitre duz baronage etc   our poet looks upon his hero as a martyr and particularly laments the loss of henry his son and hugh le despenser justiciry of england he concludes with an english stanza much in the style and spirit of those just quoted  a learned and ingenious writer in a work which places the study of the law in a new light and proves it to be an entertaining history of manners has observed that this ballad on richard of alemaigne probably occasioned a statute against libels in the year      under the title against slanderous reports or tales to cause discord betwixt king and people observations upon the statutes chiefly the more ancient etc edit      p     that this spirit was growing to an extravagance which deserved to be checked we shall have occasion to bring further proofs  i must not pass over the reign of henry the third who died in the year      without observing that this monarch entertained in his court a poet with a certain salary whose name was henry de avranches see carews surv cornw p    edit   0   and although this poet was a frenchman and most probably wrote in french yet this first instance of an officer who was afterward yet with sufficient impropriety denominated a poet laureate in the english court deservedly claims particular notice in the course of these annals he is called master henry the versifier henry of huntingdon says that walo versificator wrote a panegyric on henry the first and that the same walo versificator wrote a poem on the park which that king made at woodstock apud lelands collectan vol ii  0  i     edit    0 perhaps he was in the department of henry mentioned in the text one gualo a latin poet who flourished about this time is mentioned by bale iii   and pitts p     he is commended in the policraticon a copy of his latin hexametrical satire on the monks is printed by mathias flacius among miscellaneous latin poems de corrupto ecclesiae statu p     basil      oct  which appellation perhaps implies a different character from the royal minstrel or joculator the kings treasurers are ordered to pay this master henry one hundred shillings which i suppose to have been a years stipend in the year      magistro henrico versificatori see madox hist excheq p      and again the same precept occurs under the year      ibid p     in mss digb bibl bodl i find in john of hovedens salutationes quinquaginta mariae mag henricus versificator magnus de b virgin etc  our master henry it seems had in some of his verses reflected on the rusticity of the cornish men this insult was resented in a latin satire now remaining written by michael blaunpayne a native of cornwall and recited by the author in the presence of hugh abbot of westminster hugh de mortimer oicial of the archbishop of canterbury the bishop elect of winchester and the bishop of rochester mss bibl bodl arch bodl    in pergam  to viz versus magistri michaelis cornubinsis contra mag henricum abricensem

hexameters and pentameters viz fol    camden cites other latin verses of michael blaunpain whom he calls merry michael the cornish poet rem p  0 see also p     edit      he wrote many other latin pieces both in prose and verse    while we are speaking of the versifier of henry the third it will not be foreign to add that in the thirtysixth year of the same king forty shillings and one pipe of wine were given to richard the kings harper and one pipe of wine to beatrice his wife rot pip an    henr iii et in uno dolio vini empto et dato magistro ricardo citharistae regis xl sol per br reg et in uno dolio empto et dato beatrici uxori ejusdem ricardi  but why this gratuity of a pipe of wine should also be made to the wife as well as to the husband who from his profession was a genial character appears problematical according to our present ideas  the first poet whose name occurs in the reign of edward the first and indeed in these annals is robert of gloucester a monk of the abbey of gloucester he has left a poem o considerable length which is a history of england in verse from brutus to the reign of edward the first it was evidently written after the year      as the poet mentions king arthurs sumptuous tomb erected in that year before the high altar of glastenbury church page     edit hearne oxon       and he declares himself a living witness of the remakably dismal weather which distinguished the day on which the battle of evesham abovementioned was fought in the year      page   0  from these and other circumstances this piece appears to have been composed about the year    0 it is exhibited in the manuscripts is cited by many antiquaries and printed by hearne in the alexandrine measure but with equal probability might have been written in fourlined stanzas this rhyming chronicle is totally destitute of art or imagination the author has clothed the fables of geoffrey of monmouth in rhyme which have often a more poetical air in geoffreys prose the language is not much more easy or intelligible than that of many of the norman saxon poems quoted in the preceding section it is full of saxonisms which indeed abound more or less in every writer before gower and chaucer but this obscurity is perhaps owing to the western dialect in which our monk of gloucester was educated provincial barbarisms are naturally the growth of extreme counties and of such as are situated at a distance from the metropolis and it is probable that the saxon heptarchy which consisted of a cluster of seven independent states contributed to produce as many different provincial dialects in the mean time it is to be considered that writers of all ages and languages have their affectations and singularities which occasion in each a peculiar phraseology  robert of

vero invisus ille et velut quercus ventorum viribus eradicata cum maximo sonitu corruit it is difficult to determine which is most blameable the poetical historian or the prosaic poet  it was a tradition invented by the old fablers that giants brought the stones of stonehenge from the most sequestered deserts of africa and placed them in ireland that every stone was washed with juices of herbs and contained a medical power and that merlin the magician at the request of king arthur transported them from ireland and erected them in circles on the plain of amesbury as a sepulchral monument for the britons treacherously slain by hengist this fable is thus delivered without decoration by robert of gloucester  sire king quoth merlin tho such things y wis ne bethe for to schewe

erected in memory of hengists maacre rests i believe on the sole evidence of geoffry of monmouth who had it from the british bards but why should not the testimony of the british bards be allowed on this occasion for they did not invent facts so much as fables in the present case hengists massacre in an allowed event remove all the apparent iction and the bards only say that an immense pile of stones was raised on the plain of ambresbury in memory of that event they lived too near the time to forge this origin of stonehenge the whole story was recent and from the immensity of the work itself must have been still more notorious therefore their forgery would have been too glaring it may be objected that they were fond of referring every thing stupendous to their favorite hero arthur this i grant but not when known authenticated facts stood in their way and while the real cause was remembered even to this day the massacre of hengist as i have partly hinted is an undisputed piece of history why should not the other part of the story be equally true besides the silence of nennius i am aware that this hypothesis is still attended with many difficulties and improbabilities and so are all the systems and conjectures ever yet framed about this amazing monument it appears to me to be the work of a rude people who had some ideas of art such as we may suppose the romans left behind them among the britons in the mean time i do not remember that in the very controverted etymology of the word stoneenge the name of hengist has been properly or sufficiently considered  if any thing engages our attention in this passage it is the wildness of the fiction in which however the poet had no share  i will here add arthurs intrigue with ygerne  at the fest of estre tho king send is

the manuscript library of doctor n johnson of pontefract now perhaps dispersed there was a manuscript on vellum containing a history in old english verse from brute to the eighteenth year of edward the second and in that of basil lord denbigh a metrical history in english from the same period to henry he third wanly supposed it to have been of the handwriting of the time of edward the fourth  in a poem commonly entitled roman de rois dangleterre it is esteemed one of the oldest of the french romances and begun to be written by eustace sometimes called eustache wistace or huistace who finished his part under the title of brut dangleterre in the year      hence robert de brunne somewhat inaccurately calls it simply the brut the brut of england a prose chronicle of england sometimes continued as low as henry the sixth is a common manuscript it was at first translated from a french chronicle mss harl  00  to written in the beginning of the reign of edward the third i think it is printed by caxton under the title of fructus temporum the french have a famous ancient prose romance called brut which includes the history of the sangreal i know not whether it is exactly the same in an old

this romance in its ancient and early manuscripts has constantly passed under the name of its finisher wace yet the accurate fauchett cites it by the name of its first author eustace rec p    edit       and at the same time it is extraordinary that robert de brunne in his prologue should not once mention the name of eustace as having any concern in it so soon was the name of the beginner superseded by that of the continuator an ingenious french antiquary very justly supposes that wace took many of his descriptions from that invaluable and singular monument the tapestry of the norman conquest

robert de brunnes chronicle beginning from cadwallader and ending with edward the first is translated in great measure from the second part of a french metrical chronicle written in five books by

is called romance the latin tongue ceased to be spoken in france about the ninth century and was succeeded by what was called the romance tongue a mixture of frankish and bad latin hence the first poems in that language are called romans or romants essay on pope p     in the following passages of this chronicle where robert de brunne mentions romance he sometimes means langtots french book from

possessed much more industry than genius and cannot at present be read with much pleasure yet it should be remembered that even such a writer as robert de brunne uncouth and unpleasing as he naturally seems and chiefly employed in turning the theology of his age into rhyme contributed to form a style to teach expression and to polish his native tongue in the infancy of language and composition nothing is wanted but writers at that period even the most artless have their use  robert grosthead bishop of lincoln see diss ii  the author and translator are often thus confounded in manuscripts to an old english religious poem on the holy virgin we find the following title incipit quidm cantus quem compouit frater thoms de hales de ordine fratrum minorum etc mss coll jes oxon    supr citat but

the french minstrels in whose language he has left a poem never printed of some length this was probably translated into english rhyme about the reign of edward the first nor is it quite improbable if the translation was made at this period that the translator was robert de brunne especially as he translated another of grostheads pieces it is called by leland chateau damour script brit p      but in one of the bodleian manuscripts of this book we have the following title romance par mestre robert grosseteste mss bodl ne d     in another it is called ce est la vie de d jhu de sa humanite fet a

a religious allegory and under the ideas of chivalry the fundamental articles of christian belief are represented it has the air of a system of divinity written by a troubadour the poet in describing the advent of christ supposes that he entered into a magnificent castle which is the body of the immaculate virgin the structure of this castle is conceived with some imagination and drawn with the pencil of romance the poem begins with these lines  ki pense ben ben peut dire sanz penser ne poet suffice de null bon our commencer deu nos dont de li penser de ki par ki en ki sont tos les biens ki

afterward the fountain is explained to be gods grace charity is constable of the caste etc etc  it was undoubtedly a great impediment to the cultivation and progressive improvement of the english language at these early periods that the best authors chose to write in french many of robert grostheads pieces are indeed in latin yet where the subject was popular and not immediately addressed to learned readers he adopted the romance or french language in preference to his native english of this as we have already seen his manuel peche and his chateau d amor are sufficient proofs both in prose and verse and his example and authority must have had considerable influence in encouraging this practice peter langtoft our augustine canon of bridlington not only compiled the large chronicle of england above recited in french but even translated herbert boscams latin life of thomas of beckett into french rhymes pits p   0 append who with great probability supposes him to have been an

and johanne two ladies of gallantry in various parts of england and ireland particularly at winchester and pontefract f    b the curious reader is also referred to a french poem in which the poet supposes that a minstrel jugleour traveling from london clothed in a rich tabard met the king and his retinue the king asks him many questions particularly his lords name and the price of his horse the minstrel evades all the kings questions by impertinent answers and at last presumes to give his majesty advice ibid f  0  b    yet this fashion proceeded rather from necessity and a principle of convenience than from affectation the vernacular english as i have before remarked was rough and unpolished and although these writers possessed but few ideas of taste and elegance they embraced a foreign tongue almost equally familiar and in which they could convey their sentiments with greater ease grace and propriety it should also be considered that our most eminent scholars received a part of their education at the university of paris another and a very material circmstance concurred to countenance this fashionable practice of composing in french it procured them readers of rank and distinction the english court for more than two hundred years after the conquest was totally french and our kings either from birth kindred or marriage and from a perpetual intercourse seem to have been more closely connected with france than with england it was however fortunate that these french pieces were written as some of them met with their translators who perhaps unable to aspire to the praise of original writers at least by this means contributed to adorn their native tongue and who very probably would not have written at all had not original writers i mean their cotemporaries who wrote in french furnished them with models and materials  hearne to whose diligence even the poetical antiquarian is much obliged but whose conjectures are generally wrong imagines that the old english metrical romance called richard cuer de lion was written by robert de brunne it is at least probable that the leisure of monastic life produced many rhymers from proofs here given we may fairly conclude that the monks often wrote for the minstrels and although our gilbertine brother of brunne chose to relate true stories in plain language yet it is reasonable to suppose that many of our ancient tales in verse containing fictitious adventures were written although not invented in the religious houses the romantic history of guy earl of warwick is expressly said on good authority to have been written by walter of exeter a franciscan friar of carocus in cornwall about the year      carews surv cornw p    edit ut supr i suppose carew means the metrical romance of guy but bale

immediately after his death the author unknown p   land pr for t davies      octavo but this piece which has great merit could not have been written till some centuries afterward from the classical allusions and general color of the phraseology to say nothing more it with greater probability belongs to henry the eighth it escaped me till just before this work went to press that dr percy had printed this elegy ball ii    that the pope should here pronounce the funeral panegyric of edward the first is by no means surprising if we consider the predominant ideas of the age and in the true spirit of these ideas the poet makes this illustrious monarchs achievements in the holy land his principal and leading topic but there is a particular circumstance alluded to in these stanzas relating to the crusading character of edward together with its consequences which needs explanation edward in the decline of life had vowed a second expedition to jerusalem but finding his end approach in his last moments he devoted the prodigious sum of thirty thousand pounds to provide one hundred and forty knights the poet says eighty  who should carry his heart into palestine but this appointment of the dying king was never executed our elegist and the chroniclers impute the crime of witholding so pious a legacy to the advice of the king of france whose daughter isabel was married to the succeeding king but it is more probable to suppose that edward the second and his profligate minion piers gaveston dissipated the money in their luxurious and expensive pleasures  sect iii we have seen in the preceding section that the character of our poetical composition began to be changed about the reign of the first edward that either fictitious adventures were substituted by the minstrels in the place of historical and traditionary facts or reality disguised by the misrepresentations of invention and that a taste for ornamental and even exotic expression gradually prevailed over the rude simplicity of the native english phraseology this change which with our language affected our poetry had been growing for some time and among other causes was occasioned by the introduction and increase of the tales of chivalry  the ideas of chivalry in an imperfect degree had been of old established among the gothic tribes the fashion of challenging to single combat the pride of seking dangerous adventures and the spirit of avenging and protecting the fair sex seem to have been peculiar to the northern nations in the most uncultivated state of europe all these customs were afterward encouraged and confirmed by corresponding circumstances in the feudal constitution at length the crusades excited a new spirit of enterprise and introduced into the courts and ceremonies of european princes a higher degree of splendour and parade caught from the riches and magnificence of eastern cities i cannot help transcribing here a curious passage from old fauchett he is speaking of louis the young king of france about the year    0 le quel fut le premier roy de sa maison qui monstra dehors ses richesses allant en jerusalem aussi la france commenca de son temps a sembellir de bastimens plus magniiques prendre plaisir a pierrieres et autres delicatesses goustus en lvant par luy ou les seigneurs qui avoient ja fait ce voyage de sort quon peut dire quil a este le premier tenant cour de grand roy estant si magnifique que sa femme dedaignant la simplicite de ses predecesseurs luy fit elever une sepulture dargent au lieu de pierre recueil de la lang et poes fr chapter viii p    edit      he adds that a great number of french romances were composed about this period  these oriental expeditions established a taste for hyperbolical description and propagated an infinity of mavelous tales which men returning from distant countries easily imposed on credulous and ignorant minds the unparalleled emulation with which the nations of christendom universally embraced this holy cause the pride with which emperors kings barons earls bishops and knights strove to excel each other on this interesting occasion not only in prowess and heroism but in sumptuous equipages gorgeous banners armorial cognisances splendid pavilions and other expensive articles of a similar nature diffused a love of war and a fondness for military pomp hence their very diversions became warlike and the martial enthusiasm of the times appeared in tilts and tournaments these practices and opinions cooperated with the kindred superstitions of dragons see kirchers mund subterran viii   he mentions a knight of rhodes made grand master of the order for killing a dragon       dwarfs fairies giants and enchanters which the traditions of the gothic scalders had already planted and produced that extraordinary species of composition which has been called romance  before these expeditions into the east became fashionable the principal and leading subjects of the old fablers were the achievements of king arthur with his knights of the round table and of charlemagne with his twelve peers but in the romances written after the holy war a new set of champions of conquests and of countries were introduced trebizonde took place of rouncevalles and godfrey of bulloigne solomon nouraddin the caliphs the souldans and the cities of egypt and syria became the favorite topics the troubadours of provence an idle and unsettled race of men took up arms and followed their barons in prodigious multitudes to the conquest of jerusalem they made a considerable part of the household of the nobility of france louis the seventh king of france not only entertained them at his court very liberally but commanded a considerable company of them into his retinue when he took ship for palestine that they might solace him with their songs during the dangers and inconveniences of so long a voyage velley hist fr sub an       the ancient chronicles of france mention legions de poets as embarking in this wonderful enterprise massieu hist poes fr p  0  many of the troubadours whose works now exist and whose names are recorded accompanied their lords to the holy war some of the french nobility of the first rank were troubadours about the eleventh century and the french critics with much triumph observe that it is the glory of the french poetry to number counts and dukes that is sovereigns among its professors from its commencement what a glory the worshipful company of merchanttaylors in london if i recollect right boast the names of many dukes earls and princes enrolled in their community this is indeed an honor to that otherwise respectable society but poets can derive no luster from counts and dukes or even princes who have been enrolled in their lists only in proportion as they have adorned the art by the excellence of their compositions  here a new and more copious source of fabling was opened in these expeditions they picked up numberless extravagant stories and at their return enriched romance with an infinite variety of oriental scenes and fictions thus these later wonders in some measure supplanted the former they had the recommendation of novelty and gained still more attention as they came from a greater distance the old french historian mezeray goes so far as to derive the origin of the french poetry and romances from the crusades hist p           in the mean time we should recollect that the saracens or arabians the same people which were the object of the crusades had acquired an establishmnt in spain about the ninth century and that by means of this earlier intercourse many of their fictions and fables together with their literature must have been known in europe before the christian armies invaded asia it is for this reason the elder spanish romances have professedly more arabian allusions than any other cervantes makes the imagined writer of don quixotes history an arabian yet exclusive of their domestic and more immediate connection with this eastern people the spaniards from temper and constitution were extravagantly fond of chivalrous exercises some critics have supposed that spain having learned the art or fashion of romancewriting from their naturalised guests the arabians communicated it at an early period to the rest of europ hut in some measure adopts this opinion but that learned man was a very incompetent judge of these matters under the common term romance he confounds romancs of chivalry romances of gallantry and all the fables of the provencial poets what can we think of a writer who having touched upon the gothic romances at whose ictions and barbarisms he is much shocked talks of the cosummate dgr of art and elegance to which the french are at present arrived in romances he adds that the superior refinemnt and politess of the french gallantry has happily given them an advantage of shining in thi species of composition hist romans p     but the sophistry and ignorance of huets treatise has been already detected and exposed by a critic of another cast in the supplement to jarviss preface prefixed to the translation of don quixot   it has been imagined that the first romances were composed in meter and sung to the harp by the poets of provence at fstival solemnities but an ingenious frenchman who has made deep researches into this sort of literature attempts to prove that this mode of reciting romantic adventures was in high reputation among the natives of normandy above a century before the troubadours of provence who are generally supposed to have led the way to the poets of italy spain and france commenced about the year      mons l eveque de la ravalerie in his revolutions de langue francoise a la suite des poesies du roi de navarre  if the critic means to insinuate that the french troubadours acquired their art of versifying from these norman bards this reasoning will favor the system of those who contend that metrical romances lineally took their rise from the historical odes of the scandinavian scalds for the normans were a branch of the scandinavian stock but fauchett at the same time that he allows the normans to have been fond of chanting the praises of their heroes in verse expressly ce que les normans avoyent pris des francois rec live i p  0 edit      pronounces that they borrowed this practice from the franks or french  it is not my business nor is it of much consequence to discuss this obscure point which properly belongs to the french antiquaries i therefore proceed to observe that our richard the first who began his reign in

chroniclers concerning richards kill in the minstrel art which i will here relate  richard in his return from the crusade was taken prisoner about the year      a whole year elapsed before the english knew where their monarch was imprisoned blondell de nesle richards favorite instrel resolved to find out his lord and after traveling many days without success at last came to a castle where richard was detained in custody here he found that the castle belonged to the duke of austria and that a king was there imprisoned suspecting that the prisoner was his master he found means to place himself directly before a window of the chamber where the king was kept and in this situation began to sing a french chanson which richard and blondell had formerly written together when the king heard the song he knew it was blondell who sung it and when blondell paused after the first half of the song the king began the other half and completed it on this blondell returned home to england and acquainted richards barons with the place of his imprisonment from which he was soon afterward released see also fauchett rec p    richard lived long in provence where he acquired a taste for their

these gratuities were chiefly arms clothes horses and sometimes money  these poets imported into england a great multitude of their tales and songs which before or about the reign of edward the second became familiar and popular among our ancestors who were sufficiently acquainted with the french language the most early notice of a professed book of chivalry in england as it should seem appears under the reign of henry the third and is a curious and evident proof of the reputation and esteem in which this sort of composition was held at that period in the revenueroll of the twentyfirst year of that king there is an entry of the expense of silver clasps and studs for the kings great book of romances this was in the year      but i will give the article in its original dress et in

highly probable that it contained the romance of richard the first on which i shall enlarge below at least the victorious achievements of that monarch were so famous in the reign of henry the second as to be made the subject of a picture in the royal palace of clarendon near salisbury a circumstance which likewise appears from the same ancient record under the year      et in camera regis subtus

england about this time but translations of these pieces were made into english which containing much of the french idiom together with a sort of poetical phraseology before unknown produced various innovations in our style these translations it is probable were enlarged with additions or improved with alterations of the story hence it was that robert de brunne as we have already seen complained of strange and quaint english of the changes made in the story of sir tristram and of the liberties assumed by his cotemporary minstrels in altering facts and coining new phrases yet these circumstances enriched our tongue and extended the circle of our poetry and for what reason these fables were so much admired and encouraged in preference to the languid poetical chronicles of robert of gloucester and robert of brunne it is obvious to conjecture the gallantries of chivalry were exhibited with new splendor and the times were growing more refined the norman fashions were adopted even in wales in the year      a splendid carousal after the manner of the normans was given by a welsh prince this was rhees ap gryffyth king of south wales who at christmas made a great feast in the

departed discontented and among deeds of arms and other shows rhees caused all the poets of wales in illustration of the argument pursued in the text we may observe that about this time the english

england by richard it is natural to suppose that some of them made their magnificent and heroic patron a principal subject of their compositions fayditt is said to have written a chant sunebre on his death beauchamps ib p  0  and this subject by means of the constant communication between both nations probably became no less fashionable in france especially if we take into the account the general popularity of richards character his love of chivalry his gallantry in the crusades and the favors which he so liberally conferred on the minstrels of that country we have a romance now remaining in

achievements were adorned with fiction and fable if not a superstitious belief of the times it was an hyperbolical invention started by the minstrels which soon grew into a tradition and is gravely recorded by the chroniclers that richard carried with him to the crusades king arthurs celebrated sword caliburn and that he presented it as a gift or relic of inestimable value to tancred king of

classical origin which constantly supplied materials to the writers of romance i shall speak of these authors with their subjects distinctly  but i do not mean to repeat here what has been already observed see diss i concerning the writings of geoffry of monmouth and turpin it will be sufficient to say at present that these two fabulous historians recorded the achievements of charlemagne and of arthur and that turpins history was artfully forged under the name of that archbishop about the year    0 with a design of giving countenance to the crusades from the example of so high an authority as charlemagne whose pretended visit to the holy sepulcher is described in the twentieth chapter  as to the siege of troy it appears that both homers poems were unknown at least not understood in europe from the abolition of literature by the goths in the fourth century to the fourteenth geoffry of monmouth indeed who wrote about the year    0 a man of learning for that age produces homer in attestation of a fact asserted in his history but in such a manner as shows that he knew little more than homers name and was but imperfectly acquainted with homers subject geoffry says that brutus having ravaged the province of acquitain with fire and sword came to a place where the city of tours now stands as homer testifies l i chapter     but the trojan story was still kept alive in two latin pieces which passed under the names of dares phrygius and dictys cretensis daress history of the destruction of troy as it was called pretended to have been translated from the greek of dares

about the time of nero and to have been composed by dictys a cretan and a soldier in the trojan war the fraud of discovering copies of books in this extraordinary manner in order to infer from thence their high and indubitable antiquity so frequently practiced betrays itself but that the present latin dictys had a greek original now lost appears from the numerous grecisms with which it abounds and from the literal correspondence of many passages with the greek fragments of one dictys cited by ancient authors the greek original was very probably forged under the name of dictys a traditionary

subject written by raoul le feure chaplain to the duke of burgundy in the year      and partly translated into english prose in the year      by caxton under the title of the recuyel of the histories of troy at the request of margaret duchess of burgundy and that from caxtons book afterward modernised shakespeare borrowed his drama of troilus and cressida the western nations in early times have been fond of deducing their origin from troy this tradition seems to be couched under odins original emigration from that part of asia which is connected with phrygia asgard or asias ortrss was the city from which odin led his colony and by some it is called troy to this place also they supposed odin to return after his death where he was to receive those who died in battle in a hall roofed with glittering shields see bartholin l ii cap   p  0   0  seq this hall says the edda is in the city of asgard which is called the fild of ida bartholin ibid in the very sublime ode on the dissolution of

of the eddic mythology who lived a d  0 0 finding that the britons and francs drew their descent from troy was ambitious of assigning the same boasted origin to odin but this tradition appears to have been older than the edda and it is more probable that the britons and francs borrowed it from the scandinavian goths and adapted it to themselves unless we suppose that these nations i mean the former were branches of the gothic stem which gave them a sort of inherent right to the claim this reasoning may perhaps account for the early existence and extraordinary popularity of the trojan story among nations ignorant and illiterate who could only have received it by tradition geoffry of monmouth took this descent of the britons from troy from the welsh or armoric bards and they perhaps had it in common with the scandinavian scalders there is not a syllable of it in the authentic historians of england who wrote before him particularly those ancient ones bid gildas and the uninterpolated

high veneration even long before that period and it should at the same time be remembered that the saxons came from scandinavia  this fable of the descent of the britons from the trojans was solemnly

seq in some of the manuscripts of this piece which i have seen there is an account of alexanders visit to the trees of the sun and moon but i do not recollect this in the printed copies undoubtedly the original has had both interpolations and omissions pseudogorionides abovementioned seems to hint at the groundwork of this history of alexander in the following passage caeteras autem res ab

abound with the most incredible fictions and traditions concerning alexander the great which they probably borrowed and improved from the persians they call him escander if i recollect right one of the miracles of this romance is our heros horn it is said that alexander gave the signal to his whole army by a wonderful horn of immense magnitude which might be heard at the distance of sixty miles and that it was blown or sounded by sixty men at once it is also in a manuscript entitled secretum secretorum aristotelis lib   mss bodl d     this treatise ascribed to aristotle was anciently in high repute it is pretended to have been translated out of greek into arabic or chaldee by one john a spaniard from thence into latin by philip a frenchman at length into english verse by lidgate under whom more will be said of it i think the latin is dedicated to theophina a queen of spain  this is the horn which orlando won from the giant jatmund and which as turpin and the islandic bards report was endued with magical power and might be heard at the distance of twenty miles cervantes says that it was bigger than a massy beam see observat fair qu i v p  0   boyardo berni and ariosto have all such a horn and the fiction is here traced to its original source but in speaking of the books which furnished the story of alexander i must not forget that quintus curtius was an admired historian of the romantic ages he is quoted in the policraticon of john of salisbury who died in the year      viii     eneas sylvius relates that alphonsus the ninth king of spain in the thirteenth century a great astronomer endeavored to relieve himself from a tedious malady by reading the bible over fourteen times with all the glosses but not meeting with the expected success he was cured by the consolation he received from once reading quintus curtius op p      peter blesensis archdeacon of london a student at paris about the year    0 mentioning the books most common in the schools declares that he profited much by frequently looking into this author epist  0  frequenter inspicere historias q curtii etc  vincentius bellovacensis cited above a writer of the thirteenth century often quotes curtius in his speculum historiale iv    etc montfaucon i think mentions a manuscript of q curtius in the colbertine library at paris eight hundred years old see barth ad claudian p      alexander benedctus in his history of venice transcribes whole pages from this historian i could give other proofs  he was also early translated into french among the royal manuscripts in the british museum

subject were best known and most esteemed for some centuries  the french to resume the main tenor of our argument had written metrical romances on most of these subjects before or about the year   00 some of these seem to have been formed from prose histories enlarged and improved with new adventures and embellishments from earlier and more simple tales in verse on the same subject chrestien of troys wrote le romans du graal or the adventures of the sangrale which included the deeds of king arthur sir tristram lancelot du lake and the rest of the knights of the round table before      there is a passage in a coeval romance relating to chrestien which proves what i have just advanced that some of these histories previously existed in prose  christians qui intent et pain a rimoyer le

story is so common among the earliest french poets as charlemagne and his twelve peers in the british museum we have an old french manuscript containing the history of charlemagne translated into

by philipes mousques canon and chancellor of the church of tournay it is in fact a chronicle of france but the author who does not choose to begin quite so high as adam and eve nor yet later than the trojan war opens his history with the rape of helen passes on to an ample description of the siege of troy and through an exact detail of all the great events which succeeded conducts his reader to the year    0 this work comprehends all the fictions of turpins charlemagne with a variety of other extravagant stories dispersed in many professed romances but it preserves numberless curious particulars which throw considerable light on historical facts du cange has collected from it all that concerns the french emperors of constantinople which he has printed at the end of his entertaining history of that city  it was indeed the fashion for the historians of these times to form such a general plan as would admit all the absurdities of popular tradition connection of parts and uniformity of subject were as little studied as truth ages of ignorance and superstition are more affected by the mavelous than by plain facts and believe what they find written without discernment or examination no man before the sixteenth century presumed to doubt that the francs derived their oigin from francus a son of hector that the spaniards were descended from japhet the britons from brutus and the scotch from fergus vincent de beauvais who lived under louis the ninth of france and who on account of his extraordinary erudition was appointed preceptor to that kings sons very gravely classes archbishop turpins charlemagne among the real histories and places it on a level with suetonius and caesar he was himself an historian and has left a large history of the world fraught with a variety of reading and of high repute in the middle ages but edifying and entertaining as this work might have been to his cotemporaries at present it serves only to record their prejudices and to characterise their credulity he flourished about    0   hercules and jason as i have before hinted were involved in the trojan story by guido de colonna and hence became familiar to

this hexameter which points out the name of the scribe  nomen scriptoris est thomas plenus amoris then follows the date of the year in which the transcript was completed viz      afterward there is the name and date of the illuminator in the following colophon written in golden letters che livre fu perfais de la enluminiere an xviiio jour davryl par jehan de grise l an de grace m ccc xliii the bishop of gloucester has a most beautiful french manuscript on vellum of mort darthur ornamented in the same manner it was a present from virtue the engraver  hence it may be concluded that the illuminations and paintings of this superb manuscript which were most probably begun as soon as the scribe had finished his part took up six years no long time if we consider the attention of an artist to ornaments so numerous so various so minute and so laboriously touched it has been supposed that before the appearance of this poem the romans or those pieces which celebrated gests were constantly composed in short verses of six or eight syllables and that in this roman d alexandre verses of twelve syllables were first used it has therefore been imagined that the verses called alexandrines the present french heroic measure took their rise from this poem alexander being the hero and alexander the chief of the four poets concerned in the work that the name some centuries afterward might take place in honor of this celebrated and early effort of french poetry i think is very probable but that verses of twelve syllables made their first appearance in this poem is a doctrine which to say no more from examples already produced and examined is at least ambiguous see pref le roman de la rose par mons labbe lenglet i p xxxvi  in this poem gadifer hereafter mentioned

monsters in another place from the same romance he turns astronomer and soars to the moon by the help of four gryphons the caliph is frequently mentioned in this piece and alexander like charlemagne has his twelve peers  these were the four reigning stories of romance on which perhaps english pieces translated from the french existed before or about the year   00 but there are some other english romances mentioned in the prologue of richard cueur de lion which we likewise probably received from the french in that period and on which i shall here also enlarge  beuves de hanton or sir beavis of southampton is a french romance of considerable antiquity although the hero is not older than the norman conquest it is alluded to in our english romance on this story which will again be cited and at

is now enclosed in the beautiful gardens of general sir john mordaunt and gives name to his seat  it is pretended that he was earl of southampton his sword is shown in arundel castle this piece was evidently written after the crusades as bevis is knighted by the king of armenia and is one of the generals at the siege of damascus  guy earl of warwick is recited as a french romance by labbe ubi

again le livre de guy de warwick et de harold d ardenne catal mss p      this harold darden is a distinguished warrior of guys history and therefore his achievements sometimes form a separate romance

giant with the monster of dunsmore heath and the dragon of northumberland are by no means equal to some of his achievements in the holy land and the trophies which he won from the sultan under the command of the emperor frederick  the romance of sidrac often entitled le livere sydrac le philosophe le quel hom appele le livere de le funtane de totes sciences appears to have been very popular from the present frequency of its manuscripts but it is rather a romance of arabian philosophy than of chivalry it is a system of natural knowledge and particularly treats of the virtues of plants sidrac the philosopher of this system was astronomer to an eastern king he lived eight hundred and fortyseven years after noah of whose book of astronomy he was possessed he converts bocchus an idolatrous king of india to the christian faith by whom he is invited to build a mighty tower against the invasions of a rival king of india but the history no less than the subject of this piece displays the state nature and migrations of literature in the dark ages after the death of bocchus sidracs book fell into the hands of a chaldean renowned for piety it then successively becomes the property of king madian namaan the assyrian and grypho archbishop of samaria the latter had a priest named demetrius who brought it into spain and here it was translated from the greek into latin this translation is said to be made at toledo by roger de palermo a minorite friar in the thirteenth century a king of spain then commanded it to be translated from latin into arabic and sent it as a most valuable present to emir elmomenim lord of tunis it was next given to frederick the second emperor of germany famous in the crusades this work which is of considerable length was translated into english verse and will be mentioned on that account again sidrac is recited as an eminent philosopher with seneca and king solomon in the marchaunts second tale ascribed to chaucer urr p     v      there is an old translation of sidrac into dutch mss marshall bibl bodl    fol   it is natural to conclude that most of these french romances were current in england either in the french originals which were well understood at least by the more polite readers or else by translation or imitation as i have before hinted when the romance of richard cuer de lion in whose prologue they are recited was translated into english that the latter was the case as to some of them at least we shall soon produce actual proofs a writer who has considered these matters with much penetration and judgment observes that probably from the reign of our richard the first we are to date that remarkable intercommunication and mutual exchange of compositions which we discover to have taken place at some early period between the french and english minstrels the same set of phrases the same species of characters incidents and adventures and often the identical stories being found in the metrical romances of both nations percys ess on anc engl minstr p     from close connection and constant intercourse the traditions and the champions of one kingdom were equally known in the other and although bevis and guy were english heroes yet on these principles this circumstance by no means destroys the supposition that their achievements although perhaps already celebrated in rude english songs might be first wrought into romance by the french dugdale relates that in the reign of henry the fourth about the year    0 a lord beauchamp traveling into the east was hospitably received at jerusalem by the soldans lieutenant who hearing that he was descended from the famous guy of warwick whose story they had in books of their own language invited him to his palace and royally feasting him presented him

cotemporary yet it is not so very improbable that guys history should be a book among the saracens if we consider that constantinople was not only a central and connecting point between the eastern and western world but that the french in the thirteenth century had acquired an establishment there under baldwin earl of flanders that the french language must have been known in sicily jerusalem cyprus and antioch in consequence of the conquests of robert guiscard hugo le grand and godfrey of ulloigne and that pilgrimages into the holy land were excessively frequent it is hence easy to suppose that the french imported many of their stories or books of this sort into the east which being thus understood there and suiting the genius of the orientals were at length translated into their language it is remarkable that the greeks at constantinople in the twelfth century and since called all the europeans by the name of franks as the turks do to this day see seld polyolb viii p

king arthur and other prose pieces of chivalry by which as the profession of minstrelsy decayed and gradually gave way to a change of manners and customs romances in meter were at length imperceptibly superseded or at least grew less in use as a mode of entertainment at public festivities  various causes concurred in the mean time to multiply books of chivalry among the french and to give them a superiority over the english not only in the number but in the excellence of those compositions their barons lived in greater magnificence their feudal system flourished on a more sumptuous extensive and lasting establishment schools were instituted in their castles for initiating the young nobility in the rules and practice of chivalry their tilts and tournaments were celebrated with a higher degree of pomp and their ideas of honor and gallantry were more exaggerated and refined  we may add what indeed has been before incidentally remarked that their troubadours were the first writers of metrical romances but by what has been here advanced i do not mean to insinuate without any restrictions that the french entirely led the way in these compositions undoubtedly the provencial bards contributed much to the progress of italian literature raimond the fourth of arragon count of provence about the year    0 a lover and a judge of letters invited to his court the most celebrated of the songsters who professed to polish and adorn the provencial language by various sorts of poetry giovan villani istor  vi c     charles the first his soninlaw and the inheritor of his virtues and dignities conquered naples and carried into italy a taste for the provencial literature at florence especially this taste prevailed where he reigned many years with great splendor and where his successors resided soon afterward the roman court was removed to provence villani acquaints us that brunetto latini dantes master was the first who attempted to polish the florentines by improving their taste and style which he did by writing his grand work the tesoro in provencial he died in      see villan ibid  ix c      hitherto the latin language had only been in use the provencial writers established a common dialect and their examples convinced other nations that the modern languages were no less adapted to composition than those of antiquity dante designed at first that his inferno and treatise on monarchy should appear in latin but finding that he could not so effectually in that language impress his satirical strokes and political maxims on the laity or illiterate he altered his mind and published those pieces in talian had petrarch written his africa his eclogues and his prose compositions in italian the literature of his country would much sooner have arrived at perfection  they introduced a love of reading and diffused a general and popular taste for poetry by writing in a language intelligible to the ladies and the people their verses being conveyed in a familiar tongue became the chief amusement of princes and feudal lords whose courts had now begun to assume an air of greater brilliancy a circumstance which necessarily gave great encouragement to their profession and by rendering these arts of ingenious entertainment universally fashionable imperceptibly laid the foundation of polite literature from these beginnings it were easy to trace the progress of poetry to its perfection through john de meun in france dante in italy and chaucer in england  this praise must undoubtedly be granted to the provencial poets but in the mean time to recur to our original argument we should be cautious of asserting in general and indiscriminating terms that the provencial poets were the first writers of metrical romance at least we should ascertain with rather more precision than has been commonly used on this subject how far they may claim this merit i am of opinion that there were two sorts of french troubadours who have not hitherto been sufficiently distinguished if we diligently examine their history we shall find that the poetry of the first troubadours consisted in satires moral fables allegories and sentimental sonnets so early as the year    0 a tribunal called the court of love was instituted both in provence and picardy at which questions in gallantry were decided this institution furnished eternal matter for the poets who threw the claims and arguments of the different parties into verse in a style that afterward led the way to the spiritual conversations of cyrus and clelia this part of their character will be insisted upon more at large when we come to speak of chaucer  fontenelle does not scruple to acknowledge that gallantry was the parent of french poetry theatr fr p     but to sing romantic and chivalrous adventures was a very different task and required very different talents the troubadours therefore who composed metrical romances form a different species and ought always to be considered separately and this latter class seems to have commenced at a later period not till after the crusades had effected a great change in the manners and ideas of the western world in the mean time i hazard a conjecture cinthio giraldi supposes that the art of the troubadours commonly called the gay science was first communicated from france to the italians and afterward to the spaniards apud huet orig romans p  0   this perhaps may be true but at the same time it is highly probable as the spaniards had their juglares or convivial bards very early as from long connection they were immediately and intimately acquainted with the fictions of the araians and as they were naturally fond of chivalry that the troubadours of provence in great measure caught this turn of fabling from spain the communication to mention no other obvious means of intercourse in an affair of this nature was easy through the ports of toulon and marseilles by which the two nations carried on from early times a constant commerce even the french critics themselves universally allow that the spaniards having learned rhyme from the arabians through this very channel conveyed it to provence tasso preferred

soon oblige the world with an ample history of provencial poetry and whose researches into a kindred subject already published have opened a new and extensive field of information concerning the manners institutions and literature of the feudal ages see memoires sur lancienne chevalerie etc paris      ii tom   mo   sect iv various matters suggested by the prologue of richard cueur de lion cited in the last section have betrayed us into a long digression and interrupted the regularity of our annals but i could not neglect so fair an opportunity of preparing the reader for those metrical tales which having acquired a new cast of fiction from the crusades and a magnificence of manners from the increase of chivalry now began to be greatly multiplied and as it were professedly to form a separate species of poetry i now therefore resume the series and proceed to give some specimens of the english metrical romances which appeared before or about the reign of edward the second and although most of these pieces continued to be sung by the minstrels in the halls of our magnificent ancestors for some centuries afterward yet as their first appearance may most probably be dated at this period they properly coincide in this place with the tenor of our history in the mean time it is natural to suppose that by frequent repetition and successive changes of language during many generations their original simplicity must have been in some degree corrupted yet some of the specimens are extracted from manuscripts written in the reign of edward the third others indeed from printed copies where the editors took great liberties in accommodating the language to the times however in such as may be supposed to have suffered most from depravations of this sort the substance of the ancient style still remains and at least the structure of the story on the whole we mean to give the reader an idea of those popular heroic tales in verse professedly written for the harp which began to be multiplied among us about the beginning of the fourteenth century we will begin with the romance of richard cueur de lion already mentioned  the poem opens with the marriage of richards father henry the second with the daughter of carbarryne a king of antioch but this is only a lady of romance henry married eleanor the divorced queen of louis of france the minstrels could not conceive any thing less than an eastern princess to be the mother of this magnanimous hero   his barons him read advised  that they granted hem a wife to wedde hastily he sent his sonde into many a

very much used in the wars of the middle ages both by sea and land it was a sort of wildfire said to be inextinguishable by water and chiefly used for burning ships against which it was thrown in pots or phials by the hand in land engagements it seems to have been discharged by machines constructed on purpose the oriental greeks pretended that this artificial fire was invented by callinicus an

it was perhaps derived from the latin machina yet the romans do not appear to have used in their wars so formidable and complicated an engine as this is described to have been in the writers of the

minstrell profession became a science and the audience grew more civilized refinements began to be studied and the romantic poet sought to gain new attention and to recommend his story by giving it the advantage of a plan most of the old metrical romances are from their nature supposed to be incoherent rhapsodies yet many of them have a regular integrity in which every part contributes to produce an intended end through various obstacles and difficulties one point is kept in view till the final and general catastrophe is brought about by a pleasing and unexpected surprise as a specimen of the rest and as it lies in a narrow compass i will develope the plan of the fable now before us which preserves at least a coincidence of events and an uniformity of design  a kings daughter of england extremely beautiful is solicited in marriage by numerous potentates of various kingdoms the king her father vows that of all these suitors that champion alone shall win his daughter who can unhorse him at a tournament this they all attempt but in vain the king every year assisted at an anniversary mass for the soul of his deceased queen who was interred in an abbey at some distance from his castle in the journey thither the princess strays from her damsels in a solitary forest she is discovered by a knight in rich armor who by many solicitations prevails over her chastity and at parting gives her a sword without a point which he charges her to keep safe together with a pair of gloves which will fit no hands but her own gloves were anciently a costly article of dress and richly decorated they were sometimes adorned with precious stones rot pip an    hen iii a d      et de i pectine auri cm lapidibus pretiosis ponderant xliii s et iii d ob et de ii paribus

secretly delivered of a boy soon after the delivery the princess having carefully placed the child in a cradle with twenty pounds in gold ten pounds in silver the gloves given her by the strange knight and a letter consigns him to one of her maidens who carries him by night and leaves him in a wood near a hermitage which she discerned by the light of the moon the hermit in the morning discovers the child reads the letter by which it appears that the gloves will fit no lady but the boys mother educates him till he is twenty years of age and at parting gives him the gloves found with him in the cradle telling him that they will fit no lady but his own mother the youth who is called degore sets forward to seek adventures and saves an earl from a terrible dragon which he kills the earl invites him to his palace dubs him a knight gives him a horse and armor and offers him half his territory sir degore refuses to accept this offer unless the gloves which he had received from his fosterfather the hermit will fit any lady of his court all the ladies of the earls court are called before him and among the rest the earls daughter but upon trial the gloves will fit none of them he therefore takes leave of the earl proceeds on his adventures and meets with a large train of knights he is informed that they were going to tourney with the king of england who had promised his daughter to that knight who could conquer him in single combat they tell him of the many barons and earls whom the king had foiled in several trials sir degore however enters the lists overthrows the king and obtains the princess as the knight is a perfect stranger she submits to her fathers commands with much reluctance he marries her but in the midst of the solemnities which preceded the consummation recollects the gloves which the hermit had given him and proposes to make an experiment with them on the hands of his bride the princess on seeing the gloves changed color claimed them for her own and drew them on with the greatest ease she declares to sir degore that she was his mother and gives him an account of his birth she told him that the knight his father gave her a pointless sword which was to be delivered to no person but the son that should be born of their stolen embraces sir degore draws the sword and contemplates its breadth and length with wonder is suddenly seized with a desire of finding out his father he sets forward on this search and on his way enters a castle where he is entertained at supper by fifteen beautiful damsels the lady of the castle invites him to her bed but in vain and he is lulled asleep by the sound of a harp various artifices are used to divert him from his pursuit and the lady even engages him to encounter a giant in her cause all the romances have such an obstacle as this they have all an enchantress who detains the knight from his quest by objects of pleasure and who is nothing more than the calypso of homer the dido of virgil and the armida of tasso  but sir degore rejects all her temptations and pursues his journey in a forest he meets a knight richly accoutred who demands the reason why sir degore presumed to enter his forest without permission a combat ensues in the midst of the contest the combatants being both unhorsed the strange knight observing the sword of his adversary not only to be remarkably long and broad but without a point begs a truce for a moment he fits the sword to a point which he had always kept and which had formerly broken off in an encounter with a giant and by this circumstance discovers sir degore to be his son they both return into england and sir degores father is married to the princess his mother  the romance of king robert of sicily begins and proceeds

most interesting passages mss f      ippomedon although the son of a king is introduced waiting in his fathers hall at a grand festival this servitude was so far from being dishonorable that it was

say some to chamber and some to boure and some to the hye toure in the feudal castles where many persons of both sexes were assembled and who did not know how to spend the time it is natural to suppose that different parties were formed and different schemes of amusement invented one of these was to mount to the top of one of the highest towers in the castle  and some on the halle stood and spoke what hem thoht good men that were of that cite the apulians  enquired of men of other cuntre etc here a conversation commences concerning the heiress of calabria and the young prince ippomedon

siracke was translated into english verse by one hugh campden and printed probably not long after it was translated at london by thomas godry at the cost of dan robert saltwood monk of saint austins in canterbury    0 this piece therefore belongs to a lower period i have seen only one manuscript copy of it laud g    fol membran  chaucer mentions in sir topaz among others the romantic poems of sir blandamoure sir libeaux and sir ippotis of the former i find nothing more than the name occurring in sir libeaux to avoid prolix repetitions from other works in the hands of all i refer the reader to percys essay on ancient metrical romances who has analyzed the plan of sir libeaux or sir libius disconius at large p    see also p    ibid  as to sir ippotis an ancient poem with that title occurs in manuscript mss cotton calig a   f    and ms vernon f     but as chaucer is speaking of romances of chivalry which he means to ridicule and this is a religious legend it may be doubted whether this is the piece alluded to by chaucer however i will here exhibit a specimen of it from the exordium ms vernon f      her by ginnith a tretys that men clpeth ypotis all that wolleth of wisdom lere lusteneth

not forget here that sir gawaine one of arthurs champions is celebrated in a separate romance among tanners manuscripts we have the wedding of sir gavain numb     bibl bodl it begins be ye blythe and

carlisle i think i have somewhere seen a romance in verse entitled the turk and gawaine    but it is neither my inclination nor intention to write a catalogue or compile a miscellany it is not to be expected that this work should be a general repository of our ancient poetry i cannot however help observing that english literature and english poetry suffer while so many pieces of this kind still remain concealed and forgotten in our manuscript libraries they contain in common with the proseromances to most of which indeed they gave rise amusing images of ancient customs and institutions not elsewhere to be found or at least not otherwise so strikingly delineated and they preserve pure and unmixed those fables of chivalry which formed the taste and awakened the imagination of our elder english classics the antiquaries of former times overlooked or rejected these valuable remains which they despised as false and frivolous and employed their industry in reviving obscure fragments of uninstructive morality or uninteresting history but in the present age we are beginning to make ample amends in which the curiosity of the antiquarian is connected with taste and genius and his researches tend to display the progress of human manners and to illustrate the history of society  as a further illustration of the general subject and many particulars of this section and the three last i will add a new proof of the reverence in which such stories were held and of the familiarity with which they must have been known by our ancestors these fables were not only perpetually repeated at their festivals but were the constant objects of their eyes the very walls of their apartments were clothed with romantic history tapestry was anciently the fashionable furniture of our houses and it was chiefly filled with lively representations of this sort the stories of the tapestry in the royal palaces of henry the eighth are still preserved the second part of the inventorye of our late sovereigne lord king henry the eighth containing his guardrobes household stuff etc etc mss harl      fol the original compare p     supr and walpoles anecd paint i p  0  which i will here

posterity robert de brunne above mentioned lived and perhaps wrote some of his pieces in this reign but he more properly belongs to the last  this is adam davy or davie he may be placed about the year      i can collect no circumstances of his life but that he was marshall of stratfordlebow near london this will appear from citations which follow  he has left several poems never printed which are almost as forgotten as his name only one manuscript of these pieces now remains which seems to be coeval with it is author mss bibl bodl laud i    fol membran it has been much damaged and on that account is often illegible  they are visions the battle of jerusalem the legend of saint alexius scripture histories of fifteen toknes before the day of judgment lamentations of souls and the life of

  fol m beauchamps rech fr theat p      it is translated from a latin work in five books very popular in the middle ages entitled hegesippi de bello judaico et excidio urbis hierosolymitanae libri quinque this is a licentious paraphrase of a part of josephuss jewish history made about the fourth century and the name hegesippus is most probably corrupted from josephus perhaps also called josippus the paraphrast is supposed to be ambrose of milan who flourished in the reign of theodosius he mentions constantinople and new rome an the provinces of scotia and saxonia from this work the maccabes seem to have got into romance it was first printed at paris fol      among the bodleian manuscripts there is a most beautiful copy of this book believed to be written in the saxon times  on the subject of vespasians siege of jerusalem as related in this book our poet adam davie has left a poem entitled the battle of jerusalem the latter part of this poem appears detached in a former part of our manuscript with the title the vengeance of gods death viz f    b thi latter part begins with these lines  and at the forty days end whider i would he bade me wede upon the mount of olyvete etc

that bougth us so strong our brother we mow may him clepe well sometimes  so seith himself ilome ms ut supr f     my readers will be perhaps surprised to find our language improve so slowly and will probably think that adam davie writes in a less intelligible phrase than many more ancient bards already cited his obscurity however arises in great measure from obsolete spelling a mark of antiquity which i have here observed in exact conformity to a manuscript of the age of edward the second and which in the poetry of his predecessors especially the minstrellpieces has been often effaced by multiplication of copies and other causes in the mean time it should be remarked that the capricious peculiarities and even ignorance of transcribers often occasion an obscurity which is not to be imputed either to the author or his age chaucer in troilus and cressida mentions the great diversite in english and in writing of our tongue he therefore prays god that no person would miswrite or missemetre his poem lib ult v      seq   but davies capital poem is the life of alexander which deserves to be published entire on many accounts it seems to be founded chiefly on simeon seths romance abovementioned but many passages are also copied from the french roman d alexandre a poem in our authors age perhaps equally popular both in england and france it is a work of considerable length ms

strictly imply minstrells i cannot indeed determine yet we may remark that mimicus is never used for mimus that certain theatrical entertainments called mascarades as we shall see below were very

religion they used at wytney in oxfordshire to set fourth yearly in manner of a show or interlude the resurrection of our lord etc for the which purposes and the more lyvely heareby to exhibit to the eye the hole action of the resurrection the priests garnished out certain small puppettes representing the persons of christ the watchmen marie and others amongst the which one bare the part of a wakinge watchman who espiinge christ to arise made a continual noyce like to the sound that is caused by the metynge of two styckes and was thereof commonly called jack snacker of wytney the like toye i myself being then a child once saw in poules church at london at a feast of whitsuntyde wheare the coming down of the holy ghost was set forth by a white pigion that was let to fly out of a hole that yet is to be seen in the mydst of the roof of the great i will and by a long censer which descendinge out of the same place almost to the very ground was swinged up and down at such a length that it reached with the one swepe almost to the westgate of the church and with the other to the quyre stairs of the same breathinge out over the whole church and company a most pleasant perfume of such sweet things as burned therein with the like doom shows also they used every where to furnish sondrye parts of their church service as by their spectacles of the nativitie passion and ascension etc  this practice of acting plays in churches was at last grown to such an enormity and attended with such inconvenient consequences that in the reign of henry the ighth bonner bishop of london issued a proclamation to the clergy of his diocese dated      prohibiting all manner of common plays games or interludes to be played set forth or declared within their churches chapels etc burnet hist ref i

modern drama plays continued to be acted on sundays so late as the reign of elizabeth and even till that of charles the first by the choristers or singingboys of saint pauls cathedral in london and of the royal chapel  it is certain that these miracleplays were the first of our dramatic exhibitions but as these pieces frequently required the introduction of allegorical characters such as charity sin death hope faith or the like and as the common poetry of the times especially among the french began to deal much in allegory at length plays were formed entirely consisting of such personifications these were called moralities the miracleplays or mysteries were totally destitute of invention or plan they tamely represented stories according to the letter of scripture or the respective legend but the moralities indicate dawnings of the dramatic art they contain some rudiments of a plot and even attempt to delineate characters and to paint manners from hence the gradual transition to real historical personages was natural and obvious it may be also observed that many licentious pleasantries were sometimes introduced in these religious representations this might imperceptibly lead the way to subjects entirely profane and to comedy and perhaps earlier than is imagined in a mss digb     bibl bodl mystery of the massacre of the holy innocents part of the subject

much ignominy it is in an enlightened age only that subjects of scripture history would be supported with proper dignity but then an enlightened age would not have chosen such subjects for theatrical exhibition it is certain that our ancestors intended no sort of impiety by these monstrous and unnatural mixtures neither the writers nor the spectators saw the impropriety nor paid a separate attention to the comic and the srious part of these motley scenes at least they were persuaded that the solemnity of the subject covered or excused all incongruities they had no just idea of decorum consequently but little sense of the ridiculous what appears to us to be the highest burlesque on them would have made no sort of impression we must not wonder at this in an age when courage devotion

was beheld by a numerous assembly of both sexes with great composure they had the authority of scripture for such a representation and they gave matters just as they found them in the third chapter of genesis it would have been absolute heresy to have departed from the sacred text in personating the primitive appearance of our first parents whom the spectators so nearly resembled in simplicity and

shows of miracles with farces and other sports but compatible with decorum  after dinner they exhibited without their masks but in proper dresses such farces as they were masters of in different parts of the city statut eccles tullens apud carpent suppl lat gl du cang v kalendae  it is probable that the same entertainments attended the solemnisation of this ridiculous festival in england it appears that in england the boybishop with his companions went about to different parts of the town at least visited the other religious houses as in rot comp coll winton a d      in dat episcopo nicolatensi this i suppose was one of the children of the choir of the neighboring cathedral in the statutes of the collegiate church of s mary ottery founded by bishop grandison in      there is this passage

from this supposition some critics may be inclined to deduce the practice of our plays being acted by the choirboys of st pauls church and the chapel royal which continued as i before observed till cromwells usurpation the english and french stages mutually throw light on each others history but perhaps it will be thought that in some of these instances i have exemplified in nothing more than farcical and gesticulatory representations yet even these traces should be attended to in the mean time we may observe upon the whole that the modern drama had its foundation in our religion and that it was raised and supported by the clergy the truth is the members of the ecclesiastical societies were almost the only persons who could read and their numbers easily furnished performers they abounded in leisure and their very relaxations were religious  i did not mean to touch upon the italian stage but as so able a judge as riccoboni seems to allow that italy derived her theater from those of france and england by way of an additional illustration of the antiquity of the two last i will here produce one or two miracleplays acted much earlier in italy than any piece mentioned by that ingenious writer or by crescimbeni in the year      on the feast of pentecost and the two following holidays the representation of the play of christ that is of his passion resurrection ascension

high antiquity of the italian stage may adopt these instances as new proofs in defense of that hypothesis  in this transient view of the origin and progress of our drama which was incidentally suggested by the mention of bastons supposed comedies i have trespassed upon future periods but i have chiefly done this for the sake of connection and to prepare the mind of the reader for other anecdotes of the history of our stage which will occur in the course of our researches and are reserved for their respective places i could have enlarged what is here loosely thrown together with many other remarks and illustrations but i was unwilling to transcribe from the colleions of those who have already treated this subject with great comprehension and penetration and especially from the author of the supplement to the translators preface of jarviss don quixote see also doctor percys very ingenious essay on the origin of the english stage etc  i claim no other merit from this digression than that of having collected some new anecdotes relating to the early state of the english and french stages the original of both which is intimately connected from books and manuscripts not easily found nor often examined these hints may perhaps prove of some service to those who have leisure and inclination to examine the subject with more precision  sect vii edward the third was an illustrious example and patron of chivalry his court was the theater of romantic elegance i have examined the annual rolls of his wardrobe which record various articles of costly stuffs delivered occasionally for the celebration of his tournaments such as standards pennons tunics caparisons with other splendid furniture of the same sort and it appears that he commanded these solemnities to be kept with a magnificence superior to that of former ages at litchfield bury guildford eltham canterbury and twice at windsor in little more than the space of one year comp j cook provisoris magn

victorious monarch with a grand exhibition of these martial exercises he established in the castle of windsor a fraternity of twentyfour knights for whom he erected a round table with a round chamber still remaining according to a similar institution of king arthur walsing p      anstis treats the notion that edward in this establishment had any retrospect to king arthur as an idle and legendary tradition ord gart ii     but the fame of arthur was still kept alive and continued to be an object of veneration long afterward and however idle and ridiculous the fables of the round table may appear at present they were then not only universally known but firmly believed nothing could be more natural to such a romantic monarch in such an age than the renovation of this most ancient and revered institution of chivalry it was a prelude to the renowned order of the garter which he soon afterward founded at windsor during the ceremonies of a magnificent feast which had been proclaimed by his heralds in germany france scotland burgundy heynault and brabant and lasted fifteen days barnes i chapter    p     froissart c  00 anstis ut supr  we must not try the modes and notions of other ages even if they have arrived to some degree of refinement by those of our own nothing is more probable than that this latter foundation of edward the third took its rise from the exploded story of

method if we previously display the merits of two or three poets who appeared in the former part of the reign of edward the third with other incidental matters  the first of these is richard hampole an eremite of the order of saint augustine he was a doctor of diviity and lived a solitary life near the nuns of hampole four miles from doncaster in yorkshire the neighborhood of this female society could not withdraw our recluse from his devotions and his studies he flourished in the year      wharton app ad cave p    saecul wickley  his latin theological tracts both in prose and vese are

margaret ms vernon but margarete is evidently the recluse at whose request richard misyn many years after hapoles death translated the incendium amoris these observations to which others might be added are suficint to confrm the suspicions insinuated in the text many of hampoles latin thologial tracs were printed very early at pais and cologne  was most probably writtten by hampole and it is not very likely that he should translate his own work the author and translator were easily confounded as to the copy of the english poem given to bishop grosthead he could not be the translator to say nothing more if hampole wrote the latin original on the whole whoever was the author of the two translations at least we may pronounce with some certainty that they belong to the reign of edward the third  sect viii the next poet in succession is one who deserves more attention on various accounts this is robert longlande author of the poem called the vision of pierce plowman a scular priest and a fellow of oriel college in oxford he flourished about the year    0 i have here followed a date commonly received but it may be observed that there is in this poem an allusion to the fall of edward the second the sige of calais is also mentioned as a recent fact and bribery accuses conscience of obstructing the conquest of france see more in observations on the fairy queen ii xi p      this poem contains a series of distinct visions which the author imagines himself to have seen while he was sleeping after a long ramble on malvernehills in worcestershire it is a satire on the vices of almost every profession but particularly on the corruptions of the clergy and the absurdities of superstition these are ridiculed with much humor and spirit couched under a strong vein of allegorical invention but instead of availing himself of the rising and rapid improvements of the english language longland prefers and adopts the style of the anglosaxon poets nor did he make these writers the models of his language only he likewise imitates their alliterative versification which consisted in using an aggregate of words beginning with the same letter he has therefore rejected rhyme in the place of which he thinks it sufficient to substitute a perpetual alliteration but this imposed constraint of seeking identical initials and the affectation of obsolete english by demanding a constant and necessary departure from the natural and obvious forms of expression while it circumscribed the powers of our authors genius contributed also to render his manner extremely perplexed and to disgust the reader with obscurities the satire is conducted by the agency of several allegorical personages such as avarice bribery simony theology conscience etc there is much imagination in the following picture which is intended to represent human life and its various occupations  then began i to meten a mervelouse sweven that i was in wilderness i wist never where as i

necessaries or ornaments of life from the convenience of communication and the increase of provincial civility could be procured in various places goods and commodities of every kind were chiefly sold at fairs to which as to one universal mart the people resorted periodically and supplied most of their wants for the ensuing year the display of merchandise and the conflux of customers at these principal and almost only emporia of domestic commerce was prodigious and they were therefore often held on open and extensive plains one of the chief of them seems to have been that of st giless hill or down near winchester to which our poet here refers it was instituted and given as a kind of revenue to the bishop of winchester by william the conqueror who by his charter permitted it to continue for three days but in consequence of new royal grants henry the third prolonged its continuance to sixteen days its jurisdiction extended seven miles round and comprehended even southampton then a capital trading town and all merchants who sold wares within that circuit forfeited them to the bishop officers were placed at a considerable distance at bridges and other avenues of access to the fair to exact toll of all merchandise passing that way in the mean time all shops in the city of winchester were shut in the fair was a court called the pavilion at which the bishops justiciaries and other officers assisted with power to try causes of vrious sorts for seven miles round nor among other singular claims could any lord of a manor hold a court baron within the said circuit without license from the pavilion during this time the bishop was empowered to take toll of very load or parcel of goods passing through the gates of the city on saint giless eve the mayor bailiffs and citizens of the city of winchester delivered the keys of the four city gates to the bishops officers who during the said sixteen days appointed a mayor and bailiff of their own to govern the city and also a coroner to act within the said city tenants of the bishop who held lands by doing service at the pavilion attended the same with horses and armor not only to do suit at the court there but to be ready to assist the bishops officers in the execution of writs and other services but i cannot here enumerate the many extraordinary privileges granted to the bishop on this occasion all tending to obstruct trade and to oppress the people numerous foreign merchants frequented this fair and it appears that the justiciaries of the pavilion and the treasurer of the bishops palace of wolvesey received annually for a fee according to ancient custom four basins and ewers of those foreign merchants who sold brazen vessels in the fair and were called mercatres diaunteres in the fair several streets were formed assigned to the sale of different commodities and called the drapry the pottery the spicery etc many monasteries in and about winchester had shops or houses in these streets used only at the fair which they held under the bishop and often let by lease for a term of years one place in the fair was called speciarium sani wythini or the spicery of saint swithins monastery in the revenuerolls of the ancient bishops of winchester this fair makes a grand and separate article of reception under this title feria computus iae sancti egidii but in the revenueroll of bishop will of waynflet an      it appears to have greatly decayed in which among other proofs i find mention made of a district in the fair being unoccupied ubi homines cornubiae stare solebant from whence it likewise appears that different counties had their different stations the whole reception to the bishop this year from the fair amouned only to    l    s   d yet this sum small as it may seem was worth upwards of  00 l edward the first sent a precept to the sheriff of hampshire to restore to the bishop this fair which his escheator malcolm de harlegh had seized into the kings hands without command of the treasurer and barons of the exchequer in the year      registr joh de pontissara episc wint fol     after the charter of henry the third many kings by charter confirmed this fair with

of charles the second in the year      when brian fitzcount lord of wallingford in berkshire maintained wallingord castle one of the strongest garrisons belonging to maud the empress and consequently sent out numerous parties for contributions and provisions henry de blois bishop of winchester enjoined him not to molest any passengers that were coming to his fair at winchester under pain of excommunication omnibus ad feriam meam veentibus etc mss dodsworth vol    f    bibl bodl this was in king stephens reign in that of richard the first in the year      the king grants to portsmouth a

curious record now remaining containing the estabishment and expenses of the household of henry percy fifth earl of northumberland in the year      and printed by doctor percy that the stores of his

purchasing necessaries in large quantities which now are supplied by frequent trading towns and the mention of beiffes and ultons which were salted oxen and sheep shows that at so late a period they knew but little of breeding cattle their ignorance of so important an article of husbandry is also an evidence that in the reign of henry the eighth the state of population was much lower among us than we may imagine  in the statutes of saint mary otterys college in devonshire given by bishop grandison the founder the stewards and sacrist are ordered to purchse annually two hundred pounds of wax for the choir of the college at this fair cap lxvii  pro luminaribus vero omnibus supradictis inveniendis etiam statuimus quod senescalli scaccarii per visum et auxilium sacriste omni anno in

first edition is by r wolf london       to in four sheets it was reprinted and added to rogerss or the fourth edition of the vision      it was evidently written after the year      wickliffe died in

also fullers worth p   wales the reader will pardon this small anticipation for the sake of connection  it is professedly written in imitation of our vision but by a different hand the author in the character of a plain uninformed person pretends to be ignorant of his creed to be instructed in the articles of which he applies by turns to the four orders of mendicant friars this circumstance affords an obvious occasion of exposing in lively colors the tricks of those societies after so unexpected a disappointment he meets one pierce or peter a plowman who resolves his doubts and teaches him the principles of true religion in a copy of the creed lately presented to me by the bishop of gloucester and once belonging to mr pope the latter in his own hand has inserted the following abstract of its plan an ignorant plain man having learned his paternoster and avemary wants to learn his creed he asks several religious men of the several orders to teach it him first of a friar minor who bids him beware of the carmelites and assures him they can teach him nothing describing their faults etc but that the friars minors shall save him whether he learns his creed or not he goes next to the friars preachers whose magnificent monastery he describes there he meets a fat friar who declaims against the augustines he is shocked at his pride and goes to the augustines they rail at the minorites he goes to the carmes they abuse the dominicans but promise him salvation without the creed for money he leaves them with indignation and finds an honest poor plowman in the field and tells him how he was disappointed by the four orders the plowman answers with a long invective against them  the language of the creed is less embarrassed and obscure than that of the vision but before i proceed to a specimen it may not be perhaps improper to prepare the reader by giving an outline of the constitution and character of the four orders of mendicant friars the object of our poets satire an enquiry in many respects connected with the general purport of this history and which in this place at least cannot be deemed a digression as it will illustrate the main subject and explain many particular passages of the plowmans creed and of some perhaps quoted above from the vision   long before the thirteenth century the monastic orders as we have partly seen in the preceding poem in consequence of their ample revenues had degenerated from their primitive austerity and were totally given up to luxury and indolence hence they became both unwilling and unable to execute the purposes of their establishment to instruct the people to check the growth of heresies or to promote in any respect the true interests of the church they forsook all their religious obligations despised the authority of their superiors and were abandoned without shame or remorse to every species of dissipation and licentiousness about the beginning therefore of the thirteenth century the condition and circumstances of the church rendered it absolutely necessary to remedy these evils by introducing a new order of religious who being destitute of fixed possessions by the severity of their manners a professed contempt of riches and an unwearied perseverance in the duties of preaching and prayer might restore respect to the monastic institution and recover the honors of the church these were the four orders of mendicant or begging friars commonly denominated the franciscans the dominicans the carmelites and the augustines the franciscans were often styled friarsminors or minorites and greyfriars the dominicans friarspreachers and sometimes blackfriars the carmelites whitefriars and the austins greyfriars the first establishment of the dominicans in england was at oxford in      of the franciscans at canterbury these two were the most eminent of the four orders the dominican friary at oxford stood in an island on the south of the city southwest of the franciscan friary the site of which is hereafter described   these societies soon surpassed all the rest not only in the purity of their lives but in the number of their privileges and the multitude of their members not to mention the success which attends all novelties their reputation arose quickly to an amazing height the popes among other uncommon immunities allowed them the liberty of traveling wherever they pleased of conversing with persons of all ranks of instructing the youth and the people in general and of hearing confessions without reserve or restriction and as on these occasions which gave them opportunities of appearing in public and conspicuous situations they exhibited more striking marks of gravity and sanctity than were observable in the deportment and conduct of the members of other monasteries they were regarded with the highest esteem and veneration throughout all the countries of europe  in the mean time they gained still greater respect by cultivating the literature then in vogue with the greatest assiduity and success gianoni says that most of the theological professors in the university of naples newly founded in the year    0 were chosen from the mendicants hist nap xvi    they were the principal teachers of theology at paris the school where this science had received its origin see boul hist academ paris iii p       0         etc  at oxford and cambridge respectively all the four orders had flourishing monasteries the most learned scholars in the university of oxford at the close of the thirteenth century were franciscan friars and long after this period the franciscans appear to have been the sole support and ornament of that university this circumstance in some degree roused the monks from their indolence and induced the greater monasteries to procure the foundation of small colleges in the universities for the education of their novices at oxford the monks had also schools which bore the name of their respective orders and there were schools in that university which were appropriated to particular monasteries kennets paroch ant p     wood hist ant univ oxon i     leland says that even in his time t stamford a temporary university the names of halls inhabited by the novices of peterborough sempringham and vauldrey abbeys were remaining itin vi p    and it appears that the greater part of the proceeders in theology at oxford and cambridge just before the reformation were monks but we do not find that in consequence of all these efforts the monks made a much greater figure in literature  in this rivalry which subsisted between the mendicants and the monks the latter sometimes availed themselves of their riches and with a view to attract popularity and to eclipse the growing luster of the former proceeded to their degrees in the universities with prodigious parade in the year      william de brook a benedictine of saint peters abbey at gloucester took the degree of doctor in divinity at oxford he was attended on this important occasion by the abbot and whole convent of gloucester the abbots of westminster reading abingdon evesham and malmesbury with one hundred noblemen and esquires

among many other instances which might be given of the learning of the mendicants there is one which greatly contributed to establish their literary character in the eleventh century aristotles philosophy had been condemned in the university of paris as heretical about a hundred years afterward these prejudices began to subside and new translations of aristotles writings were published in latin by our countryman michael scotus and others with more attention to the original greek at least without the pompous and perplexed circumlocutions which appeared in the arabic versions hitherto used in the mean time the mendicant orders sprung up who happily availing themselves of these new translations and making them the constant subject of their scholastic lectures were the first who revived the doctrines of this philosopher and acquired the merit of having opened a new system of science see joann laun de varia aristotel fortun in acad paris p    edit paris       the dominicans of

star still going before marched to the church of s eustorgius with all their attendants preceeded by trumpets and horns apes baboons and a great variety of animals in the church on one side of the

abrin de offic eccl p  0   the buildings of the mendicant monasteries especially in england were remarkably magnificent and commonly much exceeded those of the endowed convents of the second magnitude as these fraternities were professedly poor and could not from their original institution receive estates the munificence of their benefactors was employed in adorning their houses with stately refectories and churches and for these and other purposes they did nor want address to procure multitudes of patrons which was facilitated by the notion of their superior sanctity it was fashionable for persons of the highest rank to bequeath their bodies to be buried in the friary churches which were consequently filled with sumptuous shrines and superb monuments their churches were esteemed more sacred than others  in the noble church of the gray friars in london finished in the year      but long since destroyed four queens besides upwards of six hundred persons of quality were buried whose beautiful tombs remained till the dissolution weav fun mon p      these interments imported considerable sums of money into the mendicant societies it is probable that they derived more benefit from casual charity than they would have gained from a regular endowment the franciscans indeed enjoyed from the popes the privilege of distributing indulgences a valuable indemnification for their voluntary poverty see baluz miscellan tom iv   0 vii       on the whole two of these mendicant institutions the dominicans and the franciscans for the space of near three centuries appear to have governed the european church and state with an absolute and universal sway they filled during that period the most eminent ecclesiastical and civil stations taught in the universities with an authority which silenced all opposition and maintained the disputed prerogative of the roman pontiff against the united influence of prelates and kings with a vigor only to be paralleled by its success the dominicans and franciscans were before the reformation exactly what the jesuits have been since they disregarded their monastic character and profession and were employed not only in spiritual matters but in temporal affairs of the greatest consequence in composing the differences of princes concluding treaties of peace and concerting alliances they presided in cabinet councils levied national subsidies influenced courts and managed the machines of every important operation and event both in the religious and political world  from what has been here said it is natural to suppose that the mendicants at length became universally odious the high esteem in which they were held and the transcendent degree of authority which they had assumed only served to render them obnoxious to the clergy of every rank to the monasteries of other orders and to the universities it was not from ignorance but from a knowledge of mankind that they were active in propagating superstitious notions which they knew were calculated to captivate the multitude and to strengthen the papal interest yet at the same time from the vanity of displaying an uncommon sagacity of thought and a superior skill in theology they affected novelties in doctrine which introduced dangerous errors and tended to shake the pillars of orthodoxy their ambition was unbounded and their arrogance intolerable their increasing numbers became in many states an enormous and unweildy burden to the commonwealth they had abused the powers and privileges which had been entrusted to them and the common sense of mankind could not long be blinded or deluded by the palpable frauds and artifices which these rapacious zealots so notoriously practiced for enriching their convents in england the university of oxford resolutely resisted the perpetual encroachments of the dominicans wood ut supr i   0          and many of our theologists attacked all the four orders with great vehemence and severity exclusive of the jealousies and animosities which naturally subsisted between four rival institutions their visionary refinements and love of disputation introduced among them the most violent dissensions the dominicans aimed at popularity by an obstinate denial of the immaculate conception their pretended sanctity became at length a term of reproach and their learning fell into discredit as polite letters and general knowledge increased their speculative and pedantic divinity gave way to a more liberal turn of thinking and a more perspicuous mode of writing bale who was himself a carmelite friar says that his order which was eminently distinguished for scholastic erudition began to lose their estimation about the year    0 some of them were imprudent enough to engage openly in political controversy and the augustines destroyed all their repute and authority in england by seditious sermons in which they labored o supplant the progeny of edward the fourth and to establish the title of the usurper richard newcourt repert i      about the year    0 leland visited the franciscan friary at oxford big with the hopes of finding in their celebrated library if not many valuable books at least those which had been bequeathed by the learned bishop grosthead the delays and difficulties with which he procured admittance into this venerable repository heightened his curiosity and expectations at length after much ceremony being permitted to enter instead of an inestimable treasure he saw little more than empty shelves covered with cobwebs and dust leland describes this adventure with some humor contigit ut copiam peterem videndi bibliothecam franciscanorum ad quod obstreperunt asini aliquot rudentes nulli prorsus mortalium tam sanctos aditus et recessus adire nisi

rosamond but a rosamundchamber was a common apartment in the royal castles perhaps in imitation of her bower at woodstock literally nothing more than a chamber which yet was curiously constructed and decorated at least in memory of it the old prose paraphrast of the chronicle of robert of gloucester says boures had the rosamonde a bout in engelonde which this king hen ii for her sake made at

alliteration of initials as if his example had as it were appropriated that mode of versification to the subject and the supposed character which supports the satire it is extraordinary that we should find in this poem one of the absurd arguments of the puritans against ecclesiastical establishments v      urr edit for christ made no cathedralls ne with him was no cardinals but see what follows concerning wickliffe  all these poems were for the most part founded on the doctrines newly broached by wickliffe it is remarkable that they touch on the very topics which wickliffe had just published in his objections of freres charging them with fifty heresis as in the following also freres buildin many great churches and costy wast houses and cloisteres as it wern castles and that wituten need etc lewiss wickliff p    i will here add a passage from wickliffes tract entitled why poor priests have no benefices lewis app number xix p     and yet they lords wolen not present a clerk able of kunning of gods law but a kitchen clerk or a penny clerk or wise in builing castle or worldly doing though he kunne not read well his sauter etc here is a manifest piece of satire on wykeham bishop of wincheer wickliffes cotemporary who is supposed to have recommended himself to edward the third by rebuilding the castle of windsor this was a recent and notorious instance but in this appointment the king probably paid a compliment to that prelates singular talents for business his activity circumspection and management rather than to any scientific and professed skill in architecture which he might have possessed it seems to me that he was only a supervisor or comptroller on this occasion it was common to depute churchmen to this department from an idea of their superior prudence and probity thus john the prior of st swithins at winchester in    0 is commissioned by brief from the king to supervise large repairs done by the sheriff in the castle of winchester and the royal manor

should not possess estates that the ecclesiastical ceremonies obstructed true devotion and that mendicant friars the particular object of our plowmans creed were a public and insupportable grievance but wickliffe whom mr hume pronounces to have been an enthusiast like many other reformers carried his ideas of purity too far and as at least it appears from the two first of these opinions under the design of destroying superstition his undistinguishing zeal attacked even the necessary aids of religion it was certainly a lucky circumstance that wickliffe quarrelled with the pope his attacks on superstition at first probably proceeded from resentment wickliffe who was professor of divinity at oxford finding on many occasions not only his own province invaded but even the privileges of the university frequently violated by the pretensions of the mendicants gratified his warmth of temper by throwing out some slight censures against all the four orders and the popes their principal patrons and abettors soon afterward he was deprived of the wardenship of canterbury hall by the archbishop of canterbury who substituted a monk in his place upon this he appealed to the pope who confirmed the archiepiscopal sentence by way of rebuke for the freedom with which he had treated the monastic profession wickliffe highly exasperated at this usage immediately gave a loose to his indignation and without restraint or distinction attacked in numerous sermons and treatises not only the scandalous enormities of the whole body of monks but even the usurpations of the pontifical power itself with other ecclesiastical corruptions having exposed these palpable abuses with a just abhorrence he ventured still farther and proceeded to examine and refute with great learning and penetration the absurd doctrines which prevailed in the religious system of his age he not only exhorted the laity to study the scriptures but translated the bible into english for general use and popular inspection whatever were his motives it is certain that these efforts enlarged the notions of mankind and sowed those seeds of a revolution in religion which were quickened at length and brought to maturity by a favorable coincidence of circumstances in an age when the increasing growth of literature and curiosity naturally led the way to innovation and improvement but a visible diminution of the authority of the ecclesiastics in england at least had been long growing from other causes the disgust which the laity had contracted from the numerous and arbitrary encroachments both of the court of rome and of their own clergy had greatly weaned the kingdom from superstition and conspicuous symptoms had appeared on various occasions of a general desire to shake off the intolerable bondage of papal oppression  sect x longlands peculiarity of style and versification seems to have had many cotemporary imitators one of these is a nameless author on the fashionable history of alexander the great and his poem on this subject is inserted at the end of the beautiful bodleian copy of the french roman dalexandre before mentioned with this reference see above p   0 it

certain that longland was the first who led the way in this singular species of versification his vision was written on a popular subject and is the only poem composed in this capricious sort of meter which has been printed it is easy to conceive how these circumstances contributed to give him the merit of an inventor on this occasion  the ingenious doctor percy has exhibited specimens of two or three other poems belonging to this class essay on the metr of p p vis p   seq  one of these is entitled death and life it consists of two hundred and twentynine lines and is divided into two parts or fitts it begins thus  christ christen king that on the cross tholed had pains and passions to defend our souls give us grace on the ground the greatly to serve for that royal red blood that rann from thy side the subject of this piece is a vision containing a contest for superiority between our lady dame life and the ugly fiend dame death who with their several attributes and concomitants are personified in a beautiful vein of allegorical painting dame life is thus forcibly described  she was brighter of her blee than was the bright son her rud redder than the rose that on the rise hangs meekely smiling with her mouth and merry in her looks ever laughing for love as she like would and as she came by the banks the boughs each one they lowted to that lady and laid forth their branches blossoms and burgens breathed full sweet flowers flourished in the frith where she forth stepped and the grass that was gray grened belive the figure of death follows which is equally bold and expressive another piece of this kind also quoted by doctor percy is entitled chevelere assign or de cigne that is the knight of the swan this is a romance which is extant in a prose translation from the french among mr garricks noble collection of old plays k vol  0 imprinted at london by me wylliam copland there is an edition on parchment by w de word      newly translated out of frenshe into english at thinstigacion of the puyssaunt prince lord edward duke of buckynghame here i understand french prose  we must not forget that among the royal manuscripts in the british museum there is a

some of the earliest of our specimens of old english poetry see sect i  we have long ago seen that alliteration was esteemed a fashionable and favorite ornament of verse for the sake of throwing the

pass over two scotch poets of this period who have adorned the english language by a strain of versification expression and poetical imagery far superior to their age and who consequently deserve to be mentioned in a general review of the progress of our national poetry they have written two heroic poems one of them is john harbor archdeacon of aberdeen he was educated at oxford and rymer has printed an instrument for his safe passage into england in order to prosecute his studies in that university in the years      and      fod vi         david bruc king of scotland gave him a pension

le livre des avnments aux chevaliers etc et demerra le dit livre toujours en la dicte chapelle this sacred register certainly furnished from time to time ample materials to the romancewriters and this circumstance gives a new explanation to a reference which we so frequently find in romances i mean that appeal which they so constantly make to some authentic record  the pompous circumstances of which these heraldic narratives consisted and the minute prolixity with which they were displayed seem to have infected the professed historians of this age of this there are various instances in froissart who had no other design than to compile a chronicle of real facts i will give one example out of many at a treaty of marriage between our richard the second and isabel daughter of charles the fifth king of france the two monarchs attended with a noble retinue met and formed several encampments in a spacious plain near the castle of guynes froissart expends many pages in relating at large the costly furniture of the pavilions the riches of the sideboards the profusion and variety of sumptuous liquors spices and dishes with their order of service the number of the attendants with their address and exact discharge of duty in their respective offices the presents of gold and precious stones made on both sides and a thousand other particulars of equal importance relating to the parade of this royal interview see froissarts cronycle translated by lord berners pinson      vol ii f      on this account caxton in his exhortation to the knights of his age ranks froissarts history as a book of chivalry with the romances of lancelot and percival and recommends it to their attention as a manual equally calculated to inculcate the knightly virtues of courage and courtesy book of

of barons vied with one another in the luster of their shows when tournaments coronations royal interviews and solemn festivals were the grand objects of mankind froissart was an eyewitness of many of

recurring to froissart himself who has interspersed in his history many curious particulars relating to his own life and works   as we are approaching to chaucer let us here stand still and take a retrospect of the general manners the tournaments and carousals of our ancient princes by forming splendid assemblies of both sexes while they inculcated the most liberal sentiments of honor and heroism undoubtedly contributed to introduce ideas of courtesy and to encourage decorum yet the national manners still retained a great degree of ferocity and the ceremonies of the most refined courts in europe had often a mixture of barbarism which rendered them ridiculous this absurdity will always appear at periods when men are so far civilized as to have lost their native simplicity and yet have not attained just ideas of politeness and propriety their luxury was inelegant their pleasures indelicate their pomp cumbersome and unwieldy in the mean time it may seem surprising that the many schools of philosophy which flourished in the middle ages should not have corrected and polished the times but as their religion was corrupted by superstition so their philosophy degenerated into sophistry nor is it science alone even if founded on truth that will polish nations for this purpose the powers of imagination must be awakened and exerted to teach elegant feelings and to heighten our natural sensibilities it is not the head only that must be informed but the heart must also be moved many classic authors were known in the thirteenth century but the scholars of that period wanted taste to read and admire them the pathetic or sublime strokes of virgil would be but little relished by theologists and metaphysicians  sect xii the most illustrious ornament of the reign of edward the third and of his successor richard the second was jeffrey chaucer a poet with whom the history of our poetry is by many supposed to have commenced and who has been pronounced by a critic of unquestionable taste and discernment to be the first english versifier who wrote poetically johnsons diction pref p    he was born in the year      and educated at oxford where he made a rapid progress in the scholastic sciences as they were then taught but the liveliness of his parts and the native gaiety of his disposition soon recommended him to the patronage of a magnificent monarch and rendered him a very popular and acceptable character in the brilliant court which i have above described in the mean time he added to his accomplishments by frequent tours into france and italy which he sometimes visited under the advantages of a public character hitherto our poets had been persons of a private and circumscribed education and the art of versifying like every other kind of composition had been confined to recluse scholars but chaucer was a man of the world and from this circumstance we are to account in great measure for the many new embellishments which he conferred on our language and our poetry the descriptions of splendid processions and gallant carousals with which his works abound are a proof that he was conversant with the practices and diversions of polite life familiarity with a variety of things and objects opportunities of acquiring the fashionable and courtly modes of speech connections with the great at home and a personal acquaintance with the vernacular poets of foreign countries opened his mind and furnished him with new lights the earl of salisbury beheaded by henry the fourth could not but patronise chaucer i do not mean for political reasons the earl was a writer of verses and very fond of poetry on this account his acquaintance was much cultivated by the famous christina of pisa whose works both in prose and verse compose so considerable a part of the old french literature she used to call him gracieux chevalier aimant dictiez et luimeme gracieux dicteur see m boivin mem lit tom ii p     seq  to i have seen none of this earls ditties otherwise he would have been here considered in form as an english poet  in italy he was introduced to petrarch at the wedding of violante daughter of galeazzo duke of milan with the duke of clarence and it is not improbable that boccacio was of the party froissart was also present vie de petrarque iii     amst       to i believe paulus jovius is the first who metions this anecdote vit galeas ii p      although chaucer had undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers and particularly of dante before this fortunate interview yet it seems likely that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions and enlarged his knowledge of the italian fables his travels likewise enabled him to cultivate the italian and provencial languages with the greatest success and induced him to polish the asperity and enrich the sterility of his native versification with softer cadences and a more copious and variegated phraseology in this attempt which was authorized by the recent and popular examples of petrarch in italy and alain chartier in france leland script brit      he was countenanced and assisted by his friend john gower the early guide and encourager of his studies gower confess amant l v fol   0 b barthel      and great well chaucer when ye mete as my disple and my poet for in the flowers of his youth in sundry wise as he well couth of dites and of songs glade the which he for my sake made etc   the revival of learning in most countries appears to have first owed its rise to translation at rude periods the modes of original thinking are unknown and the arts of original composition have not yet been studied the writers therefore of such periods are chiefly and very usefully employed in importing the ideas of other languages into their own they do not venture to think for themselves nor aim at the merit of inventors but they are laying the foundations of literature and while they are naturalising the knowledge of more learned ages and countries by translation they are imperceptibly improving the national language this has been remarkably the case not only in england but in france and italy in the year      john trevisa canon of westbury in wiltshire and a great traveller not only finished a translation of the old and new testaments at the command of his munificent patron thomas lord berkley see h wharton append cav p     but also translated higdens polychronicon and other latin pieces such as bartholomew hantwille de propritaibus rerum lib xix printed by wynkyn de word      fol and vegetius de art militari mss digb     bibl bodl in the same manuscript is aegidius romanus de rgimine principum a translation probably by trevisa he also translated some pieces of richard fitzralph archbishop of armagh see supr p     he wrote a tract prefixed to his version of the polychronicon on the utility of translations de utilitate translationum dialogus intr clericum et patronum see more of his translations in mss harl   00 i do not find his english bible in any of our libraries nor do i believe that any copy of it now remains caxton mentions it in the preface to his edition of the english polychronicon  but these translations would have been alone insufficient to have produced or sustained any considerable revolution in our language the great work was reserved for gower and chaucer wickliffe had also translated the bible it is observable that he made his translation from the vulgate latin version of jerome it was finished      see ms cod bibl coll eman cant  0   and in other respects his attempts to bring about a reformation in religion at this time proved beneficial to english literature the orthodox divines of this period generally wrote in latin but wickliffe that his arguments might be familiarised to common readers and the bulk of the people was obliged to compose in english his numerous theological treatises against the papal corruptions edward the third while he perhaps intended only to banish a badge of conquest greatly contributed to establish the national diaiect by abolishing the use of the norman tongue in the public acts and judicial proceedings as we have before observed and by substituting the natural language of the country but chaucer manifestly first taught his countrymen to write english and formed a style by naturalising words from the provencial at that time the most polished dialect of any in europe and the best adapted to the purposes of poetical expression  it is certain that chaucer abounds in classical allusions but his poetry is not formed on the ancient models he appears to have been an universal reader and his learning is sometimes mistaken for genius but his chief sources were the french and italian poets from these originals two of his capital poems the knights tale chaucer alludes to some book from whence this tale was taken more than once viz v   whilom as old stories tellin us v       as old books to us saine that all this story tells more plain v      of soulis find i naught in this registre that is this history or narrative see also v      in the legende of good women where chaurs works are mentioned is this passage which i do not well understand v   0  and all the love of palamon and arcite of thebis though the story is known lite   and the romaunt of the rose are imitations or translations the first of these is taken from boccacio  boccacio was the disciple of petrarch and although principally known and deservedly celebrated as a writer or inventor of tales he was by his cotemporaries usually placed in the third rank after dante and petrarch but boccacio having seen the platonic sonnets of his master petrarch in a fit of despair committed all his poetry to the flames goujet bibl fr tom vii p     but we must except that besides the poem mentioned below boccacios amazonida e forze dercole are both now extant and were printed at ferrara in or about the year      fol  except a single poem of which his own good taste had long taught him to entertain a more favorable opinion this piece thus happily rescued from destruction is at present so scarce and so little known even in italy as to have left its author but a slender proportion of that eminent degree of poetical reputation which he might have justly claimed from so extraordinary a performance it is an heroic poem in twelve books entitled le teseide and written in the octave stanza called by the italians ottava rima which boccacio adopted from the old french chansons and here first introduced among his countrymen see crescimben itor volgar poes vol i l i p    ven       to  it was printed at ferrara but with some deviations from the original and even misrepresentations of the story in the year      poema della

i confess i am of opinion that boccacios theseid is an original composition but there is a grecobarbarous poem extant on this subject which if it could be proved to be antecedent in point of time to the italian poem would degrade boccacio to a mere translator on this occasion it is a matter that deserves to be examined at large and to be traced with accuracy  this greek poem is as little known and as scarce as boccacios theseid it is entitled  it was printed in quarto at venice in the year      stampata in vinegia per giovanantonio et fratelli da sabbio a requisitione de m damiano de santa

but is often cited by du cange in his greek glossary under the title de nuptiis thesei et aemiliae the heads of the chapters are adorned with rude wooden cuts of the story i once suspected that boccacio having received this poem from some of his learned friends among the grecian exiles who being driven from constantinople took refuge in italy about the fourteenth century translated it into italian under this supposition i was indeed surprised to find the ideas of chivalry and the ceremonies of a tournament minutely described in a poem which appeared to have been written at constantinople but this difficulty was soon removed when i recollected that the franks venetians and germans had been in possession of that city for more than one hundred years and that baldwin earl of flanders was elected emperor of constantinople in the year   0  and was succeeded by four latin or frankish emperors down to the year      about which period it is probable that the anonymous greek poem called the loves of lybister and rhodamna was written this appears by the german name frederic which often occurs in it and is grecised with many other german words in a manuscript of this poem which crusius saw were many paintings and illuminations where in the representation of a battle he observed no guns but javelins and bows and arrows he adds et musicae testudines it is written in the iambic measure mentioned below it is a series of wandering adventures with little art or invention lybister the son of a latin king and a christian sets forward accompanied with an hundred attendants in search of rhodamna whom he had lost by the stratagems of a certain old woman skilled in magic he meets clitophon son of a king of armenia they undergo various dangers in different countries lybister relates his dream concerning a partridge and an eagle and how from that dream he fell in love with rhodamna daughter of chyses a pagan king and communicated his passion by sending an arrow to

v nov    but to say no more of this i have at present no sort of doubt of what i before asserted that boccacio is the writer and inventor of this piece our greek poem is in fact a literal translation from the italian theseid it consists of twelve books and is written in boccacios octave stanza the two last lines of every stanza rhyming together the verses are of the iambic kind and something like the versus politici which were common among the greek scholars a little before and long after constantinople was taken by the turks in the year      it will readily be allowed that the circumstance of the stanzas and rhymes is very singular in a poem composed in the greek language and is alone sufficient to prove this piece to be a translation from boccacio i must not forget to observe that the greek is extremely barbarous and of the lowest period of that language  it was a common practice of the learned and indigent greeks who frequented italy and the neighboring states about the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to translate the popular pieces of italian poetry and the romances or tales most in vogue into these grecobarbarous iambics that is versus politici abovementioned a sort of

  l vii sign m g  in passing through chaucers hands this poem has received many new beauties not only those capital fictions and desciptions the temples of mars venus and diana with their allegorical paintings and the figures of lycurgus and emetrius with their retinue are so much heightened by the bold and spiried manner of the british bard as to strike us with an air of originality in the mean time it is to be remarked that as chaucer in some places has thrown in strokes of his own so in others he has contracted the uninteresting and tedious prolixity of narrative which he found in the italian poet and that he might avoid a servile imitation and indulge himself as he pleased in an arbitrary departure from the original it appears that he neglected the embarrassment of boccacios stanza and preferred the english heroic couplet of which this poem affords the first conspicuous example extant in our language  the situation and structure of the temple of mars are thus described   a forest in which there wonneth nether man ne best with knotty knarry barrein treys old of stubbys shape and hideous to behold in which there was a rombyll and a swough sound  as though a storm should

parts of his works he has painted morning scenes con amore and his imagination seems to have been peculiarly struck with the charms of a rural prospect at sunrising  we are surprised to find in a poet of such antiquity numbers so nervous and flowing a circumstance which greatly contributed to render drydens paraphrase of this poem the most animated and harmonious piece of versification in the english language i cannot leave the knights tale without remarking that the inventor of this poem appears to have possessed considerable talents for the artificial construction of a story it exhibits unexpected and striking turns of fortune and abounds in those incidents which are calculated to strike the fancy by opening resources to sublime description or interest the heart by pathetic situations on this account even without considering the poetical and exterior ornaments of the piece we are hardly disgusted with the mixture of manners the confusion of times and the like violations of propriety which this poem in common with all others of its age presents in almost every page the action is supposed to have happened soon after the marriage of theseus with hippolita and the death of creon in the siege of thebes but we are soon transported into more recent periods sunday the celebration of matins judicial astrology heraldry tilts and tournaments knights of england and targets

jurisprudence who died about the year    0 fauchet p      being left unfinished it was completed by john of meun a native of a little town of that name situated on the river loire near orleans who seems to have flourished about the year    0 id ibid p  00 he also translated boethius de consolatione and abelards letters and wrote answers of the sybills etc  this poem is esteemed by the french the most valuable piece of their old poetry it is far beyond the rude efforts of all their preceding romancers and they have nothing equal to it before the reign of francis the first who died in the year      but there is a considerable difference in the merit of the two authors william of lorris who wrote not one quarter of the poem is remarkable for his elegance and luxuriance of description and is a beautiful painter of allegorical personages john of meun is a writer of another cast he possesses but little of his predecessors inventive and poetical vein and in that respect was not properly qualified to finish a poem begun by william of lorris but he has strong satire and great liveliness the poem consists of       verses william of lorriss part ends with v      viz  a peu que je ne men desespoir   he was one of the wits of the court of charles le bell  the difficulties and dangers of a lover in pursuing and obtaining the object of his desires are the literal argument of this poem this design is couched under the allegory of a rose which our lover after frequent obstacles gathers in a delicious garden he traverses vast ditches scales lofty walls and forces the gates of adamantine and almost impregnable castles these enchanted fortresses are all inhabited by various divinities some of which assist and some oppose the lovers progress in the preface of the edition printed in the year      all this allegory is turned to religion the rose is proved to be a state of grace or divine wisdom or eternal beatitude or the holy virgin to which heretics cannot gain access it is the white rose of jericho quasi plantatio ros in jericho etc etc the chemists in the mean time made it a search for the philosophers stone and other professions with labored commentaries explained it into their own respective sciences   chaucer has luckily translated all that was written by william of lorris see occleves letter of cupide written   0  urrys chaucer p     v     who calls john of moon the author of the romaunt of the rose  he gives only part of the continuation of john of meun chaucers poem consists of      verses and ends with this verse of the original viz v    0   vous aurez absolution but chaucer has made several omissions in john of meuns part before he comes to this period he has translated all william of lorriss part as i have observed and his translation of that part ends with v      viz  than shuldin i fallin in wanhope chaucers cotemporaries called his romant of the rose a translation lydgate says that chaucer   notably did his business by great avyse his wits to dispose to translate the romans of the rose prol boch st vi it is manifest that chaucer took no pains to disguise his translation he literally follows the french in saying that a river was less than saine i e the seine at paris v     no wight in all paris v      a grove has more birds than ben in all the relme of france v     he calls a pine a tree in france men call a pine v      he says of roses so fair werin nevir in rone v      that for paris ne for pavie v      he has sometimes reference to french ideas or words not in the original as men clepin hem sereins in

loraine v     he adds for in loraine there notis be full swetir than in this contre there is not a syllable of these songs and singers of loraine in the french by the way i suspect that chaucer translated this poem while he was at paris there are also many allusions to english affairs which i suspected to be chaucers but they are all in the french original such as hornpipis of cornevaile v    0 these are called in the original chalemeaux de cornouaille v      a knight is introduced allied to king arthour of bretaigne v      who is called bon roy artus de bretaigne orig v      sir gawin

chaucer has enriched this figure the circumstance of dangers hair standing erect like the prickles on the urchin or hedgehog is his own and finely imagined  hitherto specimens have been given from that part of this poem which was written by william de lorris its first inventor here chaucer was in his own walk one of the most striking pictures in the style of allegorical personification which occurs in chaucers translation of the additional part is much heightened by chaucer and indeed owes all its merit to the translator whose gnius was much better adapted to this species of painting than that of john of meun the continuator of the poem  with her labor and eke travail travail et douleur la hebergent mais ill le lient et la chargent que mort prochaine luy presentent et talent de seq

melancholy and other beings of the like sort were counselors in the palace of old age and employed in telling her day and night that death stood armed at her gate was far beyond the sentimental and satirical vein of john of meun and is conceived with great vigor of imagination  chaucer appears to have been early struck with this french poem in his dreme written long before he begun this translation he supposes that the chamber in which he slept was richly painted with the story of the romaunt of the rose v     chaucer alludes to this poem in the marchaunts tale v      p    urr  it is natural to imagine that such a poem must have been a favorite with chaucer no poet before william of lorris either italian or french had delineated allegorical personages in so distinct and enlarged a style and with such a fullness of characteristical attributes nor had descriptive poetry selected such a variety of circumstances and disclosed such an exuberance of embellishment in forming agreeable representations of nature on this account we are surprised that boileau should mention villon as the first poet of france who drew form and order from the chaos of the old french romancers  villon sceut le premier dans ces siecles grossiers debrouiller lart confus de nos vieux romanciers art poet chapter i he died about the year       but the poetry of william of lorris was not the poetry of boileau  that this poem should not please boileau i can easily conceive it is more surprising that it should have been censured as a contemptible performance by petrarch who lived in the age of fancy petrarch being desired by his friend guy de gonzague to send him some new piece sent the roman de la rose with the poem instead of an encomium he returned a severe criticism in which he treats it as a cold inartificial and extravagant composition as a proof how much france who valued this poem as her chief work was surpassed by italy in eloquence and the arts of writing see petrarch carm l i ep  0  in this opinion we must attribute something to jealousy but the truth is petrarchs genius was too cultivated to relish these wild excursions of imagination his favorite classics whom he revived and studied with so much attention ran in his head especially ovids art of love a poem of another species and evidently formed on another plan but which petrarch had been taught to venerate as the model and criterion of a didactic poem on the passion of love reduced to a system we may add that although the poem before us was founded on the visionary doctrines and refinements concerning love invented by the provencial poets and consequently less unlikely to be favorably received by petrarch yet his ideas on that delicate subject were much more platonic and metaphysical  sect xiv chaucers poem of

his works remain a proof that chaucer translated from some italian original is that in a manuscript which i have seen of this poem i find mnesteo for menestes rupheo for ruphes phebuseo for phebuses

latin in my tongue it write l ii v  0 seq but sir francis kinaston who translated troilus and cresseide      into latin rhymes says that chaucer in this poem has taken the liberty of his own

not reach l iii v    0 bot sothe is though i can not tellen all as can mine author of his excellence see also l iii           he calls it a litill tragedy l ult v       troilus is supposed to have seen cresside in a temple and retiring to his chamber is thus naturally described in the critical situation of a lover examining his own mind after the first impression of love  and when that he in chamber was alone he down upon his beddis fete him set and first he began to sihe sigh  and then to groan and thought aie on her so withoutin let that as he satte and woke his spirit met thought imagined  that he her saugh and temple and all the wise manner  right of her look and began it new avise l i v      there is not so much nature in the sonnet to love which follows it is translated from petrarch and had chaucer followed his own genius he would not have disgusted us with the affected gallantry and exaggerated compliments which it extends through five tedious stanzas the doubts

aien it went but at the last as that her eyin glent glanced  aside anon she began his sword aspie as it lay bear and began for fere to cry and askid him why he had it outdrawe and troilus anon the cause her told and how therewith himself he would have slawe for which creseide upon him began behold and began him in her armis fast to fold and said o mercy god to which a deed alas how nere we

pope has imitated this piece with his usual elegance of diction and harmony of versification but in the mean time he has not only misrepresented the story but marred the character of the poem he has endeavored to correct it is extravagancies by new refinements and additions of another cast but he did not consider that extravagancies are essential to a poem of such a structure and even constitute it is beauties an attempt to unite order and exactness of imagery with a subject formed on principles so professedly romantic and anomalous is like giving corinthian pillars to a gothic palace when i

circumstance invented by boccacio as the cause which gave rise to his decameron or the relation of his hundred stories it is remarkable that boccacio chose a greek title that is  for his tales he has also given grek names to the ladies and gentlemen who recite the tales his eclogues are full of greek words this was natural at the revival of the greek language  is by no means so happily conceived as that of chaucer for a similar purpose boccacio supposes that when the plague began to abate at florence ten young persons of both sexes retired to a country house two miles from the city with a design of enjoying fresh air and passing ten days agreeably their principal and established amusement instead of playing at chess after dinner was for each to tell a tale one superiority which among others chaucers plan afforded above that of boccacio was the opportunity of displaying a variety of striking and dramatic characters which would not have easily met but on such an expedition a circumstance which also contributed to give a variety to the stories and for a number of persons in their situation so natural so practicable so pleasant i add so rational a mode of entertainment could not have been imagined  the canterbury tales are unequal and of various merit few if any of the stories are perhaps the invention of chacer i have already spoken at large of the knights tale one of our authors noblest compositions the reader will excuse my irregularity in not considering it under the canterbury tales i have here given the reason which is my apology in the text  that of the canterbury tales which deserves the next place as written in the higher strain of poetry and the poem by which milton describes and characterises chaucer is the squiers tale the imagination of this story consists in arabian fiction engrafted on gothic chivalry nor is this arabian fiction purely the sport of arbitrary fancy it is in great measure founded on arabian learning cambuscan a king of tartary celebrates his birthday festival in the hall of his palace at sarra with the most royal magnificence in the midst of the solemnity the guests are alarmed with a miraculous and unexpected

revelling in his hall with many knights is suddenly alarmed by the entrance of a gigantic figure of a black man mounted on a black steed this terrible stranger without receiving any obstruction from

by the king of araby and inde to cambuscan in honor of his feast the horse of brass on the skillful movement and management of certain secret springs transported his rider into the most distant region of the world in the space of twentyfour hours for as the rider chose he could fly in the air with the swiftness of an eagle and again as occasion required he could stand motionless in opposition to the strongest force vanish on a sudden at command and return at his masters call the mirror of glass was endued with the power of showing any future disasters which might happen to cambuscans kingdom and discovered the most hidden machinations of treason the naked sword could pierce armor deemed impenetrable were it as thik as is a branchid ok and he who was wounded with it could never be healed unless its possessor could be entreated to stroke the wound with its edge the ring was intended for canace cambuscans daughter and while she bore it in her purse or wore it on her thumb nabled her to

another place the favorite philosophical studies of the arabians diss i ii  in this poem the nature of those studies is displayed and their operations exemplified and this consideration added to the circumstances of tartary being the scene of action and arabia the country from which these extraordinary presents are brought induces me to believe this story to be one of the many fables which the arabians imported into europe at least it is formed on their principles their sciences were tinctured with the warmth of their imaginations and consisted in wonderful discoveries and mysterious

that it was the most popular of all boccacios tales for the benefit of those who did not understand italian and to spread its circulation he translated it into latin with some alterations petrarch relates this in a letter to boccacio and adds that on showing the translation to one of his paduan friends the latter touched with the tenderness of the story burst into such frequent and violent fits of tears that he could not read to the end in the same letter he says that a veronese having heard of the paduans exquisiteness of feeling on this occasion resolved to try the experiment he read the

the importance and affectation of sagacity with which dame partlett communicates her medical advice and displays her knowledge in physic is a ridicule on the state of medicine and its professors v  0 0   in another strain the cock is thus beautifully described and not without some striking and picturesque allusions to the manners of the times   a cock hight chaunticlere in all the land of crowing nas his pere his voice was merier than the merry orgon on massedaies that in the churchis gone well sikerer clearer was his crowing in his loge pen yard  than is a clock or abbey horologe  his comb

flower and like the burnid gold was his color v      in this poem the fox is compared to the three archtraitors judas iscariot virgils sinon and ganilion who betrayed the christian army under charlemagne to the saracens and is mentioned by archbishop turpin v      see also monk t v  0   here also are cited as writers of high note or authority cato physiologus or pliny the elder boethius on

fol     b edit       and by the way about forty verses belonging to this argument are translated from the same chapter of the polycraticon in the wife of baths prologue mention is made in this prologue of st jerome and theophrast on that subject v         the author of the polycraticon quotes thophrastus from jerome viz fertur auctore hieronimo aurcolus theophrasti libellus de non ducenda uxore fol     a chaucer likewise on this occasion cites valrie v     this is not the favorite historian of the middle ages valerius maximus it is book written by walter mapes archdeacon of oxford under the assumed name of valerius entitled valerius ad ruinum de non ducenda uxore this piece is in the bodleian library with a large gloss mss dibg     ii     mapes perhaps adopted this name because one valerius had written a treatise on the same subject inserted in st jeromes works some copies of this prologue instead of valeric and theophrast read paraphrast if that be the true reading which i do not believe chaucer alludes to the gloss abovementioned helowis cited just afterward is the celebrated eloisa trottula is mentioned v     among the manuscripts of merton college in oxford is

of chaucers tales in the comic species but i am of opinion that the millers tale has more true humor than either not that i mean to palliate the levity of the story which was most probably chosen by chaucer in compliance with the prevailing manners of an unpolished age and agreeable to ideas of festivity not always the most delicate and refined chaucer abounds in liberties of this kind and this must be his apology so does boccacio and perhaps much more but from a different cause the licentiousness of boccacios tales which he composed per cacciar le malincolia delle femine to amuse the ladies is to be vindicated at least accounted for on other principles it was not so much the consequence of popular incivility as it was owing to a particular event of the writers age just before boccacio wrote the plague at florence had totally changed the customs and manners of the people only a few of the women had survived this fatal malady who having lost their husbands parents or friends gradually grew regardless of those constraints and customary formalities which before of course influenced their behavior for want of female attendants they were obliged often to take men only into their service and this circumstance greatly contributed to destroy their habits of delicacy and gave an opening to various freedoms and indecencies unsuitable to the sex and frequently productive of very serious consequences as to the monasteries it is not surprising that boccacio should have made them the scenes of his most libertine stories the plague had thrown open their gates the monks and nuns wandered abroad and partaking of the common liberties of life and the levities of the world forgot the rigor of their institutions and the severity of their ecclesiastical characters at the ceasing of the plague when the religious were compelled to return to their cloisters they could not forsake their attachment to these secular indulgences they continued to practice the same free course of life and would not submit to the disagreeable and unsocial injunctions of their respective orders cotemporary historians give a shocking representation of the unbounded debaucheries of the florentines on this occasion and ecclesiastical writers mention this period as the grand epoch of the relaxation of monastic discipline boccacio did not escape the censure of the church for these compositions his conversion was a point much labored and in expiation of his follies he was almost persuaded to renounce poetry and the heathen authors and to turn carthusian but to say the truth boccacios life was almost as loose as his writings till he was in great measure reclaimed by the powerful remonstrances of his master petrarch who talked much more to the purpose than his confessor this boccacio himself acknowledges in the fifth of his eclogues which like those of petrarch are enigmatical and obscure entitled philosotrophos  but to return to the millers tale the character of the clerk of oxford who studied astrology a science then in high repute but under the specious appearance of decorum and the mask of the serious philosopher carried on intrigues is painted with these lively circumstances  this clerk yclepid was hend nicholas the gntle nicholas  of derne scret love he couth and of solas and thrto was he sly and right prive and like unto a maidin for to se a chamber

scholar continuing the farce gravely acquaints the former that he has been all this while making a most important discovery by means of astrological calculations he is soon persuaded to believe the prediction and in the sequel which cannot be repeated here this humourous contrivance crowns the scholars schemes with success and proves the cause of the carpenters disgrace in this piece the reader observes that the humor of the characters is made subservient to the plot  i have before hinted that chaucers obscenity is in great measure to be imputed to his age we are apt to form romantic and exaggerated notions about the moral innocence of our ancestors ages of ignorance and simplicity are thought to be ages of purity the direct contrary i believe is the case rude periods have that grossness of manners which is not less friendly to virtue than luxury itself in the middle ages not only the most flagrant violations of modesty were frequently practiced and permitted but the most infamous vices men are less ashamed as they are les polished great refinement multiplies criminal pleasures but at the same time prevents the actual commission of many enormities at least it preserves public decency and suppresses public licentiousness  the reves tale or the miller of trompington is much in the same style but with less humor see also the shipmans tal which was originally taken from some comic frenh trobadour but chaucer had it from boccacio the story of zenobia in the monks tale i from boccacios cas vir illustr see lydg boch viii   that of hugolin of pisa in the same tale from dante that of pedro of spain from archbishop turpin ibid of julius caesar from lucan suetonius and valerius maximus ibid the idea of this tale was suggested by boccacios book on the same subjec  this story was enlarged by chaucer from boccacio decamer giom ix nov    there is an old english poem on the same plan entitled a right pleasant and mery history of the mylnr of aington with his wife and

and hearne bened abb i praeat p xl lv i am of opinion that solerehall in cambridge mentioned in this poem was aula solarii the hall with the upper story at that time a sufficient circumstance to distinguish and deominate one of the academical hospitia although chaucer calls it a great college v    thus in oxford we had chimneyhall aula cum camino an almost parallel proof of the simplicity of their ancient houses of learning twyne also mentions solerehall at oxford also aula selarii which i doubt not is properly solarii compare wood ant oxon ii    col i    col i    col   caius will have it

at least evidently written after the time of chaucer it is the work of some tasteless imitator who has sufficiently disguised his original by retaining none of its spirit i mention these circumstances lest it should be thought that this frigid abridgment was the groundwork of chaucers poem on the same subject in the class of umourous or satirical tales the sompnours tale which exposes the tricks and extortions of the mendicant friars has also distinguished merit this piece has incidentally been mentioned above with the plowmans tale and pierce plowman  genuine humor the concomitant of true taste consists in discerning improprieties in books as well as characters we therefore must remark under this class another tale of chaucer which till lately has been looked upon as a grave heroic narrative i mean the rhyme of sir thopas chaucer at a period which almost realised the manners of romantic chivalry discerned the leading absurdities of the old romances and in this poem which may be justly called a prelude to don quixote has burlesqued them with exquisite ridicule that this was the poets aim appears from many passages but to put the matter beyond a doubt take the words of an ingenious critic we are to observe says he that this was chaucers own tale and that when in the progress of it the good sense of the host is made to break in upon him and interrupt him chaucer approves his disgust and changing his note tells the simple instructive tale of meliboeus a moral tale virtuous as he terms it to show what sort of fictions were most expressive of real life and most proper to be put into the hands of the people it is further to be noted that the book of the giant olyphant and child thops was not a fiction of his own but a story of antique fame and very celebrated in the days of chivalry so that nothing could better suit the poets design of discrediting the old romances than the choice of this venerable legend for the vehicle of his ridicule upon them see dr hurds letters on chivalry and romance dialogues etc iii     edit       but it is to be remembered that chaucers design was intended to ridicule the frivolous descriptions and other tedious impertinencies so common in the volumes of chivalry with which his age was overwhelmed not to degrade in general or expose a mode of fabling whose sublime extravagancies constitute the mavelous graces of his own cambuscan a composition which at the same time abundantly demonstrates that the manners of romance are better calculated to answer the purposes of pure poetry to captivate the imagination and to produce surprise than the fictions of classical antiquity  sect xvii but chaucers vein of humor although conspicuous in the canterbury tales is chiefly displayed in the characters with which they are introduced in these his knowledge of the world availed him in a peculiar degree and enabled him to give such an accurate picure of ancient manners as no cotemporary nation has transmitted to postrity it is here that we view the pursuits and employments the customs and diversions of our ancestors copied from the life and represented with equal truth and spirit by a judge of mankind whose penetration qualified him to discern their foibles or discriminating peculiarities and by an artist who understood that proper selection of circumstances and those predominant characteristics which form a finished portrait we are surprised to find in so gross and ignorant an age such talents for satire and for observation on lif qualities which usually exert themselves at more civilized periods when the improved state of society by subtilising our speculations and establishing uniform modes of bhaviour disposes mankind to study themselves and renders deviations of conduct and singularities of character more immediately and necessarily the objcts of censure and ridicule these curious and valuable remains are specimens of chaucers native genius unassisted and unalloyed the figures are all british and bear no suspicious signatures of classical italian or french imitation the characters of theophrastus are not so lively particular and appropriated a few traites from this celebrated part of our author yet too little tasted and understood may be sufficient to prove and illustrate what is here advanced  the character of the prioresse is chiefly distinguished by an excess of delicacy and decorum and an affectation of courtly accomplishments but we are informed that she was educated at the school of stratford at bow near london perhaps a fashionable seminary for breeding nuns  there

the character of the host or master of the tabarde inn where the pilgrims are assembled is conspicuous he has much good sense and discovers great talents for managing and regulating a large company and to him we are indebted for the happy proposal of obliging every pilgrim to tell a story during their journey to canterbury his interpositions between the tales are very useful and enlivening and he is something like the chorus on the grecian stage he is of great service in encouraging each person to begin his part in conducting the scheme with spirit in making proper observations on the merit or tendency of the several stories in settling disputes which must naturally arise in the course of such an entertainment and in connecting all the narratives into one continued system his love of good cheer experience in marshalling guests address authoritative deportment and facetious disposition are thus expressively displayed by chaucer  great chere our host made us everichone and to the

v      chaucers scheme of the canterbury tales was evidently left unfinished it was intended by our author that every pilgrim should likewise tell a tale on their return from canterbury or rather two on their way thither and two on their return only chaucer himself tells two tales the poet says that there were twentynine pilgrims in company but in the characters he describes more among the tales which remain there are none of the prioresses chaplains the haberdasher carpynter web dyer tapicer and host the chanon yeman has a tale but no character the plowmans tale is certinly supposititious

to this deficiency and with this view to have written a tale called the marchaunts second tale or the history of beryn it was first printed by urry who supposed it to be chaucers urr chauc p      in the prologue which is of considerable length there is some humor and contrivance in which the author happily enough continues to characterise the pilgrims by imagining what each did and how each behaved when they all arrived at canterbury after dinner was ordered at their inn they all proceed to the cathedral at entering the church one of the monks sprinkles them with holy water the knight with the better sort of the company goes in great order to the shrine of thomas a beckett the miller and his companions run staring about the church they pretend to blazon the arms painted in the glass windows and enter into a dispute in heraldry but the host of the tabarde reproves them for their improper behavior and impertinent discourse and directs them to the martyrs shrine when all had finished their devotions they return to the inn in the way thither they purchase toys for which that city was famous called canterbury brochis and here much facetiousness passes betwixt the friar and the sompnour in which the latter vows revenge on the former for telling a tale so palpably levelled at his profession and protests he will retaliate on their return by a more severe story when dinner is ended the host of the tabarde thanks all the company in form for their several tales the party then separate till suppertime by agreement the knight goes to survey the walls and bulwarks of the city and explains to his son the squier the nature and strength of them mention is here made of great guns the wife of bath is too weary to walk far she proposes to the prioresse to divert themselves in the garden which abounds with herbs proper for making salves others wander about the streets the pardoner has a low adventure which ends much to his disgrace the next morning they proceed on their return to southwark and our genial master of the tabarde just as they leave canterbury by way of putting the company into good humor begins a panegyric on the morning and the month of april some lines

themes of unbounded variety that his merit was not less in painting familiar manners with humor and propriety than in moving the passions and in representing the beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and sublimity in a word that he appeared with all the luster and dignity of a true poet in an age which compelled him to struggle with a barbarous language and a national want of taste and when to write verses at all was regarded as a singular qualification it is true indeed that he lived at a time when the french and italians had made considerable advances and improvements in poetry and although proofs have already been occasionally given of his imitations from these sources i shall close my account of him with a distinct and comprehensive view of the nature of the poetry which subsisted in france and italy when he wrote pointing out in the mean time how far and in what manner the popular models of those nations contributed to form his taste and influence his genius  i have already mentioned the troubadours of provence and have observed that they were fond of moral and allegorical fables see supr p      a taste for this sort of composition they partly acquired by reading boethius and the psychomachia of prudentius two favorite classics of the dark ages and partly from the saracens their neighbors in spain who were great inventors of apologues the french have a

admitted the most licentious excursions of fancy in forming personifications and in feigning imaginary bings and ideal habitations under these we may rank chaucers house of fame which i have before hinted to have been probably the poduction of provence  but the principal subject of their poems dictated in great measure by the spirit of chivalry was love especially among the troubadours of rank and distinction whose castles being crowded with ladies presented perpetual scenes of the most splendid gallantry this passion they spiritualised into various metaphysical refinements and filled it with abstracted notions of visionary perfection and felicity here too they were perhaps influenced by their neighbors the saracens whose philosophy chiefly consisted of fantastic abstractions it is manifest however that nothing can exceed the profound pedantry with which they treated this favorite argument they defined the essence and characteristics of true love with all the parade of a scotist in his professorial chair and bewildered their imaginations in speculative questions concerning the most desperate or the most happy situations of a sincere and sentimental heart in the mean time the greatest libertie and indecencies were practiced and encouraged these doctrines did not inluence the manners of the times in an old french tale a countess in the absence of her lord having received a

of their affectation in writing on this subject in which the poet under the gency of allegorical personages displays the gradual approachs and impediments to fruition and introduces a regular disputation conducted with much formality between reason and a lover chaucers testament of love is also formed on this philosophy of gallantry it is a lovers parody of boethiuss book de consolatione

establishments consisted of ladies and gentlemen of the highest rank exercised and approved in courtesy who tried with the most consummate ceremony and decided with supreme authority cases in love

relating to the antint manners and ancient poetry of the french the public waits with impatience for the history of the provencial poets written by mons de la curne de saint palaye who has copied most of their manuscripts with great care and expense    not long afterward on the same principle a society was established in languedoc called the fraternity of the penitents of love enthusiasm was here carried to as high a pitch of extravagance as ever it was in religion it was a contention of ladies and gentlemen who should best sustain the honor of their amorous fanaticism their object was to prove the excess of their love by showing with an invincible fortitude and consistency of conduct with no less obstinacy of opinion that they could bear extremes of heat and cold accordingly the resolute knights and esquires the dames and damsels who had the hardiness to embrace this severe institution dressed themselves during the heat of summer in the thickest mantles lined with the warmest fur in this they demonstrated according to the ancient poets that love works the most wonderful and extraordinary changes in winter their love again perverted the nature of the seasons they then clothed themselves in the lightest and thinnest stuffs which could be procured it was a crime to wear fur on a day of the most piercing cold or to appear with a hood cloak gloves or muff the flame of love kept them sufficiently warm fires all the winter were utterly banished from their houses and they dressed their apartments with evergreens in the most intense frost their beds were covered only with a piece of canvass it must be remembered that in the mean time they passed the greater part of the day abroad in wandering about from castle to castle insomuch that many of these devotees during so desperate a pilgrimage perished by the inclemency of the weather and died martyrs to their profession see d vaisette hist du languedoc om iv p     seq compare p     note y   the early universality

much consequence consider how powerfully petrarch must have been influenced to talk of love in so peculiar a strain by studying the poets of provence his triumfo di amore has much imagery copied from

edit      ol  it is a proof of the decay of invention among the french in the beginning of the fourteenth century that about that period they began to translate into prose their old metrical romances such as the fables of king arthur of charlemagne of oddegir the dane of renaud of montauban and other illustrious champions whom their early writers had celebrated in rhyme these translations in which the originals were much enlarged produced an infinite number of other romances in prose and the old metrical romances soon became unfashionable and negleced the romance of perceforrest one of the largest of the french romances of chivalry was written in verse about    0 it was not ill many years afterward translated into pros m falconet an ingenious enquirer into the early literature of france is of opinion that the most ancient romances such as that of the round table were first written in latin prose it being well known that turpins charlemagne as it is now extant was originally composed in that language he thinks they were translated into french rhymes and at last into french prose tells que nous les avons aujourduy see hist acad inscript vii     but part of this doctrine may be justly doubted  at length about the year    0 in the place of the provencial a new species of poetry succeeded in france consisting of chants royaux with regard to the chaunt royal pasquier describes it to be a song in honor of god the holy virgin or any other argument of dignity especially if joined with distress it was written in heroic stanzas and closed with a lenvoy or stanza containing a

the index to wartons history of english poetry which is here presented to the world was not originally intended for publication the great inconvenience arising from the want of its assistance must have been severely felt by all who have in the course of their literary pursuits had occasion to refer to this noble treasure of poetical knowledge to obviate the disadvantage as it related exclusively to himself the compiler at a period of leisure drew out the present index the experience of its utility suggested the idea of multiplying the copies by which it is trusted that a commendable service has been rendered to literature though none can with reason think these pages wholly useless some may not find it needful to their studies to possess them therefore it has been thought fit to suffer the impression of them to fall far short of that of the history it does not exceed onefourth of the number  whether an entire index of the three volumes together would not have been a plan more desirable than that which has been pursued is a question not now to be examined it has been considered and this is the reply the history of english poetry is an unfinished work the learned and elegant historian was gathered to his fathers almost in the midst of his instructive and entertaining labors much yet remains to be done and as it is the reverse of improbable that some other foot we faintly hope passibus aequis will traverse the ground which he has left untrodden it cannot be denied that with regard to uniformity a separate table to each volume was the preferable mode to adopt  if an index be copious and correct it possesses the first qualities belonging to the nature of such an undertaking this merit as far as human diligence could succeed the compiler claims
