chesterfields arrival in ireland a midst the applause which art and learning brings listen o stanhope to what nature sings though rude the notes yet noble is the choice the subject only can support the voice illustrious guest whose happy wisdoms known to belgian councils as to britains throne whose tongue inspired an unresolving state and fixed britannias as europas fate fired with the glories of thy splendid name through various climates still pursued by fame to thee a muse untaught in latian lays or grecian style her voice obscure would raise wrapped in the theme sublime would proudly soar and sound thy welcome to her native shore thee even factions with one voice require and heaven and george indulge the strong desire see bending crowds with willing hearts obey and grateful own the delegated sway though never great brunswick to hibernia rise but shines afar and gladens other skies his godlike power beneficent we view effulgent and reflected all from you lo thus the silver substitute of day supplies his absence with a borrowed ray over the gay globe with gentle beam presides chears the wild waste and rules the teeming tides whose heaving bosom swells the public store with wealth and plenty from each distant shore in expectation flocks the tuneful throng and glows to hail thee with a grateful song as birds exulting on the eager wing salute the dawnings of the gladsome spring their pouring throats employ from spray to spray to greet the sun and bless the genial day each raptured muse shall now resume her lyre swell the full chords and sweep the sounding wyre sacred to thee the melting strain shall flow to thee the numbers and the strains they owe thrice happy genius in whose soul conspire the statesmans wisdom and the poets fire o friend to arts revive our drooping isle and make those arts by thy indulgence smile even here thy presence shall their strength restore though congreve steel roscommon are no more though morris modest hides his heavenly strains and britains senate noble boil detains though swift be dumb for swift ierne weeps the pride the parent of his country sleeps his clouded soul now darts no dazzling ray and faintly warms the animated clay not romes sad ruins such impressions leave as reason buried in the bodys grave his living lines shall mix their sacred fire in natures blaze and with thy works expire nor you great sir on these weak numbers frown which mourn a swift and sing thy just renown such strains alas as my unlettered hand trembling would reach thee on the crowded strand but thronging thousands intercept my way and deafning ios drown my feeble lay yet if a moment from the toils of state and all the burden of a kingdoms weight some little leisure to the muse you lend each leisure moment is the muses friend permit my lord that my unpolished lays may hope for pardon though they fail to please to the right honorable the countess of chfsterfield occasioned by her procuring a pardon for two soldiers condemned for desertion what means this dismal sound that march so slow this solemn sadness and this pomp of woe behold two victims pale and trembling led already numbered with the unheeded dead what ghastly terrors on each brow we trace see death imprinted on each dying face yet love of life asserts its eager claim but hope alas affords no flattering gleam lo the pale king in horrid pomp appears what cruel eye could then refrain from tears what heart relentless then forbear to melt who saw their sorrows but like sorrows felt how sad the conflict how severe the strife of wretches clinging to the verge of life when angry justice claimed her promised prey and frowned vindictive on the kind delay thy saving mercy in that moment flew the darling attribute of heaven and you to soft compassion won thy willing lord his justice tempring sheathed the uplifted sword and in that dismal that tremendous hour snatched the pale victims from the offended power as when by adverse stars or chance misled enticed by lucre or impelled by dread a wretch from some high rocks stupendous brow hangs over the waves and dreadful depths below the slender bough he grasps his only stay yields to his weight and more and more gives way of hope abandoned as the branch he tears he views the abyss and as he views despairs till some unhopdfor hand prevents his doom lifts him to life and lengthened years to come redeemed from fate nor yet restored to life they wondering pause and feel a doubtful strife if still on earth they breathe with human race or mix with shades in deaths obscure embrace till dawning hope the dubious horror clears reveals their safety and dispels their fears loud shouts of triumph waft thy name on high and stanhopes goodness fills the vaulted sky oh had thou power afflicted realms to spare and rescue europe from the waste of war fell rage and discord at thy nod should cease and all mankind enjoy the sweets of peace then human blood should deluge earth no more but leagues of commerce join each distant shore you like the dove the friendly branch should bring and blooming olives in each climate spring a golden age the guilty globe should see and scotia faithful as hibernia be no feuds intestine in her bosom jar no breath rebellious wakes the trump of war her martial tribe a generous fervor feels and virtues strength each steadfast hero steels for truth and freedom firmly they unite and stand resolved to tempt the hardy fight thy stanhopes presence shall each patriot fire and georges glory all their souls inspire on the spring the mounting sun with gladsome ray makes wanton nature smile each field looks green each garden gay and birds rejoice the while the surly winters now no more the lovely spring prevails no tempests dash the sounding shore or burst the rending sails soft breezes breathing through the grove already decked in green invite the thrush and turtle dove with philomel their queen in lays of love they waste the day while she enchants the night her bosom leaning on some spray to give the gloom delight the smiling shepherd now beholds with joy his teeming flocks and drives them bleating to their folds amid the vocal rocks the lusty swain with rapture steals by yonder friendly shade where with love songs and soothing tales he charms the listening maid since flora now her mantle throws on that tall mountains head so lately crowned with winters snows by surly boreas shed to phoebus praise let poets sing and sweep their joyful lyres whose cheerful beam restores the spring and every bard inspires on the lyingin hospital in dublin on outstretchd wings of glorious seraphs borne more bright than evening bow or radiant morn lo charity from heaven descends and heavenly joy her train attends serenely meek in smiles arrayed seraphic ardours on her wait celestial virtues shine displayed celestial pomp adorns her state around her throne obsequious move soft compassion pious love melting pity hopes that cheer and from the wretched drive despair divine benevolence before her stands grace in her smiles and bounty in her hands she comes religion to restore to banish care from every breast to raise the sick relieve the poor and give the weak and wearied rest all hail celestial goddess hail o charity sublime propitious spread thy sacred veil and cover every crime thy sacrifice all sin attones and still accepted mounts on high you ease the laboring mothers groans you hush the orphans cry you brighten every mortal gloom you soften anguish banish strife you take the helpless infant from the womb and hand it smiling into life devote to thee here goddess see thy votries kneel they fervent feel thy soulexalting fire rejoiced they rise above the skies where heavenly minds aspire celestial guest inflame each breast with social ardours mutual love still more refined make humankind till each be like the blessed above lines to lord chief justice singleton with love of lasting fame inspired i hung over swifts immortal page his matchless energy admired and kindled with poetic rage methought in a fine seat near drogheda where his lordship and the author were born bewlys blissful shade i lay near boynes smooth flowing tide where aged elms their arms displayed close by a crystal fountain side there to my ravished sight arose all natures charms all edens spring the enameled turf with violets glows and birds mid purple fragrance sing when lo a form divine appears advancing from a laure gloom with all the reverend marks of years with all the pomp of greece and rome his solemn port sublime displays each public worth each lettered grace his sacred head was crowned with bays and virtue triumphed in his face a pious fear filled all my mind as on the godlike seer i gazed to ecstacy and awe resigned i lay transported and amazed the muses all around him smile each nymph sustains a golden lyre the guardian genius of this isle sedate attends the sacred sire the shape etherial nearer drew in awful dignity arrayed his countrys father soon i knew the drapiers everhonourd shade the illustrious bard approached serene inclining gracious erc he spoke propitious smiles adorn his mien and from his lips these accents broke to thee even thee my care extends he said and reached his reverend hand to plume thy muse lo swift descends to guide thy flight thy fame expand let virtues power thy strains employ thy countrys friends be always thine her faithful sons still sing with joy and make the patriots merit shine high as thy native towers upraise midst yonder clouds their tops sublime his virtues soar who wakes thy lays inspires thy muse demands thy rhyme not athens walls more worth could boast though plato there imbibed his lore though tully thence to latiums coast transferred the bright immortal store a shining sage see boyne disclose who pours abroad bright wisdoms beams from his rich tongue persuasion flows and science sheds her lucid streams through distant climes his fame outspread in wide expanding rounds prevails he stands in lost astreas stead to poize aloft the unerring scales a worth like his my lyre might praise which flattrys finger never debased such splendid worth inspired my lays when singleton my numbers graced that honored sound my senses shook sudden the instructive vision fled reposed on swifts inspiring book i waking found my raptured head on mr popes death these lines to pope for ever sacred live the best a grateful mourning muse can give to him now numbered with the immortal dead this verse unfeigned with flowing eyes be read o thou applauded by the wise and great nor worth nor genius could postpone thy fate too long an exile from the worlds of bliss by envying angels snatched too soon from this thy strains seraphick shall their anthems raise give heaven new harmony and god new praise on a picture of our saviors examination before caiphas sent to his grace dr george stone lord primate of ireland on hallowed canvass see the savior shine and lowliest meekness temper beams divine unclouded sapience in his visage glows and from his eyes benign effulgence flows resigned and calm the worlds redeemer stands and bears with godlike patience impious bands the hebrew priest beholds that face with fear and pilates heart confessed a god was there no dread like this disturbs our pontiffs soul no conscious fears his rising joys control wrapped in the theme divine his bosom swells and on the sacred scene delighted dwells what pure emotions his warm soul expand when jesus stretches his appealing hand the spotless victim selfdevoted dies whilst angels waft the eternal sacrifice the glorious groupe elates his raptured mind by faith inflamed and love of humankind hail pious pastor thines the exalted rock the crook is

sense was fraught piercing his wit sagacious was his thought by nature fitted to discern aright whilst science sharpened and improved his sight but lost to virtue in his early way he walked the path which led him wide astray an ill example his strong passion sways the foul infection on his morals preys religion mocked he daily hears and sees endures it first then likes it by degrees till with the potent poison all overspread his conscience slumbers and his fears are fled now plunged in vice he feels no pang within but sports with death and basks secure in sin with horrid blasphemies is nightly pleased a dying savior and a god appeased are subjects made for shocking ridicule when wit runs wanton in the mad misrule religion fled had left no feeble trace nor in his heart remained one mark of grace perverse forlorn o death he is wholly thine a ripening victim to the wrath divine the angry bolt in heavens right hand grows red and aims destruction at his guilty head when gracious providence with smile serene bade melting mercy gently step between some angel guides him with celestial care and leads him heedless to the house of prayer where happily paulus in fair truths defense his armor reason and his weapon sense awful arose and with persuasive art displays the preachers and the apostles part destined the hardened sinner to subdue his words resistless as his cause was true the listening youth with conscious tremblings heard the mighty truths his powerful tongue declared alternate changes in his face arise the crimson blush in sudden paleness dies he stands amazed his eyes

of mortal life of truths involved we vainly boast to know or secrets sunk in natures womb too low where our short sight affords a feeble gleam like flitting visions in some wandering dream there wrapped in mazes of uncertainty suspending reason doubts her own decree discerns her weakness must her search confine too dim her optics and too short her line to fathom depths that in thick darkness lie and sink impervious to the mental eye a thousand things correct our wanton pride and doubts on doubts arise on every side what are the universal fabricks laws or if attraction be the immediate cause that knits the springs of the revolving sphere excites its movements makes its parts cohere through yonder arch a trackless space explore or mark the waves on this resounding shore what guides the stars in their stupendous course through complex motion and contending force how ebbing seas from shelving shores subside or circling cynthia swells the foaming tide what doors pour forth the furious northern blast or bitter breezes from the chilling east whence sudden tempests toss the boistrous deep or storms are hushed and on its surface sleep how rending earthquakes make the mountains rock and shrinking nature feels the dreadful shock of gravity the latent cause reveal why mounts the smoke or sinks the showry hail how flows the vein in yonder rocky rill or flash the sparkles from the stubborn steel what instinct moves the parsimonous ant or dictates to the unwieldy elephant how mind and matter strike such harmony and will and motion in one form agree whence dawn ideas whence perceptions ray whence gleams the soul with intellectual day thinternal essence of one atom show then boast of science and how much you know here glimmering reason lights our dubious way this twilight state forbids a brighter day through natures mist lo truth appears from far to few a fixed to more a wandering star their pole indeed who sail by wisdoms shore but lost to those who distant depths explore whose rays illusive often our sight misguide and lessen here what there they magnified our judgments vary as our passions bend caprice the motive and selflove the end opinions tinctured with complexions stains the mottley issue of discordant brains when formed by fancy in affections dress their differing sires in different shapes express from hence the fierce polemick hydra came from hence this system and that sect took name hence epicurus made his atoms dance and hence descartes thy physical romance from hence religion felt the wild extremes the bigot fury and enthusiasts dreams by dim conjectures we indulge our pride such doubtful knowledge is a dangerous guide the winking glimmer will our hopes deceive like dying lamps in some perplexing cave it lights us in while we with wonder gaze but soon extinguished in the gloomy maze bewildered where the lamp no more can burn we lose our labor and too late return our prying eyes would pierce all natures store unlock her secrets turn her treasures over yet far within she shuns the searching ray her mighty master keeps the mystic key a nearer views denied to mortal sight newton s transcendent day must bound in night well did eternal providence ordain in lifes short view to make the prospect plain where man may answer natures wholesome call enjoy himself and seek the good of all where known effects result from stated laws and loud proclaim the one eternal cause the source from whence the vast creation flows the mind from which ten thousand systems rose for these wise ends our faculties were made and god we see through all his works displayed beyond this limit man may spare his pains nor waste the vigor of his laboring brains in quest of truths remote from human sight which scape our ken and mocked the stagyrite the smallest worm insults the sages hand all greshams vanquished by a grain of sand the stinted lot allowed to human race the narrow bounds of our contracted space can scarce our minds with useful thoughts supply like afterfruits we just appear and die vain searches here our levity proclaim by tempests tossed who takes a steady aim when waves are dashing round the driven bark the pilots danger mocks his nice remark who would improve that knows no term to come or purchase diamonds to adorn a tomb by poor endeavors we solicit praise an empty idol which to pride we raise a frail defense to shield our names from death a fulsome vapor made of vulgar breath it is virtue lengthens out our mortal span immortal fame shall crown the virtuous man religions eye can soften human fate whilst hope from far beholds a better state if long or short it matters not our stay while reason smooths and peace prepares the way this irksome desert must be traveled through ere pisgahs top or canaans vales we view men glide like bubbles on the stream of time burst as they swell and vanish in their prime or floating down the universal tide encountring join and in the shock subside since god and nature some wise purpose plan in all this lower world but most in man a creature framed at such a vast expense enriched with reason and adorned with sense why would its makers hand so close confine to clogging clay this particle divine which outward casualties can still annoy and whose own motion must itself destroy when fullblown faculties his genius crown lo death assails and lops the pigmy down why all this labor on a thing that must as soon as finished fall again to dust thus reasons man whose reasnings often are vain and sees so little of the eternal chain from whence contingent destinies impend a scale of causes that in god must end the mystic mazes of his own decree in wonders wrapped which he alone can see yet man vile reptile with presumption pryes where trembling angels veil their wondering eyes imperious emmet know thy native dust thyself mistaken and thy maker just who gives thee rudiments of knowledge here then lifts thee upwards to a nobler sphere above the stars to take thy high degree and brighten on to all eternity where truth still shining in unclouded day shall all her radiance on thy soul display forbear vain man to murmur at thy fate nor mourn thy passage to a better state though nature binds thee to this sordid spot break from her bands and seek a happier lot to god alone let thy affections tend thy proper center and thy final end who out of nothing made the world and thee his wisdom formed and goodness bid it be eternal wisdom whilst yet all was night called forth from chaos his first creature light and spread its splendour over the wide expanse where orbs unnumberd move in mystic dance then smiled omnipotence his works to see he smiled in light and bid that lamp still be now blazed the sun in his bright orb above the morning stars in joyful measures move the listening angels in deep wonder gaze then joined the hymn and their first work was praise to the hon mrs conolly how pious worth exalted rank endears what lovely grandeur virtue lends to years what dignity humane what awful grace dwell in that mien and open in that face a mind thus blessed shall eye the last slow sand when tardy time uplifts his lenient hand with dauntless joy the untried state explore quit natures limits and with seraphs soar why else would piety her palm display why else invite us to the realms of day sure heaven had made the christian task too hard if goodness here could claim no just reward if faith farseeing found no chearing gleam nor evening hope enjoyed the morning beam lo dawning glories gild this vale of strife and heavens own lamp illumes the bounds of life sedate from thence thy tranquil eye now cast on future pleasures and enjoy the past pleasures sublime and pure still genuine glow which only hearts like thine can ever know where every virtue in warm league combined are treasured up in store for humankind thence flowing daily through thy generous hand relieve all care and glad a grateful land for thee incessant breathes the heartfelt prayer the wish unfeigned and the vow sincere for thee the widow lifts her tearless eyes for thee the orphans incense mounts the skies the public voice for thee still fervent prays and begs each blessing from thy length of days long here to flourish long thy power dispense ere heaven shall call and angels waft thee hence take then the plaudit to thy merit due the crown unfading and the triumph true how vain the tinsel pomp which monarchs claim the blaze of grandeur and the blast of fame those useless trappings of external state it is wisdom shines it is virtue makes them great such virtuous wisdom as adorns thy mind by hope exalted and by faith refined with grateful fervours must that bosom swell where pious confidence and meekness dwell the soul firm settled and the thought serene the part well acted and the closing scene appear triumphant to the exulting eye ere angels draw the curtain of the sky it is thine the debt of nature thus to pay and close the evening

times nor present shame give sanction to my rhimes how much would breeding and politeness fail should wits be frighted at a formal tale clear truths in such a garb would give offense what think to scar with bugbears men of sense thank heaven they bid these monkish dreams good night the clouds are gone and all again looks bright such sentiments there are such humors spread their noxious poison through the heart and head what learned cure can doctors here advise since fools extol what wiser knaves despise an odd experiment for once be tried inlist a poet on religions side let verse with all her youthful train appear and wit to virtue serve a volunteer at her own weapons foil the dextrous foe and shoot down folly with her favorite bow decked in bright arms let reason gaily tread first win the fancy then surprise the head since truth must like a pelted pillar stand the butt and aim of each fantastic hand that sacred pile whose rock eternal bears the rage of hostile storms and sapping years in vain the floods assault its steadfast base in vain would hell its heavenly form deface though eighteen rolling ages loud proclaim its strength unshaken and its height the same though half the kings who rule this pendent ball bow down their scepters and before it fall against it knaves their impious force will try and mimick fools their feeble bolts let fly say then my friend from whence this humor springs this bloated vice this angry form of things whose inbred venom stirs such tumid rage the bane and brand of this licentious age shall not the muse the hidden cause disclose probe the proud part the putrid plague expose regardless she who feels the pungent smart the head misguided or the highblown heart if priest or people most in fault she finds if pride oppresses or if envy blinds to both alike impartial she proceeds and forms her estimate of men by deeds say first why rolls the force of fashions tide so smoothly swift against religions side whilst down its stream the men of power throng the men of pleasure and the men of song drawn by the artful lord shaftsbury peers seducing lore join the gay crowd and seek the enchanting shore there the abandoned headlong and profane with pride press forwards and of priests complain bright as the beams that from the ocean rise when radiant rays adorn the eastern skies fair as the essence of etherial light dawning over chaos and coeval night pure as the gale that from arabia blows than lillies whiter or than falling snows religion shone when first the heavenborn maid with virgin truth and purity arrayed sublimely meek disclosed her angel face beaming celestial smiles and shedding grace her suffering sons the scourging rod sustain their province patience and their portion pain no pomp they seek no pageant power they need ambitious only for her sake to bleed in meekness robbed thus humble was her state she knew no wish so mean as to be great on heaven alone she fixed her steadfast eye her masters kingdom was beyond the sky she sought not wealth unanxious of her store for his example taught her to be poor thus in her blooming years oppressed she grew by patience armed the mighty to subdue how mild her mien how winning then her ways how different from her looks in later days the muse would spare what fullen truth may blame nor dwells delighted on so harsh a theme truth like the genial sun will still abide though vapors veil it and the clouds may hide could prying malice or could envy see religion leaning in the least degree to fetter freedom or bright reason blind or throw a tangling snare on humankind could one ingredient in that pure compound to parts pernicious or the whole be found the fool of wit with some pretense might fleer the coxcomb rally and the pedant sneer smart virro frankly

too much in haste to hear or offer reason at creeds he mocks how loud the laughing fit how willing to be damned to show his wit sporus forsooth allows some pious cheats but then such clumsey bugbears gross deceits such monkish phantoms make the juggle clear to men of sense the thing will still appear such arts indeed may vulgar minds restrain and graver fools who like may hug the chain to talk of fasting furity and grace with all that sanctity and form of face which pampered priests over velvet cushions wear would make a hermit smile a stoic stare when they aloft hold forth the cake and rod and point to paths which paul and peter trod to narrow paths they point and thorny ways and those who like may tread them if they please far other objects their affections fix in stalls to snore or in a coach and six mere censure is at best a poor pretense and malice ill supplies the place of sense reproach so keen when vulgar found and trite shows less of candor than of partial spite since pride in all and passions still abound since few are proof and none are perfect found to natures slips be kind allowance made and over her failings cast a friendly shade though priests indeed should good examples give yet priests have appetites and priests must live but why such wealth and grandeur why so great like lords attended and like kings they eat this more betrays the rancour of your will you would have the clergy barefoot beggars still still homeless wander through the world oppressed without protection or a place of rest the wealth they have was by the state bestowed or rather paid them as a debt it owed for shame no more such bitter railings bring you quarrel with the men and not the thing over vices watchful and to virtues blind by nature prone to prejudice inclined with sharpened

tend worthy so bright a guide so good a friend to a person of fine parts but whimsical humors of a cruel nature and bad morals why would wild nature with her bounty play and throw such treasures of her charms away with wasteful hand why lavish half her store enriching one while she left thousands poor or squander blessings on a stubborn land that ill requites the cheerful givers hand the surly glebe a mingled product shows the hateful hemlock and the fragrant rose shoot up promiscuous in our wondering sight and give at once both horror and delight bright sparks of diamond glitter through

in a breast abused when calm the clime o how serene the while yet storms lie brooding in a winters smile the fell hyena can the shepherd call with human voice designed his prey to fall that heaven should thus a reasoning being arm with seeming virtue and with every charm which wit and genius in their prime bestow to gild deceit and give a treacherous blow such fickle blandishments too often

infused malignance on thy natal hour for when thy soul did joves own hand employ it dashed thy essence with some cursed alloy which took the impression of each baleful ill in crooked traces and retains them still thy injured virtues in some weak essays like tender blades their blooming heads would raise but soon the stronger cockle choaks the grain and stifled goodness lifts itself in vain a

see his fathers warlike shade stalks near what quickraisd passions in his soul appear in horror fixed as thunderstruck he stands with starting eye balls and with outstretchd hands ten thousand tumults

moments of the midnight hour what time the branches bend beneath the snow and birds for safety seek the shadeless bower can i forget the music of thy tongue which spread around such high harmonions

looked up amazed the soopdish shaking in his heedless hands when dublin molly busy in the bar with wonder listened to his charming lay then blessed her happy fate who came so far to hear him sweetly sing from astons quay nor could the poets tongue his praise forbear who often came to hear his strains divine and in his cups would heartily declare his notes were sweeter than the tuneful nine thus jovial danced the smiling hours away when philomela gave such true delight good humor cheered the short thickclouded day and punch and pleasure crowned the livelong night but fate alas forbade our growing joys what human happiness can always last relentless fate which every life destroys at phillys breast his lifted javelin cast could no delight his mortal wrath assuage nor musicks power his pointed dart withstand in vain alas clarinda cleaned the cage in vain she fed him with her milkwhite hand how gladness danced within his little eyes still as he saw her decent cap and gown as up the steps she gently used to rise and in his highhung house she took him down how tenderly she stroakd his neck and bill how softly touched his taper legs and claws with lenient finger soothed each smarting ill and gently healed his little hurts and flaws but thou fell wretch that in the open street with savage hand our frighted songster struck may thou with screaming screechowls nightly meet with boding batts with bailiffs and bad luck may braying asses bitterns from the mire and croaking ravens haunt thee all thy life may baleful cats and cackling hens conspire and what is more dreadful

this the fruit of my fond toil my joy my pride my cheer shall one tempestuous hour thus spoil the labors of a year oh what avails that day by day i nursed the thriving crop and settled with my foot the clay and reared the social prop ambitions pride had spurred me on all gardeners to excel i often called them one by one and boastingly would tell how i prepared the furrowed ground and how the grain did sow then challenged all the country round for such an early blow how did their bloom my wishes raise what hopes did they afford to earn my honored masters praise and crown his cheerful board poor morris wrapped in sad surprise demands in sober mood should storms molest a man so wise a man so just and good ah morris cease thy fruitless moan nor at misfortunes spurn misfortunes not thy lot

skim the daisid lawn then perching on a lillys head stood smiling in the dawn young lesbia now amid the gales the breath of morn bestows fand by the fragrance which it steals from cowslips and the rose to yonder grotto arched with green the lovely nymph drew nigh the warbling thrush inchants the scene with bees which humming fly now placed within the blissfu  shade her sparrow fluttering round

he speeds the dart yet love himself shoots wide his arrow entered dickeys heart he on her bosom died who would not envy his sweet death and dickeys doom desire within her arms to yield his breath and on her breast expire to a young lady on her performing upon the harpsichord the muse who sung thy dawning praise now welcomes thy meridian rays the beauties of thy early prime first fledged her wings for flights sublime she saw thee shine like opening day along the tracts of heavens highway the muse prophetic saw thee there still brightning in thy lucid sphere now far unequal in her flight and lost in beams of dazling light on raptured wing she hails thy noon as soaring eagles seek the sun but o what numbers can she find to sing the beauties of thy mind where every virtue heaven bestows and every grace from heaven that flows a hallowed treasure all combine within that spotless ark divine which beaming forth so often declare that god vouchsafes to visit there to deck thee with distinguished love he took from every saint above ideas of the purest kind and mixing all composed thy mind then lodged it in the fairest mold that should a soul so rich infold a mold with fairest forms to vie in finished shape and symmetry harmonious to the ravished sight inspiring joy and soft delight enchanting all to instant love who hear thy voice or see thee move but when the tuneful keys you press and musicks inmost powers express what melting strains extatick rise how every raptured hearer dies see love his purple wings expand and flutter over the snowy hand from every finger flies a dart in every note he wounds a heart whilst conscious blushes still confess your kind concern for our distress and yet by heightning every grace the pain they would relieve increase for as in paintings shadows lie to raise the picture to the eye thy blushes thus but more reveal the modest worth they would conceal to cloe kind nature has cloe expressed to strike us with joy and surprise each grace in her form is confessed and cupids exult in her eyes her form so erect fair and tall such winning attraction displays her mind the best beauty of all my wish and affections still raise the nightingale chimes to her voice the sirens would yield to her song in echos the valleys rejoice her music inchants the gay throng lo summer has spangld the vales and roses their purple disclose the vilets enrich the soft gales and harmony heightens all those since beauty and rapture agree to ravish both hearing and sight o come my deac cloe with me and crown the gay scene with delight come with me my nymph to yon grove where the thrush and the linnet resort whose bowers invite us to love where cupids still revel and sport in bliss well enjoy the long day to mutual endearments resigned my

from the mouth of fame who spreads his bounty with unsparing hand and industry excites over all the land his canvass wings each distant coast explore and wast the wealth of either indias shore which flows enlivening in his countrys veins still more the publicks than his private gains so runs the sanguine current through the heart whilst every member shares a wholesome part would they who swell in higher rank and place the boast of vice the blush of human race with virtuous emulation wisely see a peoples parent and that parent thee no more should luxury licentious roam to waste abroad the wealth we want at home no more should wretchedness and want prevail nor hunger tempt the starving hand to steal nor should corruption with her gilded claws debauch our senates and debase the laws each wealthy chief would then a patriot be who for his country lives must live like thee but see where nature with distinguished grace adorns the prospect of this lovely place the birds harmonious chaunt on every tree to welcome to their groves the spring and thee there waving woods on lofty summits grow here silver lakes reflect their shades below the charming landscape glads the gazers heart and natures hand assists the hand of art yet art alone behold triumphant smile with all her pomp in yonder sacred pile whose solemn brow the steadfast eye commands the pious labor of religious hands which raised to heaven in these degenerate days it is founders faith and gratitude displays and shall inform remotest years to come when brunswick reigned and cleon reared the dome a noble task lies immature behind though often revolved within your generous mind yet still in embrio waits your powerful hand to form the symmetry and bid it stand when arches bend and swelling columns rise the stately edifice shall strike our eyes with simple majesty and solemn style at once to deck and dignify the pile the noble mass magnificent shall grow not vainly high nor yet ignobly low shall shine a

where health her bower has made to walk with wisdom in the social shade each sister virtue in her train is seen rejoiced to wait on sweet content their queen around her grott unfading verdure grows and bliss untainted from her fountain flows by nature called she quaffs the morning gale and sups with science in the muses vale content and nature in one mansion dwell and virtue near them builds her mossy cell happy the man who seeks not power or praise and with such meek associates spends his days from envy safe and wild ambitions sway no camps allure him and no courts betray from customs snares secure he turns aside the baits of passion and the springs of pride by prudence taught he points his mental ken through wisdoms glass and views the ways of men who grasp at fleeting good in each disguise and gaze on shadows with insatiate eyes with panting hearts each false delight pursue through fancys maze but still neglect the true by pride impelled in fairy rounds they roam to seek that bliss abroad which lives at home misguided man to passions power a prey by sense deceived by judgment led astray thou tool of folly in thy reasons spite renounce thy knowledge and do nature right did she the splendid ills of life impose increase thy wishes or create thy woes did she thy idol pride advance on high or lift thy daring thoughts to scale the sky did she inchant thee in the mystic glade to build on vapors and dissect a shade in fierce opinions forge to toil in vain and mould the phantoms of thy forming brain for specterd whims which sanguine fancy rears distort the center and confound the spheres did she the bigots furious breast inspire to spread his frantic schemes with sword and fire of all who breathe in earth in air or tides whom reason governs or whom instinct guides through natures realms no wretch like man is found who spurns her barriers and who breaks her bound still rushing lawless on his headlong mind leaves native joy and gentle peace behind he spreads the snares of fate in fashions loom and in each deep refinement digs his tomb ye sons of folly hither bend your eyes compare conditions and for once be wise here art adorns the smiling groves and fields she rules over nature and to nature yields with mutual scepter and successive sway by turns they govern and by turns obey bright order first and truth coeval rose to error still and discord endless foes eternal harmony through nature sounds gives brooks their borders and gives worlds their bounds established rectitude in all appears instinct the ant and concord moves the spheres why else should ecstasy my breast overflow when icy winters frown or roses blow when raging storms the mountain billows break or gentlest gales curl over the quivering lake here twilight groves my evening fancy woo the rook high cawing while the woodquests coo the colored cloud enriched with golden dies to crown yon bluerobd hill which props the skies the winding vale that spreads her mantld bloom the lake that glimmers through the verdant gloom here pendant lawns the limpid mirrors grace with blooming blushes and with varied face reflected beauties mid the crystal scene for ever purple and for ever green the sense and judgment at one view delight regale the fancy and surprise the sight with breast elate i climb the shapely mound an eden smiling where a chaos frowned over the grim rock a flowery mantle thrown with daisyd verdure decks the craggy stone from quarries rent which rugged rose and rude by rigor softened and by toil subdued the gentle slopes so easy here uprise as natures hand would human art disguise so when some awful sage whose manly mind by virtue warmed and love of humankind a savage race in wild disorder saw of barbarous manners fierce and brutal law with painful steps he wins his arduous way by slow degrees and bends them to obey till tamed at last in social state they stand by reason ruled and bless the forming hand on public worth let each delight attend delight the means but worth be still the end the virtuous cause shall wise effects procure who tills the fallowd glebe shall feed the poor shall make the rustic smile his garners groan and in his neighbors wealth enjoy his own for this the fields shall richer blooms display the groves shall gladden and the hills look gay for this the springs in lucid lakes shall flow the temples glitter and the gardens glow let me amid thy bowers delighted stray or on thy breezy summits waste the day wrapped in elysium wander through thy groves which calm reflection courts and fancy loves there in some murmuring grott my folly lose and drink oblivion with the sacred muse from airy hopes and groundless fears secure enjoy existence or its ills endure o solitude divine where reason dwells no pride provokes thee and no passion swells let me reposed in thy serene embrace from human evils far  from human race let me entranced on thy soft bosom lie and all the insulting storms of life defy there to itself restore the injured mind and be what nature and what god designed let then the statesman hatch his gilded schemes and canton kingdoms in extatic dreams in greedy visions grasp the incircld ball whilst butchered millions to his frenzy fall their pelf and party let the world pursue for what my friend has reason there to do from hostile storms escaped that harrassd dove now seeks her safety in the silent grove where you tread paths by thoughtful science made and court the muses in the lettered shade there at each towering system taught to smile which erring fancy founds or pride can pile there still on truth to fix your steadfast eyes and point out falsehood in her gay disguise there with your countrys weal your wishes blend to sacred freedom and her cause a friend by public virtue warmed your bosom glows and only slaves and tyrants are your foes but waft my muse to yonder bower thy strains where wisdom governs and where reason reigns where sweet content each vital blessing brings and over the genial board extends her wings there smiling concord fills her halcyon throne of joys sincere possessed  to kings unknown harmonious hearts her heavenly laws obey and waiting angels guide her peaceful sway what pleasing sounds thus circle through the gale what sweets extatick over my mind prevail ye zephyrs hush o sostly pant the breeze ye doves be dumb melinda strikes the keys as near i move my ravished senses find her music gives the image of her mind where tuneful passions gently rise and fall with tempered energy at reasons call that mental melody which art exceeds sounds in her words and varies in her deeds conn bial symphony whose equal tone still in her consorts wishes finds her own their circling joys in mutual measures move and every added day those joys improve but see their hopes to distant prospects run a blooming daughter and a darling son that growing bliss which ripening youth endears the pride and promise of maturer years by meekness robbed her gentle garb they wear for virtue formed them with peculiar care to lodge true worth their opening minds she dressed and filial duty came the foremost guest nor came alone she soon engaged a place for manly talents and for female grace then sense and wit their fair apartments fill by mild discretion guided at her will breeding and decency came next behind and honor raised and goodness warmed the mind beauty indeed would fain her place secure but angellike she waits at wisdoms door can there on earth exist more true delight or gracious heaven an happier pair unite esteem and worth in growing commerce blend and each a lover lives and each a friend to a friend on his marriage a choice so blessed heaven only could inspire to give a foretaste of the joys above how gaily native innocence lights up the charms of beautys powerful glance and shines conspicuous in her lovely smile mature in wit above her tender years she seems designed to show perfection in her dawn where fruits and blossoms charm at once our view and all the seasons meet the early spring let wealth no more over tender hearts prevail with magic glitter nor debase the mind to barter generous love for sordid gold gold from reluctant natures bowels rent the bane of peace and pest of humankind see here ye avaritious treasured gems through crystal caskets blaze gems brighter far than orient pearl or indias sparkling stone whose neverfading luster needs no foil on humble ground in native meekness set can hoarded pelf with such a fund compare to thousands slave the misers idol god the spendthrifts curse when beauty shines enriched from heavens inestimable boundless store with all the virtues that adorn the mind for social converse and the joys of life to sweeten cares and bless the married state when these united in one bosom dwell what monarch on his gorgeous throne elate shall proudly dare to claim so rich a prize and yet to thee her plighted hand she gave nor staid i ween her faithful heart behind in her embrace be thou as fully blessed as mortal essences can be who bliss consummate never here can know since cares intruding thrust themselves between and pain often petrifies the couch of down from these her arms a sure asylum yield where every anxious care shall refuge find and changed to joy corrode the heart no more may years returning in soft circles roll and lengthened days increase your growing loves till time shall passion into friendship turn when hoary wisdom makes the good exchange and reasons power those hands shall faster tie which fancy first and tender wishes joined lines inscribed to the right honorable
