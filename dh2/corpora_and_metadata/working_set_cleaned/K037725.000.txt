he is much to blame a comedy in five acts  as performed at the theater royal covent garden  london printed for g g and j robinson paternoster row  mdccxcviii  advertisement the author of he is much to blame is in some small degree indebted to le complaisant a comedy attributed to monsieur de ferriol pontdeveyle and to the tragedy of clavigo by goethe  prologue prologues in these sagacious days must not repeat the story and betray the plot for deep laid plots we sometimes have no doubt it is pity you cannot always find them out the secret must be kept and not be told in this at least we beat the bards of old we cannot endure our meaning you should guess and here again we boast complete success cautious lest you the mystery should discover we keep you in the dark  till all is over since these important points we must not name the title let us discuss he is muchto blame to blame ay surely very much but who the author well that is nothing very new and what does blame induce why punishment rashly we sin and leisurely repent lured by that tempting bait a nine nights bonus these scribbling sinners multiply upon us then prologues write to whine cajole and tickle begging you will burn the rod you have laid in pickle shielding himself by these and such like arts he hopes to hurl with surer aim his darts but strike and cry when we receive a blow is arrant cowardice i told him so he is mad who would the field of battle tread unless he hoped to have a broken head there is honor in such scars  he will win and wear it then give him honor plenty never spare it but should it be your

antiquity well and such too have been my maxims practically all my life have i been wavering uncertain and indeterminate a sagacious skeptic without knowing it and as it were by instinct it was but lately i discovered what a wise man i am and yet it seems to me as if i were scarcely half wise enough for i am told that i am to doubt of every thing which i find rather difficult for example that my wife lady vibrate is an extravagant rackety rantipole woman of fashion can i doubt that no that she squanders my money disturbs my peace and contradicts for contradictions sake can i doubt that no then have i not a daughter to marry a law suit to begin and a thousand perplexing affairs so that i do not know which way to turn why all this appears true to me but the skeptics teach that appearances deceive and that nothing is certain i may be lord vibrate or i may be the grand turk these doctrines are prodigiously deep considers but i must think of something else just now i have a

you  pray what is your opinion sir george is it not dangerous for a man to have the character of being charitable   sir g no doubt my lord it is the very certain way for his house to be besieged by beggars   lord v the master who pays the debts of one domestic makes himself the debtor of all the rest   sir g he changes a set of servants into a set of duns he first encourages them to be extravagant and then makes it incumbent upon himself to pay for their follies and vices he not only bribes them to be idle and insolent but to waste his property as well as their own   lord v it is as you say a very serious case i  i am sorry for your misfortune mr thompson  very sorry  but  really    sir g misfortune what misfortune   lord v he has foolishly been bound for his sisters husband and must go to prison for the debt   sir g to prison   lord v you have shown me how dangerous it would be for me to interfere   sir g very true very true  he has lived with your lordship several years   lord v he has and i esteem him highly   sir g a worthy man whom it would be no disgrace to call your friend   lord v none still however consequences must be weighed i must take time to consider it is

fine virtue  two  i would advise your lordship to it by all means  hundred and forty  looks round will you permit me just to write a short memorandum a bit of a note goes to a table i must send to a certain place writes excuse me a moment   lord v what can be done in this affair mr thompson   thom nothing my lord i am resigned when i assisted my brother i did no more than my duty those who lock me up in a prison may for aught i know do theirs yet though they are at liberty and i shall be confined i would neither change duties nor hearts with them going   sir g harkye harkye mr thompson will you just desire this to be taken as it is directed aside to him dont say a word it is a draft on my banker discharge your debt and be silent  you are very right my lord we cannot be too considerate lest by mistaken benevolence we should encourage vice   thom sir george my lord   sir g why now will you not oblige me mr thompson pray let that be delivered as it is directed you surely will not deny me such a favor  for you know my lord if we give    thom indeed i    sir g will you begone will you begone pushes him kindly off  if we give without  without    lord v poor fellow i suppose he is afraid of being taken   sir g oh is that it  if we give i say with  too  pshaw i have lost the thread of my argument   lord v i must own this is a dubious case perhaps i ought to pay the money calls mr thompson  i dont think i ought to let him go to prison what shall i do sir george   sir g whatever your lordship thinks best   lord v but there is the difficulty  mr thompson he is gone how foolish this is now as he is going off harry run after mr thompson and call him back one would think a man going to prison would like me be wise enough to doubt and take time to consider of it  exit scene x
