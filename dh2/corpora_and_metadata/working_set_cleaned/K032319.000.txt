tableau  la vergne del m var gucht sc    the wonder a woman keeps a secret a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by her majestys servants  written by the author of the gamester  london printed for e curll at the dial and bible against st dunstans church in fleet street and a bettesworth at the red lion on london bridge       to his serene highness george augustus electoral prince of hanover duke and marquess of cambridge earl of milfordhaven viscount northallerton baron of tewksbury and knight of the most noble order of the garter may it please your highness this dedication which i always intended to address to your highness and which i was in hopes might have congratulated you upon your being in england must now wait for your arrival i am sure i speak the sense of every honest briton when i say that we expect it with the utmost impatience  your highness who has been hitherto a stranger among us cannot easily conceive the confidence we repose in you and it will perhaps hardly be believed in future ages that the first report of the duke of cambridges design to visit us should raise the public credit of the british nation  we are filled with pleasure to think that the most accomplished of princes will perfect himself in the arts of government under the eye and direction of the greatest of queens  if it is possible there should be a set of men among us who can wish to see their country become a province of france it is i think pretty evident that your residence in great britain will soon put an end to such impious expectations  the law of nature makes it not improbable that you will one day reign over us and what may not our posterity expect from a prince who in his early years distinguished himself in the cause of liberty and led their ancestors on to victory the balance of europe will doubtless be kept steady by that hand which has already performed such wonders in order to maintain it our religion our laws and civil rites can be in no danger under a prince who from his conversation with our nobility and his presence at their most important debates will have a perfect insight into all the parts of our constitution  britain shall from henceforward claim your highness entirely as her own and endeavor by the most convincing proofs of her love and respect to make you forget the court of your illustrious father  the pains you have already taken to acquire our tongue cannot fail to endear you to every englishman yet as the idioms of a language are the last things we arrive at i am in hopes an english comedy will not be thought the most improper present that could be offered to your highness  there is no doubt but you will soon be made the subject of more correct pens and receive a just tribute from the greatest authors of our nation in the mean time though i am perhaps the most unworthy i have at least one advantage that i am the first who have shown my respect in this manner and sued for your protection  i am your highnesss most obedient most devoted most humble servant susanna cent livre  preface i dont pretend to write a preface either to point out the beauties or to excuse the errors a judicious reader may possibly discover in the following scenes but to give those excellent comedians their due to whom in some measure the best dramatick writers are obliged the poet and the player are like soul and body indispensibly necessary to one another the correct author makes the player shine whilst the judicious player makes the poets fame immortal i freely acknowledge my self obliged to the actors in general and to mr wilks and mrs oldfield in particular and i owe them this justice to say that their inimitable action could only support a play at such a season and among so many benefits let this encourage our english bards to write furnish but the artful player with materials and his skill will lay the foundation for your fame  i must again repeat that which i meet with every where i mean the just admiration of the performance of mr wilks and mrs oldfield and own that they much outdid in action the strongest of my conceptions for though nature was my aim in the last act of this comedy yet nature herself were she to paint a love quarrel would only copy them  prologue spoken by mr mills our author fears the critics of the stage who like barbarians spare nor sex nor age she trembles at those censors in the pit who think good nature shows a want of wit such malice oh what muse can undergo it to save themselves they always damn the poet our author flies from such a partial jury as wary lovers from the nymphs of drury to the few candid judges for a smile she humbly sues to recompense her toil to the bright circle of the fair she next commits her cause with anxious doubts perplexed where can she with such hopes of favor kneel as to those judges who her frailties feel a few mistakes her sex may well excuse and such a plea no woman should refuse if she succeeds a woman gains applause what female but must favor such a cause her faults  if such there be  then  pass em by and only on her beauties fix your eye in plays like vessels floating on the sea there is none so wise to know their destiny in this however the pilots skill appears while by the stars his constant course he steers in this our author does her judgment show that for her safety she relies on you your approbation fair ones cannot but move those stubborn hearts which first you taught to love the men must all applaud this play of ours for who dares see with other eyes than yours

meeting frederick frederick my lord don lopez   d lop how do you frederick   fred at your lordships service i am glad to see you look so well my lord i hope antonio is out of danger   d lop quite contrary his fever increases they tell me and the surgeons are of opinion his wound is mortal   fred your son don felix is safe i hope   d lop i hope so too but they offer large rewards to apprehend him   fred when heard your lordship from him   d lop not since he went i forbad him writing till the public news gave him an account of antonios health letters might be intercepted and the place of his abode discovered   fred your caution was good my lord though i am impatient to hear from felix yet his safety is my chief concern fortune has maliciously struck a bar between us in the affairs of life but she has done me the honor to unite our souls   d lop i am not ignorant of the friendship between my son and you i have heard him commend your morals and lament your want of noble birth   fred that is natures fault my lord it is some comfort not to owe ones misfortunes to ones self yet it is impossible not to regret the want of noble birth   d lop it is pity indeed such excellent parts as you are master of should be eclipsed by mean extraction   fred such commendation would make me vain my lord did you not cast in the allay of my extraction   d lop there is no condition of life without its cares and it is the perfection of a man to wear em as easy as he can this unfortunate duel of my sons does not pass without impression but since it is past prevention all my concern is now how he may escape the punishment if antonio dies felix shall for england you have been there what sort of people are the english   fred my lord the english are by nature what the ancient romans were by discipline courageous bold hardy and in love with liberty liberty is the idol of the english under whose banner all the nation lists give but the word for liberty and straight more armed legions would appear than france and philip keep in constant pay   d lop i like their principles who does not wish for freedom in all degrees of life though common prudence sometimes makes us act against it as i am now obliged to do for i intend to marry my daughter to don guzman whom i expect from holland every day whither he went to take possession of a large estate left him by his uncle   fred you will not sure sacrifice the lovely isabella to age avarice and a fool pardon the expression my lord but my concern for your beauteous daughter transports me beyond that good manners which i ought to pay your lordships presence   d lop i cannot deny the justness of the character frederick but you are not insensible what i have suffered by these wars and he has two things which render him very agreeable to me for a soninlaw he is rich and well born as for his being a fool i dont conceive how that can be any blot in a husband who is already possessed of a good estate  a poor fool indeed is a very scandalous thing and so are your poor wits in my opinion who have nothing to be vain of but the inside of their sculls now for don guzman i know i can rule him as i think fit this is acting the politic part frederick without which it is impossible to keep up the port of this life   fred but have you no consideration for your daughters welfare my lord   d lop is a husband of twenty thousand crowns a year no consideration now i think it a very good consideration   fred one way my lord but what will the world say of such a match   d lop sir i value not the world a button   fred i cannot think your daughter can have any inclination for such a husband   d lop there i believe you are pretty much in the right though it is a secret which i never had the curiosity to enquire into nor i believe ever shall  inclination quotha parents would have a fine time on it if they consulted their childrens inclinations i will venture you a wager that in all the garrison towns in spain and portugal during the late war there were not three women who have not had an inclination to every officer in the whole army does it therefore follow that their fathers ought to pimp for them no no sir it is not a fathers business to follow his childrens inclinations till he makes himself a beggar   fred but this is of another nature my lord   d lop look ye sir i resolve she shall marry don guzman the moment he arrives though i could not govern my son i will my daughter i assure you   fred this match my lord is more preposterous than that which you proposed to your son from whence arose this fatal  quarrel don antonios sister elvira wanted beauty only but guzman every thing but    d lop money  and that will purchase every thing and so adieu   exit fred monstrous these are the resolutions which destroy the comforts of matrimony  he is rich and well born powerful arguments indeed could i but add them to the friendship of don felix what might i not hope but a merchant and a grandee of spain are inconsistent names  lissardo from whence come you   enter lissardo in a riding habit liss that letter will inform you sir   fred i hope your masters safe   liss i left him so i have another

most obsequious humble servant be pleased to lead the way  bowing   gib sbled gang yer gat sir and i fall follow ye ise tee hungry to feed on compliments   exit fred ha ha a comical fellow  well how do you like our country colonel   col why faith frederick a man might pass his time agreeably enough with inside of a nunnery but to behold such troops of soft plump tender melting wishing nay willing girls too through a damned grate gives us brittons strong temptation to plunder ah frederick your priests are wicked rogues they immure beauty for their own proper use and show it only to the laity to create desires and inflame accounts that they may purchase pardons at a dearer rate   fred i own wenching is something more difficult here than in england where womens liberties are subservient to their inclinations and husbands seem of no effect but to take care of the children which their wives provide   col and does restraint get the better of inclination with your women here no i will be sworn not even in fourscore dont i know the constitution of the spanish ladies   fred and of all ladies where you come colonel you were ever a man of gallantry   col ah frederick the kirk half starves us scotchmen we are kept so sharp at home that we feed like cannibals abroad hark ye have thou never a pretty acquaintance now that thou would consign over to a friend for half an hour ha   fred faith colonel i am the worst pimp in christendom you had better trust to your own luck the women will soon find you out i warrant you   col ay but it is dangerous forraging in an enemys country and since i have some hopes of seeing my own again i had rather purchase my pleasure than run the hazard of a stilletto in my guts egad i think i must even marry and sacrifice my body for the good of my soul will thou recommend me to a wife then one that is willing to exchange her moyders for english liberty ha friend   fred she must be very handsome i suppose   col the handsomer the better  but be sure she has a nose   fred ay ay and some gold   col oh very much gold i shall never be able to swallow the matrimonial pill if it be not well gilded   fred puh beauty will make it slide down nimbly   col at first perhaps it may but the second or third dose will choke me  i confess frederick women are the prettiest playthings in nature but gold substantial gold gives em the air the mien the shape the grace and beauty of a goddess   fred and has not gold the same divinity in their eyes colonel   col too often  money is the very god of marriage the poets dress him in a saffron robe by which they figure out the golden deity and his lighted torch blazons those mighty charms which encourage us to list under his banner  none marry now for love no that is a jest the self same bargain serves for wife and beast  fred you are always gay colonel come shall we take a refreshing glass at my house and consider what has been said   col i have two or three compliments to discharge for some friends and then i shall wait on you with pleasure where do you live   fred at yon corner house with the green rails   col in the close of the evening i will endeavor to kiss your hand adieu   exit fred i shall expect you with impatience   exit  enter isabella and inis her maid inis for goodness sake madam where are you going in this pet   isab any where to avoid matrimony the thoughts of a husband is as terrible to me as the sight of a hobgoblin   inis ay of an old husband but if you might choose for your self i fancy matrimony would be no such frightful thing to you   isab you are pretty much in the right inis but to be forced into the arms of an idiot a sneaking snivling drivling avaricious fool who has neither person to please the eye sense to charm the ear nor generosity to supply those defects ah inis what pleasant lives women lead in england where duty wears no fetter but inclination the custom of our country inslaves us from our very cradles first to our parents next to our husbands and when heaven is so kind to rid us of both these our brothers still usurp authority and expect a blind obedience from us so that maids wives or widows we are little better than slaves to the tyrant man therefore to avoid their power i resolve to cast my self into a monastery   inis that is you will cut your own throat to avoid anothers doing it for you ah madam those eyes tell me you

thou shall have an arm full of flesh and blood to morrow flesh and blood quotha heaven forbid i should deny thee flesh and blood my girl   inis here is an old dog for you   isab do not mistake sir the fatal stroke which separates soul and body is not more terrible to the thoughts of sinners than the name of guzman to my ears   lop puh puh you lie you lie   isab my frighted heart beats hard against my breast as if it sought a passage to your feet to beg you would change your purpose   lop a very pretty speech this if it were turned into blank verse it would serve for a tragedy why thou have more
