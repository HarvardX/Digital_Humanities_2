the history of the nun or the fair vowbreaker     introduction   to the most illustrious princess   the dutchess of mazarine    madam  there are none of an illustrious quality who have not been made by some poet or other the patronesses of his distressd hero or unfortunate damsel and such addresses are tributes due only to the most elevated where they have always been very well receivd since they are the greatest testimonies we can give of our esteem and veneration  madam when i surveyd the whole toor of ladies at court which was adornd by you who appeard there with a grace and majesty peculiar to your great self only mixd with an irresistible air of sweetness generosity and wit i was impatient for an opportunity to tell your grace how infinitely one of your own sex adord you and that among all the numerous conquest your grace has made over the hearts of men your grace had not subdud a more entire slave i assure you madam there is neither compliment nor poetry in this humble declaration but a truth which has cost me a great deal of inquietude for that fortune has not set me in such a station as might justifie my pretence to the honour and satisfaction of being ever near your grace to view eternally that lovely person and hear that surprizing wit what can be more grateful to a heart than so great and so agreeable an entertainment and how few objects are there that can render it so entire a pleasure as at once to hear you speak and to look upon your beauty a beauty that is heightend if possible with an air of negligence in dress wholly charming as if your beauty disdaind those little arts of your sex whose nicety alone is their greatest charm while yours madam even without the assistance of your exalted birth begets an awe and reverence in all that do approach you and every one is proud and pleasd in paying you homage their several ways according to their capacities and talents mine madam can only be exprest by my pen which would be infinitely honourd in being permitted to celebrate your great name for ever and perpetually to serve where it has so great an inclination  in the mean time madam i presume to lay this little trifle at your feet the story is true as it is on the records of the town where it was transacted and if my fair unfortunate vowbreaker do not deserve the honour of your graces protection at least she will be found worthy of your pity which will be a sufficient glory both for her and      madam   your graces most humble       and most obedient servant           a behn     the history of the nun or the fair vowbreaker   of all the sins incident to human nature there is none of which heaven has took so particular visible and frequent notice and revenge as on that of violated vows which never go unpunished and the cupids may boast what they will for the encouragement of their trade of love that heaven never takes cognisance of lovers broken vows and oaths and that tis the only perjury that escapes the anger of the gods but i verily believe if it were searchd into we should find these frequent perjuries that pass in the world for so many gallantries only to be the occasion of so many unhappy marriages and the cause of all those misfortunes which are so frequent to the nuptialld pair for not one of a thousand but either on his side or on hers has been perjurd and broke vows made to some fond believing wretch whom they have abandond and undone what man that does not boast of the numbers he has thus ruind and who does not glory in the shameful triumph nay what woman almost has not a pleasure in deceiving taught perhaps at first by some dear false one who had fatally instructed her youth in an art she ever after practisd in revenge on all those she could be too hard for and conquer at their own weapons for without all dispute women are by nature more constant and just than men and did not their first lovers teach them the trick of change they would be doves that would never quit their mate and like indian wives would leap alive into the graves of their deceased lovers and be buried quick with em but customs of countries change even nature her self and long habit takes her place the women are taught by the lives of the men to live up to all their vices and are become almost as inconstant and tis but modesty that makes the difference and hardly inclination so depravd the nicest appetites grow in time by bad examples  but as there are degrees of vows so there are degrees of punishments for vows there are solemn matrimonial vows such as contract and are the most effectual marriage and have the most reason to be so there are a thousand vows and friendships that pass between man and man on a thousand occasions but there is another vow calld a sacred vow made to god only and by which we oblige our selves eternally to serve him with all chastity and devotion this vow is only taken and made by those that enter into holy orders and of all broken vows these are those that receive the most severe and notorious revenges of god and i am almost certain there is not one example to be producd in the world where perjuries of this nature have past unpunishd nay that have not been persud with the greatest and most rigorous of punishments i could my self of my own knowledge give an hundred examples of the fatal consequences of the violation of sacred vows and who ever make it their business and are curious in the search of such misfortunes shall find as i say that they never go unregarded  the young beauty therefore who dedicates her self to heaven and weds her self for ever to the service of god ought first very well to consider the selfdenial she is going to put upon her youth her fickle faithless deceiving youth of one opinion to day and of another to morrow like flowers which never remain in one state or fashion but bud to day and blow by insensible degrees and decay as imperceptibly the resolution we promise and believe we shall maintain is not in our power and nothing is so deceitful as human hearts  i once was designd an humble votary in the house of devotion but fancying my self not endud with an obstinacy of mind great enough to secure me from the efforts and vanities of the world i rather chose to deny my self that content i could not certainly promise my self than to languish as i have seen some do in a certain affliction tho possibly since i have sufficiently bewailed that mistaken and inconsiderate approbation and preference of the false ungrateful world full of nothing but nonsense noise false notions and contradiction before the innocence and quiet of a cloyster nevertheless i could wish for the prevention of abundance of mischiefs and miseries that nunneries and marriages were not to be enterd into till the maid so destind were of a mature age to make her own choice and that parents would not make use of their justly assumd authority to compel their children neither to the one or the other but since i cannot alter custom nor shall ever be allowd to make new laws or rectify the old ones i must leave the young nuns inclosd to their best endeavours of making a virtue of necessity and the young wives to make the best of a bad market  in iper a town not long since in the dominions of the king of spain and now in possession of the king of france there livd a man of quality of a considerable fortune calld count henrick de vallary who had a very beautiful lady by whom he had one daughter calld isabella whose mother dying when she was about two years old to the unspeakable grief of the count her husband he resolvd never to partake of any pleasure more that this transitory world could court him with but determind with himself to dedicate his youth and future days to heaven and to take upon him holy orders and without considering that possibly the young isabella when she grew to woman might have sentiments contrary to those that now possest him he designd she should also become a nun however he was not so positive in that resolution as to put the matter wholly out of her choice but divided his estate one half he carried with him to the monastery of jesuits of which number he became one and the other half he gave with isabella to the monastery of which his only sister was lady abbess of the order of st augustine but so he ordered the matter that if at the age of thirteen isabella had not a mind to take orders or that the lady abbess found her inclination averse to a monastick life she should have such a proportion of the revenue as should be fit to marry her to a noble man and left it to the discretion of the lady abbess who was a lady of known piety and admirable strictness of life and so nearly related to isabella that there was no doubt made of her integrity and justice  the little isabella was carried immediately in her mourning for her dead mother into the nunnery and was receivd as a very diverting companion by all the young ladies and above all by her reverend aunt for she was come just to the age of delighting her parents she was the prettiest forward pratler in the world and had a thousand little charms to please besides the young beauties that were just budding in her little angel face so that she soon became the dear lovd favourite of the whole house and as she was an entertainment to them all so they made it their study to find all the diversions they could for the pretty isabella and as she grew in wit and beauty every day so they faild not to cultivate her mind and delicate apprehension in all that was advantageous to her sex and whatever excellency any one abounded in she was sure to communicate it to the young isabella if one could dance another sing another play on this instrument and another on that if this spoke one language and that another if she had wit and she discretion and a third the finest fashion and manners all joynd to compleat the mind and body of this beautiful young girl who being undiverted with the less noble and less solid vanities of the world took to these virtues and excelld in all and her youth and wit being apt for all impressions she soon became a greater mistress of their arts than those who taught her so that at the age of eight or nine years she was thought fit to receive and entertain all the great men and ladies and the strangers of any nation at the grate and that with so admirable a grace so quick and piercing a wit and so delightful and sweet a conversation that she became the whole discourse of the town and strangers spread her fame as prodigious throughout the christian world for strangers came daily to hear her talk and sing and play and to admire her beauty and ladies brought their children to shame em into good fashion and manners with looking on the lovely young isabella  the lady abbess her aunt you may believe was not a little proud of the excellencies and virtues of her fair niece and omitted nothing that might adorn her mind because not only of the vastness of her parts and fame and the credit she would do her house by residing there for ever but also being very loth to part with her considerable fortune which she must resign if she returned into the world she usd all her arts and stratagems to make her become a nun to which all the fair sisterhood contributed their cunning but it was altogether needless her inclination the strictness of her devotion her early prayers and those continual and innate stedfastness and calm she was mistress of her ignorance of the worlds vanities and those that uninclosd young ladies count pleasures and diversions being all unknown to her she thought there was no joy out of a nunnery and no satisfactions on the other side of a grate  the lady abbess seeing that of her self she yielded faster than she could expect to discharge her conscience to her brother who came frequently to visit his darling isabella would very often discourse to her of the pleasures of the world telling her how much happier she would think her self to be the wife of some gallant young cavalier and to have coaches and equipages to see the world to behold a thousand rarities she had never seen to live in splendor to eat high and wear magnificent clothes to be bowd to as she passd and have a thousand adorers to see in time a pretty offspring the products of love that should talk and look and delight as she did the heart of their parents but to all her father and the lady abbess could say of the world and its pleasures isabella brought a thousand reasons and arguments so pious so devout that the abbess was very well pleased to find her purposely weak propositions so well overthrown and gives an account of her daily discourses to her brother which were no less pleasing to him and tho isabella went already dressd as richly as her quality deservd yet her father to try the utmost that the worlds vanity could do upon her young heart orders the most glorious clothes should be bought her and that the lady abbess should suffer her to go abroad with those ladies of quality that were her relations and her mothers acquaintance that she should visit and go on the toore that is the hide park there that she should see all that was diverting to try whether it were not for want of temptation to vanity that made her leave the world and love an inclosd life  as the count had commanded all things were performed and isabella arriving at her thirteenth year of age and being pretty tall of stature with the finest shape that fancy can create with all the adornment of a perfect brownhaird beauty eyes black and lovely complexion fair to a miracle all her features of the rarest proportion the mouth red the teeth white and a thousand graces in her meen and air she came no sooner abroad but she had a thousand persons fighting for love of her the reputation her wit had acquird got her adorers without seeing her but when they saw her they found themselves conquerd and undone all were glad she was come into the world of whom they had heard so much and all the youth of the town dressd only for isabella de valerie that rose like a new star that eclipsd all the rest and which set the world agazing some hopd and some despaird but all lovd while isabella regarded not their eyes their distant darling looks of love and their signs of adoration she was civil and affable to all but so reservd that none durst tell her his passion or name that strange and abhorrd thing love to her the relations with whom she went abroad every day were fein to force her out and when she went twas the motive of civility and not satisfaction that made her go whatever she saw she beheld with no admiration and nothing created wonder in her tho never so strange and novel she surveyd all things with an indifference that tho it was not sullen was far from transport so that her evenness of mind was infinitely admird and praisd and now it was that young as she was her conduct and discretion appeard equal to her wit and beauty and she encreasd daily in reputation insomuch that the parents of abundance of young noble men made it their business to endeavour to marry their sons to so admirable and noble a maid and one whose virtues were the discourse of all the world the father the lady abbess and those who had her abroad were solicited to make an alliance for the father he would give no answer but left it to the discretion of isabella who could not be persuaded to hear any thing of that nature so that for a long time she refusd her company to all those who proposd any thing of marriage to her she said she had seen nothing in the world that was worth her care or the venturing the losing of heaven for and therefore was resolvd to dedicate her self to that that the more she saw of the world the worse she likd it and pityd the wretches that were condemnd to it that she had considerd it and found no one inclination that forbad her immediate entrance into a religious life to which her father after using all the arguments he could to make her take good heed of what she went about to consider it well and had urgd all the inconveniencies of severe life watchings midnight risings in all weathers and seasons to prayers hard lodging course diet and homely habit with a thousand other things of labour and work usd among the nuns and finding her still resolvd and inflexible to all contrary persuasions he consented kissd her and told her she had argud according to the wish of his soul and that he never believd himself truly happy till this moment that he was assurd she would become a religious  this news to the heartbreaking of a thousand lovers was spread all over the town and there was nothing but songs of complaint and of her retiring after she had shewn her self to the world and vanquishd so many hearts all wits were at work on this cruel subject and one begat another as is usual in such affairs amongst the number of these lovers there was a young gentleman nobly born his name was villenoys who was admirably made and very handsom had travelld and accomplishd himself as much as was possible for one so young to do he was about eighteen and was going to the siege of candia in a very good equipage but overtaken by his fate surprisd in his way to glory he stopt at ipers so fell most passionately in love with this maid of immortal fame but being defeated in his hopes by this news was the man that made the softest complaints to this fair beauty and whose violence of passion oppressd him to that degree that he was the only lover who durst himself tell her he was in love with her he writ billets so soft and tender that she had of all her lovers most compassion for villenoys and daind several times in pity of him to send him answers to his letters but they were such as absolutely forbad him to love her such as incited him to follow glory the mistress that could noblest reward him and that for her part her prayers should always be that he might be victorious and the darling of that fortune he was going to court and that she for her part had fixd her mind on heaven and no earthly thought should bring it down but she should ever retain for him all sisterly respect and beggd in her solitudes to hear whether her prayers had provd effectual or not and if fortune were so kind to him as she should perpetually wish  when villenoys found she was resolvd he designd to persue his journy but could not leave the town till he had seen the fatal ceremony of isabellas being made a nun which was every day expected and while he stayd he could not forbear writing daily to her but receivd no more answers from her she already accusing her self of having done too much for a maid in her circumstances but she confessd of all she had seen she likd villenoys the best and if she ever could have lovd she believd it would have been villenoys for he had all the good qualities and grace that could render him agreeable to the fair besides that he was only son to a very rich and noble parent and one that might very well presume to lay claim to a maid of isabellas beauty and fortune  as the time approachd when he must eternally lose all hope by isabellas taking orders he found himself less able to bear the efforts of that despair it possessd him with he languished with the thought so that it was visible to all his friends the decays it wrought on his beauty and gaiety so that he fell at last into a feaver and twas the whole discourse of the town that villenoys was dying for the fair isabella his relations being all of quality were extreamly afflicted at his misfortune and joynd their interests yet to dissuade this fair young victoress from an act so cruel as to inclose herself in a nunnery while the finest of all the youths of quality was dying for her and askd her if it would not be more acceptable to heaven to save a life and perhaps a soul than to go and expose her own to a thousand tortures they assurd her villenoys was dying and dying adoring her that nothing could save his life but her kind eyes turnd upon the fainting lover a lover that could breath nothing but her name in sighs and find satisfaction in nothing but weeping and crying out i dye for isabella this discourse fetchd abundance of tears from the fair eyes of this tender maid but at the same time she besought them to believe these tears ought not to give them hope she should ever yield to save his life by quitting her resolution of becoming a nun but on the contrary they were tears that only bewaild her own misfortune in having been the occasion of the death of any man especially a man who had so many excellencies as might have renderd him entirely happy and glorious for a long race of years had it not been his ill fortune to have seen her unlucky face she believd it was for her sins of curiosity and going beyond the walls of the monastery to wander after the vanities of the foolish world that had occasiond this misfortune to the young count of villenoys and she would put a severe penance on her body for the mischiefs her eyes had done him she fears she might by something in her looks have inticd his heart for she ownd she saw him with wonder at his beauty and much more she admird him when she found the beauties of his mind she confessd she had given him hope by answering his letters and that when she found her heart grow a little more than usually tender when she thought on him she believd it a crime that ought to be checkd by a virtue such as she pretended to profess and hopd she should ever carry to her grave and she desired his relations to implore him in her name to rest contented in knowing he was the first and should be the last that should ever make an impression on her heart that what she had conceivd there for him should remain with her to her dying day and that she besought him to live that she might see he both deservd this esteem she had for him and to repay it her otherwise he would dye in her debt and make her life ever after reposeless  this being all they could get from her they returnd with looks that told their message however they renderd those soft things isabella had said in so moving a manner as faild not to please and while he remaind in this condition the ceremonies were compleated of making isabella a nun which was a secret to none but villenoys and from him it was carefully conceald so that in a little time he recoverd his lost health at least so well as to support the fatal news and upon the first hearing it he made ready his equipage and departed immediately for candia where he behavd himself very gallantly under the command of the duke de beaufort and with him returnd to france after the loss of that noble city to the turks  in all the time of his absence that he might the sooner establish his repose he forbore sending to the fair cruel nun and she heard no more of villenoys in above two years so that giving her self wholly up to devotion there was never seen any one who led so austere and pious a life as this young votress she was a saint in the chapel and an angel at the grate she there laid by all her severe looks and mortifyd discourse and being at perfect peace and tranquility within she was outwardly all gay sprightly and entertaining being satisfyd no sights no freedoms could give any temptations to worldly desires she gave a loose to all that was modest and that virtue and honour would permit and was the most charming conversation that ever was admird and the whole world that passd through iper of strangers came directed and recommended to the lovely isabella i mean those of quality but however diverting she was at the grate she was most exemplary devout in the cloister doing more penance and imposing a more rigid severity and task on her self than was requird giving such rare examples to all the nuns that were less devout that her life was a proverb and a president and when they would express a very holy woman indeed they would say she was a very isabella  there was in this nunnery a young nun calld sister katteriena daughter to the grave vanhenault that is to say an earl who livd about six miles from the town in a noble villa this sister katteriena was not only a very beautiful maid but very witty and had all the good qualities to make her be belovd and had most wonderfully gaind upon the heart of the fair isabella she was her chamberfellow and companion in all her devotions and diversions so that where one was there was the other and they never went but together to the grate to the garden or to any place whither their affairs calld either this young katteriena had a brother who lovd her intirely and came every day to see her he was about twenty years of age rather tall than middle staturd his hair and eyes brown but his face exceeding beautiful adornd with a thousand graces and the most nobly and exactly made that twas possible for nature to form to the fineness and charms of his person he had an air in his meen and dressing so very agreeable besides rich that twas impossible to look on him without wishing him happy because he did so absolutely merit being so his wit and his manner was so perfectly obliging a goodness and generosity so sincere and gallant that it would even have atond for ugliness as he was eldest son to so great a father he was kept at home while the rest of his brothers were employd in wars abroad this made him of a melancholy temper and fit for soft impressions he was very bookish and had the best tutors that could be got for learning and languages and all that could compleat a man but was unusd to action and of a temper lazy and given to repose so that his father could hardly ever get him to use any exercise or so much as ride abroad which he would call losing time from his studies he card not for the conversation of men because he lovd not debauch as they usually did so that for exercise more than any design he came on horseback every day to iper to the monastery and would sit at the grate entertaining his sister the most part of the afternoon and in the evening retire he had often seen and conversd with the lovely isabella and found from the first sight of her he had more esteem for her than any other of her sex but as love very rarely takes birth without hope so he never believd that the pleasure he took in beholding her and in discoursing with her was love because he regarded her as a thing consecrate to heaven and never so much as thought to wish she were a mortal fit for his addresses yet he found himself more and more filld with reflections on her which was not usual with him he found she grew upon his memory and oftner came there than he usd to do that he lovd his studies less and going to iper more and that every time he went he found a new joy at his heart that pleasd him he found he could not get himself from the grate without pain nor part from the sight of that allcharming object without sighs and if while he was there any persons came to visit her whose quality she could not refuse the honour of her sight to he would blush and pant with uneasiness especially if they were handsom and fit to make impressions and he would check this uneasiness in himself and ask his heart what it meant by rising and beating in those moments and strive to assume an indifferency in vain and depart dissatisfyd and out of humour  on the other side isabella was not so gay as she usd to be but on the sudden retird her self more from the grate than she usd to do refusd to receive visits every day and her complexion grew a little pale and languid she was observd not to sleep or eat as she usd to do nor exercise in those little plays they made and diverted themselves with now and then she was heard to sigh often and it became the discourse of the whole house that she was much alterd the lady abbess who lovd her with a most tender passion was infinitely concernd at this change and endeavourd to find out the cause and twas generally believd she was too devout for now she redoubled her austerity and in cold winter nights of frost and snow would be up at all hours and lying upon the cold stones before the altar prostrate at prayers so that she receivd orders from the lady abbess not to harass her self so very much but to have a care of her health as well as her soul but she regarded not these admonitions tho even persuaded daily by her katteriena whom she lovd every day more and more  but one night when they were retird to their chamber amongst a thousand things that they spoke of to pass away a tedious evening they talkd of pictures and likenesses and katteriena told isabella that before she was a nun in her more happy days she was so like her brother bernardo henault who was the same that visited them every day that she would in mens clothes undertake she should not have known one from tother and fetching out his picture she had in a dressingbox she threw it to isabella who at the first sight of it turns as pale as ashes and being ready to swound she bid her take it away and could not for her soul hide the sudden surprise the picture brought katteriena had too much wit not to make a just interpretation of this change and as a woman was naturally curious to pry farther tho discretion should have made her been silent for talking in such cases does but make the wound rage the more why my dear sister said katteriena is the likeness of my brother so offensive to you isabella found by this she had discoverd too much and that thought put her by all power of excusing it she was confounded with shame and the more she strove to hide it the more it disorderd her so that she blushing extremely hung down her head sighd and confessd all by her looks at last after a considering pause she cryd my dearest sister i do confess i was surprizd at the sight of monsieur henault and much more than ever you have observd me to be at the sight of his person because there is scarce a day wherein i do not see that and know beforehand i shall see him i am prepard for the encounter and have lessend my concern or rather confusion by that time i come to the grate so much mistress i am of my passions when they give me warning of their approach and sure i can withstand the greatest assaults of fate if i can but foresee it but if it surprize me i find i am as feeble a woman as the most unresolvd you did not tell me you had this picture nor say you would shew me such a picture but when i least expect to see that face you shew it me even in my chamber  ah my dear sister replyd katteriena i believe that paleness and those blushes proceed from some other cause than the nicety of seeing the picture of a man in your chamber  you have too much wit replyd isabella to be imposd on by such an excuse if i were so silly to make it but oh my dear sister it was in my thoughts to deceive you could i have concealed my pain and sufferings you should never have known them but since i find it impossible and that i am too sincere to make use of fraud in any thing tis fit i tell you from what cause my change of colour proceeds and to own to you i fear tis love if ever therefore oh gentle pitying maid thou wert a lover if ever thy tender heart were touchd with that passion inform me oh inform me of the nature of that cruel disease and how thou foundst a cure  while she was speaking these words she threw her arms about the neck of the fair katteriena and bathd her bosom where she hid her face with a shower of tears katteriena embracing her with all the fondness of a dear lover told her with a sigh that she could deny her nothing and therefore confessd to her she had been a lover and that was the occasion of her being made a nun her father finding out the intrigue which fatally happened to be with his own page a youth of extraordinary beauty i was but young said she about thirteen and knew not what to call the newknown pleasure that i felt when ere i lookd upon the young arnaldo my heart would heave when ere he came in view and my disorderd breath came doubly from my bosom a shivering seizd me and my face grew wan my thought was at a stand and sense it self for that short moment lost its faculties but when he touchd me oh no hunted deer tird with his flight and just securd in shades pants with a nimbler motion than my heart at first i thought the youth had had some magick art to make one faint and tremble at his touches but he himself when i accusd his cruelty told me he had no art but awful passion and vowd that when i touchd him he was so so trembling so surprized so charmd so pleasd when he was present nothing could displease me but when he parted from me then twas rather a soft silent grief that easd itself by sighing and by hoping that some kind moment would restore my joy when he was absent nothing could divert me howere i strove howere i toyld for mirth no smile no joy dwelt in my heart or eyes i could not feign so very well i lovd impatient in his absence i would count the tedious parting hours and pass them off like useless visitants whom we wish were gon these are the hours where life no business has at least a lovers life but oh what minutes seemd the happy hours when on his eyes i gazd and he on mine and half our conversation lost in sighs sighs the soft moving language of a lover  no more no more replyd isabella throwing her arms again about the neck of the transported katteriena thou blowst my flame by thy soft words and makst me know my weakness and my shame i love i love and feel those differing passionsthen pausing a moment she proceededyet so didst thou but hast surmounted it now thou hast found the nature of my pain oh tell me thy saving remedy alas replyd katteriena tho theres but one disease theres many remedies they say possessions one but that to me seems a riddle absence they say another and that was mine for arnaldo having by chance lost one of my billets discoverd the amour and was sent to travel and my self forcd into this monastery where at last time convincd me i had lovd below my quality and that shamd me into holy orders and is it a disease replyd isabella that people often recover most frequently said katteriena and yet some dye of the disease but very rarely nay then said isabella i fear you will find me one of these martyrs for i have already opposd it with the most severe devotion in the world but all my prayers are vain your lovely brother persues me into the greatest solitude he meets me at my very midnight devotions and interrupts my prayers he gives me a thousand thoughts that ought not to enter into a soul dedicated to heaven he ruins all the glory i have achievd even above my sex for piety of life and the observation of all virtues oh katteriena he has a power in his eyes that transcends all the world besides and to shew the weakness of human nature and how vain all our boastings are he has done that in one fatal hour that the persuasions of all my relations and friends glory honour pleasure and all that can tempt could not perform in years i resisted all but henaults eyes and they were ordaind to make me truly wretched but yet with thy assistance and a resolution to see him no more and my perpetual trust in heaven i may perhaps overcome this tyrant of my soul who i thought had never enterd into holy houses or mixd his devotions and worship with the true religion but oh no cells no cloysters no hermitages are securd from his efforts  this discourse she ended with abundance of tears and it was resolvd since she was devoted for ever to a holy life that it was best for her to make it as easy to her as was possible in order to it and the banishing this fond and useless passion from her heart it was very necessary she should see henault no more at first isabella was afraid that in refusing to see him he might mistrust her passion but katteriena who was both pious and discreet and endeavourd truly to cure her of so violent a disease which must she knew either end in her death or destruction told her she would take care of that matter that it should not blemish her honour and so leaving her a while after they had resolved on this she left her in a thousand confusions she was now another woman than what she had hitherto been she was quite alterd in every sentiment thought and notion she now repented she had promisd not to see henault she trembled and even fainted for fear she should see him no more she was not able to bear that thought it made her rage within like one possest and all her virtue could not calm her yet since her word was past and as she was she could not without great scandal break it in that point she resolvd to dye a thousand deaths rather than not perform her promise made to katteriena but tis not to be expressd what she endurd what fits pains and convulsions she sustaind and how much ado she had to dissemble to dame katteriena who soon returnd to the afflicted maid the next day about the time that henault was to come as he usually did about two or three a clock after noon tis impossible to express the uneasiness of isabella she askd a thousand times what is not your brother come when dame katteriena would reply why do you ask she would say because i would be sure not to see him you need not fear madam replyd katteriena for you shall keep your chamber she need not have urgd that for isabella was very ill without knowing it and in a feaver  at last one of the nuns came up and told dame katteriena that her brother was at the grate and she desired he should be bid come about to the private grate above stairs which he did and she went to him leaving isabella even dead on the bed at the very name of henault but the more she conceald her flame the more violently it ragd which she strove in vain by prayers and those recourses of solitude to lessen all this did but augment the pain and was oyl to the fire so that she now could hope that nothing but death would put an end to her griefs and her infamy she was eternally thinking on him how handsome his face how delicate every feature how charming his air how graceful his meen how soft and good his disposition and how witty and entertaining his conversation she now fancyd she was at the grate talking to him as she usd to be and blest those happy hours she past then and bewaild her misfortune that she is no more destind to be so happy then gives a loose to grief griefs at which no mortals but despairing lovers can guess or how tormenting they are where the most easie moments are those wherein one resolves to kill ones self and the happiest thought is damnation but from these imaginations she endeavours to fly all frighted with horror but alas whither would she fly but to a life more full of horror she considers well she cannot bear despairing love and finds it impossible to cure her despair she cannot fly from the thoughts of the charming henault and tis impossible to quit em and at this rate she found life could not long support it self but would either reduce her to madness and so render her an hated object of scorn to the censuring world or force her hand to commit a murder upon her self this she had found this she had well considerd nor could her fervent and continual prayers her nightly watchings her mortifications on the cold marble in long winter season and all her acts of devotion abate one spark of this shameful feaver of love that was destroying her within when she had ragd and struggled with this unruly passion till she was quite tird and breathless finding all her force in vain she filld her fancy with a thousand charming ideas of the lovely henault and in that soft fit had a mind to satisfy her panting heart and give it one joy more by beholding the lord of its desires and the author of its pains pleasd yet trembling at this resolve she rose from the bed where she was laid and softly advancd to the staircase from whence there opend that room where dame katteriena was and where there was a private grate at which she was entertaining her brother they were earnest in discourse and so loud that isabella could easily hear all they said and the first words were from katteriena who in a sort of anger cryd urge me no more my virtue is too nice to become an advocate for a passion that can tend to nothing but your ruin for suppose i should tell the fair isabella you dye for her what can it avail you what hope can any man have to move the heart of a virgin so averse to love a virgin whose modesty and virtue is so very curious it would fly the very word love as some monstrous witchcraft or the foulest of sins who would loath me for bringing so lewd a message and banish you her sight as the object of her hate and scorn is it unknown to you how many of the noblest youths of flanders have addressd themselves to her in vain when yet she was in the world have you been ignorant how the young count de villenoys languished in vain almost to death for her and that no persuasions no attractions in him no wordly advantages or all his pleadings who had a wit and spirit capable of prevailing on any heart less severe and harsh than hers do you not know that all was lost on this insensible fair one even when she was a proper object for the adoration of the young and amorous and can you hope now she has so entirely wedded her future days to devotion and given all to heaven nay lives a life here more like a saint than a woman rather an angel than a mortal creature do you imagin with any rhetorick you can deliver now to turn the heart and whole nature of this divine maid to consider your earthly passion no tis fondness and an injury to her virtue to harbour such a thought quit it quit it my dear brother before it ruin your repose ah sister replied the dejected henault your counsel comes too late and your reasons are of too feeble force to rebate those arrows the charming isabellas eyes have fixd in my heart and soul and i am undone unless she know my pain which i shall dye before i shall ever dare mention to her but you young maids have a thousand familiarities together can jest and play and say a thousand things between railery and earnest that may first hint what you would deliver and insinuate into each others hearts a kind of curiosity to know more for naturally my dear sister maids are curious and vain and however divine the mind of the fair isabella may be it bears the tincture still of mortal woman  suppose this true how could this mortal part about her advantage you said katteriena all that you can expect from this discovery if she should be content to hear it and to return you pity would be to make her wretched like your self what farther can you hope oh talk not replied henault of so much happiness i do not expect to be so blest that she should pity me or love to a degree of inquietude tis sufficient for the ease of my heart that she know its pains and what it suffers for her that she would give my eyes leave to gaze upon her and my heart to vent a sigh now and then and when i dare to give me leave to speak and tell her of my passion this this is all my sister and at that word the tears glided down his cheeks and he declind his eyes and set a look so charming and so sad that isabella whose eyes were fixd upon him was a thousand times ready to throw her self into the room and to have made a confession how sensible she was of all she had heard and seen but with much ado she containd and satisfyd her self with knowing that she was adord by him whom she adord and with prudence that is natural to her she withdrew and waited with patience the event of their discourse she impatiently longd to know how katteriena would manage this secret her brother had given her and was pleasd that the friendship and prudence of that maid had conceald her passion from her brother and now contented and joyful beyond imagination to find her self belovd she knew she could dissemble her own passion and make him the first aggressor the first that lovd or at least that should seem to do so this thought restores her so great a part of her peace of mind that she resolvd to see him and to dissemble with katteriena so far as to make her believe she had subdud that passion she was really ashamd to own she now with her womans skill begins to practise an art she never before understood and has recourse to cunning and resolves to seem to reassume her former repose but hearing katteriena approach she laid her self again on her bed where she had left her but composd her face to more chearfulness and put on a resolution that indeed deceivd the sister who was extreamly pleased she said to see her look so well when isabella replyd yes i am another woman now i hope heaven has heard and granted my long and humble supplications and driven from my heart this tormenting god that has so long disturbd my purer thoughts and are you sure said dame katteriena that this wanton deity is repelld by the noble force of your resolutions is he never to return no replied isabella never to my heart yes said katteriena if you should see the lovely murderer of your repose your wound would bleed anew at this isabella smiling with a little disdain replyd because you once to love and henaults charms defenceless found me ah do you think i have no fortitude but so in fondness lost remiss in virtue that when i have resolvd and see it necessary for my afterquiet to want the power of keeping that resolution no scorn me and despise me then as lost to all the glories of my sex and all that nicety ive hitherto preservd there needed no more from a maid of isabellas integrity and reputation to convince any one of the sincerity of what she said since in the whole course of her life she never could be chargd with an untruth or an equivocation and katteriena assurd her she believd her and was infinitely glad she had vanquishd a passion that would have provd destructive to her repose isabella replyd she had not altogether vanquishd her passion she did not boast of so absolute a power over her soft nature but had resolvd things great and time would work the cure that she hopd katteriena would make such excuses to her brother for her not appearing at the grate so gay and entertaining as she usd and by a little absence she should retrieve the liberty she had lost but she desird such excuses might be made for her that young henault might not perceive the reason at the naming him she had much ado not to shew some concern extraordinary and katteriena assurd her she had now a very good excuse to keep from the grate when he was at it for said she now you have resolvd i may tell you he is dying for you raving in love and has this day made me promise to him to give you some account of his passion and to make you sensible of his languishment i had not told you this replyd katteriena but that i believe you fortifyd with brave resolution and virtue and that this knowledge will rather put you more upon your guard than you were before while she spoke she fixed her eyes on isabella to see what alteration it would make in her heart and looks but the masterpiece of this young maids art was shewn in this minute for she commanded her self so well that her very looks dissembled and shewd no concern at a relation that made her soul dance with joy but it was what she was prepard for or else i question her fortitude but with a calmness which absolutely subdud katteriena she replyd i am almost glad he has confessd a passion for me and you shall confess to him you told me of it and that i absent my self from the grate on purpose to avoid the sight of a man who durst love me and confess it and i assure you my dear sister continued she dissembling you could not have advancd my cure by a more effectual way than telling me of his presumption at that word katteriena joyfully related to her all that had passd between young henault and her self and how he implord her aid in this amour at the end of which relation isabella smild and carelesly replyd i pity him and so going to their devotion they had no more discourse of the lover  in the mean time young henault was a little satisfyd to know his sister would discover his passion to the lovely isabella and though he dreaded the return he was pleasd that she should know she had a lover that adord her though even without hope for though the thought of possessing isabella was the most ravishing that could be yet he had a dread upon him when he thought of it for he could not hope to accomplish that without sacrilege and he was a young man very devout and even bigotted in religion and would often question and debate within himself that if it were possible he should come to be belovd by this fair creature and that it were possible for her to grant all that youth in love could require whether he should receive the blessing offerd and though he adord the maid whether he should not abhor the nun in his embraces twas an undetermind thought that chilld his fire as often as it approachd but he had too many that rekindled it again with the greater flame and ardor  his impatience to know what success katteriena had with the relation she was to make to isabella in his behalf brought him early to iper the next day he came again to the private grate where his sister receiving him and finding him with a sad and dejected look expect what she had to say she told him that look well became the news she had for him it being such as ought to make him both grievd and penitent for to obey him she had so absolutely displeasd isabella that she was resolvd never to believe her her friend more or to see you said she therefore as you have made me commit a crime against my conscience against my order against my friendship and against my honour you ought to do some brave thing take some noble resolution worthy of your courage to redeem all for your repose i promisd i would let isabella know you lovd and for the mitigation of my crime you ought to let me tell her you have surmounted your passion as the last remedy of life and fame  at these her last words the tears gushd from his eyes and he was able only a good while to sigh at last cryd what see her no more see the charming isabella no more and then vented the grief of his soul in so passionate a manner as his sister had all the compassion imaginable for him but thought it great sin and indiscretion to cherish his flame so that after a while having heard her counsel he replyd and is this all my sister you will do to save a brother all replyd she i would not be the occasion of making a nun violate her vow to save a brothers life no nor my own assure your self of this and take it as my last resolution therefore if you will be content with the friendship of this young lady and so behave your self that we may find no longer the lover in the friend we shall reassume our former conversation and live with you as we ought otherwise your presence will continually banish her from the grate and in time make both her you love and your self a town discourse  much more to this purpose she said to dissuade him and bid him retire and keep himself from thence till he could resolve to visit them without a crime and she protested if he did not do this and master his foolish passion she would let her father understand his conduct who was a man of temper so very precise that should he believe his son should have a thought of love to a virgin vowd to heaven he would abandon him to shame and eternal poverty by disinheriting him of all he could therefore she said he ought to lay all this to his heart and weigh it with his unheedy passion while the sister talkd thus wisely henault was not without his thoughts but considerd as she spoke but did not consider in the right place he was not considering how to please a father and save an estate but how to manage the matter so to establish himself as he was before with isabella for he imagind since already she knew his passion and that if after that she would be prevaild with to see him he might some lucky minute or other have the pleasure of speaking for himself at least he should again see and talk to her which was a joyful thought in the midst of so many dreadful ones and as if he had known what passd in isabellas heart he by a strange sympathy took the same measures to deceive katteriena a wellmeaning young lady and easily imposd on from her own innocence he resolvd to dissemble patience since he must have that virtue and ownd his sisters reasons were just and ought to be persud that she had argud him into half his peace and that he would endeavour to recover the rest that youth ought to be pardond a thousand failings and years would reduce him to a condition of laughing at his follies of youth but that grave direction was not yet arrivd and so desiring she would pray for his conversion and that she would recommend him to the devotions of the fair isabella he took his leave and came no more to the nunnery in ten days in all which time none but impatient lovers can guess what pain and languishments isabella sufferd not knowing the cause of his absence nor daring to enquire but she bore it out so admirably that dame katteriena never so much as suspected she had any thoughts of that nature that perplexd her and now believd indeed she had conquerd all her uneasiness and one day when isabella and she were alone together she askd that fair dissembler if she did not admire at the conduct and resolution of her brother why replyd isabella unconcernedly while her heart was fainting within for fear of ill news with that katteriena told her the last discourse she had with her brother and how at last she had persuaded him for her sake to quit his passion and that he had promisd he would endeavour to surmount it and that that was the reason he was absent now and they were to see him no more till he had made a conquest over himself you may assure your self this news was not so welcom to isabella as katteriena imagind yet still she dissembled with a force beyond what the most cunning practitioner could have shewn and carryd her self before people as if no pressures had lain upon her heart but when alone retird in order to her devotion she would vent her griefs in the most deplorable manner that a distressd distracted maid could do and which in spite of all her severe penances she found no abatement of  at last henault came again to the monastery and with a look as gay as he could possibly assume he saw his sister and told her he had gaind an absolute victory over his heart and desird he might see isabella only to convince both her and katteriena that he was no longer a lover of that fair creature that had so lately charmd him that he had set five thousand pounds a year against a fruitless passion and found the solid gold much the heavier in the scale and he smild and talkd the whole day of indifferent things with his sister and askd no more for isabella nor did isabella look or ask after him but in her heart two months passd in this indifference till it was taken notice of that sister isabella came not to the grate when henault was there as she usd to do this being spoken to dame katteriena she told it to isabella and said the nuns would believe there was some cause for her absence if she did not appear again that if she could trust her heart she was sure she could trust her brother for he thought no more of her she was confident this in lieu of pleasing was a dagger to the heart of isabella who thought it time to retrieve the flying lover and therefore told katteriena she would the next day entertain at the low grate as she was wont to do and accordingly as soon as any people of quality came she appeard there where she had not been two minutes but she saw the lovely henault and it was well for both that people were in the room they had else both sufficiently discoverd their inclinations or rather their not to be conceald passions after the general conversation was over by the going away of the gentlemen that were at the grate katteriena being employd elsewhere isabella was at last left alone with henault but who can guess the confusion of these two lovers who wishd yet feard to know each others thoughts she trembling with a dismal apprehension that he lovd no more and he almost dying with fear she should reproach or upbraid him with his presumption so that both being possessd with equal sentiments of love fear and shame they both stood fixd with dejected looks and hearts that heavd with stifled sighs at last isabella the softer and tenderhearted of the two tho not the most a lover perhaps not being able to contain her love any longer within the bounds of dissimulation or discretion being by nature innocent burst out into tears and all fainting with pressing thoughts within she fell languishly into a chair that stood there while the distracted henault who could not come to her assistance and finding marks of love rather than anger or disdain in that confusion of isabellas throwing himself on his knees at the grate implord her to behold him to hear him and to pardon him who dyd every moment for her and who adord her with a violent ardor but yet with such an one as should tho he perishd with it be conformable to her commands and as he spoke the tears streamd down his dying eyes that beheld her with all the tender regard that ever lover was capable of she recoverd a little and turnd her too beautiful face to him and piercd him with a look that darted a thousand joys and flames into his heart with eyes that told him her heart was burning and dying for him for which assurances he made ten thousand asseverations of his neverdying passion and expressing as many raptures and excesses of joy to find her eyes and looks confess he was not odious to her and that the knowledge he was her lover did not make her hate him in fine he spoke so many things all soft and moving and so well convincd her of his passion that she at last was compelld by a mighty force absolutely irresistible to speak  sir said she perhaps you will wonder where i a maid brought up in the simplicity of virtue should learn the confidence not only to hear of love from you but to confess i am sensible of the most violent of its pain my self and i wonder and am amazed at my own daring that i should have the courage rather to speak than dye and bury it in silence but such is my fate hurried by an unknown force which i have endeavoured always in vain to resist i am compelld to tell you i love you and have done so from the first moment i saw you and you are the only man born to give me life or death to make me happy or blest perhaps had i not been confind and as it were utterly forbid by my vow as well as my modesty to tell you this i should not have been so miserable to have fallen thus low as to have confessd my shame but our opportunities of speaking are so few and letters so impossible to be sent without discovery that perhaps this is the only time i shall ever have to speak with you alone and at that word the tears flowd abundantly from her eyes and gave henault leave to speak ah madam said he do not as soon as you have raisd me to the greatest happiness in the world throw me with one word beneath your scorn much easier tis to dye and know i am lovd than never never hope to hear that blessed sound again from that beautiful mouth ah madam rather let me make use of this one opportunity our happy luck has given us and contrive how we may for ever see and speak to each other let us assure one another there are a thousand ways to escape a place so rigid as denies us that happiness and denies the fairest maid in the world the privilege of her creation and the end to which she was formd so angelical and seeing isabella was going to speak lest she should say something that might dissuade from an attempt so dangerous and wicked he persud to tell her it might be indeed the last moment heaven would give em and besought her to answer him what he implord whether she would fly with him from the monastery at this word she grew pale and started as at some dreadful sound and cryd hah what ist you say is it possible you should propose a thing so wicked and can it enter into your imagination because i have so far forget my virtue and my vow to become a lover i should therefore fall to so wretched a degree of infamy and reprobation no name it to me no more if you would see me and if it be as you say a pleasure to be belovd by me for i will sooner dye than yield to what    alas i but too well approve these last words she spoke with a fainting tone and the tears fell anew from her fair soft eyes if it be so said he with a voice so languishing it could scarce be heard if it be so and that you are resolvd to try if my love be eternal without hope without expectation of any other joy than seeing and adoring you through the grate i am and must and will be contented and you shall see i can prefer the sighing to these cold irons that separate us before all the possessions of the rest of the world that i chuse rather to lead my life here at this cruel distance from you for ever than before the embrace of all the fair and you shall see how pleasd i will be to languish here but as you see me decay for surely so i shall do not triumph ore my languid looks and laugh at my pale and meager face but pitying say how easily i might have preservd that face those eyes and all that youth and vigour now no more from this total ruine i now behold it in and love your slave that dyes and will be daily and visibly dying as long as my eyes can gaze on that fair object and my soul be fed and kept alive with her charming wit and conversation if love can live on such airy food tho rich in it self yet unfit alone to sustain life it shall be for ever dedicated to the lovely isabella but oh that time cannot be long fate will not lend her slave many days who loves too violently to be satisfyd to enjoy the fair object of his desires no otherwise than at a grate  he ceasd speaking for sighs and tears stopt his voice and he beggd the liberty to sit down and his looks being quite alterd isabella found her self touchd to the very soul with a concern the most tender that ever yielding maid was oppressd with she had no power to suffer him to languish while she by one soft word could restore him and being about to say a thousand things that would have been agreeable to him she saw herself approachd by some of the nuns and only had time to say if you love me live and hope the rest of the nuns began to ask henault of news for he always brought them all that was novel in the town and they were glad still of his visits above all other for they heard how all amours and intrigues passd in the world by this young cavalier these last words of isabellas were a cordial to his soul and he from that and to conceal the present affair endeavourd to assume all the gaity he could and told em all he could either remember or invent to please em tho he wishd them a great way off at that time  thus they passd the day till it was a decent hour for him to quit the grate and for them to draw the curtain all that night did isabella dedicate to love she went to bed with a resolution to think over all she had to do and to consider how she should manage this great affair of her life i have already said she had tryd all that was possible in human strength to perform in the design of quitting a passion so injurious to her honour and virtue and found no means possible to accomplish it she had tryd fasting long praying fervently rigid penances and pains severe disciplines all the mortification almost to the destruction of life it self to conquer the unruly flame but still it burnt and ragd but the more so at last she was forcd to permit that to conquer her she could not conquer and submitted to her fate as a thing destind her by heaven it self and after all this opposition she fancyd it was resisting even divine providence to struggle any longer with her heart and this being her real belief she the more patiently gave way to all the thoughts that pleasd her  as soon as she was laid without discoursing as she usd to do to katteriena after they were in bed she pretended to be sleepy and turning from her setled her self to profound thinking and was resolvd to conclude the matter between her heart and her vow of devotion that night and she having no more to determine might end the affair accordingly the first opportunity she should have to speak to henault which was to fly and marry him or to remain for ever fixd to her vow of chastity this was the debate she brings reason on both sides against the first she sets the shame of a violated vow and considers where she shall shew her face after such an action to the vow she argues that she was born in sin and could not live without it that she was human and no angel and that possibly that sin might be as soon forgiven as another that since all her devout endeavours could not defend her from the cause heaven ought to execute the effect that as to shewing her face so she saw that of henault always turned charming as it was towards her with love what had she to do with the world or card to behold any other  some times she thought it would be more brave and pious to dye than to break her vow but she soon answerd that as false arguing for selfmurder was the worst of sins and in the deadly number she could after such an action live to repent and of two evils she ought to chuse the least she dreads to think since she had so great a reputation for virtue and piety both in the monastery and in the world what they both would say when she should commit an action so contrary to both these she posest but after a whole nights debate love was strongest and gaind the victory she never went about to think how she should escape because she knew it would be easy the keeping of the key of the monastery was often intrusted in her keeping and was by turns in the hands of many more whose virtue and discretion was infallible and out of doubt besides her aunt being the lady abbess she had greater privilege than the rest so that she had no more to do she thought than to acquaint henault with her design as soon as she should get an opportunity which was not quickly but in the mean time isabellas father dyd which put some little stop to our lovers happiness and gave her a short time of grief but love who while he is new and young can do us miracles soon wipd her eyes and chasd away all sorrows from her heart and grew every day more and more impatient to put her new design in execution being every day more resolvd her fathers death had removd one obstacle and securd her from his reproaches and now she only wants opportunity first to acquaint henault and then to fly  she waited not long all things concurring to her desire for katteriena falling sick she had the good luck as she calld it then to entertain henault at the grate oftentimes alone the first moment she did so she entertaind him with the good news and told him she had at last vanquishd her heart in favour of him and loving him above all things honour her vow or reputation had resolvd to abandon her self wholly to him to give her self up to love and serve him and that she had no other consideration in the world but henault instead of returning her an answer all joy and satisfaction held down his eyes and sighing with a dejected look he cryd ah madam pity a man so wretched and undone as not to be sensible of this blessing as i ought she grew pale at this reply and trembling expected he would proceed tis not continued he that i want love tenderest passion and all the desire youth and love can inspire but oh madam when i consider for raving mad in love as i am for your sake i do consider that if i should take you from this repose nobly born and educated as you are and for that act should find a rigid father deprive me of all that ought to support you and afford your birth beauty and merits their due what would you say how would you reproach me he sighing expected her answer when blushes overspreading her face she replyd in a tone all haughty and angry ah henault am i then refusd after having abandond all things for you is it thus you reward my sacrificd honour vows and virtue cannot you hazard the loss of fortune to possess isabella who loses all for you then bursting into tears at her misfortune of loving she sufferd him to say oh charming fair one how industrious is your cruelty to find out new torments for an heart already pressd down with the severities of love is it possible you can make so unhappy a construction of the tenderest part of my passion and can you imagin it want of love in me to consider how i shall preserve and merit the vast blessing heaven has given me is my care a crime and would not the most deserving beauty of the world hate me if i should to preserve my life and satisfy the passion of my fond heart reduce her to the extremities of want and misery and is there any thing in what i have said but what you ought to take for the greatest respect and tenderness alas replyd isabella sighing young as i am all unskilful in love i find but what i feel that discretion is no part of it and consideration inconsistent with the nobler passion who will subsist of its own nature and love unmixed with any other sentiment and tis not pure if it be otherwise i know had i mixd discretion with mine my love must have been less i never thought of living but my love and if i considerd at all it was that grandure and magnificence were useless trifles to lovers wholly needless and troublesom i thought of living in some loanly cottage far from the noise of crowded busie cities to walk with thee in groves and silent shades where i might hear no voice but thine and when we had been tird to sit us done by some cool murmuring rivulet and be to each a world my monarch thou and i thy sovereign queen while wreaths of flowers shall crown our happy heads some fragrant bank our throne and heaven our canopy thus we might laugh at fortune and the proud despise the duller world who place their joys in mighty shew and equipage alas my nature could not bear it i am unusd to wordly vanities and would boast of nothing but my henault no riches but his love no grandure but his presence she ended speaking with tears and he replyd now now i find my isabella loves indeed when shes content to abandon the world for my sake oh thou hast named the only happy life that suits my quiet nature to be retird has always been my joy but to be so with thee oh thou hast charmd me with a thought so dear as has for ever banishd all my care but how to receive thy goodness please think no more what my angry parent may do when he shall hear how i have disposd of my self against his will and pleasure but trust to love and providence no more be gone all thoughts but those of isabella  as soon as he had made an end of expressing his joy he fell to consulting how and when she should escape and since it was uncertain when she should be offerd the key for she would not ask for it she resolvd to give him notice either by word of mouth or a bit of paper she would write in and give him through the grate the first opportunity and parting for that time they both resolvd to get up what was possible for their support till time should reconcile affairs and friends and to wait the happy hour  isabellas dead mother had left jewels of the value of  000l to her daughter at her decease which jewels were in the possession now of the lady abbess and were upon sale to be added to the revenue of the monastery and as isabella was the most prudent of her sex at least had hitherto been so esteemd she was intrusted with all that was in possession of the lady abbess and twas not difficult to make her self mistress of all her own jewels as also some   or  00l in gold that was hoarded up in her ladyships cabinet against any accidents that might arrive to the monastery these isabella also made her own and put up with the jewels and having acquainted henault with the day and hour of her escape he got together what he could and waiting for her with his coach one night when no body was awake but her self when rising softly as she usd to do in the night to her devotion she stole so dexterously out of the monastery as no body knew any thing of it she carryd away the keys with her after having lockd all the doors for she was intrusted often with all she found henault waiting in his coach and trusted none but an honest coachman that lovd him he receivd her with all the transports of a truly ravishd lover and she was infinitely charmd with the new pleasure of his embraces and kisses  they drove out of town immediately and because she durst not be seen in that habit for it had been immediate death for both they drove into a thicket some three miles from the town where henault having brought her some of his younger sisters clothes he made her put off her habit and put on those and rending the other they hid them in a sandpit covered over with broom and went that night forty miles from iper to a little town upon the river rhine where changing their names they were forthwith married and took a house in a country village a farm where they resolvd to live retird by the name of beroone and drove a farming trade however not forgetting to set friends and engines at work to get their pardon as criminals first that had trangressd the law and next as disobedient persons who had done contrary to the will and desire of their parents isabella writ to her aunt the most moving letters in the world so did henault to his father but she was a long time before she could gain so much as an answer from her aunt and henault was so unhappy as never to gain one from his father who no sooner heard the news that was spread over all the town and country that young henault was fled with the so famd isabella a nun and singular for devotion and piety of life but he immediately setled his estate on his younger son cutting henault off with all his birthright which was  000l a year this news you may believe was not very pleasing to the young man who tho in possession of the loveliest virgin and now wife that ever man was blessd with yet when he reflected he should have children by her and these and she should come to want he having been magnificently educated and impatient of scanty fortune he laid it to heart and it gave him a thousand uneasinesses in the midst of unspeakable joys and the more be strove to hide his sentiments from isabella the more tormenting it was within he durst not name it to her so insuperable a grief it would cause in her to hear him complain and tho she could live hardly as being bred to a devout and severe life he could not but must let the man of quality shew it self even in the disguise of an humbler farmer besides all this he found nothing of his industry thrive his cattel still dyd in the midst of those that were in full vigour and health of other peoples his crops of wheat and barly and other grain tho managd by able and knowing husbandmen were all either mildewd or blasted or some misfortune still arrivd to him his coachhorses would fight and kill one another his barns sometimes be fird so that it became a proverb all over the country if any ill luck had arrivd to any body they would say they had monsieur beroones luck all these reflections did but add to his melancholy and he grew at last to be in some want insomuch that isabella who had by her frequent letters and submissive supplications to her aunt who lovd her tenderly obtaind her pardon and her blessing she now pressd her for some money and besought her to consider how great a fortune she had brought to the monastery and implord she would allow her some sallary out of it for she had been marryd two years and most of what she had was exhausted the aunt who found that what was done could not be undone did from time to time supply her so as one might have livd very decently on that very revenue but that would not satisfy the great heart of henault he was now about three and twenty years old and isabella about eighteen too young and too lovely a pair to begin their misfortunes so soon they were both the most just and pious in the world they were examples of goodness and eminent for holy living and for perfect loving and yet nothing thrivd they undertook they had no children and all their joy was in each other at last one good fortune arrivd to them by the solicitations of the lady abbess and the bishop who was her near kinsman they got a pardon for isabellas quitting the monastery and marrying so that she might now return to her own country again henault having also his pardon they immediately quit the place where they had remaind for two years and came again into flanders hoping the change of place might afford em better luck  henault then began again to solicit his cruel father but nothing would do he refusd to see him or to receive any letters from him but at last he prevaild so far with him as that he sent a kinsman to him to assure him if he would leave his wife and go into the french campagn he would equip him as well as his quality requird and that according as he behavd himself he should gain his favour but if he livd idly at home giving up his youth and glory to lazy love he would have no more to say to him but race him out of his heart and out of his memory  he had setled himself in a very pretty house furnished with what was fitting for the reception of any body of quality that would live a private life and they found all the respect that their merits deservd from all the world every body entirely loving and endeavouring to serve them and isabella so perfectly had the ascendent over her aunts heart that she procurd from her all that she could desire and much more than she could expect she was perpetually progging and saving all that she could to enrich and advance her and at last pardoning and forgiving henault lovd him as her own child so that all things lookd with a better face than before and never was so dear and fond a couple seen as henault and isabella but at last she provd with child and the aunt who might reasonably believe so young a couple would have a great many children and foreseeing there was no provision likely to be made them unless he pleasd his father for if the aunt should chance to dye all their hope was gone she therefore daily solicited him to obey his father and go to the camp and that having atchievd fame and renown he would return a favourite to his father and comfort to his wife after she had solicited in vain for he was not able to endure the thought of leaving isabella melancholy as he was with his ill fortune the bishop kinsman to isabella took him to task and urgd his youth and birth and that he ought not to wast both without action when all the world was employd and that since his father had so great a desire he should go into a campagn either to serve the venetian against the turks or into the french service which he likd best he besought him to think of it and since he had satisfyd his love he should and ought to satisfy his duty it being absolutely necessary for the wiping off the stain of his sacrilege and to gain him the favour of heaven which he found had hitherto been averse to all he had undertaken in fine all his friends and all who lovd him joynd in this design and all thought it convenient nor was he insensible of the advantage it might bring him but love which every day grew fonder and fonder in his heart opposd all their reasonings tho he saw all the brave youth of the age preparing to go either to one army or the other  at last he lets isabella know what propositions he had made him both by his father and his relations at the very first motion she almost fainted in his arms while he was speaking and it possessd her with so intire a grief that she miscarryd to the insupportable torment of her tender husband and lover so that to reestablish her repose he was forcd to promise not to go however she considerd all their circumstances and weighd the advantages that might redound both to his honour and fortune by it and in a matter of a months time with the persuasions and reasons of her friends she sufferd him to resolve upon going her self determining to retire to the monastery till the time of his return but when she namd the monastery he grew pale and disorderd and obliged her to promise him not to enter into it any more for fear they should never suffer her to come forth again so that he resolvd not to depart till she had made a vow to him never to go again within the walls of a religious house which had already been so fatal to them she promisd and he believd  henault at last overcame his heart which pleaded so for his stay and sent his father word he was ready to obey him and to carry the first efforts of his arms against the common foes of christendom the turks his father was very well pleasd at this and sent him two thousand crowns his horses and furniture sutable to his quality and a man to wait on him so that it was not long ere he got himself in order to be gone after a dismal parting  he made what hast he could to the french army then under the command of the monsignior the duke of beaufort then at candia and put himself a voluntier under his conduct in which station was villenoys who you have already heard was so passionate a lover of isabella who no sooner heard of henaults being arrivd and that he was husband to isabella but he was impatient to learn by what strange adventure he came to gain her even from her vowd retreat when he with all his courtship could not be so happy tho she was then free in the world and unvowd to heaven  as soon as he sent his name to henault he was sent for up for henault had heard of villenoys and that he had been a lover of isabella they receivd one another with all the endearing civility imaginable for the aforesaid reason and for that he was his countryman tho unknown to him villenoys being gone to the army just as henault came from the jesuits college a great deal of endearment passd between them and they became from that moment like two sworn brothers and he receivd the whole relation from henault of his amour  it was not long before the siege began anew for he arrivd at the beginning of the spring and as soon as he came almost they fell to action and it happend upon a day that a party of some four hundred men resolvd to sally out upon the enemy as when ever they could they did but as it is not my business to relate the history of the war being wholly unacquainted with the terms of battels i shall only say that these men were led by villenoys and that henault would accompany him in this sally and that they acted very noble and great things worthy of a memory in the history of that siege but this day particularly they had an occasion to shew their valour which they did very much to their glory but venturing too far they were ambushd in the persuit of the party of the enemies and being surrounded villenoys had the unhappiness to see his gallant friend fall fighting and dealing of wounds around him even as he descended to the earth for he fell from his horse at the same moment that he killd a turk and villenoys could neither assist him nor had he the satisfaction to be able to rescue his dead body from under the horses but with much ado escaping with his own life got away in spite of all that followd him and recoverd the town before they could overtake him he passionately bewaild the loss of this brave young man and offerd any recompence to those that would have venturd to have searchd for his dead body among the slain but it was not fit to hazard the living for unnecessary services to the dead and tho he had a great mind to have interrd him he rested content with what he wishd to pay his friends memory tho he could not so that all the service now he could do him was to write to isabella to whom he had not writ tho commanded by her so to do in three years before which was never since she took orders he gave her an account of the death of her husband and how gloriously he fell fighting for the holy cross and how much honour he had won if it had been his fate to have outlivd that great but unfortunate day where with  00 men they had killd   00 of the enemy the general beaufort himself had so great a respect and esteem for this young man and knowing him to be of quality that he did him the honour to bemoan him and to send a condoling letter to isabella how much worth her esteem he dyd and that he had eternizd his memory with the last gasp of his life  when this news arrivd it may be easily imagind what impressions or rather ruins it made in the heart of this fair mourner the letters came by his man who saw him fall in battel and came off with those few that escapd with villenoys he brought back what money he had a few jewels with isabellas picture that he carryd with him and had left in his chamber in the fort at candia for fear of breaking it in action and now isabellas sorrow grew to the extremity she thought she could not suffer more than she did by his absence but she now found a grief more killing she hung her chamber with black and livd without the light of day only wax lights that let her behold the picture of this charming man before which she sacrificd floods of tears he had now been absent about ten months and she had learnt just to live without him but hope preservd her then but now she had nothing for which to wish to live she for about two months after the news arrivd livd without seeing any creature but a young maid that was her woman but extream importunity obligd her to give way to the visits of her friends who endeavourd to restore her melancholy soul to its wonted easiness for however it was oppressd within by henaults absence she bore it off with a modest chearfulness but now she found that fortitude and virtue faild her when she was assurd he was no more she continud thus mourning and thus inclosd the space of a whole year never suffering the visit of any man but of a near relation so that she acquird a reputation such as never any young beauty had for she was now but nineteen and her face and shape more excellent than ever she daily increasd in beauty which joynd to her exemplary piety charity and all other excellent qualities gaind her a wonderous fame and begat an awe and reverence in all that heard of her and there was no man of any quality that did not adore her after her year was up she went to the churches but would never be seen any where else abroad but that was enough to procure her a thousand lovers and some who had the boldness to send her letters which if she receivd she gave no answer to and many she sent back unread and unseald so that she would encourage none tho their quality was far beyond what she could hope but she was resolvd to marry no more however her fortune might require it  it happend that about this time candia being unfortunately taken by the turks all the brave men that escapd the sword returnd among them villenoys who no sooner arrivd but he sent to let isabella know of it and to beg the honour of waiting on her desirous to learn what fate befel her dear lord she sufferd him to visit her where he found her in her mourning a thousand times more fair at least he fancyd so than ever she appeard to be so that if he lovd her before he now adord her if he burnt then he rages now but the awful sadness and soft languishment of her eyes hinderd him from the presumption of speaking of his passion to her tho it would have been no new thing and his first visit was spent in the relation of every circumstance of henaults death and at his going away he beggd leave to visit her sometimes and she gave him permission he lost no time but made use of the liberty she had given him and when his sister who was a great companion of isabellas went to see her he would still wait on her so that either with his own visits and those of his sisters he saw isabella every day and had the good luck to see he diverted her by giving her relations of transactions of the siege and the customs and manners of the turks all he said was with so good a grace that he renderd every thing agreeable he was besides very beautiful well made of quality and fortune and fit to inspire love  he made his visits so often and so long that at last he took the courage to speak of his passion which at first isabella would by no means hear of but by degrees she yielded more and more to listen to his tender discourse and he livd thus with her two years before he could gain any more upon her heart than to suffer him to speak of love to her but that which subdud her quite was that her aunt the lady abbess dyd and with her all the hopes and fortune of isabella so that she was left with only a charming face and meen a virtue and a discretion above her sex to make her fortune within the world into a religious house she was resolvd not to go because her heart deceivd her once and she durst not trust it again whatever it promisd  the death of this lady made her look more favourably on villenoys but yet she was resolvd to try his love to the utmost and keep him off as long as twas possible she could subsist and twas for interest she married again tho she likd the person very well and since she was forcd to submit her self to be a second time a wife she thought she could live better with villenoys than any other since for him she ever had a great esteem and fancyd the hand of heaven had pointed out her destiny which she could not avoid without a crime  so that when she was again importund by her impatient lover she told him she had made a vow to remain three years at least before she would marry again after the death of the best of men and husbands and him who had the fruits of her early heart and notwithstanding all the solicitations of villenoys she would not consent to marry him till her vow of widowhood was expird  he took her promise which he urgd her to give him and to shew the height of his passion in his obedience he condescends to stay her appointed time tho he saw her every day and all his friends and relations made her visits upon this new account and there was nothing talkd on but this designd wedding which when the time was expird was performd accordingly with great pomp and magnificence for villenoys had no parents to hinder his design or if he had the reputation and virtue of this lady would have subdud them  the marriage was celebrated in this house where she livd ever since her return from germany from the time she got her pardon and when villenoys was preparing all things in a more magnificent order at his villa some ten miles from the city she was very melancholy and would often say she had been usd to such profound retreat and to live without the fatigue of noise and equipage that she feard she should never endure that grandeur which was proper for his quality and tho the house in the country was the most beautifully situated in all flanders she was afraid of a numerous train and kept him for the most part in this pretty city mansion which he adornd and enlargd as much as she would give him leave so that there wanted nothing to make this house fit to receive the people of the greatest quality little as it was but all the servants and footmen all but one valet and the maid were lodgd abroad for isabella not much usd to the sight of men about her sufferd them as seldom as possible to come in her presence so that she livd more like a nun still than a lady of the world and very rarely any maids came about her but maria who had always permission to come when ever she pleasd unless forbidden  as villenoys had the most tender and violent passion for his wife in the world he sufferd her to be pleasd at any rate and to live in what method she best likd and was infinitely satisfyd with the austerity and manner of her conduct since in his arms and alone with him she wanted nothing that could charm so that she was esteemed the fairest and best of wives and he the most happy of all mankind when she would go abroad she had her coaches rich and gay and her livery ready to attend her in all the splendour imaginable and he was always buying one rich jewel or necklace or some great rarity or other that might please her so that there was nothing her soul could desire which it had not except the assurance of eternal happiness which she labourd incessantly to gain she had no discontent but because she was not blessd with a child but she submits to the pleasure of heaven and endeavourd by her good works and her charity to make the poor her children and was ever doing acts of virtue to make the proverb good that more are the children of the barren than the fruitful woman she livd in this tranquility belovd by all for the space of five years and time and perpetual obligations from villenoys who was the most indulgent and indearing man in the world had almost worn out of her heart the thought of henault or if she rememberd him it was in her prayers or sometimes with a short sigh and no more tho it was a great while before she could subdue her heart to that calmness but she was prudent and wisely bent all her endeavours to please oblige and caress the deserving living and to strive all she could to forget the unhappy dead since it could not but redound to the disturbance of her repose to think of him so that she had now transferrd all that tenderness she had for him to villenoys  villenoys of all diversions lovd hunting and kept at his country house a very famous pack of dogs which he usd to lend sometimes to a young lord who was his dear friend and his neighbour in the country who would often take them and be out two or three days together where he heard of game and oftentimes villenoys and he would be a whole week at a time exercising in this sport for there was no game near at hand this young lord had sent him a letter to invite him fifteen miles farther than his own villa to hunt and appointed to meet him at his country house in order to go in search of this promisd game so that villenoys got about a weeks provision of what necessaries he thought he should want in that time and taking only his valet who lovd the sport he left isabella for a week to her devotion and her other innocent diversions of fine work at which she was excellent and left the town to go meet this young challenger  when villenoys was at any time out it was the custom of isabella to retire to her chamber and to receive no visits not even the ladies so absolutely she devoted her self to her husband all the first day she passd over in this manner and evening being come she orderd her supper to be brought to her chamber and because it was washingday the next day she orderd all her maids to go very early to bed that they might be up betimes and to leave only maria to attend her which was accordingly done this maria was a young maid that was very discreet and of all things in the world lovd her lady whom she had livd with ever since she came from the monastery  when all were in bed and the little light supper just carryd up to the lady and only as i said maria attending some body knockd at the gate it being about nine of the clock at night so maria snatching up a candle went to the gate to see who it might be when she opend the door she found a man in a very odd habit and a worse countenance and asking who he would speak with he told her her lady my lady replyd maria does not use to receive visits at this hour pray what is your business he replyd that which i will deliver only to your lady and that she may give me admittance pray deliver her this ring and pulling off a small ring with isabellas name and hair in it he gave it maria who shutting the gate upon him went in with the ring as soon as isabella saw it she was ready to swound on the chair where she sate and cryd where had you this maria replyd an old rusty fellow at the gate gave it me and desired it might be his pasport to you i askd his name but he said you knew him not but he had great news to tell you isabella replyd almost swounding again oh maria i am ruind the maid all this while knew not what she meant nor that that was a ring given to henault by her mistress but endeavouring to recover her only askd her what she should say to the old messenger isabella bid her bring him up to her she had scarce life to utter these last words and before she was well recoverd maria enterd with the man and isabella making a sign to her to depart the room she was left alone with him  henault for it was he stood trembling and speechless before her giving her leisure to take a strict survey of him at first finding no feature nor part of henault about him her fears began to lessen and she hopd it was not he as her first apprehensions had suggested when he with the tears of joy standing in his eyes and not daring suddenly to approach her for fear of encreasing that disorder he saw in her pale face began to speak to her and cryd fair creature is there no remains of your henault left in this face of mine all oregrown with hair nothing in these eyes sunk with eight years absence from you and sorrows nothing in this shape bowd with labour and griefs that can inform you i was once that happy man you lovd at these words tears stopd his speech and isabella kept them company for yet she wanted words shame and confusion filld her soul and she was not able to lift her eyes up to consider the face of him whose voice she knew so perfectly well in one moment she run over a thousand thoughts she finds by his return she is not only exposd to all the shame imaginable to all the upbraiding on his part when he shall know she is marryd to another but all the fury and rage of villenoys and the scorn of the town who will look on her as an adulteress she sees henault poor and knew she must fall from all the glory and tranquility she had for five happy years triumphd in in which time she had known no sorrow or care tho she had endurd a thousand with henault she dyes to think however that he should know she had been so lightly in love with him to marry again and she dyes to think that villenoys must see her again in the arms of henault besides she could not recal her love for love like reputation once fled never returns more tis impossible to love and cease to love and love another and yet return again to the first passion tho the person have all the charms or a thousand times more than it had when it first conquerd this mistery in love it may be is not generally known but nothing is more certain one may a while suffer the flame to languish but there may be a reviving spark in the ashes rakd up that may burn anew but when tis quite extinguishd it never returns or rekindles  twas so with the heart of isabella had she believd henault had been living she had lovd to the last moment of their lives but alas the dead are soon forgotten and she now lovd only villenoys  after they had both thus silently wept with very different sentiments she thought twas time to speak and dissembling as well as she could she caressd him in her arms and told him she could not express her surprize and joy for his arrival if she did not embrace him heartily or speak so passionately as she usd to do he fancyd it her confusion and his being in a condition not so fit to receive embraces from her and evaded them as much as twas possible for him to do in respect to her till he had dressd his face and put himself in order but the supper being just brought up when he knockd she orderd him to sit down and eat and he desird her not to let maria know who he was to see how long it would be before she knew him or would call him to mind but isabella commanded maria to make up a bed in such a chamber without disturbing her fellows and dismissd her from waiting at table the maid admird what strange good and joyful news this man had brought her mistress that he was so treated and alone with her which never any man had yet been but she never imagind the truth and knew her ladys prudence too well to question her conduct while they were at supper isabella obligd him to tell her how he came to be reported dead of which she receivd letters both from monsieur villenoys and the duke of beaufort and by his man the news who saw him dead he told her that after the fight of which first he gave her an account he being left among the dead when the enemy came to plunder and strip em they found he had life in him and appearing as an eminent person they thought it better booty to save me continud he and get my ransom than to strip me and bury me among the dead so they bore me off to a tent and recoverd me to life and after that i was recoverd of my wounds and sold by the soldier that had taken me to a spahee who kept me a slave setting a great ransom on me such as i was not able to pay i writ several times to give you and my father an account of my misery but receivd no answer and endurd seven years of dreadful slavery when i found at last an opportunity to make my escape and from that time resolvd never to cut the hair of this beard till i should either see my dearest isabella again or hear some news of her all that i feard was that she was dead and at that word he fetchd a deep sigh and viewing all things so infinitely more magnificent than he had left em or believd she could afford and that she was far more beautiful in person and rich in dress than when he left her he had a thousand torments of jealousie that seizd him of which he durst not make any mention but rather chose to wait a little and see whether she had lost her virtue he desird he might send for a barber to put his face in some handsomer order and more fit for the happiness twas that night to receive but she told him no dress no disguise could render him more dear and acceptable to her and that to morrow was time enough and that his travels had renderd him more fit for repose than dressing so that after a little while they had talkd over all they had a mind to say all that was very indearing on his side and as much concern as she could force on hers she conducted him to his chamber which was very rich and which gave him a very great addition of jealousie however he sufferd her to help him to bed which she seemd to do with all the tenderness in the world and when she had seen him laid she said she would go to her prayers and come to him as soon as she had done which being before her usual custom it was not a wonder to him she stayd long and he being extreamly tird with his journy fell asleep tis true isabella essayd to pray but alas it was in vain she was distracted with a thousand thoughts what to do which the more she thought the more it distracted her she was a thousand times about to end her life and at one stroke rid her self of the infamy that she saw must inevitably fall upon her but nature was frail and the tempter strong and after a thousand convulsions even worse than death it self she resolvd upon the murder of henault as the only means of removing all the obstacles to her future happiness she resolvd on this but after she had done so she was seizd with so great horror that she imagind if she performd it she should run mad and yet if she did not she should be also frantick with the shames and miseries that would befal her and believing the murder the least evil since she could never live with him she fixd her heart on that and causing her self to be put immediately to bed in her own bed she made maria go to hers and when all was still she softly rose and taking a candle with her only in her nightgown and slippers she goes to the bed of the unfortunate henault with a penknife in her hand but considering she knew not how to conceal the blood should she cut his throat she resolves to strangle him or smother him with a pillow that last thought was no sooner borne but put in execution and as he soundly slept she smotherd him without any noise or so much as his strugling but when she had done this dreadful deed and saw the dead corps of her oncelovd lord lye smiling as it were upon her she fell into a swound with the horror of the deed and it had been well for her she had there dyd but she revivd again and awakend to more and new horrors she flyes all frighted from the chamber and fancies the phantom of her dead lord persues her she runs from room to room and starts and stares as if she saw him continually before her now all that was ever soft and dear to her with him comes into her heart and she finds he conquers anew being dead who could not gain her pity while living  while she was thus flying from her guilt in vain she hears one knock with authority at the door she is now more affrighted if possible and knows not whither to fly for refuge she fancies they are already the officers of justice and that ten thousand tortures and wrecks are fastening on her to make her confess the horrid murder the knocking increases and so loud that the laundry maids believing it to be the woman that usd to call them up and help them to wash rose and opening the door let in villenoys who having been at his country villa and finding there a footman instead of his friend who waited to tell him his master was fallen sick of the small pox and could not wait on him he took horse and came back to his lovely isabella but running up as he usd to do to her chamber he found her not and seeing a light in another room he went in but found isabella flying from him out at another door with all the speed she could he admires at this action and the more because his maid told him her lady had been a bed a good while he grows a little jealous and persues her but still she flies at last he caught her in his arms where she fell into a swound but quickly recovering he set her down in a chair and kneeling before her implord to know what she ayld and why she fled from him who adord her she only fixd a ghastly look upon him and said she was not well oh said he put not me off with such poor excuses isabella never fled from me when ill but came to my arms and to my bosom to find a cure therefore tell me whats the matter at that she fell a weeping in a most violent manner and cryd she was for ever undone he being movd with love and compassion conjurd her to tell what she ayld ah said she thou and i and all of us are undone at this he lost all patience and ravd and cryd tell me and tell me immediately whats the matter when she saw his face pale and his eyes fierce she fell on her knees and cryd oh you can never pardon me if i should tell you and yet alas i am innocent of ill by all thats good i am but her conscience accusing her at that word she was silent if thou art innocent said villenoys taking her up in his arms and kissing her wet face by all thats good i pardon thee what ever thou hast done alas said she oh but i dare not name it till you swear by all thats sacred replyd he and by whatever oath you can oblige me to by my inviolable love to thee and by thy own dear self i swear whatere it be i do forgive thee i know thou art too good to commit a sin i may not with honour pardon  with this and heartend by his caresses she told him that henault was returnd and repeating to him his escape she said she had put him to bed and when he expected her to come she fell on her knees at the bedside and confessd she was married to villenoys at that word said she he fetchd a deep sigh or two and presently after with a very little struggling dyd and yonder he lyes still in the bed after this she wept so abundantly that all villenoys could do could hardly calm her spirits but after consulting what they should do in this affair villenoys askd her who of the house saw him she said only maria who knew not who he was so that resolving to save isabellas honour which was the only misfortune to come villenoys himself proposd the carrying him out to the bridge and throwing him into the river where the stream would carry him down to the sea and lose him or if he were found none could know him so villenoys took a candle and went and lookd on him and found him altogether changd that no body would know who he was he therefore put on his clothes which was not hard for him to do for he was scarce yet cold and comforting again isabella as well as he could he went himself into the stable and fetched a sack such as they usd for oats a new sack whereon stuck a great needle with a packthread in it this sack he brings into the house and shews to isabella telling her he would put the body in there for the better convenience of carrying it on his back isabella all this while said but little but filld with thoughts all black and hellish she ponderd within while the fond and passionate villenoys was endeavouring to hide her shame and to make this an absolute secret she imagind that could she live after a deed so black villenoys would be eternal reproaching her if not with his tongue at least with his heart and emboldend by one wickedness she was the readier for another and another of such a nature as has in my opinion far less excuse than the first but when fate begins to afflict she goes through stitch with her black work  when villenoys who would for the safety of isabellas honour be the sole actor in the disposing of this body and since he was young vigorous and strong and able to bear it would trust no one with the secret he having put up the body and tyd it fast set it on a chair turning his back towards it with the more conveniency to take it upon his back bidding isabella give him the two corners of the sack in his hands telling her they must do this last office for the dead more in order to the securing their honour and tranquility hereafter than for any other reason and bid her be of good courage till he came back for it was not far to the bridge and it being the dead of the night he should pass well enough when he had the sack on his back and ready to go with it she cryd stay my dear some of his clothes hang out which i will put in and with that taking the packneedle with the thread sewd the sack with several strong stitches to the collar of villenoys coat without his perceiving it and bid him go now and when you come to the bridge said she and that you are throwing him over the rail which is not above breast high be sure you give him a good swing least the sack should hang on any thing at the side of the bridge and not fall into the stream ile warrant you said villenoys i know how to secure his falling and going his way with it love lent him strength and he soon arrivd at the bridge where turning his back to the rail and heaving the body over he threw himself with all his force backward the better to swing the body into the river whose weight it being made fast to his collar pulld villenoys after it and both the live and the dead man falling into the river which being rapid at the bridge soon drownd him especially when so great a weight hung to his neck so that he dyd without considering what was the occasion of his fate  isabella remaind the most part of the night sitting in her chamber without going to bed to see what would become of her damnable design but when it was towards morning and she heard no news she put herself into bed but not to find repose or rest there for that she thought impossible after so great a barbarity as she had committed no said she it is but just i should for ever wake who have in one fatal night destroyd two such innocents oh what fate what destiny is mine under what cursed planet was i born that heaven it self could not divert my ruine it was not many hours since i thought my self the most happy and blest of women and now am fallen to the misery of one of the worst fiends of hell  such were her thoughts and such her cryes till the light brought on new matter for grief for about ten of the clock news was brought that two men were found dead in the river and that they were carryd to the townhall to lye there till they were ownd within an hour after news was brought in that one of these unhappy men was villenoys his valet who all this while imagind him in bed with his lady ran to the hall to undeceive the people for he knew if his lord were gone out he should have been calld to dress him but finding it as twas reported he fell a weeping and wringing his hands in a most miserable manner he ran home with the news where knocking at his ladys chamber door and finding it fast lockd he almost hopd again he was deceivd but isabella rising and opening the door maria first enterd weeping with the news and then brought the valet to testify the fatal truth of it isabella tho it were nothing but what she expected to hear almost swounded in her chair nor did she feign it but felt really all the pangs of killing grief and was so alterd with her nights watching and grieving that this new sorrow lookd very natural in her when she was recoverd she asked a thousand questions about him and questiond the possibility of it for said she he went out this morning early from me and had no signs in his face of any grief or discontent alas said the valet madam he is not his own murderer some one has done it in revenge and then told her how he was found fastend to a sack with a dead strange man tyd up within it and every body concludes that they were both first murderd and then drawn to the river and thrown both in at the relation of this strange man she seemd more amazd than before and commanding the valet to go to the hall and to take order about the coroners sitting on the body of villenoys and then to have it brought home she called maria to her and after bidding her shut the door she cryd ah maria i will tell thee what my heart imagins but first said she run to the chamber of the stranger and see if he be still in bed which i fear he is not she did so and brought word he was gone then said she my forebodings are true when i was in bed last night with villenoys and at that word she sighd as if her heartstrings had broken i told him i had lodgd a stranger in my house who was by when my first lord and husband fell in battel and that after the fight finding him yet alive he spoke to him and gave him that ring you brought me last night and conjurd him if ever his fortune should bring him to flanders to see me and give me that ring and tell mewith that she wept and could scarce speak a thousand tender and endearing things and then dyd in his arms for my dear henaults sake said she i usd him nobly and dismissd you that night because i was ashamd to have any witness of the griefs i paid his memory all this i told to villenoys whom i found disorderd and after a sleepless night i fancy he got up and took this poor man and has occasiond his death at that she wept anew and maria to whom all that her mistress said was gospel verily believd it so without examining reason and isabella conjuring her since none of the house knew of the old mans being there for old he appeard to be that she would let it for ever be a secret and to this she bound her by an oath so that none knowing henault altho his body was exposd there for three days to publick view when the coroner had set on the bodies he found they had been first murderd some way or other and then afterwards tackd together and thrown into the river they brought the body of villenoys home to his house where it being laid on a table all the house infinitely bewaild it and isabella did nothing but swound away almost as fast as she recoverd life however she would to compleat her misery be led to see this dreadful victim of her cruelty and coming near the table the body whose eyes were before close shut now opend themselves wide and fixd them upon isabella who giving a great schreek fell down in a swound and the eyes closd again they had much ado to bring her to life but at last they did so and led her back to her bed where she remaind a good while different opinions and discourses were made concerning the opening of the eyes of the dead man and viewing isabella but she was a woman of so admirable a life and conversation of so undoubted a piety and sanctity of living that not the least conjecture could be made of her having a hand in it besides the improbability of it yet the whole thing was a mystery which they thought they ought to look into but a few days after the body of villenoys being interrd in a most magnificent manner and by will all he had was long since setled on isabella the world instead of suspecting her adord her the more and every body of quality was already hoping to be next tho the fair mourner still kept her bed and languishd daily  it happend not long after this there came to the town a french gentleman who was taken at the siege of candia and was fellowslave with henault for seven years in turky and who had escapd with henault and came as far as liege with him where having some business and acquaintance with a merchant he stayd some time but when he parted with henault he askd him where he should find him in flanders henault gave him a note with his name and place of abode if his wife were alive if not to enquire at his sisters or his fathers this french man came at last to the very house of isabella enquiring for this man and receivd a strange answer and was laughd at he found that was the house and that the lady and enquiring about the town and speaking of henaults return describing the man it was quickly discoverd to be the same that was in the sack he had his friend taken up for he was buried and found him the same and causing a barber to trim him when his bushy beard was off a great many people rememberd him and the french man affirming he went to his own home all isabellas family and her self were cited before the magistrate of justice where as soon as she was accusd she confessd the whole matter of fact and without any disorder deliverd her self in the hands of justice as the murderess of two husbands both belovd in one night the whole world stood amazd at this who knew her life a holy and charitable life and how dearly and well she had livd with her husbands and every one bewaild her misfortune and she alone was the only person that was not afflicted for her self she was tryd and condemnd to lose her head which sentence she joyfully receivd and said heaven and her judges were too merciful to her and that her sins had deservd much more  while she was in prison she was always at prayers and very chearful and easie distributing all she had amongst and for the use of the poor of the town especially to the poor widows exhorting daily the young and the fair that came perpetually to visit her never to break a vow for that was first the ruine of her and she never since prosperd do whatever other good deeds she could when the day of execution came she appeard on the scaffold all in mourning but with a meen so very majestick and charming and a face so surprizing fair where no languishment or fear appeard but all chearful as a bride that she set all hearts a flaming even in that mortifying minute of preparation for death she made a speech of half an hour long so eloquent so admirable a warning to the vowbreakers that it was as amazing to hear her as it was to behold her  after she had done with the help of maria she put off her mourning vail and without any thing over her face she kneeld down and the executioner at one blow severd her beautiful head from her delicate body being then in her seven and twentieth year she was generally lamented and honourably buryd    finis
