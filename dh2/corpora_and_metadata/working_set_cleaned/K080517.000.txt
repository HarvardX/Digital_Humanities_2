a poem sacred to the memory of sir isaac newton  by james thomson  his tibi me rebus quaedam divina voluptas percipit atque horror quod sic natura tua vi tam manifesta patet ex omni part retecta luc dublin printed by s powell for richard norris at the corner of cranelane in essexstreet m dcc xxvii  where may be had summer a poem and winter a poem  to the right honorable sir robert walpole knight of the most noble order of the garter sir since i have ventured to write a poem on a gentleman who is universally acknowledged to be the honor of our country as a philosopher prompted by the same ambition i address it to her most illustrious patriot  though by the wise choice of the best of kings you are engaged in the highest and most active scenes of life balancing the power of europe watching over our common welfare informing the whole body of society and commerce and even like heaven dispensing happiness to the discontented and ungrateful though thus gloriously employed yet are you not less attentive in the hour of leisure to the variety beauty and magnificence of nature nor less delighted and astonished at the discoveries of the incomparable newton the same comprehensive genius which way soever it looks must have a steady clear and unbounded prospect  but not to encroach any further on your important moments all devoted to the good of mankind i once more plead the dignity of my subject for my excuse in this approach and beg leave to subscribe my self with the sincerest veneration  sir your most faithful humble servant james thomson  a poem sacred to the memory of sir isaac newton shall the great soul of newton quit this earth to mingle with his stars and every muse astonished into silence shun the weight of honors due to his illustrious name but what can man  even now the sons of light in strains such as delight the ear of god hail his arrival on the coasts of bliss yet am not i deterred though high the theme and sung to harps of angels for with you aetherial flames ambitious i aspire in natures general symphony to join and what new wonders can ye show your guest who while on this dim spot where mortals toil clouded in dust from motions simple laws could trace the boundless hand of providence wideworking through this universal frame have ye not listened while he bound the suns and planets to their spheres the unequal task of humankind till then often had they rolled over erring man the year and often disgraced the pride of schools before their course was known full in its causes and effects to him allpiercing sage who sat not down and dreamt romantic schemes defended by the din of specious words and tyranny of names but bidding his amazing mind attend and with heroic patience years on years deepsearching saw at last the system dawn and shine of all his race on him alone what were his raptures then how pure how strong and what the triumphs of old greece and rome by his diminished but the pride of boys in some small fray victorious when instead of shattered parcels of this earth usurped by violence unmanly and sore deeds of cruelty and blood nature herself stood all subdued by him and open laid her every latent glory to his view and first our solar system he surveyed with accurate ken and by the mingling power of gravitation and projection saw the whole in silent harmony revolve drawn to his lengthened eye the attending moons designed to cheer remoter planets were by him in all their mixed proportions seen he also fixed the wandering queen of night whether she wanes into a scanty orb or waxing broad with her pale shadowy light in a soft deluge overflows the sky her every motion clear discerning he adjusted to the obsequious main and taught why now the mighty mass of waters swells resistless heaving on the broken rocks and the full river turning till again the tide revertive unattracted leaves a yellow waste of idle sands behind then breaking hence he took his ardent flight through the blue infinite and every star which the clear concave of a winters night pours on the eye or astronomic tube farstretching snatches from the dark abyss or such as farther in successive skies to fancy only shine at his approach blazed into suns the enlivening center each of an harmonious system all combined and ruled unerring by that single power which draws the stone projected to the ground o unprofuse magnificence divine o wisdom truly perfect thus to call from a few causes such a scheme of things effects so various beautiful and great an universe complete and o beloved of heaven into the almightys councils thus to be admitted and allowed to scan the rising moving wideestablishd frame he too unbaffled in his aim pursued the comet to the long elliptic curve as round innumerous worlds he wound his way till to the forehead of the eveningsky reduced the blazing wonder glares anew the heavens are all his own finished by him the fair discovery lies and every eye may lay the useless telescope aside unless it be to hold the great acquests by newton made who from the wild domain of the des carts french dreamer rescued heaven and earth all europe stood appalled but found it vain to keep at odds with demonstration strong and lingering to resist the awakening force of truth at once their pleasing visions fled with the gay shadows of the morning mixed when newton rose our philosophic sun the aerial flow of sound was known to him from whence it first in wavy circles breaks till the touched organ takes the message in nor could the darting beam of speed immense escape his swift pursuit and measuring glance even light it self which every thing displays shone undiscovered till his brighter mind untwisted all the shining robe of day and from the whitening undistinguished blaze collecting every ray into his kind to the charmed eye educd the gorgeous train of parentcolours first the flaming red sprung vivid forth the tawny orange next and then delicious yellow by whose side fell the kind beams of allrefreshing green then the pure blue that swells autumnal skies aetherial played and then of sadder hue emergd the deepend indico as when the heavyskirted evening droops with frost while the last gleanings of refracted light died in the fainting violetaway these when the clouds distill the rosy shower shine out distinct adown the watery bow while over our heads the dewy vision bends delightful melting on the fields beneath myriads of mingling dies from these result and myriads still remain the exhaustless source of beauty everflushing evernew did ever poet image ought so fair dreaming in whispering groves by the hoarse brook or prophet to whose rapture heaven descends even now the setting sun and liverid clouds seen greenwich from thy lovely heights declare how just how beauteous the refractive law the noiseless tide of time all bearing down to vast eternitys unbounded sea where the green islands of the happy shine he backward stemd alone and to it is source ascending marked it is periods and hung out his lights at equal distances to guide historian wilderd on his darksome way but who can number up his labors who his high discoveries sing when but a few of the deepstudying race can stretch their minds to image what he knew as clear as they the truths selfevident with which he linked his far thest views for is there ought that is great that is wonderful and hard deterring search that was his prize and worthy of his toil unfailing who the lonely monarch reigned of science thininhabited below what wonder then that his devotion swelled responsive to his knowledge for could he whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw the finished university of things in all its order magnitude and parts forbear incessant to adore that power who fills sustains and actuates the whole say ye who best can tell ye happy few who saw him in the softest lights of life all unwithheld indulging to his friends the vast unborrowd treasures of his mind o speak the wondrous man how mild how calm how greatly humble how divinely good how firm established on eternal truth pure as his faith and active as his love fervent in doing well with every nerve still pressing on forgetful of the past and panting for perfection far above those little cares and visionary joys that so befool the fond impassioned heart of overcheated evertrusting man and say ye downward gloomyminded tribe ye who unconscious of those nobler flights that reach impatient at immortal life against the prime indearing privilege of being dare contend say can a soul of such extensive deep tremendous powers enlarging still be but a finer breath of spirits dancing through their tubes awhile and then for ever lost in vacant air but hark methinks i hear a warning voice solemn as when some awful change is come sound through the world  he is dead  the measures full and i resign my charge  ye mouldering stones that build the towering pyramid the proud triumphal arch the monument effaced by ruthless ruin and whatever supports the worshipped name of gray antiquity down to the dust what grandeur can ye boast while newton lifts his column to the skies beyond the waste of time  let no weak drop be shed for him the beauty in her bloom cut off the joyous youth and darling child these are the tombs that claim the tender tear and elegiac song but newton calls for other notes of gratulation high that now he wanders through those endless worlds he here so well descried and wondering talks and hymns their author with his glad compeers o britains boast whether with angels thou sit in dread discourse or fellow saints who joy to see the honor of their kind or whether mounted on cherubic wing thy swift career is with the whirling spheres comparing things with things in rapture lost and lowly adoration for that light so plenteous rayd into thy mind below from light himself o look with pity down on humankind a frail erroncous race assuage the madness of a frantic world but chiefly over thy countrys cause preside and be her genius called her council steer correct her manners and inspire her youth for guilty as she is she brought thee forth and glorious in thy name she points thee out to all her sons and bids them eye thy star while in expectance of the arrousing blast when time shall be no more thy sacred dust sleeps with her kings and dignifies the
