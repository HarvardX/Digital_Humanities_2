a brief case of the distillers and of the distilling trade in england showing how far it is the interest of england to encourage the said trade as it is so considerable an advantage to the landed interest to the trade and navigation to the public revenue and to the employment of the poor humbly recommended to the lords and commons of great britain in the present parliament assembled  london printed for t warner at the blackbay in paternoster row mdccxxvi price one shilling  the preface as almost every thing in this criticizing age is liable to be cavild at and disputed so contrary to the rules of charity and good humor it is the avowed temper or at least the practice of the age where any thing so disputed is liable to a double or differing construction always to take it in the worst  to prevent this and anticipate the cavils of those who would suggest evil where no evil ought to be suggested a short preface is thought needful to this work tho otherwise plain enough to prepare the reader to be at least honest and just if he should not incline to be candid and generous in his looking over the following sheets  here is no apology to be made for vice no extenuating of crimes no harangues for drunkenness when at the same time the liquors which it has been suggested are instrumental to our immoralitys are as the reader may think spoken favorably of  but we are stating the case of the distilling business as a commerce and of the distillers as a society improving that commerce for the good of their country enquiring whether they are a public good and encouragers of the trade yea or no if they are the parliament of great britain now sitting will judge whether it is meet to encourage them or not and if not vice versa  but it seems needful to hint and this is the reason of this preface that the question does not seem to lie here whether the spirits shall be distilled and consumed among us and whether the poor shall drink them but whether the dutch shall surnish us with them and cheat and impose upon us as well publicly as privately in the grossest and most barefaced manner or whether our own manufacture shall supply us our own growth be consumed and our own people employed  these are indeed very short questions and i think few words will decide them if the first be encouraged and fraud and clandestine trade be continued for want of due regulations and proper measures taken to prevent it i shall only say it shall not be for want of due information but if our own manufacture the labor and industry of our own people and the consumption of our own growth be encouraged as we cannot doubt they will i take the liberty to say the distillingtrade in england which is already so much improved and increased will in a very few years conquer all foreign importations all the clandestine and corrupt management of other countries who impose upon us and even the smuggling and running of french brandy itself  the same ignorance that occasions most of the prejudice at the distilling trade among us obliged me to enter into the detail of the dutch operations with their malt spirits and the first introduction of geneva among the common people which otherwise some might pretend is useless in the case before us but it is needful we should know things in their original and be able to see from what fountain every mischief flows that we may not lay the weight where it ought not to lie  the dutch were doubtless looked upon as great benefactors to our commerce and who by taking off yearly so great a quantity of our corn were so great an advantage to our landed interest our navigation and our poor and while the product let it be what it will was consumed abroad and their geneva and other spirits reached no farther than their camps and fleets and withal while they did not cheat us in the drawbacks too if ever that time was they were really so  but here you will see that it is possible in the general turn of things and the changes which matters of trade in common with the rest of human affairs are subject to what is a public good to day may be a public grievance to morrow and what a law is made to encourage at one time may require a law to prohibit and prevent at another and this is the true case of the dutch distilling trade as it shocks with and at this time interferes with our own as will be seen from p    to    of this work in which an account of that part is given  time and a short discourse swelled also beyond expectation in other needful parts prevents entering further into these things at present but by this may be seen the great difficultys this valuable business of the english distillery has struggled with and the great and just arguments for its farther encouragement all which is humbly submitted to the wisdom and justice of the parliament  a brief state of the case of the distillers etc the distilling of spirits is indeed an ancient art and the distillers company is ancient having been incorporated in the reign of queen elizabeth but as the nature of their business is quite changed that they work in a new method and from new materials are under new limitations and their interest and trade stand in a new and quite different situation from what was the case formerly so it may be said their very constitution is modern and they are young in the manufacture  but however young the trade may be and that the materials they work from are different from what they formerly made use of it is apparent that they are infinitely more a public benefit to the nation than they were before and that the distilling trade considered in its present magnitude is one of the greatest improvements and the most to the advantage of the public of any business now carried on in england  in former times the distillers like other incorporated arts and mysterys worked wholly for themselves and for their own profit now they without a pun may be truly said to be public spirited people for they work for the whole body and that immediately and in a particular manner    they work for the gentlemen or landed interest in consuming the produce of their soil and encouraging tillage and husbandry    they work for the tenant and farmer in helping them off with their corn and particularly in finding them a market for those grains of the meanest quality and which it would be difficult if not impossible for them to dispose of to advantage any other way    they work for the navigation of the kingdom abundance of shipping and other vessels being daily and constantly and some wholly employed in bringing the corn and coal which is consumed by the distillers trade up to london from the remotest parts of the kingdom    they work for the poor many thousands of familys being necessarily employed as well in the husbandry of the corn they use as in the malting it then in carrying and removing it to and from the maltingplaces to the ports for shipping it to london or otherwise to london directly by land    but above all this they work for the public in the extraordinary sums of money which they pay to the crown as well in the excise upon the spirits they extract as in the duty upon the malt paid before it comes to their hands and in the tax upon coals  to explain these particulars a little farther tho as briefly as we can let it be considered    the landed gentlemen must be sensible the distillers work for them since the distilling trade in and about london only consumes about  00000 quarters of corn and that corn necessarily employs  00000 acres of land for the produce of it for this kind of corn being generally the product of the remote countys where the lands are not rich we may venture to say two quarters upon an acre one with another is no mean crop and is sufficient to make a due calculation upon  n b the horses employed in the husbandry of  00000 acres of land every year and in the carriage of this corn to the malsters and the recarriage of the malt either to the market or to the port where it is to be shipped tho no guess can be made at their number yet this may with modesty be allowed that those cattle being very many must necessarily consume the growth and produce of many thousands of acres of land more  nor is it sufficient to say that if those lands did not produce this corn they would produce something else or that if the distillers did not take off and consume this corn somebody else would seeing it is evident england being now become what they properly call a corn country produces much more corn than it can consume and if that consumption should be lessened many of those lands must lie uncultivated as it is manifest many thousands of acres did before it is also a received maxim that every quarter of corn which is carried off and consumed more than was consumed before no scarcity being occasioned at home is so much clear gain to the public stock of the nation  if it be objected that the liquor distilled is consumed at home and so is not equally beneficial to the public stock as what is exported it is answered   but much of it is also exported and more would be if encouragement were given   that most of what is consumed at home is used in the stead and room of french and foreign brandys and spirits which are generally bought abroad with ready money and smuggld on shore to the ruin of the fair trader and lessening the revenue by a constant abcminable fraud and which it appears no laws yet made have been sufficient to prevent    the tenant or farmer is particularly worked for being assisted by the distilling trade and that in several respects as the distillers not only take off a great quantity of their corn but also take off those kinds which are not marketable for other uses as particularly   when through long drought the grain appears thin and light as is often the case or by unseasonable rains in harvest the farmers cannot get their corn well in or when by that or other disasters and accidents it is damaged either in the field or in the barn in the ear or in the sack in all which cases the farmer is put to great difficulty to dispose of it and were it not for the distillingtrade could do little with it but feed his hogs which would not enable him to pay his rent   the farmers have oftentimes lands which not only will not bear any other corn but that for want of manure and improvement which in some places is hard to be had of through the sterility and poverty of the soil are unable to produce either better corn or a better and fuller grain of the kind and which lands if they could not employ them thus must lie waste and untilled but are profitably cultivated by the vent which they find for that meaner kind of grain to the distillers this is visible in the northern and eastern countys and coasts of england where a very great quantity of poor and unimproveable lands which formerly lay waste are now plowed and sowed to the advantage of the poor tenants tho much more of the landlord    the encouragement given to navigation by the distillingtrade in england is visible in many branches of it for the corn and the coals which they consume being a bulky and heavy carriage and not to be easily brought far by land the number of coasting ships and vessels of all kinds are visibly increased since the increase of this trade and consequently the number of seamen employed are increased the advantage of which is so well known it needs not be enlarged on the coastingnavigation also being the greatest and best nursery of able seamen in the whole nation  to the increase of the number of ships and vessels thus employed might be added here the addition which that increase is to all the numerous trades both foreign and hometrades and to the employment of hands and increase of business which necessarily attends the building fitting out furnishing and victualling all those vessels but i forbear to run it out to its full length contenting my self to represent that this trade is a great addition to the marine interest and an increase and encouragement of all its dependencys  that they work for the poor is evident by their setting the poor to work which indeed is the best way of working for them the number of hands employed or whose employments are bettered and increased by this trade would take up a volume by it self to calculate and cast it up it is sufficient to say that as all increase of business is an increase of employment for the poor so all increase of employment for the poor is an increase of the public stock as it enables those people to gain their bread who were not able to do it or not so well able before and this again assists the landed interest too in abating the heavy rates of the parishpoor and enabling several thousands of poor people to support themselves and familys which must otherwise be left upon the parishes to maintain  this runs through all the several branches of business and people through whose hands the said manufactures pass as well the distilling part it self as the materials made use of for the production as corn and coals and the shipping and other carriages already mentioned as also the vast expensive works of the distillers themselves the copper and ironwork they make use of the vessels and large utensils and the number of hands employed and the exceeding charge daily expended by them in all these things  but we wave the multiplying particulars and come to the last article namely the great benefit to the public arising by the dutys with which this trade is loaded and which have now for many years increased the funds upon which the public credit has been so long upupheld and these are considerable in three branches   the several excises upon the spirits themselves laid in several branches and at several times and which amount in the whole to above a hundred thousand pounds per annum   the duty upon malt which is paid by the distillers in the price of the goods when they buy and which amounts to a very great sum   the duty upon coals of which the distillers consume by calculation above twenty thousand chaldrons a year   the advantages of this trade being thus considered it occurs in the next place to show   that this trade is yet improving that it is a growing trade and that if not discouraged by unreasonable hardships and impositions it is likely to increase in an extraordinary manner and   that this increase is likely to be obtained not by an increase of excesses and immoralities but by changing the gust of the people from drinking those other spirits and brandys which being manufactured corrupted and adulterated abroad are not only imported as well clandestinely as otherwise to the great injury of the health of our people but being bought by our ready money are a great disadvantage to our commerce and injury to the revenue    that the distilling trade is a still improving and growing business and it is worth considering to what a height and on what a just foundation it is likely to improve for if it be already even while it is not much above twenty years old in its present magnitude so advanced as has been already said as to pay so great a revenue to the crown and employ such a prodigious number of acres of land besides ships cattle and men what may it not do when by the improvement of the art and the granting such regulations by which it would flourish it shall from the mere goodness of the goods that shall be produced entirely suppress the importation of foreign mixtures and even of french brandy itself the spirit distilled from corn in england prevailing over them all by the force of its own merit  nor is this question unworthy the consideration of the crown it self whether the encouraging the distilling trade is not really a better and more effectual way to raise a revenue by it than loading it with new taxes which can have no other effect than to lessen the consumption and bring a rising manufacture under a decay  it is evident that as well by the dearness of french brandy and the corruption and fraud of the dutch importation as by the improved and still advancing goodness of the english malt spirit which i shall make appear is coming fairly up to be equal to the best french brandy the great and opiniated gust of the people to french and foreign brandy is already much abated and the consumption of our own product gains ground on them every day to the great advantage of the whole nation  as the consumption increases the public revenue increases of course without the addition of new taxes with this undeniable difference to the advantage of england namely that this way as the revenue increases all the forementioned advantages will increase the quantity of lands to be cultivated will increase the advantage to the farmer the employment of cattle ships and men will all increase with it whereas by burdening the trade with new dutys it cannot be pretended the consumption will encrese tho the duty should on the contrary if it should decrease as is most natural the dearness of all goods lessening the consumption then all those national advantages above must decrease in proportion  as to the weak pretenses of the malt spirits being destructive to the health of the people they seem only fit to be jested with as they have been and i must say i am sorry to see some magisterial people have exposed their weakness in this point so much  they have no where showed the world a reason why as good and wholesome a spirit may not be drawn from the corn whose mere decoction in other preparations is allowed to be so good as from any other materials and if as the learned say the spirit only is the nutritive part of all our food whether meat or drink there can then be no question but that a spirit carefully extracted from the gross and humid parts and faithfully prepared without any adulterations or corrupt mixtures must be as wholesome to the body as the same spirit unextracted and mixed with the common liquids by infusion and ebullition or as any spirit extracted from other principles of any kind whatsoever  as for the excesses and intemperances of the people and their drinking immoderate quantitys of malt spirits the distillers are not concerned in it at all their business is to prepare a spirit wholesome and good if the people will destroy themselves by their own excesses and make that poison which is otherwise an antidote it is the magistrates business to help that not the distillers it is humbly conceived also they would do the same with foreign brandy and spirits if there was no distilling at home in the whole nation  it is in the next place humbly offered to the public to consider what a trade and how ruinous to the nation in several considerable articles the distilling trade in england is now opposed to and how necessary it is to have that pernicious commerce if possible suppressed and this part is the more useful because it seems very few even of our most penetrating gentlemen are fully masters of it  were the foreign importation of spirits confined only to that species we call french which it is generally allowed is a wholesome and well extracted spirit yet as the french brandys are a product infinitely injurious to our commerce bought from a nation with whom we having no treaty of commerce cannot exchange our manufactures but must pay for them in specie to the evident turning the balance of trade against us in this respect they are injurious to the health of the public if not to the health of particular bodies and consequently it is a public good to discourage them and abate their consumption  but when we come to speak of the foreign spirits however falsely called brandys it is evident there the case differs extremely and we are so great sufferers in that part as well in respect to the health of the body as the prosperity of commerce and the frauds put upon the crown to the great loss of the revenue that as it is a public good in our distilling trade that we gain upon and lessen that trade so it must be some service to expose the abuses of it and let our people see how grsly they are imposed upon in it both in the public and private interest of our country  to set this dark commerce in a clear light it is needful to take notice by what unhappy artifice the subtle dutch traders are enabled our own weakness concurring not only to underwork us but to impose upon us and sell us spirits distilled from our own materials cheaper than we can make them at home tho as it happens their avarice so natural to their climate will not suffer them to make them so good  first then we are to suppose they have the malt from england as generally they have from norfolk and the parts adjacent  the fraud begins at the very beginning for the dutch approving to have their malt far grown on the floor and without dressing and skreening off the tails as we call them the malster lets it run in such manner that  0 quarter of barley shall measure out  0 quarter of malt i speak within compass for it has been known to measure  0 to  0 quarter from  0 now the fraud of this lies here the malt in the makers hands being gaged in the barley the duty which is   s per quarter is paid by the measure or gage of the barley wetted so the score or  0 quarter pays   l to the king  when this barley is malted and the malt comes to be exported the duty of   s per quarter is drawn back by debenture and then the malt being measured anew the  0 quarter being increased to  0 draws back upon that measure and so the exporter receives   l drawback upon that which paid but   l duty this is so vile a fraud and so openly practiced that nothing is more wonderful to me than that no notice has yet been taken of it except this that being so well known no care has been taken to put a stop to it  but it does not end here as there is a drawback allowed for the maltduty upon all the exported malt so there is a bounty paid to the exporter by the crown for the encouraging the exportation and this is   s   d per quarter more which being likewise paid upon the  0 quarter made out of  0 increases the fraud   l more so that the crown pays back to the exporter    l for every score of barley malted and receives but   l by which it is no wonder that the malttax should be deficient  suppose then the dutch pay a sham price per quarter for their malt and thus receive double for it again it is no wonder that they can distill a spirit from it cheaper than the distillers in england who fairly pay   s per bushel to the crown for all their malt and full   d a gallon for the spirits they draw from it  nor have the dutch done with us yet but let us examine it thoroughly and we shall see a greater fraud yet behind  the dutch i know not by what error on our side are allowed to import here foreign brandy the duty upon importation being   s   d per gallon or thereabouts whereas the french brandy pays   s   d per gallon this our people take up with and call it french brandy and having sufficient proof that it comes from abroad are satisfied with it as such  the dutch tell us it is not french tho we have good reason to believe that all the real brandy that is in it is french by which we are cheated that way but that is not the case it is apparent the dutch mix their own malt spirits with this brandy and send it to us while our people deluded with the notion that it must be right brandy because it comes by a foreign permit eagerly buy it for right brandy and give a price accordingly  let any one judge then under what disadvantages we carry on this trade with the dutch and how much it is the interest of england to put a stop to it and granting it is our interest the next thing is to consider what is the way to do it and that is easily answered the only way is to discourage the importation of their adulterated brandys and encourage and increase the distilling trade at home by which so many advantages accrue to the nation and the consequences of which would yet be greater than perhaps is expected or than is thought possible except by some men of more penetration than ordinary viz    the people will by little and little be brought off from being so fond of foreign spirits by the difficulty of coming at them and the badness of their quality as we see the taste of the nation was effectually brought off from the french to portuguese wines by the prohibitions and high dutys of the late war    the distillers here are apparently able to make as good as fine as clean and as wholesome a spirit from our own materials as any of those imported from abroad infinitely better than the dutch and as they are every day improving will very soon if they are not discouraged be able to outdo even the french brandy itself and it is apparent they produce so fine a spirit already that a very nice palate cannot distinguish it from french and had they the dutch trick of importing it from abroad they might easily sell it for french brandy among the people  i foresee that as abundance of people are apt ignorantly to charge the immoralitys and particularly the drunkenness of the age upon the great encouragement of the distilling malt spirits so they would make that growing evil a reason against the just encouragement which ought to be given to the business of the distillers as a trade as if the encouraging the distillers business would be an encouraging of drunkenness whereas we are speaking of it as a needful and an advantageous commerce a benefit to the public to the poor and to the whole nation and that would be infinitely more so if it may be encouraged in keeping out and putting a stop to that foreign pernicious commerce carried on to our great loss and disadvantage as to the vice of drinking to excess we are no way concerned in it the brewing trade and the wine trade are liable to the same objections yet i do not find it argued by any body that therefore we must have no beer nor wine  so hasty showers when they from heaven flow down are sent to fructify and not to drown and in the torrent if a drunkard sink it is not the brook that drowns him but the drink but it would be hard because the sinners slain for fear of drowning we must have no rain but to clear up this case upon which so much weak cavilling has been made i beg leave in a kind of historical way to enter a little into the state of national drinking in england as it has been and as it now is and tho i shall be very brief i slatter myself it shall be both useful and diverting especially i answer for it that it shall come directly to the case in hand and clear not only the distillers and the distilling trade but even all the liquors they make from the charge of being destructive to the morals of the people or an encouragement to drunkenness and excess any otherwise than nay not so much as all strong liquors are so to those who drink to excess  our drunkenness as a national vice takes its epoch at the restoration anno        or within a very few years after some run it back to james i time and refer us to the paintings on the ceiling of the banqueting house for proof of it but i am not writing satyrs i am upon a search after not so much the vice as the materials and manufactures upon which it is fed and by which it was supported  joy mirth good cheer and good liquor were the solace of the common people in the year      they rejoiced that after a long usurpation the king should enjoy his own again that after a long series of blood and confusion and a civil war in the bowels of their country the people should enjoy a public peace and tranquillity that trade should flourish and plenty succeed misery and want these were the several reasons of their joy and very merry and very mad and very drunken the people were and grew more and more so every day  as to the materials beer and ale were considerable articles they went a great way in the work at first but were far from being sufficient strong waters which had not been long in use came in play the occasion was this in the dutch wars it had been observed that the captains of the hollanders men of war when they were to engage with our ships usually set a hogshead of brandy abroach before the mast and bid the men drink lustick then they might fight lustick and our poor seamen felt the force of the brandy sometimes to their cost  we were not long behind them but suddenly after the war we began to abound in strong watershops these were a sort of petty distillers who made up those compound waters from such mixed and confused trash as they could get to work from such as damaged and eager or sour wines wines that had taken salt water in at sea lees and bottoms also damaged sugars and melasses grounds of syder and innumerable other such like for till then there was very little distilling known in england but for physical uses the spirits they drew were foul and gross but they mixed them up with such additions as they could get to make them palatable and so gave them in general the name of cordial waters and thus the strongwatershops usually made a vast show of glasses labelld and written on like the gallypot latin of the apothecarys with innumerable hard names to set them off  here as at a fountain the good wives furnished their little fireside cupboards with a needful bottle for a cherishing cup and hence as from wholesale dealers all the little chandlers shops not in london and its adjacent parts only but over great part of england were furnished for sale and to the personal knowledge of the writer hereof and of thousands still living not the chandlers shops only but just as is now complained of the barbers shops  barber surgeons they were then called were furnished with the same and sold it by retail to the poor people who came under their operations  and why should it be so suprising a thing then in our opinion that the geneva which as i shall show presently is but the same thing returned again should be so generally received among the inferior poor seeing would we but look thus a little way behind us it would appear that it was so with our ancestors and our poor people are only set down where their forefathers were before them as to the liquors i mean as to the difference of the quantitys and whether they drank more to excess than our people do now that is a question by itself and not much to the present case  but it is objected they did not drink such destructive liquors then as we do now that is in short they did not drink geneva for that is the meaning of it  this objection must be spoken to as we go along because it comes into the history i am upon for it leads me to give a brief account of what they did drink and where they had it i have mentioned the introduction of the strongwatershops and petty distillers who began this trade i come now to the liquors some of their names were as follow  aqua vitae aqua mirabilis aqua solis aqua dulcis these in latin anniseed water cinnamon water clove water plague water cholick water which in short was geneva these and many more in english but to sum up the whole aqua vitae and anniseed water were the captains or leaders and the strong inclinations of the people run all into those two and in a little while the latter prevailed over the former too and as anniseed water was the only liquor for some years the quantity that was drunk of it was prodigious great in a word it was the geneva of these times it was not only sold in the chandlers shops and in the barbers shops as above and perhaps in bulks and stalls too but it had this particular article attending it which we are not yet arrived to with the geneva viz that it was cried about sreets of which the memory of the famous anniseed robin will be a neverdying testimony who was so well known in leaden hall and the stocksmarket for his liquor and his broadbrimdhat that it became proverbial when we saw a mans hat hanging about his ears to say he looks like anniseed robin  this part viz of going about the streets and into the fields to shows and musters of the trained bands to cry a dram of the bottle has not been so long omitted but that we can all remember it and the bumboats who continue to this day crying a dream of the bottle in the river among the ships are a remainder of that custom and which was never left off atall  i should not however have troubled you with these instances from low life but that it is in the scene we are now acting and this anniseed robin was a magnipotent fellow in his day i assure you  having thus brought you back to the dramdrinking age i must let you see how a full stop was put to it on a sudden and what became of the drinking world in the mean time  as all these various sorts of good liquor had their meridian so they had too their declination and after some time they fell into a general dislike for the french outdid them exceedingly and pouring in their liquors at a very cheap rate and the goodness of the brandy recommending it self also the famous anniseed water began to lose ground and the people took their drams in plain brandy the physicians also on all occasions telling the people it was better than any of their compounded waters  thus the best brandy being sold for   d per quartern the poor could have a large dram for a halfpenny and the fellows that cried it about the streets carried with them little double dramcups which being held up on one side was a penny and on the other side a halfpenny  this held on for several years and the customhouse books will show the prodigious consumption till the late revolution when a furious and continued war the france breaking out a prohibition of trade followed brandy rose from   d to   d per quartern and from thence to a scarcity so that none good was be had the distillers not being yet come into the way of distilling from malt could not supply them and thus the poor were thrown off from the dramcup to the alehousepot to their great regret as well as expense for now they could call for nothing less than a pint which tho for a while it was but a penny yet soon after by doubling the excise came up to three halfpence where it still stays and thus i have gone through the first part of my history  it remains a question which i believe is not yet determined tho i see not much difficulty in it whether the morals of the people were the better or the worse by this change if i may use so much freedom i insist that they are much the worse and as my reasons for it are of some weight in the present debate i beg you will hear them summed up as briefly for your convenience as i can    the charge was immediately increased and a poor man that could before be refreshed in his labor at the small expense of a halfpenny was now obliged to spend three halfpence at a time as often as either necessity or inclination called him    the expense of time was immediately also increased for then poor men in their stails or garrets or shops or wherever they were at their work could call in and call up poor anniseed robin or any of his contemporarys or successors and take a dram without the least loss of their time and go on with their work or if they were at daylabour in the field or the street in the wet and the cold they could call for a dram for a penny or a halfpenny as their pockets could afford and go on with their business whereas upon this change the poor were really distressed and they made loud complaints of it as i very well remember  having thus gone through the history of what is past and given you some account of the manner of our drinking till within these few years allow me to bring it on to our own times and view our poor in the present situation of their great affair i mean of liquor for what they shall drink is i assure you no matter of mean concern to them  the poor as above having been reduced to the miserable necessity of this alehousetippling and grown sick of the tedious and dull as well as expensive way of drinking were apparently ripe for a change if they could have found any way to their advantage when on a sudden the diligent dutch fruitful at invention as the english are at imitation and with their own advantage at the bottom you may be sure helped them out again as they had done once before for the dutch sutlers carried into the camps in flanders during the late long wars against france a certain new distilled water called geneva being a good wholesome malt spirit if rightly prepared wrought up with juniper berries a thing not only wholesome but really physical and for many years allowed to be so by the most celebrated physicians  it was strange to observe how this liquor prevailed in the army how the soldiers were surprised at the goodness of it the spirit the vigor it put into them they declared publicly to one another there never was any such liquor heard of in the world it put a perfectly new spirit and new life into them and invigorated them at such a rate that it made them quite a new kind of people  at first like the champaign and burgundy it was drank among the gentlemen only a drink for generals and for officers nay they tell us in holland that even the great d of m gave it a character as a thing that inspired nature with a new flame and put a sort of vigor into the mind which nature itself was a stranger to before and that he recommended the moderate use of it to the greatest men when they were going at any time to engage the enemy  it is a great mistake to argue from hence that the dutch always made their soldiers mad with drink before they led them out to fight for what i am saying of them now is of the generals and officers before the soldiers came to have any fellowfeeling of this article  at first no doubt the dutch made a fine spirit of it and as perfect as it was possible to be expected but as the dutch are hardly to be charged with any deficiency in needful craft and that they saw plainly what was good for the high was also good for the low and that the poor soldiers money was as good to them as the great generals if they could but make it out in quantity they soon came into the old trading maxim viz that cheapness causes consumption and found out a way to make a sort of the same spirit and drawn perhaps from the same ingredients that being made meaner in quality should be proportioned to the purse as well as to the palate of the common soldiers  and thus the soldiers in the confederate camp came to the honor of drinking upon a level with their officers or at least flattering themselves that they did so which indeed was almost the same thing and if there was any apparent difference it was such that neither officers or soldiers were nice enough in their palates to judge of  it would interrupt our business and the main design of this work to dwell too long upon the particular steps and gradations by which geneva gained so much upon the minds of the common people or to enquire into the reasons of it if what i have said viz its being thus approved by their general officers gave the first occasion it is sufficient to tell you that by this means the geneva gained a vast credit among the dutch troops from the dutch it spread universally among all the confederate armies and the english soldiers became as great admirers of it as any other nation whatsoever except the mere dutch themselves for they indeed drank it like mothersmilk  but you are to take notice here that the subtle distillers and particularly the wise merchants of amsterdam who had felt the sweet of the trade had consulted together to bring this part to suit with their interest also namely that the geneva which they sent to the army for the use of the officers and gentlemen especially general officers bore a different price from that which was opened for the ordinary use of the army and for the common soldiers whether it differed in virtue and value or not i cannot enter into here for in such liquors as these i shall not answer for it that what is sold for the highest price is always of best quality in proportion sometimes fancy grounded upon an advanced demand answers to goodness and makes an equivalent to the quality of the liquor nor could those little needful frauds be always carried on without it but of that by itself  let this part be one way or other and be the liquor better or worse this is certain the price was reduced in the common suttlerscarriages and the poor soldiers had their gin at a rate fit for a poor soldier to pay and this too betrayed a secret in the dutch commerce which it has been proper to mention already and for the sake of which this part has been mentioned here and is absolutely necessary to speak of namely that the dutch were enabled to bring down the price of their geneva even without reducing the goodness  i must be allowed to say that it seems exceeding hard that as our distillers were not then come into the thing and that geneva was not known here they should find themselves so oppressed at their first entrance and the dutch should be able not only to make their own spirits cent per cent cheapter than we could but that they shall be still able to import them upon us fifty per cent cheaper than we can make them and yet raise them from the same materials namely from our own corn  and here there is such an allowed concession made by the whole legislature of great britain to one of the articles summed up in the first part of this work namely of the vast advantage the consuming of corn is to the landed interest that i could not but remind the reader of it namely the allowing back all the duty upon malt and   s   d bountymoney upon the exporting it as barley which if the sums drawn back by certificate in the countries of norfolk and kent only are cast up will appear surprising in value i say it is a full concession to our argument and nothing but a full conviction that the exporting it is infinitely advantageous to great britain can be a justifiable reason for it  were the commons of great britain to have been told when that law was made that all or the greatest part of the bounty whatever sums were drawn from the public by it would only have two effects and both of them pernicious to the british commerce in general and to the revenue in particular it is my opinion they would have considered better of it before they had passed it into a law or have put it in the power of a voracious set of men to have ruined so great and rising a manufacture and branch of our commerce at our own expense  were those bountys taken off for a while or were they reduced a little to a tolerable degree the consequence would presently be this that the dutch could no more draw a spirit  0 per cent cheaper from our own materials than we could or import it upon us mixed among french or other foreign brandys so much to our disadvantage  what reason can be alleged why the dutch should be able to extract a better spirit from the fame goods nay it is evident they do not and we are assured they cannot but they have gotten into a course of uncontrolled kry and by this they can send it over cheaper and that is sufficient to all the rest for cheapness causes consumption  but to return to the article above when first the dutch came into this trade as i hinted before p    they took their malt so rough so grown and so undressed that it was frequent for a score of english barley at that time to hold out  0 to  0 quarters of malt at the exportation which accordingly magnified the fraud and entitled the exporter to receive back twelve pound for a score of barley which upon being gaugd in the cistern paid to the crown but   l duty and so again in the bounty but they have been pleased to be a little less barefaced since and have thanks to their modesty reduced it by a slight dressing as above to forty quarters for twenty  n b there is a little cavil which may be raised here and we doubt not our opposers will think they have some advantage in it namely that the barley does generally swell one in the score before the gauging but we may answer that by itself  to what extremes do we see wise men run upon wrong information of things and yet how little care do they take to be rightly and better informed of the things they are mistaken about it will perhaps be very hard to persuade men of common sense to believe that the dutch can import their spirits extracted from our materials  0 per cent cheaper than we can make them and yet at the same time prove too that all the ordinary parts of the workmanship about them may be performed as cheap in london as in amsterdam  but it must be confessed that when they come to be more fully and rightly informed of things and to see what a cheat is put upon the english crown in the conditions upon which they get their corn which are the materials the riddle is expounded presently and we cannot suppose men to have common sense who will not then open their eyes to it  but to come back to thecamp our soldiers tasting this liquor brought the desire as well as the fame of it over with them at the ensuing peace and our distillers preparing it as well here as the dutch abroad they supplied the people with it wrought from our own corn the product of our own land very much to our advantage as has been said already the increase of the demand afterward encreassing the consumption of our own malt to a very great degree  it seems bacchus and the brewer take umbrage at this invasion and tho what between the winebrewer and the beerbrewer they have had the poisoning trade to themselves to long that one would think they should be satiated with the mischiefs of it tho they were not with the profits yet it seems they do not sit easy under it tho i am told the pretense of the brewing trade being declined on this account is but a pretense and no more it seems they could have been content with it in the apothecarys shops and allowed it among the materia medica to pass for good physic but when they found it applied to the defeat of tippling and sotting as above they resolved against it as fatal and destructive to the health and understanding and that as to the tempers of the people it was safer to be drunk with any thing rather than geneva  it is a poor foundation to raise clamor upon viz to single out the vicious temper of the poor to exclaim against when here is a vice in our trade that wants reforming first and which if an end were put to it would both do the crown and the revenue justice it would block up the door to any more dutch cheats of this kind at least and put it into our own power to reform the rest with more ease and till then i doubt it will never be reformed while we live  it has been suggested by some how weakly we shall see presently that burdening the distilling trade in england with new dutys will be a means to cure all the evils which they acknowledge seem to be growing upon us by the immoderate use or drinking of the malt spirits among the poor if these mens zeal for the reformation of the people was no greater than their knowledge of the true interest of their country they would never propose a method which should only shut the door against the drinking our own manufacture our spirits distilled at home and open the door to a flux or tide of the same or worse spirits imported from holland and so bring in dutch drunkenness among us too which by the way is yet something of a worse kind than our own feeding the intemperance of the people with the same or worse ingredients but giving the dutch the profit of it and leaving us nothing but the poverty and the crime  had not this preposterous notion started itself into the world just when these sheets were in the press and so fair an opportunity was left to answer and expose it this tract had not swelled to such a bulk but since the politics of these gentlemen have taken such a turn and this flight of their wit has carried them to such a height i must trespass a little on the patience of the gentlemen that shall see these sheets to give in a word or two upon so weighty a suggestion  all wise crowns and ours of england in particular make it a maxim in their laying dutys never by loading their own product to encourage importations from abroad in prejudice of the same goods manufacturd at home but if it shall be proved    that burthening the english distillery will only serve to increase the advantage of foreigners and ruin the manufacture of spirits distilled from our own corn at home how will it answer the wise maxims of state and of trade which we all depend so much upon    if it shall appear that such a burthening the manufacture at home will but increase the frauds of foreigners and instead of detecting the vilest clandestine commerce in england and the opennest and grossest abuse of parliamentary bounty with a lessening to the public good which it was appointed to increase wherre then will the good end of the parliament be answered and how well are such people qualified for politicians  and if after all it should further appear that the proposal itself comes from a quarter where no such sanative principles as these of preserving our trade are to be found but that it is all from a view to separate and corrupt ends tending in themselves to support the interest of a set of men who carry on a trade a thousand times more pernicious to trade and to the morals of the people than this i say if this should be proved by it all then it must give a new turn to our conceptions about these things themselves we must run em all over again in our thoughts  let us then endeavor to state the case clearly among us    that the dutch do cheat and impose upon us already most grossly and barefacedly or rather to put it right the exporters of the malt to holland do cheat and impose upon us for if the dutch are not the men let us not wrong the devil but lay the saddle on the right horse    that by this cheat let who will be in it the dutch distillers for we are not talking of the dutch as a nation but as traders and especially as distillers are enabled to buy their malt for less than half the price which our english distillers give for it    that by this means they are likewise enabled to work their spirits whether the geneva or other spirits for we are not now speaking of one sort more than another so cheap as to sell them one time with another for at least  0 per cent less price than our distillers can work them for from the same materials    that by the advantages disguises and various kinds of crafty ways which the dutch have for disposing and dispersing these spirits among our people under the names of foreign brandys and by the aid of foreign permits for they always find the way to make us the tools of our own delusions they have an opportunity to sell that  0 per cent dearer than we do which they can make  0 per cent cheaper  let any considering person take these things in pieces a little and examine them separately  all errors and mistakes of mankind are much better and easier prevented in principle than corrected in practice as fire is easier suppressed in the sparks than in the flame the first and grossest of all the mischiefs that can be complained of in the distilling trade are founded in this original fraud of putting    l of the crownmoney in the pocket of the exporters for every score of barley which is malted for their exportation whether to holland or any other part and for which they pay   l duty and no more or very little more as has been said  let us first see the magnitude of this cheat and then a little of the consequence of it suppose the dutch take off an hundred thousand quarters of malt a year for their distillery if i undercalculate it the gentlemen can make an allowance for that upon all their own estimations and i doubt not but i speak much below the quantity but i say suppose the dutch take off for the use of their distilling trade one hundred thousand quarters of malt from england every year l s d this ought by the malt debentures to draw back after the rate of   s sterling per quarter which is in the whole  0000 00 00 and for the bounty allowed by act of parliament on the exportation of it as corn it ought to receive also   s   d per quarter more which is upon the whole    00 00 00 total    00 00 00  this encouragement were there nothing more in it is very considerable and gives the dutch a vast advantage over our distillers here at home who pay this whole duty without any drawback bounty or other encouragement whatsoever except it be that they also pay a heavy duty upon the spirits again after they are distilled instead of which the dutch sending their spirits hither by the help of another fraud subsequent to all the rest have a price for theirs superior to ours and pay no duty at all and whatever duty is paid we pay it our selves as we are the last consumers  but after we have considered the heavy weight of    00 l upon every hundred thousand quarter of malt which the dutch take off and the disadvantages which our distillers lie under upon this account let us add to it what is mentioned p    and undeniably made out namely that the dutch or somebody for them draw off from us just two and thirty thousand five hundred pounds sterling more upon every hundred thousand quarter of malt they take off and which is done by the mere craft and fraud of the exporter as has been said which our offices are so supinely negligent in as to pass upon themselves for law or our officers so well interested in as to connive at i do not pretend to enquire whether it is ignorance or corruption let the gentlemen concerned acquit themselves of it as well as they can it is equal to the poor discouraged distillers whether they are oppressed by one or the other it is manifest they are oppressed by it be it which way it will it is the same thing if my house be fired whether it were done by a foolservant or a rogueservant the house is burnt and i feel the loss let it be done how it will  not but that it may come in my way in this debate to say something of the probable causes or at least the encouragements of these gross pieces of fraud and how a wise nation as we are esteemed to be or at least think our selves to be should come to shut our eyes so apparently to our own interest as to lie open to such cheats as these are and to be so abused every day nay not to shut our eyes to them but to be abused with our eyes open for certainly this can never be said to be a secret if it has been practiced so long and never seen before we must have been as unhappy in the ignorance as i think we are exposed in the fraud of it  but to return to the point about loading the distillers trade with farther weight i would humbly recommend to those gentlemen who have this design under consideration if any are so weak that they would first consider of unloading it and then they may put it into a condition to bear any hardships they shall afterward put upon it with the greater ease  let them unload it from the dead weight which these clandestine practices are not to the trade only but to the whole nation for in short it is a tax levied upon us to give to a set of clandestine traders whether they are dutchmen or englishmen or any men where the malt is shipped for holland it is the same thing it is a national grievance and a burden upon the trade which ought to be removed  all inequality of burdens is a prejudice to the fair trader in the sense of which maxim it has always been the care of our crown by an equality of burdens to give the fair trader a due advantage hence smuggling and clandestine trade is on so many accounts guarded against and by so many laws made criminal among us tho so impossible to be fully prevented  but here is a law which however good in it self and intended with the same just view is unhappily and by the craft of a set of foreigners perverted the point of it turned upon the fair traders and the greatest clandestine fraud that ever was of its kind practiced in england is set up by its authority so that the cheat is supported by the very law that was made to prevent it may it is founded upon the very execution of that law of equality on which justice was to have been expected  instead of an encouraging drawback by which the consumption of our growth was supposed to be secured and in order to which the exporter to have the benefit of all the duty that was paid being returned to him he receives   l per score in one article more than ever was paid and   l  0 s in another more than ever was intended  i have often heard it spoken of with some wonder in england how it came to pass that in some particular places on the coasts the drawback upon the duty on malt came to more than the duty it self as was alleged once likewise in the affair of the saltduty and by which as i have been told a gross abuse of the public afterward was detected whether it was so in the salt or no and how it came about is none of my business but if it be so likewise in the malt drawback i believe upon a due enquiry into the reason of it some of these wicked things might come to light and perhaps more than some people are aware of  but to reduce all this to the true end for which all such complaints ought to be made namely the preventing the like and supposing it to be detected and prevented as we hope it may what are we to enquire next  the next question is how would this reform the abuses of the distilling my answer is direct in two heads   you would then have no abuses to correct but our own whereas now all the corruptions and adulterations of foreigners are put to our homeaccount   the distillers then being as is said again secured and formed into a body with due powers to act by and sufficient encouragement are able to answer for all abuses of the trade that is they are able to answer that there should be no abuses committed no unwholesom liquors distilled or sold if they were distilled   this being the case there would be nothing left for the crown to be concerned in but to prevent if they can the intemperance of the people  nor would such a regulation want its encouragement even in the nature of the thing there are many ways to increase the revenue besides loading trade with new taxes if this particular branch clogged with difficulties and oppressed by foreigners smuglers and the like may be set free from those oppressions and weights giving it room to increase increases the revenue of course whereas while it sinks under those weights adding dutys only serves to sink it deeper and so even lessens the revenue which it paid before  this was the case exactly with the late high dutys upon pepper while those dutys subsisted the revenue was devoured i think i may say wholly devoured by the drawbacks and all the homeconsumption of pepper was supplied by clandestine trade that is to say by smuglers whereas those high duties being again taken off the trade returned into its own channel and the revenue revived which was sunk before  thus if the distilling trade should be loaded with more duties while these frauds on the foreign trade still remain unredressd what must be the case but this namely the foreigners would have all the business and the distillers might put out their fires and sit still  but i meet with another popular objection still and it shows a little from what quarter all the rest has come the objection is this  that the distillers pay too small an excise that they may pay a little higher duty very well and that they do not pay an equality with the brewer upon a quarter of malt  now tho this seems a little envious at best supposing we should grant the suggestion as if the brewer was uneasy that any malt should be consumed but what should pay as great a duty as that which their own trade pay yet as it happens not to be so in fact it exposes the objector so much the more and leaves us to guess a little the plainer whence these clamours at the distillers had at least some of their original i shall enquire into the particulars presently but shall name another objection of something a like nature along with it  it is also said there is a sudden and great decay of the brewing trade in london and this too they would place to the account of the distilling trade as if the distillers were rising upon the fall of the brewers all which are mere groundless jingles of a few designing men who would deserve more regard if they spoke truth and as they are mistaken deserve indeed little or none at all  it is true we have not room here to give a large and particular answer to all these cavils for such we hope to prove them to be and no more but yet we cannot close this tract without letting them know that we have heard all they have to say upon these material heads which upon the whole amounts to but very little in substance tho much perhaps in noise and pretenses the whole may be briefly answered in the following particulars reserving a more full and particular answer as we may hereafter see occasion but to take them as they lie    it is so far from being true that the distillers pay less duty upon a quarter of malt than the brewer that it is evident they pay more and not to enter at this time into a calculation of the particulars here not being room for it this we may undertake to assert namely that the distillers pay near    s per quarter upon the malt they use allowing a just proportion for its being not dressed down to the same fineness and consequently the same measure as that of the brewers  whereas on the contrary the brewers the dressing of their malt being likewise considered do not pay above   s to   s   d on each quarter  for let it be considered here what is observed already in its place and ought to have notice taken of it on all occasions namely that for the doublebeer paleales stout and such like drinks which the brewers now run so much upon and in which they do not draw near so great a length from a quarter as in the ordinary brewing they of course do not pay so much to the crown for the excise nay for these liquors they may be said not to pay six shillings per quarter on the malt whereas the distillers always extracting the utmost spirit the malt will put forth and paying as much duty for the meanest malt as the brewer does for the best has an infinite disadvantage and pays more for his malt by how much the less spirit he extracts from it  this as above will require a more full explanation and on occasion such an explanation will not be wanting but in the mean time those who make the objection know so much of the truth of it that they are able to save us the labor and answer themselves tho at this time perhaps such generous treatment may not be for their interest  i go back then to the first head namely that there is a great and sudden decay of the brewing trade my answer is    there has been no apparent decay of the brewing trade one year with another for above four years past to last midsummer what decay has been must be since that time    by consequence then the great increase of the consumption of spirits in england has not been the cause of the decay of the said brewing for as that increase has been of three or four years continuance why if it decayed the brewing trade was it never felt till since midsummer last    there has been no proportioned advance upon the distillery since midsummer last why then should the decay of one be occasioned by the other which has not felt the effect of it if the distilling had increased in proportion during that time and that so much more than ever it had done before then indeed the water of one channel being found in the stream of another would account for the difference but as that is not so in fact the deficiency must be from some other more apparent cause and that we shall see presently  the apparent causes of the decay or sudden stop of the brewing so far as the fact may be granted for it is not so mighty in fact as in noise are these    the excessive dearness of hops the last season which was so heavy a rentcharge upon the brewer that it really put a check to their whole business and some of them found it hard to furnish themselves with a suitable stock upon any terms whatever that difficulty has of course caused them to lessen the quantity of beer among their customers as much as they could when they came to lay in their stores    the dearness of malt it self which by the universal badness of the season in all the malting counties has had an effect upon the malt as well as upon other grain this has both lessened the quantity and advanced the price so that malt in particular has been   to   s per quarter dearer this year than it was the last these things have been so apparent and here so well known to other people as well as to the brewers themselves that it is something strange they should lay themselves open to so effectual a reply  but this too will appear less strange when we shall add that the kery of the brewers themselves to say no worse of it may have some share in the reasons for a sudden decay of their trade especially if it be true that they have come into that barefaced piece of policy viz to strike their work in order to lessen the excise and so make a joint clamor for promoting the design but of this we may say more in its proper place  but now to put in a word for the poor as well as for the trade and so to close this discourse you must allow me to say that were it so that they had quite forsaken the drinking beer and ale and were wholly come into the drinking of spirits brandy geneva or what you please it seems to me they have done not only that which their ancestors did before them but even what their superiors have seemed to lead them into just now by a general example as follows  there has been for some years and still continues among us a national gust or inclination to drinking stronger and high pricd liquors than formerly i do not say we drink more or more to excess that is a subject of another nature and however true is not to my present purpose but the stream of the nations palate runs i say for stronger and dearer liquors let me begin at the head  the ladys and gentlemen of quality and distinction not content with the usual and as i have said above most wholesome dram called right french brandy now treat with ratafia and citron at a guinea a bottle  the punch drinkers of quality if any such there be not contented with the best french brandy in their bowls must have arrack at    s to    s per gallon  the wine drinkers of the better sort not content with the portugal and barcelona wines must have high country morgeau o brian and hermitage clarets at   s to   per bottle and after that champagn and burgundy at   s to   s per bottle  the common draft of red wine of oporto and viana tho all stronger than the french wines formerly drank is not now strong enough for the citizens but they must be made up so the winebrewers call it with lisbons with alicants and benecarloes and the oporto and lisbon whites tho very strong are turned out of doors for the yet stronger mountain malaga  to descend still lower our common drinkers of ale or beer are not contented as formerly with the ordinary beer and beer or porters ale but they are advanced first to twopenny then to doublebeer and stout and now to the strongest northcountry burton and tamworth pale ale dorchester and newbury beers and the like of which great quantitys are brought up by land carriage above  00 miles and for which above  00 smallbrewhouses have as i am told been erected within these few years in the city and the adjacent parts which ales are sold from   d to  0 d per quart  in like manner then the poor following this unhappy humor of the rich and finding themselves as willing to gratify their palate only not equally able to bear the expense are fallen into the old dramdrinking way which their fathers practiced before them and which as it is easy to their pockets spends less of their time and unless they please no more prompts their excesses than the beer and the ale did before and if i may give my opinion i think indeed not so much and thus i have brought down the history to our present times  i shall close this tract which is already swelled to a larger bulk than was intended with a few very short hints at the disadvantage which the distillers at present are under in the course of their trade and which they hope to be delivered from by the justice of the parliament and the encouragements which they have reason to hope for and expect  some of the disadvantages they are under are as follows    that whereas all the malt exported to holland and from which the dutch extract the spirits which they import upon us draws back the whole duty besides a bounty of   s   d per quarter to the exporter not to speak of the fraud mentioned above and which doubles both the drawback and the bounty yet our own distilled spirit upon exportation draws back but   l   s per tun of the excise paid and nothing at all of the malt duty  thus the dutch are enabled exceedingly to underwork and undersell the english distiller even by our selves and at the expense of our own crown whom they so many ways injure in the said allowances    that by the advantages given to the dutch for the importing brandy   s   d per gallon duty less than the french which dutys are also paid by the importers not by the dutch they have an unrestrained liberty of imposing their mixtures upon us of a baser kind which mixtures because they apparently come from abroad and are called brandy at the customhouse our people are easily persuaded to take for true brandy whereas it is very well known that many times it is inferior to our common malt spirits and our distillers affirm they are able to outdo even the best of it  the dutch by the like artifice come into our rivers and ports or at least into the open roads where our ships ride as in yarmouth roads the downs st helens and even into the river of thames up to the nore and the hope and there supply our outwardbound ships with their spirits or brandys as they call them not only for the said ships use but also in quantities for trade for all which no entry is made or any duty at all paid so that our guinea and east india ships in particular which used to take in large quantities of liquors of our distillers go away now with little or no stores depending to be supplied by the dutch in the downs and other places  these are all great obstructions to the distilling trade and as they are withal great abuses upon the fair traders in general and injurious to the crown in particular we cannot doubt but if fairly represented the distillers shall have such relief as in right and justice they ought to expect  besides these apparent discouragements in favor of foreigners and in favor of clandestine trade they are unjustly attacked with clamours and popular pretenses as if their trade was a public nuisance and ought to be regulated by the magistrates suggesting that their liquors are unwholesom and destructive incentives to vice and tempting to the poor to the waste of their health money time and understandings things which tho not worth replying to their apparent partiality being sufficiently already exposed and as all the excesses of the people either in these liquors or any other are founded in their own intemperance the distillers say if they may obtain such powers and just authority which as a company they once had and still ought to have and which other companys in cases less essential to the health of the people now have so as they may be able to inspect and regulate the trade as it ought to be regulated they would answer to the world for the wholesomness of the liquors they extract and appeal to the understanding and sense of the most experienced physicians if unprejudiced  as for the learned and worthy physician who if report lies not is to be employed to show to the world the pernicious consequence of drinking geneva or malt spirits and how many thousands it has slain we impatiently wait his elaborate performance and to help it forward only beg he will not omit to prove also the few needful particulars following   that the malt spirits made in england are much more pernicious than those made in holland and sent over hither tho made all from the same materials   that the liquor called geneva is mortal in it self and that the juniper berries put into it are poison   that it is the liquor it self not the immoderate use or excess of it that does the mischief   that it is much better to be drunk with strongbeer and paleales brewed from malt than with spirits extracted from the same malt tho it is the spirit alone in the beer and ale that intoxicates   that drunkenness by ale and beer destroys no health wastes no time spends no money weakens no understandings and that it is only the geneva that does such wicked things as those   that there are more people drunk with geneva than with ale and beer and that a poor man can be drunk for a halfpenny   and lastly to clench it all let him prove that more people die of drinking geneva than die of the doctor not failing to tell to the world where that formidable geneva shop stands that has slain more christians than himself   finish
