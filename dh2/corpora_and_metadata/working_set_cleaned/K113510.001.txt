magnitudinem ejus ostendero l a flori epitome lib i london printed by henry hughs  mdccxcviii  advertisement these two volumes are composed from the xivth and xvth of my outlines of the globe i had many solicitations from private friends and a few wishes from persons unknown delivered in the public prints to commit to the press a part in the form in which the posthumous volumes might hereafter make their appearance i might have pleaded the imprudence of the attempt at my time of life of beginning so arduous an undertaking in my   st year i happily till very lately had scarcely any admonition of the advanced season i plunged into the sea of troubles and with my papers in one hand made my way through the waves with the other and brought them secure to land this alas is senile boasting i must submit to the judgment of the public and learn from thence how far i am to be censured for so grievous an offense against the maxim of aristotle who fixes the decline of human abilities to the   th year i ought to shudder when i consider the wear and tare of twentytwo years and i feel shocked at the remark of the elegant delaney who observes that it is generally agreed among wise men that few great attempts at lest in the learned way have ever been wisely undertaken and happily executed after that period i cannot defend the wisdom yet from the good fortune of my life i will attempt the execution  it will be formed upon the model of my introduction to the arctic zoology imitating as far as my talents will admit the great examples left by the disciples of the linnaean school and the solid writings of the liberal and communicative race of the hyperborean learned fitted by climate to assiduous study and to retain the immenseness of their knowledge when acquired the torrid zone generally enervates the body and mind the divine particle melts away and every idea is too often lost in irresistible indolence  yet there are two writers to whom i must own the highest obligations who felt no degeneracy by the influence of climate their thoughts are as firm and collected as if they had been braced by the steady frost of the north  the first is james rennel esquire late major of engineers and surveyor general in bengal the effects of his labors more immediately applied to the national service have been productive of others which have proved the brightest elucidations of a country till after the year      little more than the object of conquest and now and then  rarely indeed of sordid adventure mr rennels map of hindoostan or the mogul empire and the attendant memoir are unparalleled convictions of the accuracy of the author in the study of geography in which no rival dare dispute the palm of merit i cannot express the obligations my present work is under to his labors i understand that there is another of the same nature but far more extensive  perhaps in the press  every success attend the labors of his pen  i pede fausto grandia laturus meritorum praemia  the other writer i allude to is the celebrated sir william jones the subjects of that true genius were favored by apollo himself being as sublime and elegant as those over which that deity peculiarly presided the sun whose character might melt away the powers of feeble genii served only to exalt his strength of mind as its beams are feigned to give additional brilliancy to the diamond in its mine the reader will not wonder that i make him so nearly the alpha and omega of this my labor the various pen of my illustrious countryman excelled in every science phoebus smiled on all his undertakings and he was saluted by the whole circle attendant on the deity as gallus is said to have been of old  a truer simile cannot be adduced  utque vero phoebi chorus surrexerit omnis i must not be silent in respect to the labors of another gentleman who notwithstanding he never visited hindoostan has written with uncommon success on the wonderful mythology of the hindoo religion derived most happily the sources of many of its mysteries and traced their origins nearly lost in the mists of fable from the sacred purity of holy writ he has done the same by numbers of the abstrusest antiquities of the works of art and that with a depth of learning and perspicuity rarely to be met with but alas no choir rises to salute the reverend thomas maurice this learned divine bends under the weight of honesta pauperies that still voice which hurtmerit and conscious modesty cannot always suppress is often drowned in the clamors of the undaunted throng so as never to emerge into the notice of those whose peculiar duty it is to search deeply into characters be they in courts or choirs and to put to flight the ignavum pecus which are too frequently the pests of both who for their bellies sake creep and intrude and climb into the fold of other care they little reckoning make than how to scramble at the shearers feast and shove away the worthy bidden guest   thomas

opportunity of perusing a printed copy of the ms volume of the outlines of the globe which treats of arabia and persia they will find that we left behind the province of sind rent from the hindoostan empire by the usurper kouli khan who as nature seemed to have pointed out made the mighty river of that name the boundary between the persian and indian dominions  the sind or the seindhoo of the sanscrit the indus was called by the ancients indus a name retained by the moderns it rises from ten streams springing remote from each other out of the persian and tartarian mountains one of which originates in cashmere the rivers of the panjab and those which rise from the west above candahar and cabul are the great contributory streams but the parent one seems to be that which flows out of cashgar in lat     0 n the name sind is native and of great antiquity and mentioned by pliny and arrian as the indian appellative the one writes it sindus the other  we learn by the nubian geographer that the arabians call it mehran i mean to proceed down to its delta where it is discharged into the sea and briefly point out the most remarkable places ancient or modern which occur in my course  the indus peninsula of india or rather the streams which fall into it from the east particularly the ihylum or river of cashmere and the ganges near latak in little thibet to the north of cashmere approximate and then run diverging till they reach the sea and peninsulate the mighty empire so that they give the name to hindoostan of the peninsula of india india or hindoostan is not of vernacular derivation ancient as it is the name hind was given it by the persians who transmitted it to the greeks and they formed from it the word india for we are assured by the scientific linguist mr wilkins that no such word is to be found in the sanscrit dictionary for the aborigines of the country knew it by no other than that of bharata rennel xx and the attendant note  the discovery is new but we have preserved the ancient name of hindoostan given it by the persians and that of india by the grecians who gave that of hindoos to the aboriginal people of the country and stan a region  this vast peninsula was formerly divided into two parts hindoostan proper which was bounded on the south by the rivers nerbudda and soane and the southern borders of bengal and by the barrampooter on the east  the other division is the deccan which signifies the south and under that meaning comprehends all the rest of the peninsula as far as cape comorin this name and this division seem at present scarcely known except in the mention of the great soubahship possessed by nizam al muluck and his successors this is now greatly altered in its limits and abridged in its extent  hindoostan tends to a conoid form the northern part spreads into a large irregular base hurdwar the most northern place in the province of delhi is nearly in lat  0 long       cape comorin is the most southern extremity the point in lat   long        0 e the length therefore of this country is thirteen hundred and eighty three british miles the breadth at the base from tatta in the delta of the indus to silhet on the eastern extremity of bengal is thirteen hundred and ninety  it is necessary to be observed that india is bounded on the north by a range of most lofty mountains rocky and frequently precipitous and inaccessible these were the haemodus and paropamisus of the ancients and those which are interrupted by the indus forcing its way through the chain are called the imaus or the snowy but the flatterers of alexander in compliment to him bestowed on the western part of that outlet the name of caucasus as if says arrian exped alex p     they had been a continuation of his dominions in maps they still are called the indian caucasus pliny lib vi c    gives authority for this by saying they were caucasi parts  ancient roads to india the earliest notice we have of commerce with this great empire was in the book of genesis chapter    where we find mention of the ishmaelites carrying on a trade with egypt patriarchal in spices balm and myrrh the two last might have been productions of arabia or of gilead but the spices were consined to india they traveled at that time in caravans and carried their goods on the backs of camels in the very manner that their descendants the arabs continue to do from that period they took the same route as the patriarch jacob did and delivered their articles of luxury at the proud memphis as soon as they became a naval people much of the commerce of arabia as well as of india was conveyed to muza arrian periplus p      a port not remote from the modern mocha and from thence shipped to berenice or to myos hormos and placed on the backs of camels conveyed to the egyptian markets but in respect to the ishmaelites who had met with joseph and his brethren it is highly probable that it was prior to the time of their knowledge of navigation they had therefore performed the whole journey to and from india by land on their return they increased their caravan by the addition of the myrrh and balm the produce of their own country or of gilead which they had left not long before they met with the patriarchs at dotham a place in the middle of palestine not far to the west of the sea of tiberias they then proceeded on their journey to egypt with the addition of another article of commerce a slave in the person of joseph whom they had just purchased from his envious brethren  this communication with india was carried on for a great length of time to use the authority of holy writ our safest guide on all occasions we find that solomon gave it every encouragement he founded hamath in the country of galilee and tadmor in the wilderness or palmyra and many other cities of store kings i chapter   v       chron ii chapter   v    or emporia for the commerce of india and tire sidon and all the surrounding nations  i shall now mention the route for which the ancients were indebted to the macedonian hero who after passing the paropamisan caucasus founded a city on the southeast side of the ghergistan mountains or hindoo kho or the indian caucasus and called it alexandria in honor of himself alexandria alexander passed this way in his pursuit of bessus and returned by the same road on his invasion of india it is probable that alexandria was founded on the first expedition in order to secure his return into a country the conquest of which he had so much at heart according to mr rennel it appears to have been in lat    opposite to the modern bamian which stands on the northwest side of caucasus here according to quintus curtius lib vii c   he left seven thousand old macedonian soldiers and a number worn out in the service arrian i p   0 says that he appointed proexes a noble persian governor and niloxenus commissary of the army alexandria continued long an emporium of the goods of india the termination of the commercial views of the europeans till it was superseded by the rise of candahar and cabul it seems to have had to it two roads the one direct and the same with the course taken by alexander in his way from the caspian sea to his pursuit of bessus and his indian conquest through aria the modern herat herat which was till the latter ages a place of great strength and great commercial note in course of ages it suffered all the calamities to which the cities of the east are peculiarly incident but it often emerged abdulkurreem a noble cashmerian who attended kouli khan on his return from india see p    of his memoirs saw it in    0 on his return in a most distressful state the very ground floors of the houses were ploughed up and sown with grain but he speaks of the magnificent ruins which showed its former situation the country was uncommonly rich but the whole road from candahar to this city was a scene of desolation marked by the march of kouli khan on his return from india from herat the ancients directed their course to the southern part of the caspian sea this journey must have been performed by caravans of camels or horses as the road was destitute of navigable rivers the route touched on the shore where astrabad now stands which perhaps was the port  the second way and which was much frequented was toward the northwest the merchants went by champan drapsica the modern damian bactra now called zariaspa nautica the modern nekebad and from that town by a short stage to maracunda or samarcand samarcand seated in a most beautiful valley all these cities rose and were supported by the passage of the caravans as to samarcand it had long been a vast city known by the name of maracunda it was garrisoned by alexander the great after the capture at nautica of bessus the murderer of darius the scythians laid siege to it but it was relieved by the macedonian hero it is said to have been even then a city of vast opulence strength and splendour  from samarcand the articles of commerce were conveyed to the oxus the oxus the modern amu which runs at no great distance to the south that famous river rises far to the southeast in the caucasan chain it becomes navigable for barks at termed in lat     0 n long before it comes near samarcand it is singular that so distant a route should be pursued before the commodities were embarked in the days of el edrisi or the nubian geographer p     we find that it was frequented on that account the geographer mentions termed among other stations near that great river when the goods were shipped from samarcand they fell down the stream which in the time of herodotus passed through a marshy tract the paludes excipientes araxem now the aral lake out of which it flowed and going southwest fell into the caspian sea in the bay of balchan this passage has been destroyed above two centuries ago and its ancient channel is scarcely to be traced master anthony jenkinson a most authentic traveller gives the following account of the cause in his travels into those parts in      as related by purchase see p     the water that serves all that country is drawn by ditches out of the river oxus unto the great destruction of the said river for which cause it falls not into the caspian sea as it has done in times past and in short time all that land is like to be destroyed and to become a wilderness for want of water when the river of oxus shall fail  i will now briefly enter on some other ways pointed out by the ancients as commercial routes into india other routes one is that mentioned by pliny lib vii c    who probably speaks on good authority his account is founded on intelligence delivered down by pompey when he was pursuing the mithridatic war it was then certainly known that it was but seven days journey out of india to the bactryan country even to the river icarus which runs into the oxus by means of which the indian commerce may be transported by the channel of the caspian sea and again by the river cyrus the modern kur caspian sea on the western side as far as phasis the rione or modern fasz a large and navigable river which falls into the head of the euxine sea and appears to me a communication of great practicability  i may also mention batnae batnae a large commercial city built according to ammianus lib xiv c   not remote from the euphrates in mesopotamia by the macedonians it was filled with rich merchants an annual fair was held there in the beginning of september and it was then the resort of multitudes of people for the sake of the commodities brought from india and even seres or china and various other places both by land and water the last by the channel of the persian gulf and so up the euphrates  the seres reminds me of the last communication i shall mention the seres which was to the north leading to the distant country of china the chinese merchants descended from their country and leaving the head of the desert of gobi to the west reached little bucharia and got the convenience of the river ilak for part of their journey  the ancient comedae comedae the same with cashgar seated in lat  0 n in the casia regio of ptolemy lay at the foot of mount imaus the indian and chinese trade carried on through this city is still considerable the river sir the old iaxartes is not far to the west of cashgar and might by its falling into lake aral be an ancient channel of communication with the caspian sea this city was the rendezvous even in early times of the merchants trading with the country to the north and to the south this i dare suppose was the receptaculum eorum qui ad seras negotii causa prosisciuntur penes imaum montem of ptolemy and near it to the east was the lithinon purgon and turris lapidea of ammianus shaws travels p  0   which by the name turris lapidea could be no other than a beacon sixed on a stone tower  hierken to the south of cashgar hierken was another celebrated mart and is still the center of commerce between the north of asia india thibet and sibiria when the merchants reached the indus they fell into the tracts before described  the seres above spoken of were the inhabitants of the north of china remarkable for their silk which the ancients believed was combed from the leaves of trees and when steeped in water was corded and spun and after their manner wove into a web these seres had some intercourse with the romans for florus tells us that they sent ambassadors to augustus who were four years on their journey they were a most gentle race and shunned mankind yet carried on a traffic in the same manner as the western moors do at present with people they never see the moors go annually in caravans singular traffic laden with trinkets to an appointed place on the borders of nigritia there they find several heaps of gold deposited by the negroes against each of which the moors put as many trinkets as they think of equal value and then retire if the next morning the negroes approve the bargain they take the trinkets and leave the gold or else they make some deduction from the gold dust and in this manner transact the exchange without the lest instance of dishonesty on either part tassys memoirs p      tassys account is that a commerce similar to this is carried on between a nation called the cadensis and the negroes the cadensis act as the middle man between them and the tunisians who go to their country and obtain gold and negro slaves for european commodities   candahar candahar seated in lat    o n long       e is the capital of a recent kingdom formed by the convulsion given to this part of the eastern world it was founded by ahmed abdalla an afghan prince compelled by kouli khan to join his army in      on the assassination of the tyrant he appeared again among his subjects and added to his dominions candahar cashmere and some other small districts his successors reside at cabul he has an army of two hundred thousand men once clothed with british manufactures which were sent up the indus and thence to cabul by the lesser river  candahar is a city of vast strength by nature as well as art being seated amidst fens and rocks the governor hossein khan defended it eighteen months against all the attacks of kouli khan at length reduced to extremity he sallied out at the head of his men and fell bravely fighting in defense of his country  candahar and cabul were considered of high importance in a political light the first was esteemed the gate of india in respect to persia and cabul that in respect to tartary and both were in the middle ages the great emporia for indian goods which were transported into western tartary and from thence by the caspian and euxine seas to constantinople and from that city to all parts of europe candahar was the magazine of the indian and persian goods and cabul of the spices they were conveyed in caravans northwestwards to the famous city of samarcand in lat  0 n and from thence the goods were put in boats and sent down into the oxus or amu which falls into the caspian sea as i have before related and there shipped for their different destinations those for russia up the volga those for constantinople up the river cyrus the modern kur which descends a great and rapid river from mount caucasus and is navigable very far up so as to form an easy communication with the euxine sea venice and genoa received the indian luxuries from constantinople and their own port of caffa and dispersed them over the other parts of europe  both these cities continue the emporia of persia india tartary and all the circumjacent nations the commerce is still considerable notwithstanding it has been lessened by that of the european nations who have established factories in almost every part of the indian empire  cabul is seated in lat       n long       e cabul at the foot of the indian caucasus and in so happy a climate as to produce the fruits of both the temperate and torrid zones notwithstanding it is bordered by mountains capped with eternal snow the indian historians speak of it in the most rapturous terms it stands on the river kameh which falls into the indus at attock but possibly is interrupted by rapids as it is only navigable by rafts  cabul is the residence of the kings of candahar and the present capital the nubian geographer p    speaks of cabul as a noble city that its mountains abounded with the sinest aromatic woods neregil and myrobalans the first may be nellila phylanthus emblica the others the spondias purpurea etc all the myrobalans had once a name in our shops as gentle purgatives among other purposes they are used in the tanning business  of late days cabul has been noted for its vast fairs of horses and cattle the first brought there by the ushec tartars slaves are also a considerable article of commerce merchants resort to these markets from persia china and tartary it was taken by kouli khan by storm who put great part of the garrison to the sword and made himself master of a vast treasure in arms ammunition and jewels kouli khan showed here a strong specimen of oriental justice by ripping up the bellies of eighty kuzzlebash or soldiers for only being present when some of their comrades forced one of the country women  the genoese caffa those once enterprizing people made themselves masters of caffa a noted city and port on the euxine sea in the famous peninsula of krim tartary this they seized in      and made the emporium of the commodities of india and persia which were brought down the oxus and the other routes mentioned in the preceding page they colonized caffa with their own countrymen and gained prodigious wealth during the time they were in possession it was wrested from them in      by mahomet the great and with it soon expired the mighty power of that city of merchants genoa for centuries the rival of venice equally potent and equally brave waged long and fierce wars with each other incited more by avarice than the ambition of glory  bochara bochara not far to the south of samarcand was another great emporium and communicated the eastern articles to all the neighboring parts of tartary it traded with india china and persia and partook of those of muscovy by the caravans which went from that empire to cathay this city seems to have been of more modern date it is not mentioned as far as i recollect before the days of the nubian geographer who wrote some time prior to the year      but it appears to have been in the next century a most flourishing place  anthony jenkinson purchase iii     gives a very curious account of the state of bochara and its commerce as it was in the year      this has been uninterruptedly continued from the earliest time to the present for the northern parts of asia have their wants and luxuries to supply even from india and china the discovery of the passage by the cape of good hope gave a great check to this inland commerce no more commodities were conveyed that way to the greatest part of europe yet still the trade is very considerable to the places i mentioned and even to the russian empire catherine has as yet no share in hindoostan no indian fleets her splendid courts and all the luxuries of her vast cities are supplied either from astrakan or from the other caspian ports astrakan is the great russian staple of the indian commerce gurjef and kislar are the same persia has its derbend niezabad baku and others the tartars have their bay of balchan and mangushlak through which bochara still pours its indian articles of commerce it is foreign to the plan of outline to enter into minutiae i must therefore refer to the second volume of my friend the reverend wm coxes valuable travels the  th chapter will satisfy the most ardent curiosity  in respect to the ancient russian commerce with these distant parts russian commerce i shall conclude the subject with observing that after the various commodities of india had arrived through the channel of the oxus into the caspian sea they were shipped for the volga the rha of the ancients that river was so little known to the ancients that they have not left us the name of a single place in its whole course the merchants ascended that great river after navigating it a very considerable way they entered the kama and arrived through the kokra at tcherdyn seated in lat  0    north in those early times a mighty emporium from thence the several eastern articles of commerce were dispersed over all the arctic regions the nortmans and the sueons people of the baltic had great intercourse with them through the nova and ladoga another vast emporium seated on the lake of the same name as a proof of the antiquity of its commerce coins of greece and rome of syria and arabia have been found in the ancient burying places evidences that the people of the east and of the west had met there to supply their several wants even at tcherdyn coins of the arabian caliphs have been discovered notwithstanding the immense wealth of both tcherdyn and ladoga scarcely a trace is to be seen of those great emporia the commerce of the first extended even within the artic circle the beormas the people of the old permia ascended the petzora with their furs exchanged them for the products of the torrid zones and falling down that northern river dispersed them over all their chilly regions  the march of alexander to the panjab i introduce again the paropamisan alexandria no place could be fixed on with greater judgment whether as a place darmes or an emporium of the mighty empire he designed from which he could form the vast commerce he meditated for in his lucid intervals a more able monarch never existed as from a head quarter from hence he directed his expedition to bactra and sogdiana the modern countries of balk bucharia and samarcand having fulfilled the objects of his march he returned and from this place set forth on his great design the conquest of india i will attend his march across the country to the banks of the indus  the conqueror took a northeastern course and passed by the tract of the modern towns of killaut tazee meerout jomrood and gundermouk he crossed several rivers in his way such as the cophenes or cow river or nagaz and the choe which falls into the guraeus or modern kameh on the upper part of the cophenes which is called dilen stood ghizni ghizni once the capital of a mighty empire of the same name which consisted of the tract lying between the indus and parthia to the south of the oxus and part of the ancient bactria the city is now a heap of ruins and scarcely mentioned in history its emperor mahmood i surnamed ghizni first invaded india in the year  000 his first conquests extends only to moultan he in  0   conquered the kingdom of guzerat at that time all hindoostan was inhabited by the aborigines with true mohammedan zeal he exercised all sorts of barbarities against the hindoos and in order if possible to exterminate their religion levelled with the ground their favorite pagoda sumnaut and every other object of their worship the ghiznian empire continued  0  years mahomed began his reign in     and it became extinct in       the city of attock stands opposite to the junction of the kameh with the indus in the district of bijore not remote from hence stood the aornos petra and inaccessible mountain aornos petra towering into a conical form with a castle on its summit which gave so much trouble to alexander and which he took merely by an unexpected panic of the garrison m danville supposes it to have been the modern renas situated in about lat    north our countryman the gallant captain john jones in      mastered by open storm dellamcotta a fort equally strong and seated in a manner equally singular amidst the boutan mountains  amidst the savage mountains of sewad and bijore offspring of the macedonians inhabits a tribe who assert that they are descended from some of the followers of alexander the great who were left behind when he passed through the country possibly the garrison of alexandria and of the other garrisons he left behind might also contribute to this mixed species of population the tribe of sultani assumes the honor of being the descendants of a daughter of that conqueror who came from cabul and possessed this country and to this day carry with them their pedigree abul fazul ii      they call their great ancestor sultan secunder zulkerman which mr rennel p     observes should be printed zul kernine or the twohorned this is certainly a most remarkable allusion to the prophecy of isaiah viii   in which alexander the great is foretold under the description of the goat with this difference only that they double the number of the horn with which he had destroyed the power of the persians and the medes see rollins ancient hist vi       taxila stood on taxila or near the spot where the city attock now stands here alexander crossed the indus on a bridge of boats which his favorite hephestion had some time before been sent to prepare in      the famous timur beg or tamerlane passed this river on one of the same kind in our days kouli khan who may complete the sanguinary triumvirate crossed the indus at attock in the same manner this by reason of the great rapidity of the stream in all other parts was fixed on as the most convenient place which long after induced the emperor akbar to build the castle of attock for its defense against similar invasions  opposite to attock stood a very ancient city the nilaube of ptolemy this place is mentioned by two of the oriental historians quoted by major rennel p    under the name of nilab by which the river indus itself was generally known by the old writers plin lib v c    arrian exped alex i       alexander after succeding in his passage panjab got clear of the mountains and arrived in the rich plains of panjab or the five rivers each immortalized by being a great scene of action of the macedonian hero the hydaspes the modern behut or chelum the acesines or jenaub or cheenaub and the hydraotes or modern rauvee all which after a long course unite in one channel which retains the name of cheenaub and after the junction passes through the country of the oxydracae beneath the north side of moultan and at the distance of about twenty miles from that city falls into the indus about two hundred miles below attock in magnitude equal to the indus itself  on the banks of the hydraotes stood the city of the malli malli who with the oxydracae after a most gallant resistance made submission to alexander in the same neighborhood stood the site now unknown sangala inhabited by the cathaei of arrian ii         exped alex and the catheri of diodorus siculus lib xvii c  0  they are supposed to have been the same with the valiant cast the khatre to this day renowned for their desperate valor alexander besieged them in their city their defense was brave and obstinate but they fell before the fortune of the macedonian hero who destroyed the nation and levelled their city with the ground a nameless city as mr rennel styles it was to be found higher up the river on the opposite side this deserved to have been immortalized as having been the place where that hero endangered his life by one of the rash actions he was very subject to fall into alexander wounded he leaped into the city was beset by enemies and received a desperate wound in his side by an arrow which had transfixed his breastplate he fainted but recovered the moment he felt an indian going to strip him and drawing a dagger pierced his assailant to the heart i leave the reader to consult arrian exped alex i     about the event and mr rennel p     as to reasons for fixing the site of the momentous affair in the place he does about ten miles above the conflux of the two rivers  gold is found in some of the rivers of panjab gold in respect to gold we are informed by herodotus thalia c    that the indians paid their tribute to darius in that precious metal and tells us that it is procured out of the rivers and also dug out of the earth and smelted by them into ingots before they make with it their donative one of the epithets the poets bestow on the hydaspes is aurifer possibly as being peculiarly rich in gold herodotus thalia c  0  relates and seems to credit the strange story of its particles being thrown up with the sand of the vast desert probably that of registan by ants as big as foxes and that the indians went with three camels to collect the grains which they found in the hillocks as soon as they had filled their bags they returned with all possible expedition to avoid the fury of the ants which pursued them with incredible swiftness it is reasonable to suppose that the historian had heard of the monstrous nests of the termites or white ants which his informants thought proper to stock with most monstrous inhabitants  on the banks of the hydaspes was fought the decisive battle between alexander and the indian monarch porus battle with porus both equal in valor but the former by his great superiority in the art of war obtained a complete victory with a handful of men porus employed not fewer than two hundred elephants which terrific as they might have been to the macedonian horses were with their garrisoned towers totally destroyed by the victorious army  i cannot resist the introduction into this place of the following curious anecdotes of the two famous monarchs persian history of  as communicated to me by major ouseley the ingenious author of the persian miscellanies he informs me that two persian writers mention the invasion of hindoostan by alexander the great ferdusi in his shah nameh or chronicle of kings written about the latter end of the  0th century and beginning of the   th and nezami another celebrated poet who flourished in the   th the first enumerates the various troops of persia greece and india and the camel loads of presents which alexander received from keid the indian prince nezami in his skander nameh or history of alexander says that forty elephants were laden with the various productions of the country among which several carried indian steel porus is mentioned under the name of four the poet adds he brought two thousand elephants into the field which by a contrivance of aristotle alexanders secretary were completely routed and four himself killed by alexander who found in his castle of canooge immense treasures  on the banks of this river nicoea and bucephala opposite to each other he built on the bloody scene two cities nicoea and bucephala nicoea so named from the victory the last in honor of his celebrated horse which died of old age at the time of this action alexander gratefully paid it the highest funeral honors erected a magnificent sepulcher and called the city after its name  i shall not trace the sieges battles and slaughters of this ambitious character of his marches and his passages over the rivers that form this part of the panjab but leave my readers to consult his original historians arrian and quintus curtius it is very certain the hero did not amidst his deeds of arms neglect the study of natural history it is well known that he caused every species objects of that science to be collected for the use of his tutor aristotle q curtius relates some few remarks on the zoology of the neighborhood he met here with the rhinoceros rhinoceros etc etc with the great serpent boa constrictor gm lin iii  0   with parrots or birds which could speak and with great flocks of wild peacocks aelian in his hist an lib v c    relates that the conqueror was so struck with their beauty that he forbad his soldiers from killing them under the heaviest penalties  psittacus is a name derived from sillace the indian word for a parrot linnaus gm linn i     gives to one species long known the trivial of the maccdonian hero psittacus alexandri as if in honor of the species discovered by his admiral nearchus  the same great officer mentions also the vast spotted serpents the boa which he says were about sixteen cubits long arrian i     rev indic his veracity has been called in question but since the aristotelian cubit is little more than an english foot and a half we may give full credit to his having seen a serpent of the length he gives or one of twentyfour feet the ancients are often abused for their credulity but let me remark that incredulity is more frequently the offspring of ignorance than the former at this time instances may be adduced of species from twenty to thirtysix feet in length in hindoostan ceylon java and several other islands bontius p    a most respectable writer bears witness to the existence of some of thirtysix feet being found in java  among the trees the ficus indica ficus indica the varinga latifolia of rumphius could not fail engaging his attention which formed a grove of itself by the rooting of its pendulous branches  the mountains bordering on the hydaspes were part of the cachemerian chain clothed with forests of trees of vast height and size he committed to the care of certain officers the falling the timber and floating it down the river to the place he had appointed for the rendezvous of the vessels which he had used in his expeditions up the other rivers at this place which was between the forks of the indus and acesines he founded another alexandria another alexandria and there formed his docks and ship yard he built several new ships rebuilt and repaired others and with a fleet which consisted of eighty triremes or ships with three banks of oars and with lesser vessels probably collected from the several rivers of the country in all amounting to two thousand of different kinds he fell down the hydaspes on his arrival at the junction of that river with the acesines which preserves its name till it is lost in the greater river his navy underwent the utmost danger by the violent collision of the two waters several of his ships were dashed to pieces and himself and his admiral nearchus with difficulty escaped the sides and channel are filled with rocks and alexander through ignorance of the climate of india undertook his expedition in the rainy season which besides the swelling of the rivers which impeded his march made dreadful havoke among his troops by the diseases of the country  the other two rivers which complete the panjab are the beyah once the beypasha and the hyphasis of alexander the fifth and last is the setlege or suttuluz the zaradruz of ptolemy and hesudrus of pliny these rise in the mountains that divide thibet from india and unite near firosepour soon after which they divide and insulate a pretty considerable tract into several islands then reunite and turning southerly fall into the indus fiftythree miles below the mouth of the chenaub according to mr rennels great map between the insulated part and the hydraotes was the seat of the malli and the catheri objects of the destructive ambition of alexander who in his expedition against those people seemed more intent on slaughter than useful conquest it was on the banks of the hyphasis says quintius curtius that the hero joined his forces with those of hephestion after each had performed some bloody exploit here he concluded his expedition and after the display of his vanity by erecting twelve altars near the junction of the hyphasis and hesudrus commenced his voyage down the indus the altars were equal in height to the loftiest towers of war on these he performed sacrisices after the manner of his country he then entertained the indians with athletic and equestrian games and concluded with investing the vanquished porus with the sovereignty of the whole country as far as the hyphasis  during his stay in these parts he founded another alexandria between the forks of the indus and acesines the modern name of the place seems by mr rennels map to be veh  it does not appear that ever he saw the hesudrus which according to pliny was a discovery of seleucus nicator one of his ablest officers and his successor in part of his dominions and particularly of those between the euphrates and the indus he seems to have succeeded also to the ambition of his master for he meditated the conquest of india or at lest of reconquering those provinces beyond the indus subdued by alexander but which soon after his retreat were recovered by sandracotta sandracotta an indian of mean birth but who by his abilities had rendered himself master of all india seleucus found this new monarch so very powerful that he did not venture to attack him he entered into a treaty with him and agreed to retire on condition sandracotta would supply him with five hundred elephants and thus covered his disgrace with a specious pretense  alexander began his voyage down the indus about the end of the month of october and was nine months in the completion not from the difficulty of navigation for it might have been performed in a very short time but from his ambitious rage of conquest and slaughter on each side of the river his army marched divided in two parts on the eastern and western banks ready to execute his orders attended by his vast fleet  one motive to this voyage was a suspicion alexander had entertained that he had found out the head of the nile and that this was no other than the celebrated river of egypt because he saw in it crocodiles and beans the nymphoea nelumbo of linnaeus similar to those of that kingdom arrian adds that alexander had even written to his mother an account of his discovery  in our way down the stream we find among the sogdi another alexandria founded on the site of the royal residence of their monarch the modern bekhor or bakhor in lat        we afterward come down to sindomana sindomana the capital of the sindomanni possibly it took the name from the tract being possessed of a considerable manufactory of sindones or fine cloths  being the name applied to certain kinds the produce of the indian looms i must not call them linens for i understand that india produces no sort of linum or flax it appears by arrian musicanus to have been in the dominions of a prince called musicanus and that it opened its gates to alexander on his passage down the indus musicanus had deserted that hero who caused him to be crucified and all the brachmins he could find to be put to death as our edward i did the welsh bards for the same reason supposing the enthusiastic songs of both to have inspired their countrymen to the defense of their country against the ambitious invaders  the next ancient place of note is the prasiane insula of pliny prasiane insula formed by the dividing of the indus about twelve miles below stood mansura a city mentioned by the nubian geographer p    that town was the ancient minnagara of arrian ii     mar eryth its port was the barbaricum emporium of the same imports near the most western mouth of

indian indigo rumph amboin v p   0 tab  0  let me here mention indo scythia that all the lower and middle parts of the western boundary of the indus went by the name of indo scythia the scythians chiefly the getae had expelled the greeks who continued long after the retreat of alexander and repeopled it with colonies of their own nation the getae were the most brave and most just of all the scythians and continued to preserve this character in their new possessions  a few miles lower begins the delta of the indus pattala named after the egyptian or that of the nile and was called by the indians pattala which in their language signifies the same thing there is a greater and a lesser delta it is near the sea intersected by numbers of unnavigable channels and creeks the isles formed by these were the insulae solis of mela lib ii c    contra indi ostia fatal says he to all that enter them by reason of the violent heat of the air there is not at present in all india a place more fatal to europeans pattala was the first indian emporium frequented by the romans but the passage from the red sea was greatly infested with pirates for which reason the ships always took on board a certain number of archers for their defense plin not hist lib vi c      the tide comes up with a vast bore or head vast tides and is very dangerous at certain times to vessels which are in its way the fleet of alexander when he had arrived near the mouth of the river was surprised with one of these bores and lost great numbers of ships those which lay on the sand banks were swept away by the fury of the tide those which were in the channel on the mud received no injury but were set afloat arrian i p p         exped alex   the mention of this occasions me to return to the conclusion of the expedition of the macedonian hero when he reached pattala he found the city deserted the fame of his barbarity had induced the prince who had before submitted to retire with all his subjects alexander finding the necessity of repeopling the place sent out light troops who made some of the late inhabitants prisoners those he treated with the utmost kindness dismissed them and promised them protection if they could induce their fellowcitizens to return he succeeded in his design he formed a haven and made docks in order to refit his fleet which being accomplished he sailed down into the ocean the dangers which might occur in an unknown sea and the pressing instances made by his friends induced him to return he landed his forces and took the rout toward gedrosia and at length arrived at the city of babylen with the remains of his faithful army reduced by the toilsome march by famine pestilence and every calamity which his phrenetic ambition had involved it in  he had committed the care of his fleet to nearchus a man of first rate abilities who engaged to conduct it through the ocean to the persian gulf and the euphrates he performed his engagement after many difficulties when he had arrived at harmozia the modern ormus he heard that his master was not remote he landed with a few of his companions and in five days reached the army but so squalid and miserable in their aspect that alexander shocked at their appearance took nearchus aside and asked whether he had not lost his fleet on being assured of its safety he gave way to the most unbounded joy and crowned both him and leonnatus with golden crowns nearchus for having preserved the fleet leonnatus for a victory obtained over the oritae and the whole army saluted the former with flowers and garlands scattered over their celebrated admiral arrian i         exped alex   i must not quit the historical part of the indus semiramis without mention of the expedition undertaken by the heroine semiramis many ages before that of alexander certainly historians must greatly have exaggerated the preparations they make her army consist of three millions of foot and two hundred thousand horse and a hundred thousand chariots and multitudes of ships ready framed and carried in pieces by land to be put together in order to cross the indus i suspect that these vessels were no more than so many coracles or vitilia navigia made of bamboos like those used by ayder alli in our days on the waters of malabar in order to supply her wants of real elephants she caused a multitude of fictitious ones to be made out of the skins of three hundred thousand black oxen which were placed on camels backs guided by a man within this strange machine stabrobates stabrobates king of india received advice of her preparations and by a prudent embassy endeavored to divert her from her intentions the queen rejected his remonstrances crossed the river and defeated the fleet of the indian monarch that perhaps was not difficult notwithstanding it consisted of four thousand boats but as they were formed only of the bamboo cane they never could resist the shock of timber ships the victory proved fatal to her she succeeded in crossing the river but was deceived by the pretended flight of stabrobates she pursued and overtook him the battle was fought the indian monarch discovered the fictitious elephants and semiramis was totally defeated she repassed the river with precipitation she lost great part of her troops and returned covered with shame into her own country so many fabulous circumstances attend this expedition that we may well doubt the veracity of the historian and possibly of the very existence of the heroine what credit as the learned bryant justly observes can be given to the historians of a person the time of whose life cannot be settled within      years  long after this dubious expedition darius hystaspes darius hystaspes induced through the curiosity of ascertaining the place where the indus met the ocean built says herodotus in his melpomene sect xliv a large fleet at caspatyrus in the pactyan territories on the borders of scythia high up the river and gave the command of it to scylax a grecian of caryandra a most able sailor he was directed to be attentive to discoveries on both sides and when he reached the mouth to sail westward and that way to return home he executed his commission passed the streights of babel mandel and in thirty months from the time he sailed from caspatyrus landed safely in egypt at the place from whence it is said that necho sent his phoenicians to circumnavigate africa by its now well known promontory the cape of good hope this expedition took place in the twelfth year of darius and in the year  0  before the christian era  review of the indus i shall now give a short topographical review of the celebrated river from the ocean to its most remote part and also of the rivers which swell its stream that which receives this mighty river is the mare erythroeum or modern arabian sea i have given some account of the delta let me add that it is delta of the indus as it was in the time of the ancients unhealthy and hot to the extreme all its fertility cannot compensate those inconveniences there is a greater and lesser delta the greater begins a few leagues from hydrabad the branch called nala sunkra forms the eastern side the lesser is included in the former and its northern point is at aurungabander the delta is of great extent each side being a hundred and fifteen miles from the sea as high as moultan is a low and level country enriched with the water annually overflowing like the river nile the indus from the beginning of the delta almost as high as moultan runs through a flat tract bounded by a parallel range of mountains distant from the banks of the river from thirty to forty miles that on the western side is rocky that on the eastern composed of sand the last when it approaches the delta conforms to its shape on the eastern side and diverges till it reaches the sea  beyond the eastern chain is a vast sandy desert sandy desert of registan extending the whole way above a hundred miles in breadth and in length reaches from near lat    n almost as high as the fertile panjab or lat     0 this is the part of which herodotus  thalia c cii speaks when he says that the eastern part of india is rendered desert by sands the caggar through it runs the river caggar but the lower part with uncertain course lost in the sands of the desert and render the place of its discharge at this time very uncertain it slows

braminabad once the capital of the circar of tattah at a small distance from tatta its name was taken from its having been sanctified by the chief residence of the brahmins or perhaps where there might have been peculiar worship paid to the god brama it had been the ancient capital of the country and its fort was of vast extent being said to have had fourteen hundred bastions at the time of composing the ayeen akberry were considerable vestiges of this fortification it is mentioned in vol ii p      at tatta we once had a factory tatta perhaps may have to this day notwithstanding the excessive unwholesomeness of the place there are seasons in which it does not rain during three years hamiltons voy i      the heats are so violent owing to the vicinity of the sandy deserts that the

preserved in this country the sircar of tatta respecting the disorder the real cause says bontius p  0 engl edit arises from intemperance an imposthume is often formed in that part and on opening it after death it is often found eaten or honeycombed the side is not unfrequently laid open to get at the part infected the impostume is cut and the liver cleansed i have heard from the credulous strange stories on this head the indians of the sircar firmly believe that the disease is inflicted by a set of sorcerers called jiggerkhars or liver eaters jiggerkhars one of this class says the ayeen akberry ii p     can steal away the liver of another by looks and incantations other accounts say that by looking at a person he deprives him of his senses and then steals from him something resembling the seed of a pomegranate and which he hides in the calf of his leg  the jiggerkhar throws on the fire the grain before described which thereupon spreads to the size of a dish and he distributes it amongst his fellows to be eaten which ceremony concludes the life of the fascinated person a jiggerkhar is able to communicate his art to another and which he does by learning him the incantations and by making him eat a bit of the liver cake if any one cut open the calf of the magicians leg extract the grain and give it to the afflicted person to eat he immediately recovers these jiggerkhars are mostly women it is said moreover that they can bring intelligence from a great distance in a short space of time and if they are thrown into a river with a stone tied to them they nevertheless will not sink in order to deprive any one of this wicked power they brand his temples and every joint in his body cram his eyes with salt suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous cavern and repeat over him certain incantations in this state he is called detcherch although after having undergone this discipline he is not able to destroy the liver of any one yet he retains the power of being able to discover another jiggerkhar and is used for detecting those disturbers of mankind they can also cure many diseases by administering a potion or by repeating an incantation many

kouli khan a conqueror equally barbarous the trade of the place has received a considerable check thevenot adds another reason that in his time about the year      the river was choked up which obstructed greatly all commerce from lahore and other places to the northeast  this city is the great residence of the banians banians or merchants and brokers of india they are of this country and have here their chieftain they are of the great commercial cast of the bhyse created say the hindoos by their brimhas or supreme being from his thighs and belly but i shall say more of the casts hereafter these form settlements in all the commercial towns in india they also send colonies for a certain number of years to the trading towns of arabia and persia and we find them even as far as astrakan in the beginning of the present century about a hundred and fifty or two hundred of this community went from moultan to that city and carry on a great trade in precious stones they live in a large stone caravansery as they die away or incline to return home a supply is sent from india by their chief selected from among their young unmarried relations as they have no females from their own country they keep during their residence at astrakan tartarian women but the contract is only during that time they are a sine race of men and are highly esteemed for the integrity of their dealings communicated to me by dr pallas these support the most important trade of astrakan by carrying it through astrabad to the inland parts of the mogul empire this points out a more southern inland road than was known in the middle ages when the merchants went by the way of bochara and samarcand to the northern cities of india candahar and cabul  at the distance of about sixty miles from its mouth the chenauh divides into two branches which flow from the northwest from their origin at the foot of the himmaleh chain the most southern is the rauvee the old hydraotes the rauvee about twentyfour miles from its mouth on the southern side stand the fort and town of toulamba they lay in the route of tamerlane toulamba and were plundered and the inhabitants enslaved by that monster of cruelty justly called in india the destroying prince he excelled even his brother hero alexander in the slaughter of mankind tamerlane in his march into india had collected above a hundred thousand prisoners these happened to show some symptoms of joy at a repulse the tyrant had received before the citadel of delhi he instantly ordered all above fifteen years of age to be massacred in cold blood the sum was a hundred thousand  the city of lahore is next lahore about a hundred and fifty miles distant from moultan it is the capital of the seiks a people which started up in the fifteenth century under a hindoo of the name of nanuck born in    0 they are a set of religionists tolerant in matters of faith like the hindoos but unlike them the seiks admit proselytes they require a conformity in certain signs and ceremonies but in other respects are pure monotheists they worship god alone without image or intermediation they may be called the reformers of india they retain also a calvinistical principle and take an oath ever to oppose a monarchical government they eat any kind of meat excepting beef for like the hindoos they hold the ox in the utmost veneration their general food is pork probably because it is forbidden by the mahometans whom they hold in abhorrence their army consists wholly of horse they can raise a hundred thousand cavalry and make war in the most savage mode they kept long concealed or unnoticed at length became formidable by their courage and enterprise and extended their conquests over lahore moultan and the western parts of delhi  lahore is a city of great antiquity and was the residence of the first mohammedan conquerors in india before they were established in the central parts in  0   in the reign of mahmood it was closely besieged by the confederated hindoos who were compelled to retire on a vigorous sally made by the garrison it is also a soubaliship of considerable extent humaioon father of akbar kept his court here part of his days its length suburbs included was at that period three leagues it had a magnificent palace and several other fine buildings built of brick possibly its trade is declined since the obstruction of the bed of the river by the banks of sand or gravel here begins the famous avenue which extended five hundred miles even to agra it consists according to thevenot part iii p    of what he calls achy trees it was planted in      by jehangir he also erected an obelisk at the end of every cose and at the end of every third cose was sunk a well for the refreshment of travelers  the pestilence first appeared in the panjab in      pestilence spread to lahore and then broke out in the duab and dehli it never before was known in hindoostan if the memoirs of jehangir are to be depended on but mr gibbon iv     assures us that the dreadful plague which depopulated the earth in the time of justinian and his successors extended even to the indies the people whom it raged among at this time according to procopius bell pers lib ii cap    were the barbari or inhabitants of the neighborhood of the emporium barbaricum in the delta of the indus d anville antiq geogr de l inde p     0  doctor mead in his elegant treatise de peste p    relates that india was visited with a pestilence in      whether it was the same with that which from the earliest times took its origin between the serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the nile or whether it might not have been the dysentery or bloody flux is uncertain bontius bontius lib iii obs   has discussed the point and given his opinion that it is the latter which at times carries off numbers equal to the plague itself certainly there have been many instances of some dreadful disease carrying its terrors through hindoostan but distinction must be made between the wide wasting pestilence described by procopius and the local disease the consequence of famine such for example as that which has raged in the northern circars within these very few years  the province of lahore is celebrated for its fine breed of horses fine horets the mogul emperors used to establish studs in different parts and furnish them with their lamed stallions of the persian and arabian kind for the farther improvement it was the north of india which supplied them with the best cavalry i wish the reader to consult abulfazel i         relative to the magnificent establishment of the domestic stables and the economy of the military cavalry in the time of his great master  abulfazel ii     speaking of the rivers of this country says metals that the natives by washing the sands obtain gold silver copper rowey tin brass and lead rowey is unknown to me brass is factitious i am doubtful as to some of these metals being found in india farther enquiry may ascertain the metallic productions of india in the course of this volume  a vast mountain of rock salt is found in this province rock salt equal to that of cardonna and like the salt of that mountain is cut into dishes plates and stands for lamps ice is an article of commerce from the northern mountains and sold at lahore throughout the year  the famous canal of shah nehr begins at ragipour and is continued almost parallel to the rauvee and ends at lahore a distance of above eighty miles the intent of this canal seems to have been to supply lahore with water in the dry season when all the indian rivers are from twenty to thirty feet below the level of their banks three other canals for the purpose of watering the country on the south and east of lahore were drawn from the same place these formed in a distant age are strong proofs of attention to rural economy and the benefit of the subject  the chunaub chunaub upper for a few miles is continued from its forks in a single channel near zusserabad the jhylum or behut falls into it with vast rapidity and violence this was the place where alexander so nearly lost his fleet in the passage through this turbulent conflux the chunaub flows in a strait channel from the foot of the himmaleb or imaus and there originates from two streams which quickly reunite gujerat and jummoo and mundal are town and forts on its banks from the origin of the chunaub to that of the rauvee is a plain tract bounded to the east by mount imaus bounded on the west and south by the chain of the panjah hills there is another plain similar from the upper part of the setlege as far as the ganges where it flows through the province of sirinagur  i now ascend from its union with the chunaub the behut the behut the most celebrated of the five rivers the fabulosus hydaspes which flows in two magnificent meanders and issuing from a narrow gap between exalted mountains from its origin in the romantic cashmere partly along a plain partly at the foot of mountains clothed with forests of trees of size magnificent many of which are perishing continually through weight of years and others succeeding them in the full verdure and vigor of youth would my pen could be inspired like that of m bernier who in      attended in quality of a physician and philosophic friend to a great omrah of that time a follower of aurengezebe in his splendid progress to cashmere for the recovery of his health by a change of the burning clime of hindoostan for the salubrious air of the former i leave to the reader the perusal of bernier the first traveller i may say of his or any other age i shall in a very abridged form take up the account from the departure of the court from agra his suite was an army he was also attended by his sister which gave splendour unspeakable to the train of ladies he left agra in the moment pronounced fortunate by the imperial astrologers to this day nothing is done without their auspices he took the road to lahore hunting or hawking on each side as occasion offered among the nobler game a lion presented itself in crossing the rivers bridges of boats were used for the purpose the heats on the march were dreadful caused by the lofty mountains of cashmere keeping the cool air of the north from refreshing the parched plains between the chenaub and the behut is the vast mountain bember mountain bember it seems like a purgatory to be passed before the entrance into the paradise of hindoostan can be accomplished it is steep black and burned the procession encamped in the channel of a large torrent dried up full of sand and stones burning hot after passing the bember says the elegant traveller we pass from a torrid to a temperate zone for we had no sooner mounted this dreadful wall of the world i mean this high steep black and bald mountain of bember but that in descending on the other side we found an air that was pretty tolerable fresh gentle and temperate but that which surprised me more in these mountains was to find myself in a trice transported out of the indies into europe for seeing the earth covered with all our plants and shrubbs except issop thyme marjoram european trees and rosemary i imagined i was in some of our mountains of auvergne in the midst of a forest of all our kinds of trees pines oaks elms planetrees and i was the more astonished because in all those burning fields of indostan whence i came i had seen almost nothing of all that  among other things relating to plants this surprised me that one and a half days journey from bember i found a mountain that was covered with them on both sides but with this difference that on the side of the mountain that was southerly toward the indies indian there was a mixture of indian and european plants and on that which was exposed to the north i observed none but european ones as if the former had participated of the air and temper of europe and the indies and the other had been merely european  i now enter the kingdom of cashmere kingdom of cashmere and immediately resume the words of the elegant traveller thousands of cascades descend from the surrounding mountains of this enchanting plain and forming rivulets meandring through all parts render it so fair and fruitful that one would take this whole kingdom for some great evergreen garden intermixed with villages and buroughs discovering themselves between trees and diversisied by meadows fields of rice corn and diverse other legumes of hemp and saffron all interlaced with ditches full of water with channels with small lakes and rivulets here and there up and down and every where are also seen some of our european plants flowers and all sorts of our trees as apples pears prunes apricots cherries nuts vines the particular gardens are full of melons skirrets beets radishes all sorts of our pot herbs and of some we have not  this happy valley this paradise of hindoostan once a lake of the indian poets is of an oval form about eighty miles long and forty broad and was once supposed to have been entirely filled with water which having burst its mound left this vale enriched to the most distant ages by the sertilizing mud of the rivers which fed its expanse this delicious spot is surrounded by mountains of vast height and rude aspect covered with snow or enchased in glacieres in which this enchanting jewel is firmly set at the foot of the exterior chain is an interior circle of hills fertile in grass abundant in trees and various sorts of vegetation and full of all kinds of cattle as cows sheep goats gazelles and musks the approach to cashmere is also very rugged and difficult we have mentioned the mountains of bember besides those is one on which the pioneers of aurengezebe were obliged to cut through a glaciere or a great mass as bernier calls it of icy snow p  0    the capital of this happy spot is sometimes called cashmere sometimes sirinagur and sometimes nagaz by cheresiddin in his life of timur be ii     is seated in lat       north on the banks of the river which runs with a current most remarkably smooth at a little distance from it is a small but beautiful lake with a communication with the river by a navigable canal the town was in berniers time three quarters of a french league long built on both sides and some part extended to the lake villas mosques and pagodas decorate several of the little hills that border the water the houses are built of wood four stories high some higher the lower is for the cattle the next for the family the third and fourth serve as warehouses the roofs are planted with tulips which in the spring produce a wonderful effect roses and numberless other flowers ornament this happy clime the inhabitants often visit the lake in their boats for the pleasure of hawking the country abounding with cranes and variety of game  the river river behut or ihlum which rises at wair naig near the southern part of the surrounding mountains flows with a northwestern course by the capital and falls into lake ouller which is fiftythree miles in length and lies in the northern part of the valley not remote from the kingdom of great thibet then passes through the outlet at barehmooleh between two steep mountains and from thence after a long course to its junction with the chunaub this river is large and navigable even within the limits of cashmere bernier p    says it carries boats as large as those on the seine at paris many small lakes are spread over the surface and some of them contain floating islands among others bernier p     visited one which he calls a great lake amidst the mountains which had ice in summer and looked like a little icy sea having heaps of ice made and unmade by the winds this reminds me of the coalition and separation of the ice in the spitzbergen seas this in question may be like the ouller for i see none of any size in the maps excepting that expanse of water  among the miraculous waters of the natives he reckons a periodical spring or the ebbing and flowing well of sandbrarc which has near to it the temple of the idol of brare the reader may amuse himself with the account from p  0  to   0 of this favorite writer and at p     those of another much of the same nature  the author of the ayeen akberry dwells with rapture on the beauties of cashmere whence we may conclude that it was a favorite subject with his master acbar who had visited it three times before abulfazel wrote other emperors of hindoostan visited it also and seemed to forget the cares of government during their residence in the happy valley by the salubrity of the air and the chearing beauties of the place they collected new vigor to resume the cares of government the remains of the palaces pavilion and gardens exhibit proofs of their elegance and splendour it appears that the periodical rains which almost deluge the rest of india are shut out of cashmere by the height of the mountains so that only light showers fall there these however are in abundance sufficient to feed the thousands of cascades which are precipitated into the valley from every part of the stupendous and romantic bulwark that encircles it amidst the various felicities of the cashmerians one dreadful evil they are constantly subject to namely earthquakes but to guard against their terrible effects all their houses are built of wood of which there is no want  the cashmerians are esteemed a most witty race and much more intelligent and ingenious than the hindoos and as much addicted to the sciences and to poetry as the very persians they have a language of their own but their books are written in the shanscrit tongue although the character be sometimes cashmerian ayeen akberry ii      they are also very industrious and excellent mechanics the various articles of their workmanship are sent into all parts of india bernier p     this race is famous for the fineness of their features and their admirable complexions they look like europeans and have nothing of the tartarian flatnosed face and small eyes like those of caschguer and their neighbors of thibet it is certainly quite right that this paradise the region of eternal spring should be peopled with females angelic they are uncommonly beautiful the courtiers of the time of bernier were most solicitous to obtain for their zenanas the cashmerian fair in order that they might have children whiter than the natives of hindoostan in order that they might pass for the true mogulbreed congenerous with their monarch  the religion of the cashmerians is the same as that of the hindoos possibly the pardonable superstition of the inhabitants warmed by their romantic situation may have multiplied the places of worship of mahadeo of beschan and of brama here is a sect of religionists free from idolatry which worship the deity alone they are remarkably benevolent and abstain from the other sex they must therefore be continued by disciples as to the mahometans they are not numerous and those split into sects ayeen ii       the cashmerians seem to have had an idea of the deluge for say they in the early ages of the world all cashmere except the mountains was covered with water one kushup brought the brahmins to inhabit the country as soon as the waters had subsided same          neither were they ignorant of the history of noah for the indians speak of him under the name of sattiaviraden who with his wife was by the god vichenou who sent to them an ark preserved from destruction in a general deluge sonnerat vol ii      the first monarch of the country was owgnund who was elected says abulfazul      years before his time ayeen       here are numbers of hermits in places nearly inaccessible they are highly venerated some being supposed to have power to excite the fury of the elements bernier p  0  found an ancient anchoute who had inhabited the summit of the lofty mountain pirepenjale ever since the time of jehangire who was here in      his religion was unknown to him was attributed the power of working miracles he caused at his pleasure great thunders and raised storms of hail rain snow and wind he looked savage having a large white beard uncombed which like that of our druid streamed like a meteor to the troubled air the sage forbid the making the lest noise on pain of raising furious storms and tempests  cashmere is famous for its manufacture of shawls shawls made of the wool of the broadtailed sheep who are found in the kingdom of thibet and their fleeces in fineness beauty and length says mr bogle in ph trans lxviii     exceed all others in the world the cashmerians engross this article and have factors in all parts of thibet for buying up the wool which is sent into cashmere and worked into shawls superior in elegance to those woven even from the fleeces of their own country this manufacture is a considerable source of wealth bernier relates that in his days shawls made expressly for the great omrahs of the thibetian wool cost a hundred and fifty roupees whereas those made of the wool of the country never cost more than fifty  akbar was a most particular encourager of the manufacture he not only paid a great attention to those of this province but introduced them into lahore where in his days there were a thousand manufactories says abulfazul of this commodity the natural color of the wool of the tools assel the name of the animal is gray tinged with red but some are quite white akbar first introduced the dying them the wool of another animal used in the manufacture is white or black out out of which were woven white black and gray shawls possibly two sorts of animals may produce the material one indisputably the sheep i mention the other i have heard called a goat  the domestic animals of this country are horses small hardy and surefooted cows black and ugly but yield plenty of milk and excellent butter here is also a sheep called hundoo which is used to carry burdens no description is left to vindicate me for imagining it to be either the camel llama hist quad i no    or the chilihucque no    the first of which is used for burdens in peru the last formerly in chili certain it is that india has a tall sheep which saddled actually can carry a boy twelve years old it is found about surat whether it could bear the snows of the cashmerian alps i leave for the subject of future inquiry  abulfazul p     vol ii mentions the elk as one of the wild animals of the country and adds that the hunting leopards are made use of in the chase of that enormous deer the chittah or hunting leopard must be brought from the scorched plains of bengal the elk may be a native of the woods at the base of the snowy mountains for they are impatient of heat and require forests for they subsist both by browzing and by grazing  cashmere says its historians princes had its own princes four thousand years before its conquest by akbar in      humaioon cast a longing eye on this rich gem but by different accidents the acquisition was reserved for his son akbar would have sound dissiculty to reduce this paradise of the indies situated as it is within such a fortress of mountains but its monarch yusof khan was basely betrayed by his omrahs akbar used his conquest with moderation and allowed a pension to the conquered khan and his gallant son from that time this happy valley enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity  that devouring prince tamerlane there as tamerlane was called by the hindoos encamped at a place called gebban on the frontiers of cashmere during his stay in that delicious country he seems to have forgot his cruelty and left without doing any injury to the innocent inhabitants cheresiddins life of timurbee eng trans ii p        this fair gem is at present possessed by timur shah successor to ahmed abdalla late king of candahar  marco polo marco polo there in his travels over the east between the years      and      visited cashmere which he calls chesimur he agrees in several respects with the account given by abulfazul and bernier mentions that the inhabitants have a language of their own that they are idolaters that they are very superstitious and describes their hermits and the powers they had of raising tempests and darkening the very air voiages de mare polo in bergerons collections p  0   i rejoin the indus at the mouth of the chenaub indus continued a little higher on the west side it receives the lucca an obscure river which flows from the northwest rising in the kingdom of candahar it is the only one which falls into the indus in all the extent of the western side above that on the same side is the cow or cophenes which leads to ghizni and to bamia at the foot of the paropamysan caucasus beyond that we pass the mouth of the kameh or guraeus which flows from cabul the principal places in the vicinity of these rivers have already been noticed  i now return to attock mr forsters journey where the river assumes the name of that city till it reaches the conflux of the chenaub below moultan attock signifies the forbidden it having been the original boundary of hindoostan on this side which the hindoos were prohibited from passing here the river is three quarters of a mile broad the water very cold rapid and turbulent and a great deal of black sand suspended in it a little above attock is bazaar where mr forster crossed the indus the extraordinary journey of that gentleman merits notice in the disguise of an asiatic he left calcutta in      crossed the ganges between loldong and hurdwar and the jumna near meiro proceeded on the south side of the mountains to jummoo and then seems to have made a tour of curiosity to cashmere from thence turned toward the southwest to bazaar went northward to cabul where he found the bills of calicut seventeen or eighteen hundred miles distant negociable from thence went to candahar and crossed the modern provinces of seisten korasan and mazanderan to the shore of the caspian sea took shipping at basrush reached the volga and arrived safe at petersburg from oude the last british station to the caspian sea was twentyseven hundred miles his security lay in his concealment of his country he traveled with asiatics he was obliged to conform to their manners to content himself with the cookery of every place he passed through submit to every accommodation and generally to sleep in the open air even in rain and snow and this he endured in a journey of a whole year he returned to india and ended of late years at the court of the nizam in a public capacity his active and most enterprizing life  after reaching bazaar we are very little acquainted with the course of the indus mr rennel informs us that the highest point to which this river can be traced is shuckur two hundred and thirty miles distant from attock and from attock to the sea is six hundred and sorty by the excellent map of the world published by mr arrowsmith it appears to pass through a long and narrow gap between two chains of mountains and to terminate at its origin in the middle of cashgar what that distance is from shuckur i cannot with certainty pronounce perhaps a hundred miles adding this to the two other numbers we may fairly call the whole length a thousand miles  mr rennel says that it has an uninterrupted navigation from the sea for flatbottomed vessels of near two hundred tons as high as moultan and lahore the last about six hundred and fifty miles distant the current of the indus must be rapid for captain hamilton i p     informs us that the vessels frequently fall down the river from lahore to tatta in twelve days but the passage up the stream requires six or seven weeks it once had a vast trade carried on along its channel but by reason of troubles and consequential bad government it is greatly reduced  i now return to the ocean the eastern branch of the indus falls into the bay of cutch which runs far inland and receives the river puddar bounded by the rugged country of cutch part of the gulf is infested with piratical tribes called sangarians who infest the sea from hence to the entrance of the gulf of persia m danville eclaircissements p    as quoted by mr rennel  see memoir p     supposes them to have been the same as the people of sangada arrian rerum indic i p     which the historian places near the river arabius this may have been the case on supposing which might have been probable that they had removed from the western to the eastern side of the indus and from thence to the shores of the gulf of cutch the banks of the river are possessed by reguli most of its sides are low fenny and liable to annual inundations this gulf was the ancient canthicolpus and sinus irinus arrian ii     also calls it barices sinus and mentions its having a group of seven isles which appear in modern charts  the puddar falls into the gulf of cutch the puddar and has a course to the northeast as far as near lat    soon after which it divides into two streams which originate in the country of the rathore raipoots inclining to the south this river is not bordered by any places remarkable in the middle ages the famed emporium nehrwaleh stood on the banks of the surutwutty a small river which flows into it from the south in lat       e long     0 it stood on the site of puttan and flourished in the middle ages it was reckoned the most fertile

cruelties notwithstanding they have been held up to us as models of greatness among those of the north are basilovitz ii and peter the great and in hindoostan the favorite akbar and others successors or predecessors their enormities are the result of education indulged first in every infantpassion then in those of youth till they become ungovernable and every opposition to their will appears criminal and brings on the most dreadful revenge and the frequent havoke of the human race compare then the manners of the princes of this country with those of the myriads of the meanest of the hindoo subjects education has produced monsters of the former climate has softened into gentleness resignation and the fullest submission in the minds of the latter to every evil to famine sickness

hospital for birds says he p    after we had dined and rested a while we caused ourselves to be conducted to see a famous hospital of birds of all forts which for being sick lame deprived of their mates or otherwise needing food and cure are kept and tended there with diligence as also the men who take care of them are maintained by the public alms the indian gentiles who with pythagoras and the ancient egyptians the first authors of this opinion according to herodotus believe the transinigration of fouls not only from man to man but also from man to brute beast conceiving it no less a work of charity to do good to beasts than to men the house of this hospital is small a little room sufficing for many birds yet i saw it full of birds of all sorts which need tendance as cocks hens pigeons peacocks ducks and small birds which during their being lame or sick or mateless are kept here but being recovered and in good plight if they be wild they are let go at liberty if domestic they are given to some pious person who keeps them in his house the most curious thing i saw in this place was certain little mice who being found orphans without fire or dam to tend them were put into this hospital and a venerable old man with a white beard keeping them in a box amongst cotton very diligently tended them with his spectacles on his nose giving them milk to eat with a birds feather because they were so little that as yet they could eat nothing else and as he told us he intended when they were grown up to let them go free whither they pleased  the next morning p    adds he for goats etc we saw another hospital of goats kids sheep and wethers either sick or lame and there were also some cocks peacocks and other animals needing the same help and kept altogether quietly enough in a great court nor wanted there men and women lodged in little rooms of the same hospital who had care of them in another place far from hence we saw another hospital of cows and calves some whereof had broken legs others more infirm very old or lean and therefore were kept here to be cured among the beasts there was also a mohammedan thief who having been taken in theft had both his hands cut off but the compassionate gentiles that he might not perish miserably now he was no longer able to get his living took him into this place and kept him among the poor beasts not suffering him to want any thing moreover without one of the gates of the city we saw another great troop of cows calves and goats which being cured and brought into better plight or gathered together from being dispersed and without masters or being redeemed with money from the mahometans who would have killed them to eat namely the goats and other animals but not the cows and calves were sent into the field to feed by neatherds purposely maintained at the public charge and thus they are kept till being reduced to perfect health it is found fitting to give them to some citizens or others who may charitably keep them i excepted cows and calves from the animals redeemed from slaughter because in cambaia cows calves and oxen are not killed by any and there is a great prohibition against it by the instance of the gentiles who upon this account pay a great sum of money to the prince and should any either mohammedan or other be found to kill them he would be punished severely even with death

of ships of war that were ruined in those seas during the late war      to      may be admitted as a proof of the former remark and the great age of the ships built in india may serve to prove the latter what i mean to infer from this for your lordships use is that ships of war under third rates may be constructed in india and with moderate repairs last for ages whereas a ship of european construction can remain there but a very few years to which disadvantage may be added that of losing in the mean time the services of the ships that are sent to relieve the worn out ones  the britannia of seven hundred tons which was built of teek made several voyages to europe  the teek is an evergreen and esteemed a sacred tree the gentoos repair or build their pagodas with this timber only when other materials are not used a prince of calicolan v poon or mast tree built one entirely out of a single tree a purple color is obtained from the tender leaves useful in dying silk and cotton which are also medicinal a syrup extracted from them mixed with sugar cures the aphthee the flowers mixed with honey are prescribed in dropsies  the poon tree uvaria altissima of koenig poon or mast tree serves for the masts its chief excellence is its straightness and its lightness it is tolerably strong but unless great care is taken to keep the ends dry it is apt to rot it grows to the height of sixty feet my good old friend doctor patrick russel see a full account of this great botanist in the preface to the plants of coromandel by dr patrick russel showed me a branch of this species and told me it was called in india the mast tree m sonnerat ii p     tab     gives a figure of it under the name of larbre de mature  surat for a long time was open to every attack nor was the fortification attended to till after it was taken and plundered in      by the famous sevatjee sevatjee founder of the english and dutch stood on the defensive and were left unmolested the governor deserted the place and retired into the castle besides that it had no other protection than a mud wall after the retreat of the freebooters the citizens requested of aurengzebe that he would seoure them with a wall accordingly one was built taking in a space of four miles in circuit it was of brick eight yards high with round bastions and on each were five or six cannons  europeans are surprised to hear of the extent of an indian city but they must be told that besides their towns being very populous every house consists but of one floor which makes them occupy more ground besides that every house is attended with a great garden a requisite as most of the food of the indians is vegetable  sevatjee was founder of the mahratta kingdom we so often hear mentioned the mahrattas the name is derived from mahrat the province in which he first established his independency this hero derived his lineage from the rajahs of chietore who pretend that their descent is from porus he took advantage of the troubles which arose in his time in the kingdom of visiapour and again during the wars between aurengzebe and his brothers he extended his conquests from baglana near surat to the portuguese districts near goa a little beyond the foot of the ghauts his capital was poonah an open town but he kept his archives at poorundar a place of vast strength a fortress on the summit of a mountain he died in    0 his successors extended their conquests or rather their inroads all over hindoostan and even compelled the great mogul to pay them a chout or tribute to save his subjects from future calamities  from time to time they extended their dominions to a vast magnitude their government and divided them into two empires that of poonah or the western and berar or the eastern the first is divided again among a number of chieftains who pay just as much obedience as they like to a paishwah or head whom mr rennel justly compares to the emperor of germany and the chieftains to the princes of that great body they often quarrel with him and often among themselves and never are united but by the apprehension of a common danger their empires extend from guzerat to near the banks of the ganges and southerly to the northern borders of the dominions of tippoo sultan their forces consist of two hundred thousand foot and horse and the same number in garrison rennel cxxviii  in their inroads they come in clouds and spread desolation far and wide  a new empire is springing out of these people madajee sindia a jaghiredar of the mahratta states of poonah or mere landholder is now successfully conquering for himself since the year      he has extended his frontiers from malwa toward the jumna possessed himself of the strong fortress of guallior and even gives a pension to the unhappy mogul shah alum who fled to him for protection after having his eyes put out by a savage rohilla chieftain on whom sindia revenged the cruelty by putting him to a most excruciating death such is the sunk state of the representative of the mighty emperors of hindoostan sindia resides at ougein in lat       a little north of the nerbudda river  about the year    0 ram rajah a weak prince succeeded to the throne of the mahratta empire same lxxxii iv  his two ministers agreed to divide his kingdom after which it became separated into two in the manner we have described same lxxxii iv  the same species of war was continued and for a long time they carried their plundering excursions to a great distance at one time they sent forth two armies of horsemen consisting of eighty thousand each same lxxxv  they poured like a deluge in      over the low countries west of the ganges and exercised their gothic rage against every thing animate and inanimate the most elegant works of art fell before their brutal fury the english were often involved in war with them in      peace was concluded at the expense of all the conquests made by goddard we retained only the isle of salsette and a few isles within the gulf of bombay  the marches of these barbarians are admirably described by the author of the memoirs of the late war in asia p     vol i it relates to the armies of ayder alli but applies equally to the military of all the powerful chieftains of india it may says the ingenious writer perhaps afford some measure of gratification to european curiosity to be informed that the undisciplined troops of asia generally inflamed with bang and other intoxicating drugs pour forth as they advance a torrent of menacing and abusive language on their adversaries every expression of contempt and aversion every threat fitted to make an impression of terror or to excite ideas of horror that custom readily presents or inventive fancy can suggest accompanies the utmost ferocity of looks voice and gesture a murmuring sound with clouds of dust announce their approach while they are yet at the distance of several miles as they advance their accents are more and more distinctly heard until at last with their eyes fixed and weapons pointed at some individual they devote him with many execrations to destruction giving his flesh like the heroes in homer and the philistine warriors to the dogs and the birds of the air and the beasts of the field the numbers of the asiatic armies the ferocity of their manner and the novelty of their appearance would unnerve and overcome the hearts of the small european bodies that are opposed to them in the field of battle if experience had not sufficiently proved how much the silence of discipline excels barbarian noise and uniformity of design and action the desultory efforts of brutal force acting by starts and liable to the contagion of accidental impression  the land from the mouth of the river of surat cape st john makes a slight curvature as far as cape st john or the baryagazenum promontorium from this cape as far as bombay according to our east india pilot the coast is skirted with islands divided from the continent and from each other by very narrow channels to the north of it is damoon a strong place possessed damoon in the last century by the portuguese but now in a most ruinous state it was once besieged by aurengzebe who had determined to take it by storm and fixed on a sunday for the attack thinking that the christians like the jews would on that day make no resistance the governor an old soldier caused mass to be said at midnight then made a sally with all his cavalry and a strong body of infantry into a quarter guarded by two hundred elephants he knew the dread those animals had of fire he assailed them with fireworks the distracted beasts in the darkness of the night and without their governors rushed on their own forces which put the army into such disorder that before morning half was cut to pieces by the portuguese and in consequence the siege raised  the tract that borders on the sea concan from bombay even as far as soonda in lat    is called concan this was the lymirica of arrian ii     a coast full of ports of which he enumerates several it once formed part of the kingdom of visiapour at the partition teaty it was confirmed to the mahrattas who now possess a line of coast of three hundred miles in extent out of which the english possess bombay and its adjacent isles and the strong hold of victoria and the portuguese goa and the ancient domain belonging to that once famous emporium the part of the concan next to the sea is low but at a small distance inland rises into vast strength it is guarded by the celebrated mountains the ghauts which rise to a surprising height and oppose to the west a mural front with ghauts the ghauts i e passes they are the same which the welsh call a bwlch from the word ghaut the whole chain derives its name they give entrance into the lofty fertile and populous plains of boundless view which they support in the manner as buttresses do a terrace formed on an immense scale these run not remote from the sea from surat to cape comorin at some places seventy miles distant but generally forty and in one place they advance to within six they have lesser hills at their bases clothed with forests particularly of the valuable teek the plains are blessed from their situation with a cool and healthy air from the sides of the mountains precipitate magnificent cataracts forming torrents the means of facilitating the conveyance of the timber and giving a thousand picturesque scenes amidst the forests  the ghauts are distinguished into the western and the eastern eastern etc the first extend as i have described uninterruptedly from surat to the pass of palicaudchery when near coimbetore they suddenly turn deeply undulating to the north then at the pass of gujethetty wind north and northeasterly as high as amboor and mugglee the last about eighty miles due west of madras from hence they are not by reason of the numbers of branches sufficiently marked on the maps they seem to take a northerly course to comprehend aurungabad to cross the taptee and continue westerly at irregular distances from the river till they arrive at a certain space from surat  the whole chain especially in the concan seems a connected wall inaccessible to the summit unless by paths worked by the hand of man and is not to be ascended even by a single traveller without the fatiguing labor of many hours horrible precipices roaring cataracts and frequent reverberating echoes terrify the passenger on each side often violent gusts arise and hurry men and cattle into the black immeasurable abyss having attained the summit the trouble is repaid by the magnificent prospect to the west of the far subjacent country broken into hills and clothed with beautiful vegetation the coast the islands and the immensity of ocean  these indian appenines mark with precision the limits of the winter and summer seasons or rather the wet and dry seasons in india they extend thirteen degrees of latitude from surat to cape comorin they arrest the great body of clouds in their passage and according to the monsoons or periodical winds from the northeast or southwest give alternately a dry season to one side and a wet one to the other some clouds do pass over and give a rainy season but at a very considerable distance to the leeward being too high and too light to condense and fall in rain within a small distance of this great range  in lat       is a very considerable bay filled with islands bay of bombay well known by the name of bombay which forms the best and most secure harbor in india this as well as every part of this coast was the usurped property of the portuguese but the greatest part of this extremity was wrested from them by the mahrattas a few places they retained for some time but at length all fell under the power of the new usurpers among the places was bassein bassein which had been taken by nugns dacugna viceroy of india in      and by him strongly fortified it was in our days seized by the mahrattas and again in    0 by the english under general goddard who restored it to its late masters by the treaty of       doctor friar who visited this city about the year    0 when it was in possession of the portuguese speaks of it as a very considerable place having six churches four convents a college of jesuits and another of franciscans  about twenty miles from bassein visrabuy inland is visrabuy famous for its hot wells which are in high esteem for their medicinal virtues and accounted by the hindoos of great sanctity  the principal isle is that of salsette isle of salsette which is divided from the continent by a very narrow channel it is about fifteen miles in circumference and rich in fruits and vegetables general goddard included this island in his other conquests it was wisely retained on the conclusion of the peace and confirmed to us by the last peace together with some little isles or rocks that lay within the important bay salsette was gallantly defended by an old man of ninetytwo who being summoned to surrender answered he was not sent for that purpose it was not till he was slain in a bloody assault that the place was taken but at the price of four hundred of our grenadiers the capture gave fresh security and importance to the isle of bombay  that island was part of the portion given to charles ii island of bombay with his queen in      his majesty sent in      james ley earl of marlborough a most experienced sailor with a strong fleet to receive it from the portuguese this nobleman was killed soon after his return in the bloody sea fight against the dutch in      he was says clarendon a man of wonderful parts in all sorts of learning which he took more delight in than in his title lord clarendons life ii  0   andersons dict ii      charles in      granted the island to the east india company under a rent of ten pounds in gold payable annually at the customhouse at london  its length is about seven miles it is flat and at first was extremely unwholesome insomuch that two monsoons at bombay is the age of a man became here a proverb but by draining and by prohibiting the use of putrid fish for manuring the coco trees it is rendered tolerably healthy and is become the great port and ship yard of the english in india three hundred sail can at one time lie here in safety  on the isle is the town the docks and arsenal town docks etc seated in lat       n long     0 e strongly fortified and behind them the dungeree town for the natives when the portuguese ceded this place to us it had only ten thousand inhabitants by our mild government in      it increased to sixty thousand abbe raynal gives this island a hundred thousand inhabitants of which seven or eight thousand are sailors mr ives calls it the grand storehouse of all the arabian and persian commerce the arabs still keep up a considerable trade in ships of a thousand tons either indian built or old indiamen bought from the company one article is the kasmish raisin a species without stones brought from kasmish an isle in the persian gulf the exports from india are chiefly cottons etc to a great amount but the trade between these parts and the persian and arabian gulphs has of late been much injured by caravans crossing the isthmus of bassora conducted by the syrians themselves the whole bay is full of shoals or rocks yet with channels of sufficient depth of water for the skilful pilate to bring in securely the largest ships and here even our military fleets find conveniences for heaving down and refitting admiral watson and again admiral hughes found here every species of naval store here his majestys ships winter and refit  although bombay is a place of very great trade it is wholly as a magazine its native productions are nothing in the account shipbuilding unless you reckon shipbuilding there the finest merchant ships in the world are built and all of teek the durability of this timber is beyond belief greater than that of our best english oak it resists the worm longer than any other but whether this be owing to the nature of the timber itself or to the cement with which the plank is joined and covered i cannot tell surat or bombay built ships will certainly last threescore years some say many more in which time however they are generally doubled once or twice so that the sides of an old ship are as thick as the walls of an house much is likewise said of the number of years they sometimes run without having occasion to use a pump but of this i cannot speak with certainty all the repairs are effected by native carpenters and all the ships even the largest are built by them and in a simplicity of manner which would astonish an european workman m sonnerat i tab    represents the indian with all the powers of his art the neighboring mountains supply them with teekwood bengal with iron and hemp and the adjacent forests with pines for masts  bombay is also the great depot of artillery arms and ammunition and all the means of furnishing an army here is also a considerable military establishment at present under the command of sir robert abercromby k b president of bombay governor and commander in chief from hence marched the force destined to assist in the reduction of the tyrant tippoo sultan and to give peace to the southern part of this vast continent  a most unfortunate expedition took its departure from this place in      expeditions from bombay at which period it had not the happiness of being under the rule of a hastings a little time before roganaut row a mahratta chieftain fled from his country and put himself under the protection of this presidency he had been guardian to the young paishwa naron row his own nephew in the numbers of intrigues that infested the state of poonah a conspiracy was formed against the youth a band of assassins were employed to murder him roganaut better known by the name of ragobah was at the time confined in prison the nephew flew to seek safety in his arms in that case he would have been safe but he could only fling himself at his feet the youth was murdered the uncle exchanged his prison for the paishwaship fresh conspiracies arose and roganaut forced to fly to the english for protection account of bombay p        aspiring to the office he flattered the english with vast advantages in case they espoused his cause and soon prevaled on them to commence hostilities salsette baroach and other places fell before them the treaty of poorunder in      secured those places to us for a time in a little space war broke out again fomented by roganaut assisted by our fears of the french who were busy in their intrigues at the court of poonah in      a small army under egerton under the command of brigadier general egerton assisted by a field committee ever embarrassing from the days of the duke of marlborough to the present was sent with him to advise or rather to perplex the commanders the army which consisted of not quite four thousand men crossed the bay to uptah river marched by panwel campooly and up the bhore ghaut to candolah which we found unoccupied the object was poonah they reached the once fair city of tullingaum on january      it had been burnt the night before by the mahrattas themselves who appeared covering the plains numerous as the sands of the sea they made frequent attacks on our army and destroyed several gallant officers and numbers of our european soldiers and sepoys we made a quick retreat to the village of worgaum from thence our field committee sent a flag of truce and offer of treaty it was accepted on condition that we were to relinquish our past conquests of salsette and other places to give up roganaut and two of the field committee as hostages and to send orders to general goddard on full march with the bengal army to return instantly home goddard received the humiliating orders under goddard but rejected them with indignation and continued his route marked in every place with glory and victory see the history of this disgraceful business in a little  to pamphlet published at brecknock in      entitled the expedition of tullingaum etc and the war in asia i p p            in january      after the conquest of bassein that able officer assembled his troops at vizrabuy and in order to make a diversion in favor of madras then in imminent danger advanced to campooly and from thence to candolah which the enemy had possessed themselves of in great force but they soon were driven from their arduous station it should seem that tullingaum had been rebuilt since the last expedition for the general found it just burnt and poonah filled with combustibles ready for the same fate he found an army of seventy thousand horse and foot ready to oppose his little body of six thousand yet such was the terror of the foe that they again burnt the town of tullingaum an indian town is as soon rebuilt as destroyed and every preparation was made for burning poonah by filling the houses with straw and removing the inhabitants to the strong hold of sattarah thus circumstanced our general thought proper to retreat in order to assist with part of his forces his friends then besieged in tellicherry by sardar khan a general of ayder allis this movement was conducted with such secrecy and skill that the whole of the artillery and heavy stores reached the foot of the pass in safety and without the smallest interruption from the enemy who were astonished on the morning of the   th of april to find that our post at can dolah had been deserted during the preceding night ten thousand of the bravest undisciplined infantry in hindoostan followed him to the subjacent country they consisted of arabs and sindies who attempted to harass him in his march but in vain he repelled every attack with great slaughter his own loss consisted only of a few camp followers and common soldiers i observe at this time hurry punt afterward our friend in the campaigns in the mysore in      among the hostile commanders goddard returned with fresh laurels to bombay which even want of success could not sere  besides the two islands i have mentioned elephanta etc scattered over the found are several others such as caranja elephanta hog butcher and green island most of them very small but all of them rising in one part or other into a lofty hill  opposite to caranja stood the ancient calliana of arrian calliana ii     a famous and much frequented emporium it had been a common port to all nations till the romans made a conquest of egypt after which they prohibited every country from entering the red sea and monopolized all the trade of india every port on this coast was shut against foreigners and that of calliana is particularized by arrian the remains of that city were observed by doctor friar but what gives this neighborhood great celebrity is the vast caverns the works of very old times discovered in the isles of salsette and of elephanta and of certain other places hereafter to be pointed out famous caverns the celebrated m niebuhr who visited those caves and those in salsette in      has given numbers of elegant plates of the various figures attended with descriptions see his second volume of travels p    to    mr gough has also published a most elaborate account of these wonderful caves printed by john nichol in       finally descriptions may be found in the viith and viiith volumes of the archaelogia by the pen of messrs mackneil hunter pyke and boon the accounts are of considerable length drawn up with great accuracy and attended with figures of the principal antiquities vast hills have been excavated by human art most probably for religious purposes mr ives gives the ground plan of that at elephanta by which it appears to be a hundred and eighty feet by a hundred and fifty in dimensions part is supported by vast pillars of a rounded form swelling at the middle resting on a square base on the summit of which at each corner is a sitting ape in the entrance are left pillars nearly similar but plain and without figures  the inside is divided into several square apartments the greatest propt by the pillars above described and is a hundred and four feet square at each angle it is divided into three small square rooms and at one of the entrances within for there are three is another all perhaps chapels these are expressed in mr pykes plan  in every cave described by these curious travelers are most amazing numbers of sculptures all cut out of the live rock of human figures extravagant deities monsters animals foliage and all that can astonish and bewilder the imagination many represent idols of the indian mythology figures half beast and half man many faces and many hands to the same sculpture and often the cobra de capello that dreadful snake which is attendant on several of the incarnations of vistchenou a fish is one which assists to explain the object of the sculptures and uses of the excavations  these caverns are the haunts of monstrous serpents hamilton i     tells us that on firing his fusil to enjoy the thundering echo of the report he disturbed a boa fifteen feet in length and two feet in girth from its ancient seat which put the traveller to speedy flight and an end to his curiosity  most of the figures are colossal from twelve to twentythree feet high some of them with all their extravagancies are said to be finely executed many are cross legged in their attitude of prayer many have rosaries which prove that these places were objects of devotion  the woman with three faces and four arms is engraven in mr pykes account i beg leave to make a few remarks on that figure round her neck are five necklaces rich in pearls and gems with pendent jewels her hair is long and hangs in beautiful ringlets her ears not her earrings as they are called hang to a vast length exactly in the malabar mode and her headdress is conic in the chinese fashion which might have been in use in early times the last is dropped the strange deformity of long ears are still retained so far is certainly of eastern sculpture  but what can be said to the figures found in another cave in the neighborhood of bombay not expressed by name they are engraven in volume vii of the archaelogia some have the sausage curl others the cochlear twirl in the hair and others the rich braid of pearl all resembling in some degree the fantastic variety in the headdresses of the roman ladies without the lest trace of oriental fashion  i shall conclude with saying that the cave of elephanta takes its name from an elephant with a lesser on its back cut on the outside of the cave and in a passage is the rude figure of a horse called that of alexander the great to whom the indians attribute these mighty works as we welsh do every thing stupendous to our favorite arthur i mention this tradition to show its great antiquity as well as that of the excavations themselves arrian in his periplus maris erythraei ii     says that there were near barygaza foundations of camps ancient chapels altars and  great wells all attributed to the macedonian hero  the idols mentioned here are quite diminutive to some in the soobahship of cashmere in recesses excavated in the mountain which are called says the ayeen ii  0  surnmii and are pretended to have been the winter retreat of the ancient inhabitants one of the figures was eighty else high there was a woman of fifty and a child of fifteen in one of these surnmii was found a tomb and in that a coffin in which was a corpse preserved by medical preparations one would suppose that the customs of the tartars had been observed in this place and burning the bodies at that time not in use  the method of traveling which begins at surat traveling in india and is continued through most parts of india is by oxen the ox supplies the use of the horse the smaller sort serve as pads the larger are used in drawing a kind of carriage called a hackerie the beasts are commonly white have black noses and large perpendicular horns they are also remarkable like most other indian and african cattle for a hunch rising between the shoulders those of guzerat are most remarkably large and in great request through most parts of india the hunch is highly esteemed as a delicacy salted and boiled when they are fitted for the saddle or the draft a cord and sometimes a piece of wood is passed through the nose from nostril to nostril and a cord extended from each end as a bridle m sonnerat vol i tab   gives a print of the hackerie or gari as it is called in india and all its apparatus in england if these creatures are forced out of their usual slow pace it is too well known that they will faint or lie down under their burden but at bombay they trot and gallop as naturally as horses and are equally as serviceable in every other respect except that by their being subject to a loose habit of body they sometimes incommode the traveller by the filth thrown upon him by the continual motion of their tails whenever they get to the end of the journey the driver always alights and puts the near bullock in the others place then he puts his hand into both their mouths and after pulling out the froth mounts his box again and drives back it seems this precaution is absolutely necessary for as they travel at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour they would otherwise be in danger of suffocation  besides the large species which i have engraven in vol i tab ii of my hist quadr is a diminutive species tab iii common at surat not bigger than a large dog which has a fierce look but is trained to draw children in their little carts i have been informed that a bull and cow from i believe the tanjore country have been imported into england the height of the first not exceeding nineteen inches and of the last not eighteen  being on the subject of animals sheep i shall mention a species of the next genus the sheep that called cabrito by the portuguese is a very long legged kind and of a very disgusting appearance at goa it is sometimes saddled and bridled and serves instead of a poney and will carry a child of twelve years of age  about bombay is found the squirrel hist quadr ii no     known by the name of the place it is very large and of a purple color  i must now digress to a very different class serpents the tribe of snakes is very numerous in india i think their great historiographer m de la cepede enumerates fortyfour species already known i shall only mention the most curious i am uncertain whether they are quite local mr ives speaks of some found in this island or neighborhood the cobra capello i shall describe some time hence mr ives relates that the cobra manilla is only a foot long of a bluish color haunting old walls its bite is as fatal as that of the cobra capello which kills in the space of a quarter of an hour the cobra de aurellia is only six inches long and not thicker than the quill of a crow it is apt to creep into the ear and occasion death by madness the sand snake is small but not less fatal than the others the palmira with a viperine head and varied body is four feet long yet in no part thicker than a swans quill  among the variety of beautiful shells found on the coast turbo scalaris is the noted turbo scalaris or wentletrap a shell seldom an inch and a quarter long of a pearly color and with about seven spires each having several elegant ridges crossing them from the first spire to the last a sine representation of the winding staircase a painter i knew filled with the conchamania once gave fiftysix guineas for three of them one alone he valued at twentyfive  some few other things respecting the natural history of bombay and its neighborhood may be here taken notice of the diseases of india begin to show themselves in this place barbiers a disease but i shall only attend to the barbiers which is more prevalent on this side of the peninsula of india than the other it is a palsy which takes its name from beriberii or the sheep as the afflicted totter in their gait like that animal when seized with a giddiness its symptoms are both a numbness a privation of the use of the limbs a tremor and an attendant titillation usually not fatal but extremely difficult of cure it comes on slowly and usually in the rainy season but if a person drinks hastily when heated a large draught of toddy or the liquor of the coco nut the attack of the disease is very sudden bontius english edition p   treats largely of the cure he recommends strongly baths or somentations of the nochile of the malabars or lagondi of the malays or the jasminum indicum  the phoenomenon of small fish appearing in the rainy season fishes falling on land in places before dry is as true as it is surprising the natives begin to fish for them the tenth day after the first rains and they make a common dish at the tables many are the modes of accounting for this annual appearance it has been suggested that the spawn may have been brought by the water fowl or may have been caught up by the typhons which rage at the commencement of the wet season and be conveyed in the torrents of rain i can only give an explanation much less violent that these fishes never had been any where but near the places where they are found that they have had a preexistent state and began life in form of frogs that it had been the rana paradoxa of gm lin iii p  0    their transformation is certainly wonderful i refer the reader to seba i p     tab    and to merians surinam p    tab    in which are full accounts of the wonderful phoenomenon of these transmuted reptiles which complete their last transformation in the first rains  all kinds of reptiles appear about that season among others toads vast toads of most enormous sizes mr ives mentions one that he supposed weighed between four and five pounds and measured from the toe of the fore to that of the hind leg twentytwo inches  i now leave the bay after saying that the tides here and at cambay rise to an amazing height this must be understood when they are pent up in bays or gulphs for on the open shore they do not rise above a foot and a half into the eastern side flows the river pen with stoney and steep banks immediately beyond the mouth the land resumes its course isles of kanara and hunary the isles of kanara and hunary appear at no great distance from shore small and lofty sevatjee seized on the first in defiance of every effort of the english at bombay he fortified this little spot finding ourselves too weak to remove so dangerous a neighbor we stirred up against him the siddee or admiral to aurengzebe this brought on several sharp naval actions ormes fragments      the siddee seized on the neighboring hunary and each party carrying on a cruel war gave importance to these inconsiderable spots  choule and victoria choule and several other small places are given in the charts on this coast dunda rajapore was a port the rendezvous of aurengzebes fleet under the command of his siddee the siddee was an office formed at the time when the mogul empire first extended itself to these coasts its duty was like that of the comes littoris saxonici on the french and british shores and was here intended to repel the insults of the malabar or portuguese cruizers as the roman comes was those of the norman rovers in the year      there were a hundred and twenty gallivats and fifteen grabs and a vast army encamped in the neighborhood  correspondent to them were nitrias the modern newtya tynadis muziris and numbers of other ports mentioned by the greek and roman historians pirate coast this is the pirate coast and extends almost from bombay till we have arrived very near to goa the romans were obliged to put on board their merchantships a number of archers to defend them against the attacks of the pirates plin not hist lib vi c     which according to the universal history x p     are said to have been arabians mr rennel gives an admirable description of this extent of freebooters  perhaps there are few coasts so much broken into small bays and harbors and that at the same time have so straight a general outline this multitude of small ports uninterrupted view along shore and elevated coasts savourable to distant vision have sitted this coast for the seat of piracy and the alternate land and sea breezes that prevail during a great part of the year oblige vessels to navigate very near the shore no wonder then that pliny should notice them in his time as committing depredations on the roman east india trade and although a temporary check has been given them in the destruction of angrias fleets etc yet we may expect that they will continue the practice while commerce lasts they are protected by the shallowness of their ports and the strength of the country within as pirates they have greater natural advantages than those of barbary who being compelled to roam far from their coasts have expensive outsets here the prizes come to their own doors and the cruizers may lie secure in port until the prey is discovered  the vessels used by these pirates are of two kinds grabs the larger are called grabs a few have three masts and carry three hundred tons the lesser have only two masts and are of the burden of a hundred and fifty tons on the main deck under the forecastle are mounted two cannons nine or ten pounders pointing forwards and firing over the prow orme i p  0   which is constructed like that of a mediterranean galley the cannons on the broadside are from six to nine pounders  gallivats are large row boats gallivats built like the grabs but do not exceed seventy tons the larger carry six or eight cannons from two to four pounders the lesser only petteraroes but both are furnished with forty or fifty stout oars which are rowed at the rate of four miles an hour both grabs and gallivats are crowded with men eight or ten of the latter and forty or fifty of the former compose angrias principal fleet for attacking ships of force they scruple not to make prize of every one which does not condescend to purchase their passports  as soon as they descry a sail they slip from port and sail as fast as the wind or if it is calm soon reach the object with their oars the gallivats taking the grabs in tow they then assemble on the stern of the chase within cannon shot and attempt to dismast her as soon as they succeed they surround and batter her on all sides if the ship makes an obstinate defense a number of gallivats with two or three hundred men in each board her sword in hand from all quarters and in the same instant i am obliged to mr ormes classical history for this account  this coast was equally infamous in the days of pliny possibly long before even as long as commerce became considerable in these seas in lib vi c    he warns the roman merchants of the dangers of this route from touching at muziris not only because it is not abundant in articles of commerce but as it borders upon the piratae hydras who had a port at hydras some write it nitrias yet i think the historian intended the first allusive to the fabled serpent which makes every thing its prey their ports of this coast are truly described by pliny to be shallow vi victoria so that the commerce was then carried on as it is in many places to this day in small boats which convey the merchandise to the ships which are obliged to anchor at a distance from land ptolemy also mentions the ports of these pirates or the  and gives a lift of them it is not improbable but that these pests of the sea continued from that time to the present but certain it is that vasco de gama found them on this coast in full force in his first voyage to india marco polo who traveled in      describes at p     their piracies in those days both in the seas of guzerat and malabar he says they took their wives and children with them and passed the whole summer on the sea they commonly had twenty ships in a fleet which they ranged at the distance of five miles from each other making a line of a hundred miles as soon as any one described a merchant ship it made a signal by smoke to the rest so there was no possibility of escape they offered no violence to the crew they only plundered the vessel and set the people on shore  in our days many of the ports of the modern pirates have been brought into notice by the attempts to extirpate these nests of thieves and with a temporary success their principal fastnesses were in victoria severndroog sunderdoo vingorla rocks in lat        0 six or seven miles from the shore and i should have given particular preeminence to gheriah gheriah the port of the chief pirate angria nearly midway between bombay and goa  victoria is the name we bestowed on one of these fastnesses the indian one was bancoote this we retain not only because it has a good harbor and great trade in salt but because the neighborhood abounds with cattle with which we can supply the garrison and navy at bombay the country is peopled with mahomctans who have no scruple to part with them as the hindoos have groses voyage ii   0   the reduction of these piratical powers added greatly to the glory of the british arms sir william james severndroog and five other of the forts on this coast were taken in april      by commodore james commander of the east india companys marine forces in india ormes hist i      the mahratta fleet made a show of assisting us but never once came within reach of the guns mr james acquired immortal honor and was among the very few who have of late years made the title of baronet the praemium virtutis  this success facilitated the reduction of gheriah the pirate angria the chief fort and residence of angria the head of the piratical states rearadmiral watson who commanded the royal squadron seconded by mr james made himself master of the place in february      in less than twentyfour hours at the expense of no more than twenty men the chieftain tullagee angria escaped two or three days before the attack and basely deserted his wife and little children mr ives gives an affecting account of the interview between them and our humane admiral notwithstanding angria forgot what ought to be dearer than all besides he took care to secure his treasure our army and our navy who were very nearly quarrelling about the booty before vii gheriah the attack was made found that the wily indian had left them no more than the value of one hundred thousand pounds to divide among them  the first of the name was conagee angria origin of the name an adventurer in the time of aurengzebe entrusted by the mahrattas with the fort of severndroog he not only kept possession of that fortress but extended his territories a hundred and twenty miles along the coasts and as far inland as the ghauts mahrattas indians renegado christians and negroes flocked in vast numbers to the piratical standard which became at last as formidable in these seas as that of algiers in the mediterranean all his successors retained the name of angria even to the last whose destruction we have related  i here mention dabul a neighboring place dabul to contrast the conduct of the portuguese who in      took it with uncommon instances of barbarity they set fire to it in four places the male inhabitants escaped but the savage heroes for we cannot deny the character of heroism put to the sword the defenseless sex and innocent children conquetes des portugais iv      after various other barbarities along the coast the wretched conqueror brandan was received at the capital goa with every mark of approbation  the important city of goa

inhabitants were of great grandeur and splendour it stands elevated in form of an amphitheatre on the banks of a most beautiful bay the country rises gently into hills finely wooded and the scene is varied with churches convents and villas and the distance bounded by the ghauts soaring with aweful majesty the algoada fort defends the entrance on the northern side all this is shown in mr

 the indian name of goa was tricurii or the isle of thirty villages it is said to have been peopled by moorish merchants who had been banished from different ports of malabar and formed soon a very flourishing settlement this is said to have happened at no very distant period before the arrival of the portuguese  when the great albuquerque entered on his viceroyalty seized by albuquerque it was a most opulent place and strongly fortified it was at that time subject to zabaim a potent monarch who was then engaged in war with diverse tributary princes timoia a neighboring pirate who had submitted to the portuguese strongly advised the christian general to seize the opportunity of attacking goa representing its great opulence and the honor and wealth that would attend his success albuquerque listened to his advice and after several assaults made himself master of the city by an agreement with the inhabitants this happened on february       0 the citizens took the oaths of allegiance to emmanuel he found in the place immense quantities of ammunition forty great cannon and in the docks forty men of war and in the stables numbers of fine persian and arabian horses osorio ii p    he himself resided in the royal palace the fame of his valor and prudence spread far and wide he received embassies from several of the indian monarchs and even was encouraged to send an envoy to the sophy of persia  unfortuately a mutinous spirit pervaded his army and even his principal officers this naturally infected his new subjects who repenting their disloyalty and disgusted with their sudden submission to a foreign and christian yoke conveyed their sentiments to their late sovereign he assembled a mighty army on the continent and notwithstanding every endeavor of the able albuquerque effected a landing on the island the portuguese defended themselves with great valor but finding the place no longer tenable their commander determined to retire he embarked with great secrecy every thing that was necessary when on the  0th of may of the same year after a sharp conflict he made good his retreat to rapander a neighboring town where he resolved to winter osorio ii p     zabaim proved a brave and active enemy albuquerque was more than once obliged to remove his quarters at length receiving a strong reinforcement of portuguese and other supplies he renewed his attempt on goa and after several sharp actions made himself again master of the city by a most fierce and bloody assault the defense being equally obstinate as the attack  from that moment the able viceroy determined to make goa the capital of his masters new acquired dominion in india he gave it every strength his military skill could suggest and every encouragement that his wisdom and commercial knowledge could invent the success was for a long series of years equal to the greatness of the design and it flourished with unrivalled splendour it became the center of the riches of india and one of the greatest marts in the universe at length the common consequences of wealth pride luxury effeminacy and every species of fraud cruelty and oppression possessed the minds of these

persecuted the poor natives in every shape and in every place the abbe raynal in most animated terms describes the sad change to him i refer the reader after the fall of the portuguese empire in india a priest of goa being asked when he thought his nation might again resume its power sensibly replied  as soon as your wickedness shall exceed that of my people let me only say that the measure of their iniquity being filled they were beaten and expelled from the very seats conquered by the intrepidity and chivalry of their ancestors and that by a small nation who sallying from the fens of holland by temperance wisdom and fortitude drove from almost every part of india that nation whose monarchs so long had tyrannised over them in europe goa and some few places on the malabar coast were left to them most of them are now deserted and fallen to ruin goa barely keeps up its head a viceroy a man of rank is still sent here a show of state is kept up but nothing of territory is left except the island and the two peninsulas that form the harbor the port of goa is one of the finest in india and in the hands of the english or dutch would be a wealthy and flourishing settlement but its commercial consequence is sunk to nothing and such is the state of diu and damoon if they still remain in their hands  it was at this place that the apostle of the indies st francis de xavier st

the year      made a most destructive inroad into the carnatic to divert the ravages of the tyrant was the object of the presidency of this coast  genesis matews lands there when the general had arrived so far he landed his troops and sent orders to the southern army under the colonels macleod and humberston to march and join him before their arrival he on january   attacked and took a few places of small consequence he then directed his views to the richest parts of ayder allis dominions to which he was encouraged by the distance they were at that time from relief he carried the opulent town of onore onore sacked which lay on the coast by storm every man says an actor in the tragedy in onore was put to the sword the carnage was great we trampled thick on dead bodies that were strewed in the way it was rather shocking to humanity but such are but secondary considerations to a soldier whose bosom glows with heroic glory and are thought only accidents of course lieut hubbards

the bosoms of our soldiers had exhausted their heroic ardour fortunately for the southern army it had not made its junction with the general and so escaped the disgrace of the massacre which probably the generous commanders had they arrived might have diverted him from  thus strengthened ascent of the ghauts he began his toilsome ascent up the hussein ghurry ghaut with all windings not less than three miles in extent and strongly fortified at every turning luckily it happened says mr sheen that the commander knew nothing of this defile otherwise it would have been madness for him to have attempted it for if the enemy had made any tolerable defense it would have been impregnable but it was defended only by the wild undisciplined troops of the native polygars  however the generals want of information was the cause of our success for in the evening part of the eleventh battalion which i belong to the light company of the bombay europeans and part of the fifteenth battalion of sepoys began the attack and took the first barrier with very little opposition  when we came to the second we were alarmed at the prodigious number and strong position of the enemy but finding it no less dangerous to retreat than to advance we charged home in all quarters when the motley crew gave way and fled leaving about five hundred killed and wounded our small body flushed with success

death and the king confined possibly the complaint of the son was unconstitutional for the throne of canhara is said to have always been filled with a female who had the privilege of marrying whom she

magazines a very fine foundry for brass cannon a powder manufactory and immense stores of every kind hon charles greviles british india iii p      matthews did not make a true estimate of this species

mention that some of the women rather than be torn from their relations threw themselves into large tanks where they were drowned the pretense for these brutalities was that the garrison an uncivilized people had acted in contradiction to the rules of war among civilized nations after the specimen we gave here i fear the idea of the civilization the british had arrived at will not rise to any great height matthews suppressed in his dispatches all accounts of this or similar transactions and also of the vast treasures we are beholden to private letters for the history one officer was so shocked at one he had written that he tore it to pieces lieut sheen was not so delicate all these shameful relations have been contradicted yet still as sir thomas brown expresses they are among

siege to mangalore a practicable breach was soon effected which the gallant governor rustan alli beg could not persuade hid timid garrison to defend so he was compelled to surrender a few years after he unjustly lost his head in sight of the city by order of his cruel master tippoo sultan  at mangalore the general received intelligence that tippoo was in full march from the carnatic to relieve his country after the receipt of the news his mind grew quite disordered he reascended the ghaut and reentered bednore in a few days the enemy appeared his forces were so numerous that they not only covered the adjacent plains but even every hill and more remote than the eye could reach matthews in a frenzy marched out with his handful of men and met the expected fate was at once defeated with the loss of five hundred men he made his retreat into bednore which he bravely defended seventeen days but finding the garrison reduced by sickness and the number of slain bednore retaken he capitulated on honorable terms the garrison to be allowed the honors of war but to pile the arms on the glacis to retain all private property and to restore all public etc etc tippoo took possession of the city notwithstanding his situation the avarice of the general overcame every consideration he ordered the officers to make unlimited drafts on the paymaster who had before been greatly exhausted by various contrivances it was currently believed that he had sent by his brother to goa three hundred thousand pounds and a great quantity of diamonds to be remitted to bombay and that even on the point of his departure he had caused the bamboos of his palanquin to be pierced and filled with pagodas when tippoo examined the state of his treasury he grew enraged at this infamous fraud he declared the treaty void put the officers and their sepoys faithful to them to the last indiscriminately in irons and marched them in that condition in a burning sun to prisons at scringapatam and other places numbers fell dead on the road the remainder arrived at the place of their destination in the utmost misery and that increased by the wretched dungeons they were confined in those who

evident that the severities exercised by tippoo after this victory was here the determined resolution of inflicting a just punishment but unhappily he included in it the innocent as well as guilty

haunt of infinite numbers and varieties of the monkey tribe botanists style it arundo bambos and arundo arbor it is an evergreen the stem is of a vivid green but as it grows older becomes of a duller color i refer to the syslema plantarum for the synonyms rumphius iv   describes but does not give its figure in the hortus malaharicus i tab    it is found under the title of ily bamboo is not the indian name but one imposed on it by the portuguese from the violent explosion the hollows give on being set on fire occasioned by the confined air little inferior to that of a piece of artillery this plant grows to a prodigious height so as to overtop all trees of the forest and its circumference so great as to occasion hyperbolical exaggeration pliny says that the joints of those which grew about the acesines are so large that a single one is sufficent to make a boat navigiorum etiam vicem praestant si credimus singula internodia pliny seems to credit the relation and acosta aromatum liber an author of credit informs us that he had frequently seen them in use on the river near cranganor on this coast and that they were capable of carrying two indians one sat on each end with their knees joined and each carried a short oar or paddle with which they rowed with vast rapidity and even against the stream the honorable edward monkton who had been at goa has assured me that the above must have been a mistake the largest joint he ever saw which always grows at the bottom of the plant was not two feet in length and about the thickness of a stout mans leg  the bamboo is subservient to other uses similar but far more important the reed formed into a frame and covered with skin becomes a boat of the same sort with the british coracles or rather the vitilia navigia in which the britons even crossed our narrow seas tour in wales i      ayder alli had great numbers which he carried with him in his campaigns those frames were carried by two men and the skins by two more and in a quarter of an hour they were ready for use one of these vessels was capable of containing twentyfive men or a piece of cannon with which they crossed any rivers they found in their march hist of

poor greenlanders whom they bite in two secured as they seem to be in their canoes  in most places the joints are used as pitchers to carry water and some will contain sufficient to supply the family for the whole day from this use it is named the arundarbor vasaria  at the siege of mangalore tippoo sultan mounted his spears on light bamboos a hundred and fortyseven feet long and made his

as pipes for conveyance of water and in the same country by macerating them the chinese make their paper both coarse and fine split into slender lengths this cane is of much use in making mats in short its uses are innumerable  they are often made use of for frames of houses for which their ready sissibility and their lightness peculiarly adapt them  they are greatly searched after as poles to carry burdens but particularly for the poles of palanquins for this purpose they are bent while growing to give them a proper curvature and when richly carved as they often are are sold at a vast

is a honey collected from reeds a sort of white gum brittle between the teeth the largest pieces do not exceed the size of a hazel nut and it is used only in medicine  the cane was an article of commerce in very early times antiquity of the prophets isaiah chapter xlv    and jeremiah chapter vi  0 make mention of it thou have brought me no sweet cane with money says the first and the second to what purpose comes there to me the sweet cane from a far country brought for the luxury of the juice either extracted by suction or by some other means in the note on the elegant poem the sugar cane note in book ix     doctor grainger informs us that at first the raw juice was made use of they afterward boiled it into a syrup and in process of time an inebriating spirit was prepared therefrom by fermentation  sugar was first made from the reed in egypt its removals from thence the plant was carried into sicily which in the twelfth century supplied many parts of europe with that commodity and from thence at a period unknown it was probably brought into spain by the moors from spain the reed was planted in the canary islands and in the madeira by the portuguese this happened about the year   0  in the same year ferdinand the catholic ordered the cane to be carried from the canaries to st domingo from those islands the art of making sugar was introduced into the islands of hispaniola and in about the year      into the brazils the reed itself growing spontaneously in both those countries till that time sugar was a most expensive luxury and used only as mr anderson observes in feasts and physical necessities  i shall here anticipate the account of the state of sugar in spain where in europe it first became stationary into spain borrowing it from the ninth volume of my outlines of the globe it was till of late years cultivated to great advantage in the kingdom of granada and great quantities of sugar made in the ingenios or mills in the year      in the city of mesril were eight hundred families their principal commerce was in sugars and syrups made in four sugar works from the plantations of canes which reached from the south side down to the sea side but these and the other sugar works are greatly decayed by reason of the excessive duties this with the increased demand for sugar on the prevaling use of chocolate in the kingdom which requires double the quantity of that article has occasioned a drain of a million of dollars out of the country in payment for sugar preserves and other confectionaries this is very extraordinary considering that spain is possessed of some of the sinest sugar islands besides the power of manufacturing it within its home dominions uztariz ii chapter      i now digress several leagues to the west laccadive

earthly tenement  a captain coffin engaged in the southern or guinea whale fishery found in a female spermaceti whale three hundred and sixty ounces of ambergrise this is said not to be unusual but then it always is in fickly emaciated fishes these instances do not prove that it was the production of the spermaceti whale the food of which is squids or the sepia many of the horny beaks were found adhering to the ambergrise or immersed in that soft substance it appears to me that the whales sometimes swallow it that it disagrees with them and acts as a sort of poison bringing on a decay and

them the chief is called atoll maldivas they have only four ports in which their few articles of commerce are collected  one article is the cowry a small species of shell trade in cowry shells the cyproea moneta of linnaeus dargenville tab xviii fig k it is very singular that many parts of the world should for ages past be obliged to these little and remote islands for their specie and that the contemptible shells of the maldives prove the price of mankind and contribute to the vilest of traffic in negroland but so it is these shells are collected twice in the month at full and new moon it is the business of the women who wade up to their middle to gather them they are packed up in parcels of twelve thousand each and are the current money among the poor in bengal a cowry is rated there at the hundred and sixtieth part of a penny so that it is impossible to find a coin so small as to be of use to the poor in a country where provisions are so exceedingly cheap eighty cowries make a pun and from fifty to sixty puns the value of a roupee or four shillings and sixpence english they are reexported to england france etc and from those places again to guinea as the price of the unhappy natives hamilton i     mistakes the manner of gathering them when he says  the natives fling into the sea branches of coco trees to which the shells adhere and are collected every four or five months the exchange for them from bengal is rice butter and cloth which is brought from that country in small vessels fitted for the shallow navigations  these islands as well as the laccadives have besides a brisk trade with the western coasts of india chiefly in coco nuts and the several manufactures from that useful article among which the kaiar or cables and ropes made of the filaments of the nuts have a vast sale on all the coast of india  fish is another article in fish the species is said to be chiefly the bonito or scomber pelamys these annually migrate among the isles in april and may they are caught both by hook and net are split and the bone taken out sprinkled with sea water and set to dry then put into the sand wrapped up in coco leaves and placed a foot or two below the surface where they become as hard as stock fish vessels come from atcheen in the isle of sumatra with gold dust to purchase this necessary which is again sold there at the rate of l  per thousand  the coco tree is the only one which these isles do produce for they are universally sandy and barren of this the inhabitants build vessels of twenty or thirty tons the cables ropes sails and every individual part is made of this tree which even supplies the sirewood and provision oil for their kitchens and lamps sugar and candied sweetmeats and strong cloth  they are furnished with water from wells which they dare not sink deeper than five or six feet otherwise the salt water will percolate through the sand on them they depend nor do these ever fail  ali rajah of cananore and high admiral of ayder alli made a conquest of these isles took the king captive and cruelly put out his eyes in this state he presented him to ayder who highly disapproving of the barbarity deprived the rajah of the command of the fleet and treated the unhappy prince with the utmost humanity gave him a palace and settled on him a revenue to supply him with every pleasure he was capable of tasting hist of ayder alli i     the poets of ayders court added to his title on this occasion  king of the islands of the sea and in their poems placed him above alexander and tamerlane let me here say that he had his poetlaureat always resident who had a stipend of a thousand roupees a month and the rank of a general of a thousand men hist ayder alli i      part of the inhabitants profess paganism part mahometism the first retained from the original their language is cingalese or that of ceylon hamilton i     which points out their primoeval stock as to mahometism it is a more modern religion derived from the moors some bury their dead others burn them like the hindoos but knox our best authority says that the poor only inter the rich commit them to the funeral pile hist ceylon      hamilton saw on one island certain tombs sculptured says he with as great variety of figures as he ever saw in europe  to return to the continent a few leagues below mahe sacrifice rock at a small distance from the coast is the sacrifice rock supposed to have received its name from certain portuguese taken by some of the neighboring cruizers of cottica and on that rock made victims to the revenge of the indians hamilton i p  0    the city of calicut seated in lat       city of calicut stands about eight leagues to the south of the rock of sacrifice this place is celebrated as being the first land in india which the europeans ever saw after the long interval of the roman commerce here the great gama on may    school first saw the fertile risings and plains of malabar backed by the lofty ghauts rise before him mr dalrymple in one of his plates gives a view of what it now is and in respect to its natural situation what it must have been at that time the works of art are too minute to be perceptible amidst the bold and eternal operations of nature  calicut was at that time the greatest emporium of all india its ancient trade the commerce of the arabs with this port was prodigious precious stones pearls amber ivory chinaware gold and silver silks and cottons indigo sugar spices valuable woods perfumes beautiful varnishes and whatever adds to the luxuries of life were brought there from all parts of the east some of these rich commodities came by sea but as navigation was neither so safe nor pursued with so much spirit as it has been since a great part of them was conveyed by land on the backs of oxen and elephants  all its splendour and all its opulence was owing to commerce yet the houses were mean but not crowded detached from each other and surrounded with delicious gardens none were built of stone but the royal palace which rose with great magnificence above the other buildings the town was very extensive and very populous  at the arrival of the portuguese it was governed by a monarch the zamoreen called the zamorin who like a lord paramount had all the other princes of malabar as tributaries the account as related by the portuguese historians is that six hundred years before the arrival of gama or about the year     perimal reigned supreme over the whole country in his old age he became a convert to mahometism and determined to resign his dominions to his relations and finish his days at the holy city of medina his successors retained the ancient religion and are considered as chief of the nayrs i will relate the tale in the elegant language of camoens who gives a faithful recital of the event dressed in poetical numbers by the elegant pen of mr mickle great samoreen her lords imperial style the mighty lord of indias utmost soil to him the kings their duteous tributes pay and at his feet confess their borrowed sway yet higher towerd the monarchs ancient boast of old one sovereign ruled the spacious coast a votive train who brought the korans lore what time great perimal the scepter bore from blessed arabias groves to india came life were their words their eloquence a flame of holy zeal fired by the powerful strain the lofty monarch joins the faithful train and vows at fair medinas shrine to close his lifes mild eve in prayer and sweet repose gifts he prepares to deck the prophets tomb the glowing labors of the indian loom orixas spices and golcondas gems yet ere the fleet the arabian ocean stems his final care his potent regions claim nor his the transport of a fathers name his servants now the regal purple wear and high enthroned the golden sceptres bear proud cochin one and one fair chale sways the spicy isle another lord obeys coulam and cananoors luxurious fields and cranganore to various lords he yields while these and others thus the monarch graced a noble youth his care unmindful past save calicut a city poor and small though lordly now no more remained to fall grieved to behold such merit thus repaid the sapient youth the king of kings he made and honored with the name great samoreen the lordly titled boast of power supreme and now great perimal resigns his reign the blissful bowers of paradise to gain before the gale his gaudy navy flies and india sinks for ever from his eyes and soon to calicuts commodious port the fleets deep edging with the wave resort wide over the shore extend the warlike piles and all the landscape round luxurious smiles and now her flag to every gale unfurled she towers the empress of the eastern world such are the blessings sapient kings bestow and from thy stream such gifts o commerce flow   gama was at first well received at calicut but the jealousy of the arabs prevented his friendship with the zamorin from being of any duration the portuguese never could make themselves masters of the place but at length albuquerque in   0  seized by albuquerque prevaled on the reigning prince to permit him to build a fort not far from the city this gave him the command of the commerce notwithstanding the city remained under the line of its ancient rulers who very frequently were engaged in wars with their european neighbors the english had their factories here but i believe have long since deserted the place as to the portuguese they became so distressed by the union of the dutch with the zamorin that they blew up their fortress and entirely quitted the neighborhood it was afterward either undermined with the sea or overthrown by an earthquake for hamilton says that in   0  his ship which drew twentyone feet water struck on its ruins  ayder alli advanced toward this town by ayder alli it was voluntarily surrendered to him by the zamorin who prostrated himself at his feet and presented him with two basins of gold one filled with pieces of gold the other with precious stones and two small cannons of gold with golden carriages of the same metal ayder raised him from the ground and promised to restore to him his dominions on condition of paying a small tribute the two princes parted seemingly in perfect amity the next day the palace appeared on fire in desiance of all attempts to save it it was wholly destroyed and with it perished the prince his family and vast treasures the zamorin had just received letters from the hindoo rajahs of travancore and cochin bitterly reproaching him with betraying his country to the mahometans and becoming apostate to his religion declaring him degraded and expelled from his cast so affected was he with the disgrace that he determined on the fatal joar see page    and by that rite made the horrible expiation life of ayder alli i       in the year      by major abington this city was taken by major abington he was superseded in his command by colonel humberston the environs were at that time in possession of the enemy under mugdum saheb a general of ayders the youthful hero panting after glory sallied forth with a handful of men and gave him a total defeat mugdum several principal officers and between three and four hundred men fell in the action his forces consisted of three thousand foot and near a thousand horse i am ashamed says the modest victor to name the number of my troops they were so few that you will think me rash to have ventured an action in consequence the enemy evacuated all the country which belonged to the zamorin whom i restored to his possessions british india iii       paniani is a town a few miles farther where the english had once a settlement paniani what makes it particularly remarkable is that the ghauts opposite to the place have in them a gap between fourteen and fifteen miles in length and about sixteen miles in width occupied chiefly by forest trees and is defended by the forts of annamally and palicaudcherry and others it being the important pass to and from the malabar coast and of late years has been very frequently the seat of action in the campaign of      the forts of annamally and palicaudcherry were taken by that most able officer colonel fullarton who knew how to conquer and knew how to record his actions viii palicaudcherry the last was completely rebuilt by ayder since the war of      with the english and was furnished with all the advantages of european construction and defense and attended with every difficulty of approach from forests intersections of the paniani river and deep rice grounds yet on the   th of november by the conduct of the commander and the valor of his troops it was surrendered by a garrison of four thousand men after a long and desperate defense fullartons campaigns p     it was afterward evacuated but by the partition treaty reserved to us with other accessions which gave entrance into dindigul and our interior acquisitions let me not omit that at palatchy not remote from palicaudcherry the land attains its greatest height and the river runs east and west into the coromandel and malabar seas same p      in september    0 lieutenant colonel hartley with a small detachment of general meadowss army marched from dindigul toward the coast westward to clear the country of enemies and favor the great attack on tippoo sultan he descended the ghauts by the paniani gap reached the coast gained a most brilliant victory over one of the sultans generals at tervannagurry on december  0 and completely broke the enemys force on the west of the ghauts he took turuckabad the capital of the country continued his march northward to cananore joined general abercromby and shared with him the fatigues and glory of the campaigns of      and      it is a break between the northern and southern ridge of the ghauts the paniani gale the mountains on each side are so high as to arrest the clouds and winds but the last rush with vast violence through this great breach during the northeast monsoons ships at some distance at sea as soon as they come within the openings feel the fierce effect of the wind which pours on them with vast fury but before they reach the line of the gap and when they have passed it the stillest calm succeeds  the river paniani rises from the northeast in the coimbotore country coimbotore country and passes through the breach and in the rainy season is navigable for small boats to the foot of the ghauts its source is from an elevated plain sixty miles in extent rising suddenly out of the surrounding country like a vast terrace and faces the great gap such are common in india and are features almost peculiar to the country  twentyfive miles south of paniani is cranganore cranganore the northern frontier of the rajahship of travencore when gama arrived on this coast he was surprised with a visit of certain deputies from that city informing him that they were like him christians and requesting to be taken under the protection of his great master emmanuel gama received them with the utmost affection and assured them he should recommend their interests to the portuguese admirals osorio lib i p      whom he should leave on the coast after his departure a quarrel happened between them and the zamorin a ship laden with spices was on its way from calicut to cranganore such was the avarice of the portuguese that they could not resist making it a prize the nephew of the zamorin who was their warm friend represented to them the danger of offending his uncle and at the same time assured them that the cargo was designed to be disposed of to them all was in vain they took the ship and slew some of the crew the nephew demanded satisfaction but his remonstrances were received with contempt  lopez soarez a portuguese admiral came into india about this time with thirteen ships he found that the zamorin and the citizens of cranganore were preparing to revenge the injuries done them he sailed for that port landed his men and assisted by the king of cochin attacked the indian army gained a complete victory and pursued the fugitives into the city and set it on fire burnt it was to no purpose that the christian inhabitants entreated the conquerors to spare their churches they did indeed attempt to quench the flames but to no purpose for very few of the places of worship escaped this happened in   0  the portuguese built a strong fort near the spot about a league up the river or channel which is not above a quarter of a mile broad but very deep yet on the bar at springtides had not above fourteen feet of water a new city arose but the indians rebuilt it at some distance from the ancient site and it became one of the sinest in india a channel divides it from another narrow isle which is about four leagues long and runs north and south parallel with the main land another channel divides it from that of cochin the dutch under commodore goens made themselves masters of cranganore in    0 without meeting the lest resistance the portuguese enervated with luxury and detested for their cruelty in a single year lost every one of their possessions in malabar to their ancient foes who succeeded to their wealth and power supported by wisdom economy and valor as soon as they were masters of the place they prohibited all boats or vessels from entering at the two channels determined to prevent surprise and illicit trade  this city was distinguished by two most remarkable circumstances jews in india the one to begin with the most ancient was its having been the residence of a republic of jews part of the tribe of manassch who had been carried into captivity by nebuchadnezzar who sent numbers of them to this distant place their history says that they amounted to twenty thousand and that they were three years in traveling to this place from the time of their setting out from babylon when they arrived they were treated with great humanity by the natives and allowed every indulgence in both religious and temporal concerns in process of time they grew so wealthy as to purchase the little kingdom of cranganore hamilton i p p         makes them increase to eighty thousand families but in his days they were reduced to four thousand they established a commonwealth and selected the two sons of one of the first families eminent for their wisdom to govern them jointly one of them instigated by ambition murdered his brother after which the commonwealth became a democracy and their territory many centuries ago returned into the hands of the natives powerful as they were they are at present very poor and few numbers of them had removed to god where they were greatly encouraged by the zamorin of the time they have to this day a synagogue near the kings palace at a small distance from cochin where are preserved their records engraven on copper plates in hebrew characters and when any of the characters decay they are new cut so that they can show their history from the reign of nebuchadnezzar to the present time the maecenas of malabar m von rheede caused these records to be translated into low dutch the perusal would be very desirable i trust that these plates were not forgeries to impose on the curious governor as the famous inscription on the death of the danish monarch hardicanute at lambeth was by a witty wag which so capitally deceived the first antiquaries of our days see european magazine vol xvii   that st thomas preached the gospel in india christians in india i make no doubt he first visited the isle of socotora after performing the orders of his divine master he passed through the several kingdoms which intervened between that isle and jerusalem from socotora he landed at cranganore where he continued some time and made numbers of proselytes and in all probability established a church government from thence he visited the eastern parts of india and met with martyrdom at meliapour where we shall resume the history of this great apostle  those christians on the malabar coast grew into a potent people but if we may credit marco polo p     there was in the center of india a country called abasia divided into seven kingdoms three of which were mohammedan the other four christian the christians distinguished themselves by a golden cross worn over their forcheads but the jews who were among them were marked on their checks with a hot iron  but what weighs greatly with me concerning the truth of the existence of the indian christians or christians of st themas or christians of st thomas as they are usually called is that the knowledge of them had reached england as early as the ixth century known in england in     for we are certain that our great alsred in consequence of a vow sent sighm ii in the year     bishop of sherbourn first to rome and afterward to india with alms to the christians of the town of saint thomas now mcliapour who returned with various rich gems some of which were to be seen in the church of sherbourn according to william of malmsbury lib ii     even in his days i have not extent of faith to favor the legend of the place of the martyrdom of the saint which was fixed by pious historians to have been at st thomas on the coromandel coast of which the reader will find an account in the following volume  the rites and customs of these christians differ in several respects from those of the church of rome their rites in some they accord which makes me imagine there might have been some accidented communication of the nature of that i have mentioned above osorio i     gives an account of their ceremonies speaking of the christians of cranganore he thus goes on  the christians who reside here are generally very poor and their churches of a mean appearance they keep the sabbath in the same manner as we do in hearing sermons and performing other religious duties the high priest whom they acknowleged as the head of their church had his seat near some mountains toward the north in a country called chaldaeis he has a council composed of twelve cardinals two bishops and several priests with the assistance of these he settles all affairs relating to religion and all the christians in these parts acquiesce in his decrees the priests are shaved in such a manner as to represent a cross on their crowns they administer the sacrament in both kinds making use of the juice of pressed grapes by way of wine and allow the laity to partake of both but no one is admitted to this solemn ordinance till he has made a confession of his iniquities they baptized not their infants till they were forty days old except in danger of death when any one amongst them is seized with a fit of sickness the priest immediately visits him and the sick person is greatly animated by the holy mans supplications when they enter their churches they sprinkle themselves with holy water they use the same form of burial as in other catholic countries the relations of the deceased give great entertainments which last a week during which time they celebrate his praises and put up prayers for his eternal happiness they preserve the sacred writings in the syrian or chaldaean language with great carefulness and their teachers are ready in all public places to instruct every one they keep the advent sunday and the forty days of lent with great strictness and observe most of the festivals which we have in our church with the same exactness they compute their time likewise in the same manner as we do adding a day to every fourth year the first day of july is kept as a holiday in honor of st thomas not only by these christians but many of the pagans also there are likewise convents for the priests and nunneries for their women who adhere to their vows of chastity with the utmost probity their priests are allowed to marry once but excluded from taking a second wife marriages amongst other people cannot be annulled but by the death of one of the parties when a woman becomes a widow she forfeits her dowry if married within a twelvemonth after the death of her husband these are the customs and manners which the christians in cranganore as well as many other parts of india have observed with the utmost fidelity from the time of st thomas  when gama arrived on this coast there were about two hundred thousand of them in the southern parts of malabar during thirteen hundred years they had been under the patriarch of babylon who appointed their metarene or archbishop they were extremely averse to the doctrine of st francis de xavier when he came among them and abhorred the worship of images which they considered as idolatry they refused to acknowledge the popes supremacy and at length were persecuted as heretics with all the horrors of the inquisition newly established at goa xavier had never troubled his new converts with any instruction nor ever instilled into them any knowledge of the principles of the christian religion any farther than implicit obedience to the head of the church he gave them crucifixes to worship and told them they were then sure of heaven his preaching was subservient to the political interests of his country his abilities and his labors for that end were amazing in him appeared all the powers which in after times gave to his order that vast importance in the affairs of the universe i will conclude this article with saying that out of the fifty thousand inhabitants found in bednore when ayder alli took possession of it thirty thousand were christians who says his historian i p    were endowed with great privileges  cranganore and a fort on the opposite side of the river named jacotta gave rise to the important war of the mysore they had been taken from the portuguese by the dutch and possessed by the last a hundred and fifty years ayder alli seeing the convenience of cranganore to his mysorean kingdom in    0 seized and garrisoned it in the ensuing war the dutch repossessed themselves of it in      tippoo sultan the successor of ayder determined to make himself master of it in right of his father he raised a mighty army which so alarmed the dutch that they resolved to dispose of the two forts to the rajah of travancore an ally of the english in order to divert the storm from themselves tippoo marched with his forces and attacked the lines of travancore the battle between his army and that of the rajah the latter in defense of cranganore on may      0 was the signal of the general war on which commenced the first campaign in june following the conclusion of that glorious war was the putting us in possession of the whole coast from caroor as far as mount dilly a tract of a hundred and twenty miles this is the result of the partition treaty  cochin lies in lat cochin      n on the southern side of the channel on an island opposite to another that stretches to the south it is a rajahship possibly dependent on that of travancore who seems to have undertaken the defense of the whole tract southward by erecting the famous lines of travancore which begin at cranganore and extend almost to the foot of the ghauts the coast is very low scarcely discernible except by the trees the soundings are gradual and are at the distance of two miles from shore ten or eleven fathoms ships usually lie three or four miles from land a dangerous bar is an obstruction to entering the harbor and a most furious surge at times beats on the shore  this was one of the first places visited by the portuguese after their arrival at calicut it was at that time governed by a prince tributary to the zamorin but who showed every act of friendship to the admiral cabral and his companions at his time the harbor was capacious and open while he was there two of the christians of st thomas came and requested him to convey them to portugal that from thence they might visit jerusalem and the holy land gama himself afterward visited cochin and received every mark of respect the prince continued faithful to his new allies and assisted them with a considerable army against the zamorin at length fortune declared against him the zamorin burnt his capital and made himself master of his dominions the portuguese under francis albuquerque says lasitau came in   0  to their assistance expelled the zamorin and duarte pachcco whom albuquerque had left behind by his astonishing valor and prudence reinstated triumpara the reigning prince but only to fit him for a new mortification in the transports of his gratitude he permitted the portuguese to build a fort this gave them full power over their faithful ally and under pretense of reducing his rebellious subjects made a conquest of the whole country in a little time the poor prince found himself enslaved cochin became under its new masters a place of great commerce till the year    0 fatal to the portuguese power in this part of india it was attacked by the commodore goens the garrison made a most gallant defense nor was it taken till after great loss on both sides the dutch found the city much too large for their purpose they reduced it considerably the titular king did not find any improvement in his situation and it is said that the present prince lives near cochin with an income of little more than six hundred pounds a year some of the race of the jewish captives and some of the christians of st thomas reside here the last are miserably poor and ignorant but the church of st andrea not far from hence is served by their clergy  in this city breathed his last the great vasco de gama of vasco de gama the discoverer of india and with the illustrious albuquerque the founder of the portuguese empire in that inexhaustible region of wealth gama was born at sines a port in the province of alentejo in portugal of a family rendered illustrious by the valor of the individuals vasco was only the fifth in heraldic history which does not even acquaint us with the time of his birth he had served in france and he was gentleman of the bedchamber to the great emmanuel when he was appointed in      to the important command of the fleet destined for the discovery of the indies we have successively mentioned his name on several glorious occasions our business now is only to trace him to his end he survived to the reign of john iii to be appointed to a third voyage and to finish his days on that shore where he had begun his career of glory he sailed from lisbon on april  0      prodigies attended his voyage on his arrival off the coast of cambay in the stillness of a calm a dreadful swelling of the sea the then unknown symptons of an earthquake appalled the boldest gama discovered the phoenomenon courage says he  india trembles at our approach another danger followed this from the description his ship was nearly foundered by the fall of a waterspout he arrived at length at this port where he gave up his great soul on december         to be judged according to unerring justice for amidst all his fine qualities he was deeply tainted with the character of his nation cruelty his body lay deposited at cochin till      when it was brought to lisbon where it was received with greater honor than was ever before paid to any person excepting those of the blood royal  a fate similar to that of gama attended alphonso albuquerque of albuquerque descended illegitimately from the blood royal of portugal he was sent out by his prince for the first time in   0  and in successive voyages showed himself to have been superior to any one of his nation before or after him both in the military and political line he was fitted by his talents to be the founder of a great empire we trace him almost every where from the red sea to the utmost limits of his indian expedition as far as sumatra and the distant malacca on his last voyage he was struck by the hand of death he directed his pilot to steer for goa the scene of many of his glorious actions he was informed on the way that he was recalled and two persons most disagreeable to him were to succeed to the government of india  lopez soarez exclamed he governor of india  it is he it could be no other don james mendez and james pereyra whom i sent prisoners for heinous crimes return the one governor of cochin the other secretary it is time for me to take sanctuary in the church for i have incurred the kings displeasure for his subjects sake and the subjects anger for the kings sake old man fly to the church it concerns your honor you should die and you never omitted any thing that concerned your honor  he died in      aged    off the bar of goa dies and was interred there but his corpse was not removed to its native country for numbers of years as is said at the instances of the citizens of goa who venerated his memory he died with the highest sentiments of piety even the gentoos and moors through devotion visited his tomb so highly and universally was he esteemed he was an inflexible lover of justice and of most polished manners yet his actions at ormus at calajate osorio i p p          and other places show how impossible it is to suppress an inborn and national barbarity  all the tract of country from cranganore almost to anjenjo a tract of about a hundred and twenty miles consists of multitudes of very low wooded isles formed by a thousand rivers that tumble from the ghauts this flat country extends thirty miles inland and has intermixed a great assemblage of lakes rivers and forests the whole marshy and most unwholesome it abounds with fish and game which makes cochin in that respect a most luxurious residence  a distemper prevales in these parts swelled legs supposed to arise from the badness of the water or from an impoverished state of blood from poor living its symptoms are a violent swelling in one and sometimes in both legs so that it is not uncommon to see them a yard in circuit round the ancle see the plate    in linscottans voyage  it is not attended with any pain but with an itching the swollen leg is not heavier than the unaffected the distemper is called the cochinleg and from the size the elephantleg no remedy has yet been discovered the dutch procure their water in boats from a distant place yet hamilton says that he had seen both men and women of that nation afflicted with the malady this destroys the hypothesis of its being the effect either of the water or of poor living  from cochin to the termination of the islands the coast is flat and so low as to be distinguished only by the trees or by the flags on the ensign staffs the sea clear of shoals and with good soundings porcah porcah on the island beyond cochin is a small dutch settlement coulang quilon or rather coulang is another now sunk into an inconsiderable place on the first arrival of the portuguese it was governed by a queenregent who ruled over a small principality the city was seated on a navigable river had an excellent harbor and its buildings were very splendid but its commerce had declined on the rise of calicut numbers of christians of st thomas were found spread over the country it was taken from the portuguese by the dutch in      the country was at that time also governed by a queen who resided at calliere an inland town nieuhoff was entrusted with a commission to her and found her a woman of majestic mien and excellent understanding nieuhoffs voyage in churchills coll ii p       to this place there continues a similarity of low and morassy country at a few miles distance to the south of coulang the coast immediately alters the land rises into high and precipitous red cliffs near them is good fresh water at anjenga anjenga a small settlement with a fort belonging to the english it is very bad and scarce the fort was built by the east india company in      they pay for the ground rent to the queen of the country by my frequent mention of the queen it should seem that a female reign in these parts was not uncustomary the trade of the neighborhood is pepper and a fine long cloth mr franklin p   remarks that this is the best place in india for intelligence and that very lately a post to several parts of india has been established a regular post says mr rennel p     is established throughout the parts of hindoostan subject to the east india company and also from calcutta to madras the postmen always travel on foot their stages are commonly from seven to eight miles and their rate of traveling within our own districts about seventy miles in the twentyfour hours  cape comorin cape comorin the most southern part of hindooslan is in lat   it is level low land at its extremity and covered with trees and not visible from the deck more than four or five leagues mr thomas daniell words are wanting to express the merit beauty and elegance of his present publication of the views in hindooslan to whom i am indebted for numbers of informations informs me that the lostiest part is the highland of comorin which is twelve hundred and ninetyfour yards high and quite smooth and verdant to the very summit near the base bursts forth a most magnificent cataract and near that is a choultry for the accommodation of travelers  a little to the northward is the termination of the ghauts which may be seen nine or ten leagues at sea this was the comar of arrian ii     where there was a castle and a port the sea adjacent was supposed to have been endued with peculiar virtues it was a great resort for the purposes of ablutions and lustrations by all such persons who had determined to pass a religious and solitary life the female sex performed the same rites written history had even in arrians time delivered a legend of a certain goddess having here performed the ablutions every month the district was called comari regio but this holy water reached says arrian as far as colchos the modern mingrelia al edrisi speaks p    of a comr insula and gives it a vast extent there is a little hill to the north of the cape which from the sea appears insulated possibly the nubian geographer might have received an account of that eminence mistaken for an island and its size exaggerated  cape comorin is the termination of the kingdom of travancore which extends along the western coast kingdom of trayancore from that of cranganore as far as this headland a hundred and forty miles in    0 it began to rise into importance by the abilities of its monarch who reigned forty years in giving audience to two ambassadors whom he foresaw would weary him with prolix harangues he cut the first short with this sensible remark  be not tedious says he  life is short he raised a fine army and well disciplined and meditated the conquest of malabar amidst all his great talents he mingled the weakness of being ashamed of his cast or tribe he wished to be a brahmin he ordered a golden calf to be made he entered at the mouth and came out at the opposite part this was his metempsychosis and he dated all his edicts from the days says abbe raynal of this glorious regeneration  this kingdom begins in lat  0    near cranganore the breadth is greatly contracted by reason of the approach of the ghauts toward the shore intersected by rivers and covered with thick woods it seems almost unconquerable the rajah whom i have mentioned gave his country additional strength by which he saved his successor from the oppression of the rising usurper ayder alli around his capital and chief province says the author of the war in asia i p     he suffered the woods to grow for a number of years till they formed an impenetrable belt of great depth this cut into labyrinths afforded easy egress to his people and rendered all attacks from without impracticable immured within this natural fortification he encouraged the cultivation of the arts and sciences he invited the approach of men of genius and knowledge he cultivated the friendship of

formerly in egypt and by preparing his own military stores casting cannon making gunpowder etc he rendered himself independent of foreign aid the subjects of his remoter provinces who to avoid the ravages of war had taken refuge within the woody circle now returned with their families and effects to their former habitations this mode of fortification he evidently copied from his wild neighbors the polygars but they live in almost a savage state while he adopted their plan to secure the cultivation of the mild arts of peace  even the approach to this difficult retreat was impeded by the famous lines of travancore lines of travancore which extend from the fouthern banks of the river of cranganore close to sea to the foot of the ghauts strongly fortified in their whole extent these proved the first check to the ambition of tippoo sultan he wished to provoke the rajah to begin hostilities in order that he might not be charged with being aggressor for several days from the   d to the   th of december      the sultans horsemen rode up to the rajahs lines and made use of every insulting expedient to draw the first act of hostility from the travancore troops but finding them aware of his artifice and that a detachment of english troops was stationed at some distance he at last gave way to his rage and on the   th of december attacked the lines by storm his troops had filled the fosse with cotton they passed by that means into the interior of the lines when by some accident the cotton took fire and the whole formed a tremendous blaze in their rear were the flames in front a furious enemy actuated by despair they fought with incredible valor out of fifteen hundred men only forty were taken the rest fell victims to the rage of the travancorian defendants mackensies sketch i p     tippoo from the outside of the lines was a spectator of the horrid carnage of his soldiers the nayrs pressed on him on all sides and being repulsed with disgrace and himself thrown from his horse in the retreat he is said to have made an oath that he never would wear his turban again till he had taken the rajahs lines and accordingly he prepared to attack them by regular approach diroms campaigns      on april       0 he completely executed his menaces he attacked the lines with such vigor that he made himself master of them totally destroyed this famous barrier and laid cranganore in ruins carried desolation through the country and put every opponent to flight mackensies sketch i p      the disgrace which tippoo suffered of the natrs was owing to three

of the great military casts the khatre sir thomas herberts travels  d edit p     he calls them cutteries meaning khatres  and support to this day the spirit of their ancestors they are excessively proud and are never known to laugh they are besides so very insolent to their inferiors that it is said if a person of the lower order dare to look at a nayr he may be put to death on the spot with impunity among the good qualities of the nayrs may be reckoned their great sidelity it is customary for them to undertake the conduct of christian or mohammedan travelers or strangers through their country the latter never venture without taking a single nayr with them who makes himself responsible for their safety even an old decrepit man or a boy is sufficient for the purpose nieuhoff in

enemy we offered our assistance to reduce it this he declined but after some prudent delay besieged it with his own people took and dismantled it that in future his subjects might depend on their own valor in the field for the defense of their country at the treaty of seringapatam marquis cornwallis generously stipulated for the security of the gallant rajah tippoo sultan grew irritated to a degree of phrenzy at the demand and broke off the actual negotiation with our general who began to renew hostilities tippoo finding a reluctance in his troops to defend the capital was compelled to accept the dictated terms p p          and the laurels of humanity and fidelity added new glories to the head of the conqueror  this account i have selected from the curious relation of the mysore

india but teems also with the spontaneous productions of all the richest spices of the east enjoying a fertile soil and temperate climate this mountainous country is a fund of wealth that requires only peace and commerce to render inexhaustible it is a beautiful scene to contemplate a delightful journey to the traveller but a most arduous march and formidable barrier to an invading army  from cape comorin i take my departure for the island of ceylon isle of calpentyn the nearest part of which the isle of calpentyn is about a hundred and fifty miles distant the intervening sea is the gulf of manaar which grows narrower and narrower till it reaches the fragments of the prior junction with the continent of which cape koiel a large promontory of the marawars and various rocks are parts the cape will be described in my progress from cape comorin along the eastern coasts of hindoostan  before cape koiel is the insulasolis of pliny lib vi    ramana koiel the isle of ramana koiel or the isle of the temple of the god rama founded near the edge of the water and on vast stones to break the force of that element rama had a right to a temple opposite to ceylon for he killed the giant ravanen king of that island and placed his brother vibouchanen on the throne rama was highly venerated in this country the capital of the marawars and the residence of the prince was named in honor of the deity ramanadabaram the passage between this island and the continent is called odioroa passage it is extremely short about five miles broad and not exceeding in depth three feet  from the eastern end of the isle of ramana koiel is a chain of rocks which runs quite across the narrow channel to the isle of manaar almost adjacent to the ceylonese shore the length is about thirty miles but the whole chain is frequently interfected by narrow passages so very shallow says dapres in his neptune oriental p    as to be navigable only by the small crast of the neighboring shore and that only in calm weather so disturbed is the channel in gales by a dreadful surf the little vessels that wish to make the passage go under manaar where they must unload pay duty to the dutch get their vessel dragged through the pass and take in their cargo on the other side it is very probable that this succession of rocks was part of an isthmus which in very early times had united ceylon and the continent for the water on each side of this chain does not exceed thirteen or fourteen feet pliny in the passage before cited takes notice of the greenish cast of this part of the channel of its being filled with shrubs that is with corals and of its being so shallow that the rowers often brushed off the tops with their oars  this chain of rocks is called adams bridge adams bridge the tradition is that our common father after his transgression was cast down from paradise and fell upon ceylon but that afterward this bridge was made by angels for him to pass over to the continent  manaar is as the name implies sandy the little channel is on the eastern side and defended by a strong fort garrisoned with a hundred men notwithstanding it is impassable for any vessels which draw more than four or five feet water it had on it seven churches built by the portuguese the natives were converted by st francis de xavier and still continue professors of christianity notwithstanding they have labored under many persecutions the pearl mussel is found in great abundance on this coast and the fishery has at different times been attended with good success since the dutch have become masters pliny says that the greatest plenty were found in his days on the coasts of tabrohana and toidis and perimula on the peninsula of malacca  a species of manati is certainly found here baldaeus manati a learned clergyman who resided long in ceylon describes it  churchills coll iii     so exactly that we cannot mistake the animal he intended here is a peculiar fish properly a seacalf of an amphibious nature the females have breasts and give suck and the flesh when well boiled tastes not unlike our sturgeon and might easily be mistaken for veal  from manaar is the very short passage into the great island of ceylon known to the ancients by the name of tabrobana ceylon i will not attempt to expose their mistakes in respect to extent and some other particulars as long as the identity of the isle is ascertained strabo mentions it in lib xv p  0   strabos account of noticing the aukwardness of the inhabitants in failing and fitting their masts in their vessels along the coasts are observed various amphibious animals among which he plainly includes manati some he compares to oxen others to horses and other land animals the dugung de busson xiii     tab lvi may possibly have been among them this strabo delivers from the account left by onesicritus a follower of alexander the great who sent him on a voyage to india where he informed himself of many things among which is no small share of fable or misrepresented accounts  mela speaks of this island as the part of another world melas and that it never was circumnavigated  pliny plinys lib vi c    gives us a large chapter on the subject of this island he not only gives the authority of megasthenes who had written a history of india and of eratosthenes a famous geometrician who pretended to give the circumference of ceylon but has drawn many lights from the four ambassadors actually sent from this island to rome in the time of claudius by accident a freed slave of a farmer of the roman customs in the red sea was driven to the coast of ceylon by a storm such an impression did he make on the king of the island by his favorable report of the romans that determined him to send these envoys from them many particulars were learned they were not sparing of any thing which tended to exalt the glory of their country they said that it contained five hunded cities the chief was palesimundum that had two hundred thousand citizens for other particulars i refer to the old historian more is beyond my plan  ptolemy comes next ptolemys who is particular as to the productions of this great island he mentions rice honey ginger beryls hyacinths and gold silver and other metals and he agrees with pliny about its producing elephants and tigers he also says the ancient name of ceylon was symondi but in his days it was called salice still in some measure retained in its indian appellative selendive the principal places named by the geographer are anurogrammum anurogrammum of which the cingalese say there are great remains in the vestiges of the ancient city anarodgurro  maragrammon the capital town which answers to the modern candy talacoris emporium and nagadiba prasodis sinus and numbers of other places ptolem geograph  which show how well known this island was to the romans either by their fleet from the red sea or their coasting traders from the western side of india i will only mention malea mons or the modern yale famous for the pascua elephantum ptolem geograph aelian not anim lib xvi c    bumasani pascua elephantum the great haunt of elephants and which were driven and probably shipped at a port still called by the dutch geyeweys of elephants van plaets and transported in vast ships to calinga the same  probably the same with the modern calingapatam a city and port on the coast of the northern circars  el edrisi p    el edrisi speaks of this island under the name of serandib and marco polo under that of seilam it is celebrated by each for its rich gems by mistake the nubian geographer places the diamond among them but all the rest it produces in high perfection and several kinds of aromatics or spices silk was also exported from hence in his days he speaks highly of the ruling monarch who had sixteen privy counselors four of his own people four christians four mahometans and four jews such was the moderation of this excellent prince he loved good wine which he procured from parthia and persia and dispersed among his subjects he was indulgent in this gift of heaven but a most severe enemy to incontinence  the portuguese were the first of the european nations who visited ceylon ceylon visited by lawrence almeyda it was discovered by laurence almeyda in   0  who was driven accidentally from his cruize off the maldive isles by the violence of the currents into a port called by the natives gabalican oforio i p      the ruling prince was as he is now styled emperor and is lord paramount over the lesser kings he is styled most great invincible and tailed wolfs ceylon p      the first of his race coming from siam with a tail a foot long pendent from behind his posterity in due time according to lord monboddos system shed their tails and became as capable of the arts of government as any european monarch whatsoever almeyda was received by the governor with the utmost courtesy he sent pelagio souza one of his officers to the royal residence at colombo where he was introduced to the emperor he met with a most favorable reception formed a league with his imperial majesty who agreed to pay emmanuel annually two hundred and fifty thousand pounds weight of cinnamon on condition that the fleets of portugal should defend his coasts from all hostile invasions it is well known that the portuguese soon after made themselves masters of the principal ports and engrossed the whole trade of the valuable bark the moors or arabs exerted every effort to prevent them from establishing themselves in ceylon this highly concerned the arabs who before that time were the sole venders of the cinnamon which they carried to suez from whence it was conveyed over the isthmus and from alexandria to all parts of europe all their endeavors were to no purpose that rich trade became monopolized by these new rivals  the dutch first landed here in   0  dutch land here and visited the emperor in      they received a formal invitation from the ruling monarch and in consequence appeared off the coast with a potent fleet they confederated with the king of ceylon and after a struggle of several years and after great bloodshed they expelled the portuguese whose power ended in the taking of colombo in      after a siege of seven months in which the portuguese exerted all that spirit and valor which originally made them lords of the indies the emperor repaid the dutch all the expense in cinnamon and other productions of the island and invested them with many privileges and in return found himself exactly in the same dependent state as he was before his victories the dutch fortified every one of his ports they have besides a grant of coast round the island twelve miles in breadth reckoning from the sea wolf p      his majesty maintains a magnificent court at candy but at any time his good allies by the sole interdiction of the article salt may make him and his subjects to submit to any terms they are pleased to dictate elscheskroon in wolfs book p       the form and extent of the isle of ceylon form of ceylon are very much undetermined the figure which is generally adopted in the roaps is that of a pear with the stalk turned toward the north the length from dondrahead south to tellipeli north is about two hundred and eighty miles the greatest breadth or from colombo to trincoli is about a hundred and sixty the latitudes of the two extremes in length are between    0 0 and      its extremes of longitude are     0 and     0  the island rises from on every side to the mountains which run in chains principally from north to south the highest and rudest tract is the kingdom of conde uda conde uda which is impervious by reason of rocks and forests except by narrow paths which are also impeded by gates of thorns closely watched by guards at the western skirt of these mountains soars hamalell and adams peak in the european language adams peak it rises preeminent above all the rest in form of a sugar loaf le brun ii p    gives a view as it appears from the sea on the summit is a flat stone with an impression resembling a human foot two feet long it is called that of our great and common ancestor the cingalese or aborigines of ceylon say that it is of buddo their great deity when he ascended into heaven from whom they expect salvation the mohammedan tradition is that adam was cast down from paradise we make his paradise an earthly one and fell on this summit and eve near judda in arabia they were separated two hundred years after which he found his wife and conducted her to his old retreat there he died and there he was buried and there are two large tombs to this day many votaries visit his imaginary sepulcher the mahometans out of respect to our common father the cingalese under the notion i have just mentioned is there not a trace of christianity in the opinion of the cingalese respecting buddo of the necessity of a mediator which they might have collected from the christians of st thomas here they light lamps and offer sacrifices which by ancient custom are given to the moorish pilgrims all the visitants are in places obliged to be drawn up by chains so rude and inaccessible is the way to this mount of sanctity  from this mountain rushes the great river mavilaganga ganges or ganges which passes unnavigable close to candy a very long and rocky course to the sea at trincomale  all the rest of the isle except some marshy flats adapted to the culture of rice are broken into thousands of hills beautifully clothed with wood the intervening valleys are often morassy or consisting of a rich fat soil but the fertility of the open parts is astonishingly great  the account given by ptolemy of the mineral or fossil productions is in a great measure confirmed minerals iron and copper are found here as is black lead a gold mine is said to be latent in one of the great mountains but the working prohibited by the emperor of gems the ruby sapphire topaz gems the electric tourmalin cronsledt ed magellan sect    and the cats eye or pseudopal and hyacinth are met with but what occasions the neglect of the mines and of the gems is the attention to the great staple of the island the important bark of the cinnamon doctor thunberg is very exact in his account of the gems of ceylon travels iv     they are dug up about matura and the liberty of search is farmed for no more than one hundred and eighty rixdollars a year amethysts and an infinite variety of crystals and crystalline gems are found in that neighborhood the account of my able correspondent well merits perusal  the inhabitants are the cingalese inhabitants these are aboriginal and differ totally in language from the people of malabar or any other neighboring nation their features more like europeans than any other their hair long most commonly turned up they are black but well made and with good countenances and of excellent morals religion and of great piety their religion is derived from buddo a proselyte of the great indian foe his doctrine spread over japan and siam as well as that of foe knox          kaempsers hist japan i      it consists of the wildest idolatry and the idols the objects of their worship are the most monstrous and phantastic the pagodas are numerous and many of them like several in india of hewnstone most richly and exquisitely carved the cingalese believe buddo to have come upon earth and that to him belonged the salvation of souls all human happiness say they proceeds from him all evil from the devil to whom he permits the power of punishment when sick they dedicate a red cock to that being as the romans did one to esculapius during the time he inhabited the earth they tell us that he usually sat under the shade of the ficus religiosa which in honor of him is called in the cingalese tongue budaghaha his religion is the established religion of the island  the civil government is monarchical government the emperor in the time of knox was absolute and clamed the most undisputable right over the lives and fortunes of all his subjects he was a most barbarous tyrant and took a diabolical delight in putting his subjects to the most cruel and lingering deaths elephants were often the executioners of his vengeance and were directed to pull the unhappy criminals limb from limb with their trunks and scatter them to the birds of the air or beasts of the field the emperors residence was at candy nearly in the center of the island but he was in knoxs time by the rebellion of his subjects obliged to desert that city the government is said by wolff p     to be at present very mild and regulated by the statute laws of the land the joint production of diverse wise princes and are considered as sacred by the cingalese it is possible that the tyrant in the days of knox had destroyed the liberties of his country which were afterward restored robert knox the author robert knox is a writer fully to be depended on a plain honest man who in      sailed in one of the east india companys ships to madras and on the return in      was forced by a storm into ceylon to refit when his father who was captain went on shore and with sixteen more of the crew were seized by the emperors soldiers and detained the captain died in a years time our author lived nineteen years in the island and saw the greatest part of it at length with difficulty he escaped and arrived safe in england in september    0 his history of the island and of his adventures were published in    0 and appears to be the only authentic account of the internal parts and the only one that can be entirely relied on  there is in this island a race of wild men called wedas wedas or bedas or bedas they speak the cingalese language but inhabit the depth of woods and the fastnesses of the mountains and are in all respects as savage as the domesticated animals are in the state of nature or barbari i suspect them to be what solinus polyhistor c    these may be the same with the wedas which solinus says made a trade of selling parrots to the romans calls barbari to distinguish them from other indians in a state of civilization for i think i have met with elsewhere the distinction between a wild people and others in a polished state of manners  these wedas wear their hair long collect it together and tie it on the crown of the head in a bunch their complexions are comparative to the other cingalese light they inhabit the depth of woods and their skins that way escape the effect of the burning sun they live entirely on flesh or on roots the first they either eat raw or dried or preserved in honey they live either in caves or under a tree with the boughs cut and laid round about them to give notice when any wild beasts come near which they may hear by their rustling and trampling upon them knox p     they are like them without law and as wolf page     says without religion knox p p       asserts the contrary the wilder sort never show themselves the tamer will enter into some kind of commerce with their civilized countrymen their dress is only a cloth wrapped round their waists and brought between their legs a small ax is usually stuck in the wrapper they are skilful archers and very nice in their arrows the heads are of iron made by the smiths of the civilized people they have no other means of bespeaking them than leaving near the shop a pattern cut out of a leaf with a piece of flesh by way of reward if he does the work they bring him more meat otherwise they shoot him in the night  after this account of the lowest of the human race elephant i fear i shall injure the half reasoning elephant on putting him on a level with such of our own species as have scarcely any of the reasoning particles left this island was celebrated by pliny lib viii c   for its race of elephants which were larger and more adapted for war than those of india he also gives the methods of capture lib viii c    they are at present taken in different manners and after being tamed are sent to the great annual fair at jaffanapatam the merchants of malabar and bengal have notice of the numbers and qualities of the elephants to be set up to sale sometimes a hundred are sold at one fair a full grown beast twelve or fourteen feet high will be sold at the rate of two thousand dollars  the manner of taking these huge animals is thus described by doctor thunberg iv p   0 who undertook a journey up the country to see what the dutch call an elephanttoil or snare which served for capturing and enclosing a great number of elephants the toil was constructed of stout cocoa trees almost in the form of a triangle the side nearest to the wood being very broad and augmented with slighter trees and bushes which gradually extended themselves into two long and imperceptible wings the narrower end was strongly fortified with stakes planted close to each other and held firmly together by ropes and became at length so narrow that only one single elephant could squeeze itself into the opening when the governor gives orders for an elephant chase on the companys account which happens at the expiration of a certain number of years it is performed in the following manner a great multitude of men as well european as cingalese are sent out into the woods in the same manner in which people go out on a general hunt for wolves and bears in the north of europe these diffuse themselves and encompass a certain extent of land which has been discovered to be frequented by elephants after this they gradually draw nearer and with great noise vociferation and beat of drum contract the area of the circle in the mean time the elephants approach nearer and nearer to the side on which the toil is placed finally torches are lighted up in order to terrify still more these huge animals and force them to enter into the toil prepared for them as soon as they all have entered the toil is closed up behind them the last time that elephants were caught in this manner their numbers amounted to upwards of a hundred and on former occasions has sometimes amounted to one hundred and thirty  the first care of the captors is to bring them out of the toil and to tame them for this purpose one or two tame elephants are placed at the side where the opening is through which each elephant is let out singly when he is immediately bound fast with strong ropes to the tame ones who discipline him with their proboscis till he likewise becomes tame and suffers himself to be handled and managed at pleasure this disciplinary correction frequently proceeds very briskly and is sometimes accomplished in a few days especially as the wild elephant is at the same time brought under control by hunger  the horses of the island are descended from the arabian breed horse these are kept in a wild state in certain islands called ilbas de cavallos they are at certain times forced into the ponds and rivers and caught by people who in the most dexterous manner fling over any part they please a noose these are sent to a fair immediately following the elephant fair and sold for large prices the peasants make no sort of use of horses but in their place employ the buffalo which they catch and tame for the cart and all their rural work wolf p   0   the species of deer are very elegant deer here are found the spotted axis hist quad no    the middle sized no    and the great no    called by the dutch elk as tall as a horse and the ribfaced no  0 with a tusk from each upper jaw pointing downwards  the little indian musk called meminna not larger than a hare is a native of this isle this has like the last its tusks  buffaloes are very common here wild and tame buffalo and are the only animals used here for rural economy  wildboars are very numerous and very fierce wildboar to fight an enemy to hunt the elephant and catch the wildhog are the three points of valor among the cingalese  monkies swarm here monkey the wanderow is a species mentioned by knox with a great white beard from ear to ear a black face and dark gray body there is a variety of the above quite white  the purplefaced no  0  has a triangular white beard purple face and black body  the rillow or rolleway no     is distinguished by the long hair on its head lying flat and parted they are as large as a bloodhound and are able to catch hold of a child and run up with it to the top of the loftiest trees and after admiring it for some time they will lay it gently down on the place they took it from these are very numerous and very audacious and will rob the corn fields and gardens in the very face of the owners and as soon as they are driven out of one end of the field will come skipping into the other and fill both their bellies and hands of late years it has been discovered by a russian tanner that their skins might be dressed and made into shoes  the tailless macauco no     and the loris no     are found here  the jackal jackal no     is numerous here as it is all over india  the tiger tiger no   0 is too frequent in ceylon these animals are shot with crossbows placed in their haunts pliny says that tigers and elephants were made by the people the executioners of their kings whenever they had offended them they appointed a solemn hunting match and exposed their monarch to the fury of those beasts  bears bear no  0  are very common even in this neighborhood of the line wolf says they are large and black and feed on honey as they do in europe  the civet civet no     is frequent in ceylon  the mungo or indian ichneumon no     is found here this weesel is famous for its antipathy to the naja or cobra de capello and for its instant recourse to the antidote to the fatal bite on its receiving a wound from that dreadful serpent the plants it seeks relief from are the ophiorrhiza mungos strychnos colubrina and ophioxylon serpentinum the last is figured in burman zeylan     tab    and in rumph amboin vi    tab xvi  the naja is found all over the hotter parts of india naja and is distinguished by a mark on the back of the head of the form of a pair of spectacles also by the power of dilating the skin of the head into the form of a hood from which it has gotten the name of the cobra de capello or hooded snake they grow from four to eight or nine feet in length and are justly dreaded by the indians their bite is generally mortal yet there is a remedy if timely applied that has its efficacy the mortal effect sometimes takes place in a quarter of an hour sometimes in two or three hours in its fatal sacculus it seems to contain the poisons of the seps one of lucans deadly list manant humeri fortesque lacerti colla caputque fluunt calido non ocius austro nix resoluta cadet nee solemn cera sequetur  an universal gangrene takes place and the flesh falls from the bones convulsions sometimes bring on death according to the degree of virus on which the symptoms depend  this species never distends its hood but when it is agitated by some passion such as fear or rage it then quits its creeping attitude raises the fore part of the body a third of its whole length spreads its hood and moves its head around darting a fiery glare to every part often remaining in all other respects immovable or its motion becomes slow steady and cautious so that in india it is held to be the emblem of prudence it is also held in veneration equal to a deity the legends of the country are full of strange tales relating to its actions they call it nella pambou or the good serpent it is often represented twisted round the deities under the name of calengam in memory of the victory of one of their gods over an enormous naja  this certainly is not the deaf adder the indian jugglers especially those of malabar have a power of taming these dreadful animals and instructing them to dance after the inharmonious and slow air of their flagelets the serpent first seems astonished then begins to rear himself and sometimes by a gentle motion of the head and with distended hood seems to listen with pleasure to the notes this is said not to be peculiar to those which are accustomed to the exercise but even the snakes newly taken will show the same disposition and fling themselves into the same attitudes  nieuhoff gives a plate of these jugglers and their snakes and kaempfer a much better  i shall mention here two or three indian serpents described by m dobsonville notwithstanding i am uncertain of their native place one is called in french le javclot a species of jaculus of a green color five or six feet long and most fatal in its bite it generally lurks extended or suspended among the branches of trees so situated that they either can dart on their prey such as little birds or insects or remove themselves with see voyages aux indes orient par m sonnerat tom i p p         tab          a spring from bough to bough it does not appear that they attack mankind but rather glide from his approach but the indians have the same notion as the arabs have of its being a flying serpent  the poisonsnake is only two feet long and very slender poisonsnake and freckled with pale brown or red its bite brings death as rapidly as lucans volucer serpens our author saw a gentoo bit by one the sufferer could only give a shriek and advance a few steps when he fell down dead  the burningserpent seems to possess the dreadful poison of three species burningserpent it gives by its bite the symptoms of raging fire like the torrida dipsas it causes at other times the blood to flow through every pore like the hoemorrhois at other times to cause swelling like the prester and to incite racking pains at length by a happy numbness death brings kindly relief to the miserable sufferer the reverend edward terry voyage in      p     saw a criminal put to death at amedavad with all the effects of the bite of the dipsas and of the prester this species

something had pricked his finger before his master could reach him he fell down dead on the floor perhaps the same with the poison snake  crocodiles are very common in ceylon crocodile and sometimes

feet its flesh is eaten and thought to be medicinal  the lacerta gekko is a species justly dreaded for the poison which exudes even from the ends of its toes and which infects to a degree of fatality any thing it passes over its urine and saliva are equally dangerous its voice which is acute like that of a cricket flings a whole company into consternation the indians obtain from it a deadly poison

many of the above mentioned animals are in all probability common to the continent of india and doubtlessly many more which have escaped the notice of travelers there is all the appearance of ceylon having been united with the continent and that the gulf of manaar was once solid land the maldives and laccadives seem likewise to have been fragments of the once far extended continent  birds birds which have the locomotive power so strongly in their formation have a less chance to be local than the preceding class the ornithology of my friend latham is as unerring a guide as human imperfection can produce in respect to the birds i shall here and elsewhere only point out those on whom nature has impressed any characters worthy of philosophic attention  to shun prolixity i avoid giving in general descriptions of either beasts or birds in respect to the first i refer entirely to the third edition of my history of quadrupeds in which i flatter myself the reader will find them amply treated as to the general enumeration of birds it will be found at page    of my indian zoology with references to mr latham or in cases where any species are common to great britain to the british zoology the list of the known quadrupeds of india its fishes reptiles and insects are also given in the same work  there are several sorts of falcons in this island falcon many of which are trained

this passion and made them an article of commerce the wedas are most skilful archers and probably do the same these birds inhabit the forests in which says solinus c    the trees were so lofty that

ind zool tab viii a warbler on account of its wonderful nest my own account of its economy taken from the indian zoology page    deserves attention it is thus introduced  had providence left the feathered tribe unendowed with any particular instinct the birds of the torrid zone would have built their nests in the same unguarded manner as those of europe but there the lesser species having a certain prescience of the dangers that surround them and of their own weakness suspend their nest at the extreme branches of the trees they are conscious of inhabiting a climate replete with enemies to them and their young with snakes that twine up the bodies of the trees and apes that are perpetually in search of prey but heaveninstructed they clude the gliding of the one and the activity of the other  the brute creation in the torrid zone are more at enmity with one another than in other climates and the birds are obliged to exert unusual artifice in placing their little broods out of the reach of an invader each aims at the same end though by different means some form their penfile nest in shape of a purse deep and open at top others with a hole in the side and others still more cautious with an entrance at the very bottom forming their lodge near the summit  but the little species we describe seems to have greater diffidence than any of the others it will not trust its nest even to the extremity of a slender twig but makes one more advance to safety by sixing it to the leaf itself  it picks up a dead leaf and surprising to relate sews it to the side of a living one its slender bill being its needle and its thread some fine sibres the lining feathers gossamer and down its eggs are white the color of the bird light yellow its length three inches its weight only three sixteenths of an ounce so that the materials of the nest and its own size are not likely to draw down a habitation that depends on so slight a tenure  two flycatchers of uncommon form flycatcher

having the coverts of the wings of a fine pompadour color is one proof i mention this in particular on account of its history but more so for that of the magnificent tree on which it usually alights to seed  this species swarms in certain seasons in the island of ceylon ficus indica particularly when the fruit of the ficus indica or broad leaved waringen is ripe they alight in vast multitudes on that grotesque tree and are caught with birdlime by the natives who prepare the twigs against their arrival mr loten informed me that when he was governor in ceylon one morning at break of day he saw some hundreds entangled on the boughs of the great waringen tree before his window and ordered one of his ceylonese servants to take them off they are excellent food and are often shot by the europeans they are observed never to alight on the ground but to perch on high trees and give this the preference on account of the fruit it is for the same reason the haunt of various other birds but notwithstanding the sweetness of the fruit it is neglected by mankind  this tree immediately attracted the attention of the ancients onesicritus the philosopher who followed alexander the great in his expedition into india commanded his galley and recorded his actions first gives us an account of this wonderful tree for this at lest he does not merit the severe remark made on him by strabo lib xv p  0   who seems incredulous to all he says possibly there may be other points in which he may be also defended this tree rises high in the air then drops its boughs which take root and successively create new stems till a vast extent is covered with the arched shade it is even said to form of itself a forest of arched avenues and a labyrinth of alleys impenetrable by the rays of the vertical sun perhaps the extent may be exaggerated we will content ourselves with giving the dimensions of one near manjee west of patna the diameter of which was from three hundred and sixty three feet to three hundred and seventy three the circumference of the shadow at noon eleven hundred and sixteen that of the several stems which were no more than fifty or sixty nine hundred and twentyone hundreds of people may find a comfortable retreat beneath its foliage such is the account given by the veracious mr marsden in page     of his excellent history of sumatra  pliny lib xii c   gives the fullest description he was best qualified for by the time he lived the romans got tolerably well acquainted with the country his account is elegant and faithful speaking of the trees of india he says  ficus

islands it inhabits most parts of the continent even as high as lat       n supposing it to be yet found on the hydraotes the modern rauwce it was imported from india into greece as aelian says by the barbarians by which he must mean the natives of the country of that bird a male and female were valued at athens at a thousand drachmae or l      0 samos possibly was the next place they were known at where they were preserved about the temple of juno being birds sacred to that goddess but their use was afterward permitted to mortals for gellius in his noctes atticae c    commends the excellency of the samian peacocks  but they were known in judaea many years before the days of alexander the monarch first in all human wisdom and who shined preeminently in the knowledge of natural history imported them in his tharshish navies which made a three years voyage to procure for solomon the rich productions of the east and the objects of the study he so fondly cultivated there can be no doubt but that the birds imported were peacocks not ethiopian parrots as has been conjectured natives of a country nearly bordering on the very sea from which his navies took their departure apes ebony and

enumerate numbers of kinds but they only vary being taken from trees of different ages or growing in different soils and situations it may be found in malabar sumatra etc but is depretiated by another name cassia and canella to our unspeakable loss cinnamon or cassia cinnamomum was a more dignified name the ancients speak of it under that title in such high terms that the dutch wisely retained the name which gave it greatest respectability our countryman the late tailor white esquire in ph trans vol l p   0 and mr combs resident in sumatra in page     are entirely of opinion that cinnamon and cassia do not specifically differ mr whites account is accompanied with some very good figures of the leaves of the former  the celebrated bark is the inner and is reckoned the most perfect when taken from trees of seven or eight years old if they grow in a wet slimy soil but those which grow in the warm white sand of the valleys come to maturity in five years seba says that the ages of the trees are fourteen fifteen or sixteen years it is the heat which gives the bark that quilled form in which it comes over to us especially the smaller and more delicate sort which is taken from the smaller branches the bark is first freed from the external coat when it is on the trees is then cut lengthways stripped off dried in the sand and so becomes merchantable  the barkers of cinnamon are brought up to the trade and are called chialiases the account given by mr eschelskroon of the management is most authentic from him i shall transcribe what will be highly satisfactory to the readers at page     of wolfes account of the isle of ceylon he begins thus  the time for barking the tree commences in the months of june and july and sometimes even in august now as soon as they come out of their villages for that purpose every district sends a detachment of dutch soldiers and another composed of the natives themselves called lascaryns along with them in order to guard the wood where they are to work and this partly on account of the roving cingalese mountaineers which sometimes fall on the barked cinnamon and make it their booty but still more for the purpose of having an eye upon the chialiases themselves that they may not be able to conceal any of the cinnamon and afterward carry it off  the bark that is peeled during the day must be carried every evening to the dutch guard belonging to their respective districts there cleansed well dried and made up into bundles and afterward taken in close cases to the factory where they are weighed and received by the company as payment of the assessment or tax imposed on these people by government a man must be a very good hand indeed that can gather thirty pounds of cinnamon in a day whence it is easily calculated how many persons it will take to gather ten or twelve million pounds and that too of the best for what is brought in is looked over before it is weighed and the refuse of it burned  at the time for gathering this drug the company are obliged to draw out a cordon of seventytwo miles in circumference and as there are a great many of these corpse de guard it follows that the company must pay a great many europeans as well as cingalese these cinnamon barkers are under the command of a captain called a malabadde and are distributed into four different classes all the chiliases must be ready at all times to work at the governors command for on him it depends how much is to be barked and delivered in and this again depends on the demand for it from europe  this important article of luxury was well known to the ancients the greeks called it  and sometimes  or casia lignea and  to the bark from the pipelike form it assumed by the rolling up we have applied the word cassia to the inferior cinnamons of malabar and sumatra  the romans called it cinnamomum but generally with some addition the xylocinnamomum or the wood we are told by pliny was sold for twenty denarii or twelve shillings and eleven pence per pound the juice or expressed oil at one thousand denarii or l      0 the daphnoides or isocinnamon seems not to be thought the genuine kind yet sold at the price of three hundred denarii or l       the same price as the true cinnamon the cinnamomum camocans was the expressed juice of a nut and perhaps a different article from the true cinnamon was sold for no more than forty asses or two shillings and sevenpence the ancients according to pliny esteemed as we do at present the cinnamon of the young twigs it was chiefly made use of as a perfume either as an ingredient for their unguents or to rub their bodies with in form of oil they appear to have been ignorant of the tree that produced it as well as the country they supposed that it came from that part of aethiopia which bordered on the troglodytes pliny says they bought all they could of their neighbors but even mr bruce who would certainly do all the honor he could to aethiopia never mentions it among his botanical enumerations pliny talks confusedly of a long voyage made with the cargoes of this precious article and of the crossing of vast seas of the cinnamon being under the protection of the god assabinus and of its never being cut without his permission i dare say that the cinnamon and cassia came then as it does now from the malabar coast and taprobone or ceylon and that the merchants crossing the sinus aethiopicus in search of it induced the roman naturalist to make aethiopia its native country pliny in lib xii c xix and other parts of his not hist treats largely of this tree   the ancients give a most romantic account of these trees that of their being guarded by a dire species of bat fighting cruelly with their sharp claws and by flying serpents one was the enormous bat of

esquire for my acquaintance with the zoology of ceylon and various particulars respecting its natural history that it would be ungrateful in me not to pay the full tribute of praise to his memory i became acquainted with him a few years after his arrival in england in      and long enjoyed the valuable friendship of a man of the strictest honor integrity liberality simplicity and gentleness of manners he was by birth a dutchman a native of utrecht he went to india in the year      where he exercised several of the highest offices at batavia and in the islands of ceylon and celebes with the highest credit he alleviating the cares of his important duties with the fullest cultivation of the liberal arts at colombo he established a botanical garden and in every place made the pleasing study of natural history a principal object he brought over with him a large collection of drawings done with equal neatness and accuracy some by the natives others by europeans whom he found in the country i was indebted to his friendship for copies of several but the greater part he at my request liberally communicated to peter brown an ingenious artist a dane by birth who engraved not fewer than twentyone and with several others from different places published a splendid work in      with the title of new illustrations of zoology under the patronage of my late worthy friend marmaduke tunstal esquire and myself  from the same collection was formed my indian zoology begun in      and left a fragment it was resumed and published more complete in one volume quarto in    0 i refer the reader to the preface to that work for an account of its rise and progress  mr loten returned into europe in      and coming into england where he lived several years in      he married his second wife laetitia cotes of the respectable house of cotes in shropshire several years after which he returned into holland and died at utrecht on february         aged eighty and was interred in st jacobs church in that city during the whole of my acquaintance with him at frequent periods he endured the most severe spasmodic complaints in his chest which for months together disabled him from the use of a bed i should not have mentioned these circumstances was it not to add to his other virtues those of unfeigned piety and resignation unexampled amidst the trial of severest misery  in the north aisle

into two or perhaps more isles divided from the greater by a very narrow channel the other side is faced by rocks and shoals and affected by most variable currents  the city of jaffanapatam stands on the western side of one of the isles jaffanapatam this retains its cingalese name most of the other places in the neighborhood have been changed to dutch when the city was taken from the natives by the portuguese in    0 they found in the treasury the tooth of an ape so highly venerated by the people of ceylon that immense sums were offered for its redemption but in vain to destroy this piece of idolatry the viceroy ordered it to be reduced to powder and then burnt apes are in many parts of india highly venerated out of respect to the god hannaman the apegod hannaman a deity partaking of the form of that race with the addition of heads of bears who rendered the god vitchenou great services in this very isle slaying giants and performing so many wondrous deeds in vol iii p     of churchills collection is a long detail of his exploits there is a wonderful extravagance in the indian mythology the warmth of their climate creates ideas filled with the strangest imagery the tooth was probably worshipped as one belonging to his godship  most of the eastern side of ceylon is guarded with sand banks or rocks between the bay of trincomale and the sort calirauw is the country

was wrested from us by his active and gallant rival suffrein  on september  d the former came off trincomale and to his great surprise found the french colors flying on all the forts suffrein with a superior squadron sailed out of the harbor secure as he thought of victory our brave admiral and his officers enraged at the loss of the place eagerly accepted the offer of combat the contending admirals displayed every proof of courage and skill suffreins ship was reduced to a wreck and he obliged to remove his flag to another by some neglect of ours we lost the disabled ship night alone terminated the battle suffrein retired into trincomale crowding in without order thus secured hughes left him reluctantly and sailed for madras with his shattered squadron our loss was inconsiderable in common men for it did not exceed fiftyone killed and three hundred wounded in officers we suffered severely the captains lumley watt and wood fell in the action the loss of the french was enormous four hundred and twelve men were killed and six hundred and seventysix were wounded the carnage on board the gallant suffreins ship the hero was unheard in any fight of any age it was an unparalleled carnage many of the french captains had behaved ill six were broke and sent prisoners to the island of mauritius and thus ended the unavailing slaughters in the indian seas  the ganges of ptolemy runs

provided with flags by which signals either of internal commotions or the appearance of ships are conveyed all along the coasts even to colombo the seat of the dutch government almost every one of

sir william james baronet communicated by lady james sir william james embarked in a sea life at twelve years of age he was more than twenty years at sea before he got the command of a ship he was with sir edward hawke in the west indies in      as a junior officer some years after he commanded a ship in the virginia trade in her he was taken by the spaniards in the gulf of florida and carried a prisoner to the havannah his sufferings after his captivity will be related hereaster  in the beginning of      he went to the east indies as chief officer of one of the east india companys ships and performed two voyages in that station in      the east india company appointed him to the command of a new ship called the guardian equipped as a ship of war in her he sailed to bombay to protect the trade on the malabar coast which was much annoyed by the depredations of angria and other pirates with which those seas swarmed  during two years he was constantly employed in convoying the merchant ships from bombay and surat to the red sea the gulf of persia and up and down the malabar coast from the gulf of cambay to cape comorin he was frequently attacked on this service by the different piratical states at one time when he had near seventy sail of ships and vessels under his charge he was assailed by a large fleet of angrias frigates and gallivats full of men with the guardian bombay grab and drake bomb ketch he engaged the enemy and kept them in close action whilst his fleet got safe into tellicherry in this conflict he sunk one of the enemies largest gallivats and obliged the rest to seek for safety in gheriah and severndroog  about the beginning of the year      sir william was appointed commander in chief of the east india companys marine forces and hoisted his broad pendant on board the protector a sine ship of    guns on april  d      he was sent with the protector guardian bombay grab and drake bomb with some gallivats to attempt such of the ports belonging to angria which lie to the northward of gheriah his principal fortress and capital  the chief of these fortresses was severndroog where angrias vessels refitted and took shelter when they could not reach gheriah it was well defended by batteries along the shore and the entrance of the harbor was secured by a strong castle on which were mounted seventy pieces of cannon angrias people considered severndroog as their strongest hold next to gheriah sir william having reconnoitred the place and informed himself of its strength brought his ships with a leading wind close to the castlewalls and by a steady welldirected fire whilst the drake threw in her bombs soon brought on a parley and in less than three hours the governor surrendered the castle and the vessels in the harbor from hence sir william went to fort victoria which quickly followed the fate of severndroog and the next day four other forts were numbered in his conquests all these falling was a severe blow to angria who had a short time before attacked a fleet of dutch ships under the protection of a  0 gun ship and a frigate the dutch fleet was dispersed and the  0 gun ship and some of the merchantmen were brought in great triumph to gheriah  when sir william returned with his victorious fleet to bombay he found admiral watson there with three lineofbattle ships and some frigates etc the government of bombay consulted with the admiral about means to destroy the powers of angria and the mahratta states joined in the confederacy for they had suffered by his depredations  sir william was sent with his little squadron to reconnoitre gheriah a place represented to be almost impregnable from the sea he judiciously stood close in to the walls under the cover of night and with his boat sounded and examined the channels leading to the harbor and outer road in the daytime he stood in within gunshot of the walls and having in two days made himself perfectly master of the enemys strength he returned to bombay this piece of service he performed with so much promptness and skill that he received the thanks of the governor and admiral and they were so well persuaded from his report of the practicability of the enterprise that no time was lost in equipping the ships and embarking the troops  the squadron formed off gheriah the  0th february      sir william in the protector led the squadron to the attack in one division whilst another division of frigates led the bombketches in another line a heavy and tremendous sire began on our part from the ships of the line whilst the shells were thrown with great success from the bombs into the harbor where all angrias ships were hawled for safety these were soon set on fire by the bombs the fire from the castle and batteries soon slackened and before the evening set in the castle surrendered and gheriah and all its dependencies fell into our hands thus shortly ended an enterprise which for many years had been in contemplation by the european governments in india but which was never before attempted from an idea that no force sufficient could be brought against the walls of this castle lord clive at this time a lieutenant colonel commanded the land forces  on the malabar coast soon after this he fell in with a french ship from mauritius very much his superior in men and guns she was called lindienne after a smart action she struck and sir william carried her in triumph to bombay  sir william james in an eminent manner displayed his nautical abilities by showing that in despite of a contrary monsoon a communication between bombay and the coromandel coast may be effected in cases of exigency the tracks are laid down in mr arrowsiniths map of the world   this passage was attempted by sir william in the first instance and he accomplished it in nearly as short a time as it usually was done in the favorable monsoon it was of the utmost moment that he succeeded at the time he did for by it he consirmed to admiral watson then in the ganges the intelligence of the war with france and brought to his assistance  00 troops by which the admiral and colonel clive were enabled in march      to take chandenagore the chief of the french settlements in bengal  in effecting this passage the commodore crossed the equator in the meridian of bombay and continued his course to the southward as far as the tenth degree and then was enabled to go as far to the eastward as the meridian of atcheen head the n w extremity of sumatra from whence with the n e monsoon which then prevaled in the bay of bengal he could with ease gain the entrance of the ganges or any port on the coromandel coast  in the beginning of this narrative it was mentioned sir william had suffered shipwreck the uncommon hardships he and his people encountered were as follows  after they were released from the spanish prison at the havannah they embarked in a small brig for carolina the crew of the brig and sir william and his people amounted to fifteen the second day after putting to sea a very hard gale of wind came on the vessel strained and soon became so leaky that the pumps and the people bailing could not keep her free and at length being worn out with labor seven of them with sir william got into the only boat they had with a small bag of biscuit and a keg of water the vessel soon after disappeared and went down they were twenty days in this boat without a compass their biscuit soon got wet with the sea which for two days made a breach over the boat a snuff box sir william had with him served to distribute their daily allowance of water and after encountering every difficulty of famine and severe labor on the twentieth day they found themselves on the island of cuba not ten miles from whence they had been embarked out of a spanish prison but a prison had no horrors to them the spaniards received them once more into captivity and it is remarkable that only one out of the seven perished though after they got on shore but few of them had the use of their limbs for many days  in the year      sir william returned to his native country the east india company presented him with a handsome elegant goldhilted sword with a complimentary motto expressive of their sense of his gallant services soon afterward he was chosen a director and continued a member of that respectable body more than twenty years in which time he had filled both the chairs he was fifteen years deputy master of the corporation of trinity house a governor of greenwich hospital served two sessions in parliament for west looe and on the   th of july      the king was pleased to create him a baronet  he planned the reduction of pondicherry during the american war and received a rich service of plate from the india company as a testimony of their sense of his skill and judgment in that affair  on the   th december      sir william died aged    in the year following a handsome building was erected on his estate in kent near the top of shooters hill it is built in the style of a castle with three sides and commands a most extensive view the lowest room is adorned with weapons peculiar to the different countries of the east the room above has different views of naval actions and enterprises painted on the ceiling in which sir william had been a considerable actor the top of the building is finished with battlements about sixty feet from the base the top of the battlements are four hundred and eighty feet above the level of shooters hill and more than a hundred and forty feet higher than the top of st pauls cupola  on a tablet over the entrance door is this inscription this building was erected mdcclxxxiv by the representative of the late sir william james bart to commemorate that gallant officers achievements in the east indies during his command of the companys marine forces in those seas and in a particular manner to record the conquest of the castle of severndroog on the coast of malabar which fell to his superior valor and able conduct on the  d day of april mdcclv   of sir william it is said by a person who knew him intimately near thirty years and was well acquainted with his professional abilities that as a thorough practical seaman he was almost without an equal  as an officer he was brave vigilant prompt and resolute patient in difficulty with a
