proposals for recovering persons apparently dead by drowning and suffocation from other causes  published by order of the governors of the dispensary  newcastle printed by s hodgson        at a meeting of the medical society held the  0th of november the following pages were read and approved of and a printed copy ordered to be sent to each member with a request that he would offer in writing to the society on tuesday the  st of december every objection alteration or improvement which may occur on a careful perusal  proposals for the recovery of persons apparently dead by drowning etc the reports of several establishments on the continent as well as of the humane society in london have fully proved that persons apparently dead from drowning or suffocation from other causes may by proper means be restored to life but whilst the success which has attended these establishments must give pleasure to every person interested in the cause of humanity yet it is to be regretted that the means of restoration have not been more publicly understood and more generally adopted  the frequent instances of death by drowning which have happened upon the river tyne and the unsuccessful attempts of recovery have afforded the strongest proofs that the methods of restoration have not been known to the public or have not been speedily or properly applied  in order to give relief to persons in such unfortunate circumstances in this town and neighborhood the governors of the newcastle dispensary have established a department of their charity on the following plan for the recovery of the vital motions when suspended by drowning and to render this department more useful they have also extended it to the methods of restoration in other cases of apparent death  plan  st the governors of the dispensary have undertaken to publish in an extensive manner such remarks on different kinds of apparent death and such methods of treatment as shall be approved of by the medical society of newcastle  d they will engage proper accommodations at some public or other houses near the river at newcastle north and southshields at howdon dock and lemington for the reception of drowned persons  d the instruments and medicines necessary for the purpose of restoration enclosed in a proper box shall be kept at the receivinghouses that the medical assistants may procure them without delay  th medical gentlemen residing near the places where accidents from drowning usually happen shall be engaged to give their assistance  th a premium of one shilling shall be given to the messenger who shall bring the first surgeon to the assistance of the drowned person  th the medical assistants shall be empowered to distribute a reward not exceeding five shillings to the persons they shall employ to assist in the methods of recovery provided they persevere in the means recommended for four hours or upwards  th if the unfortunate person be in ability and recover it is expected that he shall defray the expense of his accommodations or if he cannot be restored the same is expected from his relations remarks on different kinds of apparent death introduction   the medical society of newcastle in compliance with the request of the governors of the dispensary have investigated the nature of apparent death arising from the causes which become the object of the preceding plan with care and attention and in the following remarks they have chiefly studied conciseness plainness and precision that the public at large may understand a subject in which they are so peculiarly interested   apparent death consists in a total though temporary cessation of all the powers of motion and sense to be more particular the lungs cease to act the heart and arteries to beat and the brain and nerves to diffuse their energy it therefore only differs from real death in this that the living principle is not extinct but only lies dormant which sometimes spontaneously but more frequently and certainly when excited by proper means again becomes active in consequence of which all the functions of life are restored   the common opinion that life deserts the body as soon as the breath ceases is not confined to the vulgar alone but notwithstanding the instances of recovery from apparent death is still belleved by many of the more discerning part of the community as this opinion has been productive of the most dangerous consequences the society wish to impress the public with the following truth that the living principle in every case of death keeps possession of the body for some time at least after all the actions of life have disappeared nay probably it never entirely leaves the body so long as any degree of animal heat remains in the internal parts   by proper attention to these circumstances    the society flatter themselves that persons suddenly and apparently dead especially from the causes to be afterward enumerated will for the future not be considered to be really dead till such time as the methods of restoration have had a fair trial   but whilst the society endeavor to animate the public to use every exertion to recover those apparently dead they do not wish to conceal the great uncertainty of a successful termination in drowning especially the methods of treatment prove unsuccessful from the person lying too long under water from his being suddenly seized with other diseases or being in a state of intoxication at the time of the accident and from various other causes but in such dangerous situations if one in fifty can be restored it will amply compensate for many fruitless attempts if however any person conceive this to be a small proportion let him but for a moment consider if this one should happen to be his own son or a beloved friend with what raptures he would extol the means which had averted the most poignant distress on the nature of apparent death from drowning and on the most effectual methods of recovery   from various experiments instituted by different members of the society the following appearances have been observed to take place in drowning to which the attention of the reader is requested as not only pointing out the nature of the death but the methods which ought to be employed to effect a recovery    when an animal is kept under water in a few seconds it begins to emit its breath forcibly so as to occasion air bubbles this emission of air from its lungs is followed with as strong a desire to draw in air and in these efforts it commonly inspires water as it was thought of consequence to ascertain this point a cat six weeks old was frequently immersed in a strong solution of copperas and as frequently allowed to come above the surface to inspire in order to imitate what frequently happens in drowning it was at last brought up before it was dead and instantly strangled upon dissection the frothy fluid in the lungs and the lungs themselves became as black as ink upon adding a teaspoon full of infusion of galls to the former and moistening the lungs with a little of the same infusion the experiment with the same result was repeated on a young whelp  its struggles in a few minutes become imperceptible and it falls down motionless upon taking it out of the water provided only eight or ten minutes have elapsed after all its struggles are over the nose and mouth appear remarkably pale the eyes do not protrude and the pupils though they nearly retain their natural luster are quite dilated all sense and motion both external and internal except a slight contraction of the right side of the heart are now lost and if no means of recovery he made use of the body gradually becomes cold and with the loss of heat the heart loses the power of contraction    upon dissection no fullness in the vessels within the skull nor any disease in the brain or its membranes are to be found the lungs also appear sound are generally about half distended but sometimes more when the animal is frequently allowed to come to the surface of the water so that he may inspire a quantity of frothy fluid by drowning a large old cat and a kitten of four weeks old in a solution of copperas one ounce of frothy fluid was found in the air vessels of the lungs of the former and one dram and a half of the same fluid in the latter by adding a strong infusion of galls the fluid in both became black and as near as could be ascertained the quantity of solution of copperas in the lungs of the former amounted to two drams and in the latter to two scruples but in one experiment made by another member of the society the water in the lungs of a drowned whelp of five weeks old was much more considerable and water was also found in its stomach  consisting of mucus with a little of the water in which the animal was drowned in every experiment except one was squeezed from the lungs    the rightside of the heart is full of black blood and the large veins going out from this side of the heart through their whole course to the middle of the thighs the armpits and almost to the jaws are full of blood of the same color the leftside of the heart is almost empty which is also the case with the whole of the large arteries except the trunks of the artery which enters the lungs which is commonly filled with blood the external blood vessels are empty and the muscles commonly look as white as if the animal had been bled to death   0 upon the whole it appears    that no injury is done to the organization of the vital parts but that the heart and large veins in its neighborhood are distended with blood whilst every other part seems in a great measure to be drained of that fluid nor are these circumstances invalidated by the appearances which have been observed in some bodies of drowned persons who are never opened till many hours after death for although in a few the vessels of the brain have been found full of blood yet generally this organ as also the lungs have been found in a sound state neither does the prominent or bloodshot eye the swelled bloated face or the lividity of the skin which are so often observed in drowned persons who have been long under water prove any thing more than that the blood after death had drained to depending parts     from what has been advanced in the three preceding paragraphs it appears that the first cause of the suspension of the vital motions in drowning is the stoppage of respiration in consequence of which the circulation cannot be carried on and the blood therefore is accumulated in the rightside of the heart and in all the large internal veins with this stoppage of the circulation the brain loses its energy the body becomes cold and with the total loss of heat it may be reasonably supposed that the principle of life is extinguished although not immediately connected with the subject the society cannot help entering a caution against the hasty custom of laying out persons supposed to be dead in great sinking of the strength especially in the end of acute diseases patients frequently lie in a state exactly resembling death if the bedcloaths be removed the heat on which the vital principle depends will soon be dissipated and every spark of life destroyed by not attending to this circumstance it is to be feared that many have been actually killed who by a different treatment would have recovered      from this view of the subject the most likely means to restore persons apparently dead by drowning will consist  st in renewing the action of the lungs without which the accumulation of blood about the heart cannot be removed nor the heart itself be brought into proper motion and  d in supporting a due degree of animal heat without which the vital principle cannot with effect exert its influence     to restore the action of the lungs it is indispensably necessary that they should be inflated when the person has not been long under water perhaps blowing air into the mouth or nose with a wooden pipe may be all that is necessary to put them into motion but in many cases it will require great skill to inflate them effectually as the directions for doing this with instruments will be given in another place see the appendix paragraph        0     it would be improper to enlarge on them here it must however be observed that the inflation ought not to be done with violence but so as to imitate natural easy respiration and as in many cases the inflation ought to be continued for one or two hours it will be necessary to employ a pair of bellows but it must be observed as soon as the pulse returns the inflation should be gradually lessened and in a little time totally laid aside     by artificial breathing    judiciously and assiduously employed not only the frothy fluid already taken notice of   which renders the recovery from drowning more uncertain than other cases of suffocation will be expelled but the heart will most likely be put into motion by which the accumulation of the blood there and in its neighborhood   0 will also be removed and the circulation restored     at the same time that the measures recommended    are assiduously employed other assistants should be endeavoring to restore and to keep up a due degree of animal heat perhaps the speediest method of doing this were hot water always in readiness would be to put the patient into a warm bath but as this cannot be speedily procured but more especially as it interferes with other essential applications the body must be gradually brought to a proper heat by placing it on a warm bed or mattress and by the use of general frictions with warm clothes for more particular directions see the appendix i  the frictions however should be at first moderate and performed only with a view to restore heat and not force the blood toward the heart which in drowned persons is generally found too much distended   0     if the body has been taken out of the water in frosty weather especially if it has been afterward long exposed to the air the heat at first should be applied in a very low degree and if the thermometer be under the freezing point and the body when stripped feel cold and nearly in a condition with those that are frozen it will at first be indispensably necessary to make use of frictions with snow or cold applications as heat in such cases has been found pernicious in a little time however heat must be gradually employed     upon the whole great care and nicety ought to be observed in the application of heat which in every case ought to be proportioned to the powers of life this is well elucidated by mr hunter in the following quotation  from observation and experiments it appears to be a law of nature in animal bodies that the degree of external heat should bear a proportion to the quantity of life as it is weakened this proportion requires great accuracy in the adjustment while greater powers of life allow it greater latitudes i was led to make these observations by attending to persons who are frostbitten the effect of cold in this case being that of lessening the living principle heat must at first be gradually applied and proportioned to the quantity of the living principle but as that increases you may increase the degree of heat if this method is not observed and too great a degree of heat is at first applied the person or part loses entirely the living principle and mortification ensues this process invariably takes place with regard to men animal economy p              although the recovery of drowned persons depends almost entirely upon the methods recommended        yet when the body is in a condition to be acted upon cordial and invigorating medicines such as throwing brandy and water into the stomach and intestines peppermint water ether or spirit of hartshorn diluted with water may prove useful auxiliaries see the appendix ii paragraph     but the same moderation in their use must be observed as has been recommended in the application of heat     the means for recovering the motion of the lungs and animal heat should often be continued for several hours for it appears from the reports of the humane society that in a very great number of cases one two and even four hours were perseveringly employed before the first signs of life appeared in many cases of complete recovery recorded in the humane society the persons were under water twenty thirty one forty and one fortyfive minutes and in these cases the restoration as might be expected was tedious    0 electricity being the most powerful of all stimulants it has been recommended by several ingenious authors a fothergill henly hunter kite  and according to the reports of the humane society has been found serviceable in drowning it ought therefore to be tried when the heart cannot be brought to act by the means mentioned    shocks therefore may be transmitted through the heart the head and the spinal marrow but they ought neither to be employed so gently as to produce no effect nor so violently as to do mischief     the society being of opinion that bleeding can be seldom employed as the means of recovery refrain from recommending it in the beginning but when life returns and the pulse will bear such an evacuation it will frequently become indispensably requifite to remove determinations to the head and to the lungs which often take place from an irregular distribution of the blood to these organs     as the remarks which have been already offered will apply with a few exceptions to other cases of suffocation the society shall briefly discuss the remaining part of the subject  apparent death from hanging    in hanging the external vessels bringing back the blood from the head are immediately compressed while the blood is still carried on in the internal arteries the windpipe is soon after shut by the cord the ingress of air prevented in consequence of this the face becomes red and livid and the person or animal is speedily carried off by suffocation     on dissection the blood vessels of the brain in several animals that were strangled appeared turgid with blood but no other disease was observed within the skull the lungs were in general quite collapsed free from frothy fluid and in every respect sound the heart and large adjoining vessels exhibited exactly the same appearances as in drowned animals    0     from this view      it would appear that together with bleeding from the jugular veins or cupping in the neck the other methods of treatment ought to be the same as recommended for the recovery of drowned persons  apparent death from noxious vapors    noxious vapors arise from various sources from fermenting liquors from the fumes of charcoal of burning quick lime and of metals during their calcination from opening vaults drawwells wells of ships and ditches long shut up from the damps in mines etc     in the coalpits of this neighborhood there frequently arise two kinds of noxious air the first usually termed the chokedamp is a natural fixed air which being specifically heavier than atmospheric air occupies the bottom of the mine the other is called the firedamp which is a natural inflammable air and being ten times lighter than common air occupies the top of the mine     from some experiments which would be tedious to relate it appears that these vapors    occasion a suspension of the vital motions and death by entering the lungs and excluding the atmospheric air and in other respects if the firedamp be excepted when it takes flame the firedamp frequently takes flame by which means the pitmen are often miserably burnt at the same time others are sound without signs of life and as they are erroneously supposed to be burnt to death by the flame and not suffocated by the vapor methods of restoration unfortunately are seldom applied  no farther injury is done to the body     the bodies of animals suffocated in these vapors exhibit the following appearances  the limbs remain flexible for a long time the eyes retain their luster the temperature of the body and even a heat higher than the healthy standard in some instances continue several hours after death this is particularly the case with animals suffocated in the steams of charcoal and in them the blood remains fluid and even highly florid in animals suffocated in fixed and in inflammable air although the limbs continue flexible the blood was not florid the vessels of the brain were found turgid in animals suffocated in these vapors the lungs were sound the heart and adjoining vessels were equally turgid as in those which were drowned or hanged   0 the most effectual means of recovering the vital actions when suspended by noxious vapors consist in inflating the lungs as soon as the body is removed to the open air in sprinkling the face and when the heat is above the standard of health even the whole body with cold water in persons suffocated by the fumes of charcoal advantages have arisen from rubbing the body with snow but here the heat should be only diminished in proportion to the powers of life and therefore if the body become cold equal advantage will accrue from the gradual application of warmth the state of the vessels of the brain    would seem to require bleeding and accordingly it has been recommended portal  blood may therefore be taken from the jugular veins or from the neck    in all other respects the methods of treatment will be the same as in those who are drowned  apparent death from smothering and the want of respiration in stillborn children    children from inattention or other causes are frequently smothered in beds when not overlaid the functions of life are solely suspended by breathing confined air from experiments upon brutes it appears that in this case the lungs are collapsed and except the accumulation of blood in the heart and large vessels in the neighborhood no injury is done to the rest of the system if the means of recovery therefore be not too long delayed after the lungs and heart have ceased to act there will be great hopes of restoring the patient if the body be too hot as is commonly the case it should be exposed at first to a current of air the lungs should be immediately inflated and afterward in every other respect it should be treated conformably to what has been recommended in suffocation from drowning     in such stillborn children as come into the world in other respects with a healthy appearance great hopes may be entertained from inflating the lungs if too much time have not been lost but this process ought to be continued assiduously for some hours by blowing air through a quill or any small tube inserted into the mouth the temperature of the body should at the same time be kept up by a due degree of warmth and the blood propelled from the surface to the heart by proper frictions  appendix i containing rules to be observed by the spectators in endeavoring to recover persons apparently dead by drowning  i    as soon as the body is taken out of the water a person must inflate the lungs of the patient by blowing into the mouth or which is better into one nostril through a wooden pipe wooden pipes are always in readiness at the receivinghouses  a roll of cappaper or any thing else that will effectually convey the breath up the nostril whilst the other nostril together with the mouth is closely shut that no air may pass otherwise than by the pipe at the time of blowing through the pipe another person in order to prevent the air getting into the stomach must gently press the projecting part of the windpipe backwards when the lungs are filled the person must remove his hand from the mouth and press the belly and breast so as to let the air pass out when by these means the lungs have emptied themselves the blowing through the pipe is to be repeated in the same manner so that natural breathing as far as possible may be imitated if the lungs cannot be by these means distended it most probably will proceed from some stoppage about the opening into the windpipe which will in all likelihood be removed by pulling the tongue forwards  ii    at the same time that air is blowing into the lungs other bystanders should be employed in stripping off all the wet clothes and in rubbing the body dry with flannel or such cloths as can be procured the body should then be wrapped in a warm blanket or in the spare garments of any of the spectators  iii    if upon a short trial these methods do not succeed in restoring the breathing the body ought to be immediately carried to the nearest receivinghouse or if it be at any distance to the nearest building in removing the body great care should be taken to keep it in an easy posture with the head and shoulders a little raised it will be best conveyed in the arms of two persons while a third takes care that the neck be not too much bent forwards or to one side if the body be taken out at a considerable distance from any house it should be laid in a cart upon straw on one side with the head and upper parts raised and in this position a brisk motion will do no harm  iv    the body being now conveyed to a house it should be placed upon a warm bed or mattress and covered with a warm blanket the head and chest should be considerably raised but not so much as to slide down in which position the body should be kept during the whole of the future attempts of recovery it will now be again indispensably necessary to renew the endeavors to restore life by blowing air into the lungs as directed in rule i and by restoring a moderate degree of heat by gently rubbing the body with warm flannels or other warm cloths and by applying bottles full of warm water wrapped up in flannel to the feet  v    the means of cure recommended in rule i and ii and more particularly mentioned in the end of rule iv must be continued for a long time perseverance is absolutely necessary and it is often only after two three or four hours of uninterrupted labor that the first signs of life appear     although the above methods of cure ought to be immediately begun by any of the bystanders of discernment and have been often attended with the happiest effect yet as the application of the means requires skill and dexterity and as it is frequently absolutely necessary to employ instruments to inflate the lungs one or two of the medical assistants should be called in without delay the loss of every moment or the misapplication of the means is attended with the utmost danger to the unfortunate object who is approaching nearer and nearer to a state from which he cannot recover  appendix ii containing a description of a pocket case of instruments for the recovery of persons apparently dead with the methods of using them     many ingenious instruments have been recommended by authors and adopted by different establishments in their endeavors to recover the apparently dead but the medical society have preferred the improvements lately made upon them by mr savigny of london both on account of the utility of the instruments and their being contained in a case which is extremely portable some management however is required to adjust the instruments to the different purposes but a careful inspection of their component parts mr savignys original case contained an apparatus for injecting the fumes of tobacco which the society have not recommended  and attention to the following directions will render their application easy     when air from the lungs of a healthy person is to be used the ivory mouthpiece is to be screwed on one end of the flexible tube of red leather and the ivory nozle upon its other extremity by which means a blowpipe is completely formed which is to be inserted into the nostril and to be managed in the same manner as the wooden pipe    but as atmospheric air dephlogisticated air discovered by dr priestly preserved in bladders has been recommended by several authors but as the expansion of the lungs seems to be the principal object of the inflation the society think it of little importance whether dephlogisticated or atmospheric air be used and indeed those who have recommended the former were never able to recover any animal with it when atmospheric air had been found ineffectual should be in most cases preferred for inflating the lungs properly the following adjustment of the instrument will be required the conical part of the hollow screw by means of the brass winch is to be firmly screwed into the muzzle of any common pair of bellows proper bellows are always in readiness at the place where the instruments are lodged  the ivory mouthpiece of the flexible tube is then to be removed and the other end of the conical screw to be fitted in its place the instrument being thus completed a proper person stationed at the head of the body is to pass the tube into the nostril and sustaining it there with the forefinge he is to compress the other nostril with his thumb and the mouth with the remainder of the same hand that no air may pass out with the other hand he is to make a suitable pressure upon the prominent part of the windpipe to prevent air passing into the stomach the medical director is then to work the bellows which ought at one play to throw in a sufficient quantity of air to fill the lungs when they are properly distended the hand should be removed from the mouth and the lungs are to be assisted in emptying themselves by compressing the belly and chest the same process is to be repeated for some time that as far as possible the manner of natural respiration may be imitated if the air do not pass into the lungs so as to distend them completely it probably arises from the aperture of the windpipe being shut which may generally be remedied by bringing the tongue forwards   0 but if farther impediments occur to the inflation of the lungs the ivory nozle    must be removed and the silver instrument in the form of a catheter screwed on the tube of red leather in its place the instrument being thus completed the medical director should place himself on the right side of the patient and introducing the forefinger of his left hand at the corner of the patients mouth he should push the point of it behind the epiglottis and using this finger as a directory he must enter the tube with the other hand at the left corner of the mouth till the end of the instrument has past beyond the point of his forefinger and the instrument is then to be suffered to fall rather than to be pushed into the glottis the bellows are then to be worked as in the former process        if the methods proposed    0 fail of inflating the lungs an opening into the windpipe may be made and certainly ought to be tried as a last resource the silver instrument should be introduced into the opening fitted with the bellows and to be worked in the same manner as recommended  0 by which means air will be certainly thrown into the lungs     the next instrument recommended is the elastic tube of black leather for conveying medicines into the stomach the small end must be carefully introduced down the gullet into the stomach and any liquid cordial such as spirits ether volatile liquor of hartshorn or oil of peppermint properly diluted with water must be poured in small quantities into the other end of the tube and if the liquor do not descend readily blowing upon it will make it pass into the stomach     the next instrument is a large bladder which may instantly be connected with a proper pipe contained in a division of the case a clyster prepared with brandy gin or the oil of peppermint largely diluted with warm water must be injected     although from the sympathy which subsists betwixt the stomach and whole system and the irritability remaining long in the intestines much benefit may arise from the processes      as auxiliaries yet no means unless for a very short space must interfere with the more important articles of inflating the lungs and restoring animal heat     the last instrument proper phials for ether volatile liquor of hartshorn and oil of peppermint are also contained in the case and likewise phosphoric matches and a wax candle when a light cannot be otherwise readily procured is a thermometer upon mr hunters principles which is extremely well calculated for ascertaining the natural heat remaining in the body and for regulating the application of artificial heat the freezing point is marked on the stem by a scratch on the glass and the divisions upon an ivory scale embracing the glass are easily seen through the stem  by applying this instrument to the body and finding the temperature considerably below   o artificial heat should be gradually applied till it be uniformly heated to   o or  00o but if the external parts of the body be so chilled that the thermometer sinks below   o cold applications will be at first necessary and in this case the heat should be afterward increased slowly and gradually  the instrument may likewise be easily introduced into any cavity so as to ascertain the degree of internal heat which remains in general for some hours after the external surface is cold therefore if it be pushed three or four inches up the rectum the presence or absence of life may be ascertained by the rise or fall of mercury in the tube  conclusion    in composing the preceding pages many authors have been consulted but the society cannot conclude without expressing their great obligations to the following dr cullen dr monro dr hawes mr hunter mons portal dr goodwin and mr kite the two last of whom received the prize medals of the humane society for the best original essays on suspended
