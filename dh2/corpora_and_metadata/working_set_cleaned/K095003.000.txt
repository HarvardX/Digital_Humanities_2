adjourns some day next week this fair committee shall detail the rest then let the monsters if they dare protest the miniature picture act i scene i mr camply s study mr camply writing servant knocks at the door mr camply come in  enter servant sir here is a young gentleman come to wait upon you says his name is revel i think   mr camply revel lays down his pen and rises revel ha sir harry revel perhaps desire him to walk in exit servant i have not seen him since he was ten years old his father was the worthiest of men and i must return some of the attention he bestowed on me to his son   enter eliza camply dressed in a baronets gown and cap bows affectedly several times then salutes her brother a la francoise puts her cap up to her mouth to hide her laughing and pretends to cough mr camply sir harry revel i believe i did not know that you were come to the university or i should certainly have waited upon you first but you will easily dispense with ceremony for as you have been partly educated abroad the formalities of an english college must appear rather strange to you   eliza interrupting yes faith strange enough and all the old fogrums with their faces as starched and as prim as their bands  why we all move by clockwork au pied de la lettre indeed my good sir for the clock directs all our motions   mr camply i fancy my good cousin is a great puppy aside the melancholy event of your good fathers death must make every place appear dull to you sir harry but i hope a change of scene and the attentions of your family    eliza family attentions and family affairs are equally my aversion cousin  and really the queer fancy of my fathers ordering me to oxford in his will after i had been for three years at an academy in france is such an outoftheway thing that i am half comforted for his death by it already   mr camply indeed sir harry   eliza besides cousin ten thousand a year a title and a pretty wife are comforts that    mr camply are you married sir harry   eliza o no not yet but i shall be in a short time apropos as i must soon leave this country for a little time while i go to see the old mansion i must beg you will give me two or three franks for my intended    mr camply does she inhabit this country then sir what a giddy mortal aside  eliza going up to one side of the table lays down the franks sits down her brother goes and fits in the chair he first rose from on the other yes sir only miss loveless you know  here    mr camply loveless miss loveless  embarrassed takes up and lays down a pen eliza yes cousin  what makes you stare so because the lady has had sense enough to refuse all the squires of oxfordshire is that any reason why she should not accept of me   mr camply a vain wretch aside and affects a laugh oh no  no  no i give you joy sir harry i think you are well fitted to each other but are you sure sir it is the same miss loveless i mean   eliza i cannot possibly guess what miss loveless may run in your head but i mean the great heiress miss loveless who lives here in oxford   mr camply indeed   eliza indeed and what of that  takes snuff affectedly mr camply affects to laugh o nothing at all nothing at all   eliza flings herself back in her chair laughing ha ha ha my dear brother ha ha i shall die ha ha i shall die at your poor disconcerted visage ha ha   mr camply rises and goes up to her my sister as i hope to live why my dear bess what whim now when we parted at breakfast your eyes were red and your spirits were gone i thought at dinner to have seen you the same sighing melancholy creature and here you are all life and spirits and in breeches too what does all this mean explain explain my little oxonian   they come forward eliza leaning on his shoulder eliza not all life and spirits neither my dear brother you know i have not seen belvil this week  we have quarrelled   mr camply i suspected as much but i would not ask pray what could you quarrel about you told me you had given him your picture and that he intended to make a demand in form to me   eliza all this was true but for all this i have not seen him this week  heigh ho and i really fear i shall never see him as my lover again   mr camply how then you really love him my poor bess   eliza my dear brother indeed i do it is that and your being in love too that has made me put on this dress   mr camply me you dream i in love i ridiculous what could make you take that into your head   eliza shaking her head o my good sir all your coldness and indifference cannot impose upon me that animal that belvil has taught my heart to read into the hearts of others   mr camply well and what knowledge do you get from mine   eliza why i have read that you are deeply aye deeply in love with that weathercock flirtilla loveless   mr camply poh poh nonsense   eliza very good sense for it is true   mr camply supposing it is true what is that to your quarrel with belvil   eliza why this dress shall reconcile me to him that is if he deserves it and make miss loveless fling herself at your head or at your feet or    mr camply into the river sooner i really do not understand you   eliza you know she has flirted with and refused half the country the only two persons who have not sacrificed their time or inclinations to her coquetry are you and belvil now i think she likes you   mr camply o that is quite impossible  for i never speak to her   eliza so much the better nothing piques a coquet like your obstinate silence brother pray let me ask you one question if you do not feel afraid of her why should you not speak to her   mr camply why why  poh what a question i will tell you betsy i like her too well to permit her to exercise her power over me she is so handsome and so capricious that she would pretend to like me for one day send me to the devil the next and laugh at me for loving her all the rest of her life   eliza i have not visited her these six years because i saw you avoided her but her repeated refusals convince me she likes some one and that you are that one her blushes whenever you are named sufficiently explain   mr camply that may be pride hurt    eliza aye aye pride to be sure   mr camply well but belvil and you  i am all impatience   eliza he said  it was yesterday seen night he said  miss loveless was prodigiously handsome and very agreeable why no quoth your foolish sister no quoth that creature  no she is very witty i observed that she was a great flirt and that if i married him he should never speak to her he said that was very silly i grew angry he laughed me into a passion and my passion sent him out of the house   mr camply this was all foolish enough and then you were sorry  hey eliza sighs did he take your picture with him   eliza o yes he had it hung about his neck but that is not the worst part of the story i find he has been ever since with miss loveless six days with that odious flirtilla now as i could deceive you i am certain of improving upon them as sir harry revel then will i go there make violent love to her rout belvil humble her vanity and when i have deprived her of her whole train of admirers and her airs i will offer you as a    mr camply heyday sister not so fast when it is time i can offer myself but i do not approve of your going unless the aunt is in the plot   eliza i have wrote to her she disapproves much of her nieces conduct and is very glad to enter into any scheme that is likely to alter it come do not look so grave  wish me success and belvil true going returns pray contrive to make belvil believe i am gone to london if he should call   mr camply i will  exit eliza i wish her success indeed if she can get the better of that intolerable spirit of coquetry and love of admiration that so entirely possesses miss loveless i shall fling myself at her feet and think myself too happy to secure her peace of mind and honor for ever   is going but is met by eliza eliza brother here is mrs arabella loveless but lord mackgrinnon is with her therefore pray contrive to call him out of the way   mr camply i will   servant announces mrs arabella and lord macgrinnon give me leave to present my cousin sir harry revel to you and my lord i must beg the favor of you as you have been some time at oxford to introduce him to your societies   lord macgrinnon  mr camply and mrs arabella talk apart i shall be very happy to make him acquainted with some of the most learned and discreet gentlemen of the different colleges particularly with my worthy friends at baliol he will meet with good cheer as well as with cheerful and witty people and aw for nothing for i am at home wherever i go   eliza that i dare say camply pulls her by the elbow i hate his northern dialect aside to her brother o my lord every one must be glad when you do them the honor of making their houses your home bowing   lord macgrinnon aside a pert sheeld i fancy bows   mrs arabella pray mr camply have you not built a new hothouse lately to tell you the truth my visit was partly to your new plants but chiefly to our new neighbor here as his worthy father was a particular friend of mine i wished to ask him some questions that    mr camply if lord macgrinnon will take a walk round the shrubbery with me by the time we return i imagine your business with sir harry will be over   lord macgrinnon i will attend you with great pleasure   exit mr camply and lord macgrinnon eliza how do you think my new character fits upon me dear madam if under this disguise i can be of any service to you and find out mr belvils way of thinking in regard to your niece i shall be too happy   arabella smiling as to mr belvils way of thinking i dare be sworn my niece has no share in it   eliza indeed   mrs arabella yes indeed but my dear miss camply what am i to think of my niece she has given mr belvil just the same encouragement that every other suitor has met with lord macgrinnon too is upon her list  and yet they seem all to be far from her heart   eliza smiling is there no one do you think that is near it   mrs arabella o no if there was any particular person whom she meant to please she would not permit herself such universal coquetry   eliza my dear madam looking round there is no man can hear me all women are born coquets and nothing but a great passion for one object can cure that natural propensity we all have to coquetry   mrs arabella surely good sense might cure it   eliza good sense good sense only strengthens the foible as it increases our power over mankind  but to our point is there no one among your nieces train of admirers whom you should wish her to prefer   mrs arabella none mr belvil is not her lover  lord macgrinnon is a proud scotchman who praises her beauty and talks of the delights of love from morning till night but i suspect his views are interested from the questions he has asked other people concerning her estate her money her plate her houses  in short whatever his intentions are the secresy he involves them in bespeaks them to be of no good kind   eliza perhaps when sir harry revel appears as a serious rival we shall find out his plan  but madam do you think miss loveless hates my brother   mrs arabella would to heaven your brother did not dislike her  he would be a friend and protector to any woman that could please him   eliza then set your heart at rest about him i know he loves her though he disapproves of her conduct and if you will take the excuse of a fiddle tomorrow night to call in your neighbors by way of my brothers coming to your house as if it was a natural thing i will take care to bring matters to such a crisis that your niece shall be obliged to confess a preference to my brother if she feels it which i suspect   mrs arabella you seem to be a connoisseur in the language of looks i that live with her never suspected as much   eliza she never names him i dare say   mrs arabella more than that i think she generally turns off the conversation when he is named you see miss camply this is a bad sign    eliza an excellent one rather lord my dear madam you seem never to have taken the trouble of peeping into your own mind you are so perfectly unacquainted with that of our sex in general  and   laughing mrs arabella i do not know which delights me most her philosophy or vivacity my ignorance proceeds not from my not searching into my own heart but that no one has taken the trouble of asking if i had one or not for you know miss camply i am an old maid  laughing eliza taking her hand and so would i be one too if at your time of life that title would sit upon me with so much good humor and dignity  i think i hear my brothers voice at a distance remember that you are only to announce me as sir harry and persuade your niece that i miss camply am gone to london and that you will have a dance tomorrow night   mrs arabella i shall certainly not forget any part of a scheme which is likely to join our families into one happy group   eliza kisses her hand your are an excellent being    enter lord macgrinnon and mr camply mr camply what making fine speeches cousin    lord macgrinnon not making love surely to such an antiquated gentlewoman   eliza  aside to lord macgrinnon why not my lord   lord macgrinnon i would no more squander my breath than i would my money unless i were to get cent per cent interest for it   eliza i dare say not true scottish economy  i hope not to reap a cent per cent interest there my lord but receive through other hands interest surpassing the principal   lord macgrinnon other hands he does not mean the niece sure he he what the niece hey   mrs arabella now mr camply may not i see these plants i mentioned   mr camply certainly gentlemen will you walk   eliza we will follow you presently cousin   exit mr camply and mrs arabella lord macgrinnon how do you like the university sir harry   sir harry i dont know i suppose it is like all other universities  we young fellows leave in them all the little learning we are ever possessed of and carry no sort of knowledge out of them which can be of any service to us during the rest of our lives  how should we  we drink port  drive stage coaches  and laugh at the old dons  pshaw  pray my lord how do you like miss loveless is she not very handsome   lord macgrinnon handsome eneugh and trowth a believe what am teld oher that she is got aw the different pairts of geud breeding at the best scheuls but one of her greatest accomplishments is her fortune   eliza pshaw dirt mere dirt my lord i have heard much of her high spirit and contempt for our sex  for women in general  egad i like her for it  what do you think my lord is likely to soften her into love beside ten thousand a year and a tolerable figure   lord macgrinnon if he does mean to attack her i will mislead him aside she has had so many fine speeches made to her that i believe nothing but neglect would move her  i will make him behave quite rude to her and then she will hate him aside pretend not to see her tak na notice of her beauty rail against the whole sex and i will warrant she is your awn   eliza seems to muse upon it umph  indeed   lord macgrinnon and i will feed her vanity which in good truth as they say is her only weakness i woul cram it till it shall overflow all her good sense  take this with you sir harry i believe she has a great deal of pride but na vanity at all na na vanity at all i think    eliza that is a scotch lie now he has some design in that aside no vanity my lord why the world attribute vanity to her as the only shade to her perfections  now swear to your lie sawney aside   lord macgrinnon upon my credit i never saw any thing like it pride she has and a great deal and my advice can only come from my desire of being of some sarvice to you   eliza bowing but laughs much obliged to you my lord have i not some reason to suspect your advice for i am told you are one of her lovers   lord macgrinnon mere jest or calumny sir harry na na na macgrinnon ever married a woman that had na title  indeed miss lovelesss fortune might make a mon forget she was not noble if he might have it aw without any lawyers interfering but not me sir harry na i will na be the first of my family to set the example of marrying only a simple gentlewoman   eliza so you think it would be very foolish for any one to marry without getting the fortune entirely into ones own hands   lord macgrinnon most surely and in truth sir harry women are come to such a pretty highflying pass nowadays that ruin and beggary are the only things that can keep a wife within the bounds of decency why ye hear of nathing but divorces na i should be sorry were i to give my name to any woman that if she chose to play the devil i must return one sixpence of her money for separate maintenance or that she should exact an allowance from me  na na sir harry keep the power and the pence together in your awn hands   eliza and you would have my wife love me as the indians worship the devil through fear   lord macgrinnon hey trowth i a think fear is the strongest had we ha of mankind or womankind   eliza i must inform you my lord that i am perfectly acquainted with woman i judge of the whole sex by one whose mind i thoroughly possess   lord macgrinnon possess in trowth and suppose you do you possess a riddle that is aw a riddle na na sir harry womens minds are weak guided by the impulse of the moment  here and there a flash of wit but na judgment    eliza i could spit in his scotch face aside   lord macgrinnon hey what may ye be muttering pray sir   eliza i say the whole sex are much obliged to your lordship i am quite of a different opinion my lord and as i was telling you if i was a woman myself i could not be better acquainted with the sex than i am and i imagine it is the unjust usurpation of all their natural rights and liberties which men are possessed of that makes our sex  i say that makes women my lord women run into such errors   lord macgrinnon why if you was a woman yourself you could not plead better for them than you do   eliza i love them all i respect i honor them   lord macgrinnon i love them too but as to respect and honor   shakes his head eliza in short my lord if i succeed with miss loveless all the business i shall give her family will be to settle her whole fortune upon herself   lord macgrinnon a downright feul aside   eliza entirely in her own power that she may feel totally independent of me and free as air that i may be certain nothing but her own heart and inclination gives me her time and attentions   lord macgrinnon aw that is mare than i intend  such liberty as that may tempt her  na na sir harry you are quite wrong   eliza wrong or not such are my ideas and i shall follow them as fast as possible  runs out lord macgrinnon and i shall follow you as fast as possible i hope at least he will take my advice in trying to pique her pride and make her so angry that i may gain time to get her consent and to make mine upon my own terms  for if once i have her fortune she may go and hang herself for what i care   end of the first act act ii scene the drawing room in miss loveless s house mrs arabella and miss loveless sitting on each side of a table upon which mr belvil is sitting with a book which he shuts and turning to miss loveless says  so you do not admire this charming poem of henry and emma    miss loveless no indeed that emma you admire so much is a most unnatural creature  so meanspirited  so servile  so humble  in short no woman ever thought as prior makes her think   belvil yes i know one that did aside   miss loveless hey what do you mutter between your teeth   belvil i say i believe i know one woman whose manner of thinking might have served as a model for emmas mind   miss loveless the sentimental grave miss camply perhaps   mrs arabella i wish you were as grave my dear niece   miss loveless thank heaven my dear aunt your wish will never come to pass  a formal  prim  demure  lord aunt i dare say poor soul she will die an old maid   mrs arabella if she does then it will be from choice and not from necessity   miss loveless  to mr belvil apropos mr belvil it is reported you are the charming swain she preferred to any other   belvil embarrassed o faith madam miss camply and i were brought up together and  therefore  it is no wonder that  that   walks from the table and says aside what a foolish dog i am   miss loveless aside he certainly is over head and ears in love with me  what a delightful thing it will be to torment that prude camply and perhaps pique her insensible brother   enter a servant with a note to the aunt servant from mr camply madam   mrs arabella after having read the note my dear i will return presently i will just go and answer this  exit miss loveless what can that be rises and aside   belvil aside a note from camply  perhaps his sister has complained of me i am a silly puppy for here am i making love to a woman i do not care about and perhaps shall entangle myself in such a manner that i shall not know how to retreat  without feeling the least pleasure in the pursuit too what a cursed fool    miss loveless approaches and taps him on the shoulder with her fan what deep in thought mr belvil come i will guess the subject of that reverie   belvil my reveries can have but one subject and you must be too well acquainted with your own merit not to know it   miss loveless pshaw you are a flatterer  do you know mr belvil that i am tempted nowandthen to believe that you are upon the point of turning politician   belvil pray why madam   miss loveless because you fall into such unaccountable reveries then i am sure you must be studying about some matters of importance  perhaps you are a patriot and are forming a new system of government  lard there will be no bearing you if you turn reformer   belvil ha ha no indeed miss loveless  when i am perfectly satisfied with a reformation of my own private conduct i may then perhaps advise the community at large  but now  ridiculous  ha ha    as he laughs miss camply s picture hangs out of his bosom miss loveless ha what is that   belvil what   miss loveless a picture as i hope to live why mr belvil this is a very odd fancy of yours never to have shown me that  nay i insist upon seeing it   belvil how unlucky aside o certainly unties and gives it her it is only a picture that i had given me one day in joke  nothing serious  a joke  he  a joke  he  that is all what an imprudent puppy i am aside   miss loveless a joke is that all o then i will try him aside so it is only a joke    belvil a joke that engrosses all my serious thoughts though aside   miss loveless oh if you study your speeches i would not give one farthing for them   belvil remember that i only lend you that picture and that you must return it as soon as possible  pray compare that face with your own and imagine if possible you can that it can even be looked at with patience except indeed to serve as a foil   miss loveless i will try him aside well now i protest it is prettier than i thought i will keep it with your leave to examine the beauty at leisure as you are so indifferent about it i will put in my pocket till i have an opportunity of comparing it with the original he looks confused aside   belvil how imprudent i have been forces a laugh o certainly  keep it  fling it away  do just what you please with it  he he    reenter the aunt mrs arabella my dear niece mr camplys note was to inform me of the arrival of sir harry revel at oxford as mr camply and his sister are gone to london upon business they have desired me to show their cousin some attention in order to dissipate his melancholy having just lost his father by whose death he gets ten thousand a year pray mr belvil did you ever see him   belvil not since he was ten years old he was then very like miss camply  very handsome    mrs arabella he dines here   miss loveless he dines here  handsome  ten thousand a year and a baronet  all these things are worth thinking about  i long to see him   belvil confounded spirit of coquetry how unlike my eliza aside with your leave ladies i shall go and put a little powder in my hair and return presently   exit belvil bowing mrs arabella well my dear has mr belvil made any proposals yet   miss loveless lard aunt the instant a man speaks to one you imagine he must propose    mrs arabella i can tell you niece that your encouraging so many suitors without my hearing of any thing serious alarms me very much for the sake of your reputation there is my lord macgrinnon who tells the whole world he is in love with you   miss loveless and he tells me so too   mrs arabella for shame niece i should have blushed myself into a fever before i could have said such a thing and pray do not you know that mr belvil has even been attached to miss camply and yet you have suffered him to dangle after you for a whole week  i wish i knew his intentions   miss loveless indeed maam if you choose to call me to an account for every foolish fellow that deserts country misses for me you will have enough to do  will you condemn me in the high court of your judgment because my charms monopolize the attentions of mankind  really aunt  really you are too unreasonable  i cannot help it if i am admired    mrs arabella i only speak to you as a friend  you are your own mistress  but i do not see that you like any one yourself   miss loveless like o yes maam  i like him best that says the finest things to me and in short my dear aunt i never will marry till i can find a man who will let the whole world admire me the aunt walks about miss loveless follows her and that it will without his leave i fancy  stay i must see what sort of looks i am in for i must try what sort of heart this baronet has  aside your servant milud with a side look as lord macgrinnon enters bowing

harry revel is introduced   eliza aside ha you perfidious  madam i am your most obedient  bows all round without looking at miss loveless then takes out a glass and looks through it to mrs arabella heavens and earth maam i did not expect to find a salon so truly a la francoise in this horrid country  and some fine pictures too  that is a rubens i fancy  and that a rembrandt  pray is that a carravagio  yes it is i see   miss loveless aside he does not even look at me  it is a pretty fellow though   belvil aside he is still like eliza but not so well though   miss loveless pray sir harry

cousin who is the most superlatively accomplished woman in the world if one may credit mr belvils accounts of her   eliza i suppose you have seen her and know there is nothing so very extraordinary about her now for a description of myself aside   miss loveless yes i have seen her but she blushes so much at every thing and at nothing  and her countenance alters from one moment to another into such a variety of expressions that i really never could decide any thing about her  i suppose mr belvils passion for her was only a nursery prejudice   eliza now do i dread to have my questions answered aside his addresses to you are no secret in camplys house i assure you and i thought my foolish cousin seemed to look very grave upon the subject  but i trust you have refused mr belvils offers    miss loveless his offers  lard sir harry you are just like my aunt who fancies every dangler one has is to offer he has done every thing a respectful lover could do but offer but i suppose he will   eliza aye aye to be sure aside heaven forbid   miss loveless yes he cannot think seriously about miss camply   eliza why not pray   miss loveless why he has trusted her picture to me and that looks as if he did not care about her   eliza it does indeed pray let me see that picture  pray compare that face with this portrait and see if there is the least chance of elizas making any conquest when you are near   miss loveless for heavens sake sir harry hide it  hide it  here is mr belvil  miss loveless confused gentlemen  mr belvil where is my aunt  i must find her   exit eliza

it was given me this moment by a fair lady and i intend to make use of it as a passport to the good graces of the lady who sat for it   belvil i can hardly contain myself what shall i say to him aside   eliza now do i die to know if it is myself or miss camply that he is so much disturbed about aside what is the matter mr belvil you look out of countenance  you look  faith i have hit it you look like the secretary of the waroffice when he receives the news of a defeat instead of a victory  or like sir tantivy on a frosty morning   belvil belvil goes up to him you may think yourself very witty sir harry but your mirth at  his voice trembles at this time is the very height of cruelty   eliza i could kiss him for that now aside are you deaf man i say miss loveless gave me this and really i think it like eliza  but in her grave looks though   belvil then you are very well acquainted with miss loveless already   eliza i could beat him with pleasure aside o yes sir so well that if i do not

enter nous sir harry the ladys vanity is equal to yours excuse me  bows   eliza take care mr belvil take care i shall make you repent of those words ere long  but you seem piqued is it miss loveless or my cousins charms that disturb you so much   belvil why do you ask sir is it any thing to you what are my sentiments of either   eliza o yes sir i am in love with both and shall be heartily tired of my wife that is to be in a very short time and then intend to have an affair de coeur with my cousin she has a fine sentimental mind and a lovely person and that is the true thing for a mistress   belvil come come sir harry if you can be serious for a few minutes i shall entreat your patience and your assistance perhaps in an affair which makes me truly wretched   eliza i begin to pity him aside serious  ha ha ha serious upon my credit belvil thy serious phiz would make any man serious but myself but i never was serious in my life nor ever intend to be so and as you seem to be in the dolorous penseroso style i will leave you to improve upon your own reflections going kisses the picture joli comme le jour ce petit minois la   belvil following i insist upon your not going sir harry that picture once was mine   eliza the more fool you for parting with it   belvil part with it part with it i would as soon part with my life   eliza poh poh mr belvil it is quite ridiculous in you to appear so anxious about a picture which i repeat you have parted with so easily   belvil no by that heaven that hears us i would as soon part with the original if i was possessed of her  but it was folly and imprudence that made me lend it to miss loveless and her giving it to you was greater folly still i do entreat you sir harry i beseech you shall i kneel to you for it what is there i will not do if you will make me easy by restoring it   eliza why did the girl give it you   belvil yes she did   eliza she did  faith the girl is as great a simpleton as you are   belvil very angry very well sir harry the confession i have made gives you a right to upbraid me but though my heart is neatly broken by the consequences of my foolish conduct my spirit my spirit is not    eliza poor sighing swain   belvil hell and furies sir harry do you laugh at me   eliza what would the man have you may marry my cousin if you like it   belvil i never shall be so happy i should be distracted

eliza not so loud sir you crack the drum of my ear these country gentlemen are so robust you will  then by jove you shall not have it for should she be cruel and not surrender i shall show this picture to the whole world and swear she has and that will do as well   belvil then you are a villain   eliza with all my spirit a rascal a coxcomb a puppy and you the worthy mr belvil but seriously now bilvil you will be a lucky man to have such a gallant as myself to escort your wife about  for i shall appear in every public place with her close to her ear  always at her elbow  always    belvil this usage is not to be borne   eliza well  takes snuff and stares at him   belvil aside what is there in that boy that quite unmans me goes up to him i expect sir harry that you will give me satisfaction   eliza oh sir i expect satisfaction likewise but this is not a proper place to show our courage in tomorrow if you please mr belvil if you will meet me at the end of the chesnuttree walk at seven of clock we will decide this matter with any arms you please till then i keep the picture tomorrow the conqueror shall wear it   belvil bravely spoken sir harry with swords we will decide this point and if you fall i shall proclaim to the world that in your serious moments you are a contrast to your usual character which i must inform you sir harry is one of the most profligate and debauched i ever met with if you survive me all i ask of you is to justify me to your cousin it is to do justice to her honor that i expose my life   eliza i will answer for your justification aside i die to undeceive him well sir one of us will live to lay our laurels and our person at her feet   belvil i have a serious affair to settle therefore i must leave you going returns remember the hour   eliza yes yes  exit belvil now i have sufficiently punished him i shall give him satisfaction but in a much pleasanter way than he expects here is then at last returned to me the copy of a very foolish original and were the fate of it to be well described in a modern play i fancy it would teach many giddy girls like myself not to part with the one till the other was secured as fast as a lawyer and parson could bind it   end of the second act act iii scene miss loveless s garden miss loveless crossing the stage meets mr camply and starts miss loveless ha he here aside   mr camply confused i came  i came  to  pray miss loveless where is your aunt   miss loveless so this visit is not to me i find aside my aunt is in the house i believe lord i thought you were in london for as we give a ball tonight the gravity of such a very sober creature as you are will quite discompose our dancing   mr camply your aunt has done my sister and me the honor of inviting us and i hastened out of town on purpose to attend her commands   miss loveless her commands i suppose you mean to dance with her too i protest mr camply it will be quite edifying to see her like a true maid of honor in queen besss days with her hands thus  and footing it demurely so  her eyes rivetted upon her feet all the time lest the left foot should take place improperly of the right   mr camply ha ha ha charming i protest now draw my picture   miss loveless pshaw  how in the name of wonder should i describe your dancing when the very sound of your voice is quite a new thing to me   mr camply were i as vain as my cousin sir harry i should say that looked like a reproach to me for not speaking to you before   miss loveless lard now do not apply general observations to particular people  for heavens sake let us think of ourselves as little as we always have done   mr camply yes yes i know you ever had much less regard for yourself than for any one else in the world   miss loveless myself  myself again why did you ever think about myself   mr camply o no not at all  never never  ha ha ha i am quite diverted    miss loveless at our raillery i suppose aside that is the most provoking laugh i ever heard i will cure him of that affectation i am determined  pray excuse me mr camply when i tell you that nature never intended you for raillery it sits upon you just as a veil and beads would sit upon me   mr camply indeed if raillery is as proper for me as a convent is for you i should do nothing but laugh at my own jokes for the rest of my life besides i think you would make a very pretty nun   miss loveless you are quite mistaken mr camply for i could give you a proof that i have too much of the woman about me to make a saint of   mr camply a proof   miss loveless yes what do you think brings me into the garden at this time of the morning   mr camply indeed i do not know   miss loveless why curiosity   mr camply curiosity as i have none of that ingredient in my composition i do not desire to know what is the object of yours   miss loveless provoking indifference aside what do you think then of an appointment   mr camply i should be sorry to interrupt the smallest of your amusements and if i see right the object of them is too entertaining for my gravity to relish and so will take my leave going   miss loveless o pray stay   enter lord macgrinnon mr camply my lord your servant  exit miss loveless well my lord what can you possibly have to say to me   lord macgrinnon that you are my divinity  the idol of my worship  see the very sun shines brighter than usual to light up your beauties and the birds make a concert to hail your charms while the very roses fade with envy at seeing themselves outdone   miss loveless stop stop my lord there is so much poetry in all that that it deserves to be remembered at least from whence did you borrow or steal it   lord macgrinnon from the brilliancy of those eyes which might inspire the dullest clod of earth  those eyes that promise    miss loveless promise take care my lord my eyes and my tongue do always go together and words ought to express what the heart feels   lord macgrinnon and so they ought most charming

cold one  pray my lord what am i to derive from all this   lord macgrinnon that my person and fortune are yours that if you will but consent this night we will set off for scotland where we will live only to love all the rest of our lives   miss loveless the usual way of proposing in his country my lord is accompanied by settlements and the consent of ones parents   lord macgrinnon augh my dear miss loveless settlements and consents are not necessary between people that love nay marriage was invented only to bind the feuls and vulgar of both sexes but you  your mind like the soaring eagle despises all little game and should have no tie but your heart   miss loveless what does the fool mean aside   lord macgrinnon your aunt does not want you come with me into scotland and then we will conform to the odious custom of joining hands when our hearts are one believe the most ardent the most passionate the most faithful of lovers here will i be rivetted like a statue to the earth till

kept and this morning have received a convincing proof that i am right oh miss loveless is a coquet   eliza a coquet you are so i am so it is in human nature that we should be so when our thoughts are

it to give to some one who will be more careful of it than you have been   belvil not to him miss camply not to him for if he fails in his promise of meeting me here i will pursue him to the end of the world and tear his false heart from that breast which  i beg your pardon miss camply  but he is a villain   eliza lord now i think him a very pretty man   belvil i may never see you again miss

millions of little cupids were playing about my heart and bidding it hope  at least for pardon   eliza leans upon his shoulder i can hardly speak  my stupid belvil  and do not you see and do not you feel that sir harry   belvil starts again sir harry come puts his arm round her waist come speak   eliza why that you hold him to your breast at this instant   belvil ha is it possible is it possible

  servant introduces miss camply eliza miss loveless i have brought you sir harry revels excuses and this note   miss loveless reads dear madam i would advise you to insist upon dancing with my cousin as you are not likely to get a partner this evening of a contrary sex to your own if you depend upon your humble servant  h revel   did you know the contents of this note miss camply   eliza yes miss loveless   miss loveless why then i must confess the same uncivil folly runs through the whole family it is downright nonsense   eliza well that is very odd for my cousin is reckoned very sensible almost as clever as myself   miss loveless the girls a downright fool aside  well miss camply mr belvil will be here presently i shall dance with him   enter belvil belvil pardon me madam i am engaged to dance with miss camply   eliza and i am engaged to sir harry   miss loveless i fancy good people you mean to be witty in some way or other but as i do not understand how i must own i think the place you have chosen to exhibit in makes it rather uncivil these jokes in my house are almost rude   eliza miss loveless your head thus look down no up yes  aye that will do  do you recollect such a scene   miss loveless intolerable that puppy has given her an account of my behavior   eliza my cousin is very justly vain of your encouragement miss loveless and i thank you in his name for your great condescension   miss loveless miss camply this is not to be borne do you mean to affront me   eliza no if i could not affront you when a man i am sure my female character cannot offend   miss loveless o heavens and were you sir harry revel only to laugh at me grant me patience she cries   eliza no miss loveless not to laugh at you but to regain my own lover whom you had nearly stolen from me   belvil not that neither do not be offended miss loveless if i acknowledge that i had not the least serious intentions about you   miss loveless what is there a combination  a plot to laugh at me  i can tell you miss camply if my behavior appeared extraordinary i think yours to the full as reprehensible to put me on a masculine habit and personate a man for the sake of an odious man   eliza i never encouraged but that one odious man but you miss loveless have encouraged many   miss loveless can you stand tamely by and see me reproached in this manner   mrs arabella your conduct my dear deserves such reproaches   miss loveless why madam i shall be the ridicule of the country but i will not stay to bear it  i wish you joy both of you of your intended match and i hope you will be as heartily tired of each other soon as i am of you at present  but you shall not have the pleasure of seeing me mortified  i shall go and live at paris for the remainder of my life i have an uncle that will let me live as privately as i please pray madam make my excuses to the company  say i have got the headache say any thing and to morrow i will go and leave you and all my follies behind me going

has owned to me that she likes mr camply   miss loveless why then aunt i do think you are much worse than mr belvil miss camply or her brother and therefore to be revenged i will even stay and try to be happier than you all seem to be  and now mr camply if upon farther acquaintance we do not change our minds we may follow the example of mr belvil and your sister   mr camply i thank you miss for my sister is soon to be married   eliza o not this twelvemonth  and as no one shall say i lead them into a scrape we will all four be married together and you as my elder brother must begin the dance

way you treat your mistress fellow   john fellow yourself why it is because she is my mistress that she shall not go with thee why if thee be a lord thee be only a man  and as an englishman i am the best of the two and so you shall find me if you dare lay hold of her again   lord macgrinnon he is certainly bewitched  speak to him sweet love    susan why john  in a low voice   john why zounds i

going to take a walk together and that fellow is mad i believe for he will not let her do as she likes   mr camply miss loveless why my lord is this miss loveless you dream holds the lanthorn up to susan s face   lord macgrinnon faith  an uglier dream by half  what in the name of wonder can all this be   bevil this is a fine evening my lord but you look disturbed what is the matter   lord macgrinnon matter why all the plagues of egypt i believe yes yes i am disturbed and wet to the skin too so pray what do you talk of a fine evening for there has been a violent storm of rain all the company laugh na na    miss loveless i am much obliged to you my lord for your very kind intentions and love of my fortune i was so insensible of the nature of your affection that it is to me you are indebted for that shower of rain from yonder engine and for a beating into the bargain from honest john who thought it was his mistress you were going off with   john what and so you did not like him then  ah susan susan i have a months mind never to be jealous again   susan why you great jolterhead you did think i was going to run away dont ye know that nothing but gentlefolks run away with one another   john well well say no more if ever i am jealous again i wish a frost may nip all the trees in the garden odsnigs if mr camply had not come i believe in my heart i should have broke every bone in your skin my lord   lord macgrinnon thank ye i feel as if you had done it never did any man of the family of macgrinnon suffer such indignities as i have suffered from this company to be deluded by a woman is a trifle a man of sense will expect it but i canna help reflecting on the impertinencies the jeers and the sluicing that have been thrown at me without thinking that the happiness of my noble ancestors is disturbed by the unworthy treatment that has been offered to their lineal descendant  all the company laugh miss loveless certainly nothing but his vanity could induce him to think that i was weak enough to comply with his request and now miss camply i will confess that i am much indebted to you for curing me of my ridiculous plan of conduct and i wish you may succeed in every thing you undertake as you have in this   eliza why mine was rather a bold scheme i must confess but if the rest of the company bowing round will forget what a very lively coxcomb i have been i shall not repent of the pains i have taken to please every one   ladies i trust you will adopt my plan and only wear the dress to gain the man finis books printed for g riley i the third
