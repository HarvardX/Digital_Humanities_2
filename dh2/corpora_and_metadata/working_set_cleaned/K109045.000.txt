a tract on duelling wherein the opinions of some of the most celebrated writers on crown law are examined and corrected either by the authority of the same writers declared in contradictory sentiments on the same subject collated from other parts of their works or by the solemn decisions of more ancient writers of at least equal authority in order to ascertain the due distinction between manslaughter and murder  by granville sharp  london first printed in      second edition with additions printed for b white and son fleet street and c dilly in the poultry mdccxc  whosoever sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man genesis ix   for blood it defiles the land number xxxv    there cannot therefore be any legal prerogative to pardon wilful manslaughter but only where the king may do it by his oath that is to say where a man slays another in his own defense or by misfortune   ed iii to pardon without one or other of these two favorable circumstances would be an act highly disloyal to god and man and even to the land for the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but the blood of him that shed it number xxxv    caedes manifest numerantur inter scelera nullo humano jure expiabilia   inst     preface the intention of the following tract is to prove that the plea of sudden anger cannot remove the imputation and guilt of murder when a mortal wound is wilfully given with a weapon  that the indulgence allowed by the courts to voluntary manslaughter in rencounters and in sudden affrays and duels is indiscriminate and without foundation in law  and that impunity in such cases of voluntary manslaughter is one of the principal causes of the continuance and present increase of the base and disgraceful practice of duelling  universal benevolence including gentleness patience and an unaffected placability in our behavior even toward those men who injure and affront us is manifestly required of all men who profess the true religion and yet unhappily for the christian world this most obvious doctrine of the gospel of peace is too commonly either misunderstood or else absolutely rejected though the temporal as well as the eternal happiness of mankind greatly depends upon a conscientious and proper observation of it for a man cannot be a true christian without observing this doctrine and yet so generally received is the opposite and contradictory doctrine concerning the necessity of revenging every personal affront with sword and pistol for the sake of what is falsely called honor that a true christian is rarely to be with nay we are fallen into such gross depravity that the writer of a late publication on the principles of penal law has ventured to assert though he is in other respects as i am informed a sensible and ingenious young gentleman that the judge condemns the duellist whilst he scarcely knows how in his own heart to disapprove his behavior p     so that one would suppose christianity to be almost entirely extinct amongst us if its principles are so little regarded even in our courts of justice where they ought to be held most sacred my readers perhaps will start at such an idea in these enlightened days of reformation but i will even go farther and venture to assert that the europeans not only cease to be christians but will no longer deserve the name even of men if they persist in such a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the most indispensible principles of the laws of god and nature for nothing deserves to be esteemed human that is unreasonable and the depravity of which i complain is not only incompatible with the laws of god but absolutely inconsistent with common sense  let us view the character of the modern man of honor falsely so called who thinks it inconsistent with his reputation to pass over a personal affront with that christian submission which the gospel requires of all men without exception  such an one perhaps will allege that his honor obliges him whenever he receives an affront to call out his adversary or to accept his challenge lest his courage should be questioned and therefore in such case the one must give and the other take what is commonly called gentlemanlike satisfaction but let us examine this perversion of words the satisfaction to both parties is the risk both of body and soul in the perpetration of a most dishonorable base and cowardly felony which cannot therefore be gentlemanlike whatever the satisfaction of it may be and  st it is felony because no man can give or accept a challenge without being guilty of wilful murder if he kills his antagonist which i hope is proved in the course of the following tract  ndly it is dishonorable because it is an open violation of the indispensible principles enjoined in the two great commandments of the supreme law viz the love of god and the love of our neighbor for in this respect the offender is upon the same footing as culprits for burglary theft or any other felony the not having the fear of god before his eyes being equally applicable to all of them and the common law of england esteems no man qualified to be a member of society who wants this principle the act is therefore highly dishonorable and to use a still more humiliating term of the same import i must observe   dly that it is also base because it affords the most apparent proof of a little soul nec christiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt sed et philosophi qui dixerunt pusilli esse animi contumeliam far non posse ut alibi ostendimus says the learned grotius in his  d book de jure belli et pacis p      being in reality a brutal revenge brutal because unreasonable for how can honor be vindicated or retrieved by the commission of a notorious felony and what is unreasonable must be disgraceful to human nature and therefore is truly base  and lastly it is cowardly that is when it cannot be imputed to ignorance or folly because a man submits to it contrary to the light of his own reason for fear his courage should be called in question and yet he has not courage enough to withstand the barbarous prejudices of a depraved world lest he should suffer some temporal inconveniences and the slavish fear which he entertains of these for cowards always dread the present evil most deprives him of that reasonable fear which he ought to entertain of gods judgment because he thinks it at a distance though he knows it must inevitably follow  i condemn no man in particular god forbid i speak of the question only in general inveterate prejudices and customs may perhaps afford some excuse in particular cases to some individuals who have ignorantly yielded thereto but as ignorance is disgraceful to humanity i sincerely wish that all persons may enter into as careful an examination of this question as i have done by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime but also be prevented from attempting to defend what is past and thereby afford the best proof of an ingenuous and honorable heart  this abominable practice of duelling which of late years has increased to a most alarming degree may chiefly be attributed i humbly conceive to the improper indulgence which our english courts of justice for about two centuries back have shown to persons convicted of killing in sudden affrays and rencounters through a false idea of mercy due to human failty in cases of sudden provocation without preserving the proper distinction of those cases wherein homicide in sudden anger is really excusable by the laws of god and of this kingdom and the improper precedents which have arisen from this indiscriminate and corrupt practice have so misled the more modern writers on crown law that even the greatest and most respectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doctrines on the subject of manslaughter which are absolutely incompatible with the proper and necessary distinctions to be observed between wilful murder and manslaughter which they themselves have laid down in other parts of their works and it is on the authority of these just distinctions with the necessary consequences arising therefrom and not on my own presumption that this censure is founded which the following tract i hope will clearly demonstrate  but as my readers might seem to give too much credit to an inconsiderable person like myself were they without a previous intimation of what is proposed to risque any loss of time in the perusal of the arguments and proofs at large on which my vindication for this attempt depends i think it my duty to state the subject and intention of the tract as briefly as i can in this prefatory address that my readers may thereby be enabled to judge without much loss of time whether the matter is of sufficient consequence to merit any more of their attention  i have already mentioned my opinion that no man can give or accept a challenge to fight with weapons on any private difference whatever without being guilty of wilful murder if he kills his antagonist and the intention of the following tract is to show that the writers on crown law have no just warrant for admitting the contrary doctrines which they have laid down concerning sudden affrays and rencountres viz that the voluntary killing of a man on a sudden provocation is only to be esteemed manslaughter and as such is entitled to the benefit of clergy and they have also supposed that an assault is a sufficient provocation to justify a voluntary manslaughter  now certain it is that some allowance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a sudden provocation in consideration of the extreme frailty of human nature provided that there are no circumstances of malice in the case as if for instance a man in sudden anger should strike another merely with his fist or a small cane or stick meaning only to correct and should accidentally kill this would be properly manslaughter which though it is deemed felony as the act of striking or beating another person is in itself unlawful is nevertheless pardonable both by the laws of god and man but when two persons fight with dangerous weapons an intention of killing is expressed by the weapons and such intention renders the manslaughter voluntary which is the same thing as wilful and consequently the malice prepensed which excludes the benefit of clergy is necessarily implied though the sudden anger be but a moment before the fatal stroke for malice prepensed is thus defined by sir edward coke that is says he voluntary and of set purpose though done upon a sudden occasion for if it be voluntary the law implies malice   inst cxiii p     and yet the same great lawyer in p    speaks of voluntary manslaughter upon some sudden falling out as distinct from murder which cannot in reason be true for if the killing be voluntary the evil and malicious intention is necessarily included in the act even though the fatal blow be given merely with the hand or a small cane or stick which i have before mentioned as pardonable cases when the killing is not intended for a voluntary striking without intention to kill is indeed pardonable though death ensues but a voluntary killing is so far from being so that the law according to lord cokes own rule implies malice and consequently the same must necessarily be esteemed murder and not merely manslaughter because the necessary marks whereby manslaughter ought to be distinguished are absolutely wanting therein for manslaughter must be without malice express or implied    hale       blackstone      murder being aggravated says lord hale with malice presumed or implied but manslaghter not and yet all these great and excellent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the same error of treating the voluntary branch of killing as bare homicide or manslaughter whereas all the older writers agree that killing is pardonable only in cases of inevitable necessity bracton lib iii c   p   0 b fleta lib i c    and the learned judge staunford says that the whole matter consists in the inevitable necessity without which the killing is by no means excusable there is but one case of voluntary killing wherein the plea of sudden anger and atrocious provocation may seem entitled to some indulgence and consideration see note in p    nest ascun voi excusable pc lib i c    now the absurd and depraved notions of honor and gentlemanlike satisfaction of which i complain could not possibly exist if every conqueror in a duel who kills his antagonist was sure of being hanged up as an ignominious felon for his own gentlemanlike satisfaction and therefore i apprehend that the diabolical practice of settling private differences with sword and pistol is chiefly to be attributed to the want of punishment due to voluntary manslaughter through the mistaken concessions of the writers on crown law and the false mercy of juries in consideration of sudden anger because impunity fosters vice and depravity but more especially in cases of wilful manslaughter impunity ought to be esteemed the bane of society as the guilt of blood is thereby thrown upon a whole nation or country for it is a supreme law that whosoever sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed genesis ix   for blood it defiles the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it number xxxv    and i hope i have proved by incontrovertable extracts from the laws of god that the said judgment is inevitably incurred by all voluntary killing except in the legal prosecution of justice and in the necessary defense of our lives and properties so that no man has any legal or just right to pardon or remit the punishment due to murder or voluntary manslaughter which are the same crime and equally unpardonable in this world for such an indulgence is not only a manifest sin against almighty god but also against the community at large or country for blood it defiles the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it numb xxxv    this is not a ceremonial law but a law of morality founded in divine justice which must therefore be ever binding now as the land cannot be cleansed etc but by manslaughter so that even the king himself is absolutely restrained from it see an act of the   edw iii whereby it is ordained that a charter of pardon shall not be granted but only where the king may do it by his oath that is to say where a man slays another in his own defense or by misfortune see also a note in p    on the further limitation of royal prerogative by a subsequent statute of    ric     stat c   rendering it obnoxious to the wrath of god the blood of him who shed it the land is surely entitled to that expiation as a matter of indispensible right which when withheld or withdrawn by charters of pardon to the guilty is a manifest injury and wrong to the land ie to the whole country or kingdom which opens to us the true ground and reason why the royal prerogative is so strictly and expressly limited in this point for non potest rex gratiam facere cum injuria et damno aliorum this is an ancient and constant rule of law   inst p     and an injury wrong or damage is surely most intolerable when it is liable to affect the whole land or country by rendering it obnoxious to the wrath of god  i may probably be charged with an unpardonable temerity for presuming to censure the writings of some of the greatest and most learned men that this nation perhaps ever produced and i am thoroughly sensible of the risk and ill consequences to myself in case i am mistaken but a sincere persuasion of being in the right arising from a laborious research and careful examination of the most celebrated and approved writers on crown law obliges me to prefer what i conceive to be truth before the authority of the greatest names  and even though i should not have succeeded according to my own conceptions of the subject yet i trust that my impartial readers will pardon any involuntary errors that they find in the performance especially if they see no cause to suspect any want of uprightness in the intention of it and at all events i hope that the attempt may at least be considered as a proof that i am not afraid of difficulties and labor nor of the risk of personal inconveniences when i undertake any point with a view of serving my country or mankind in general  london  d sept      granville sharp  a tract on duelling no man can give or accept a challenge to fight with weapons and kill his antagonist on any private difference whatever without being guilty of wilful murder such as ought to be excluded from the benefit of clergy for wilful murder is the killing of a man ex malitia proecogitata pleas of the crown      p    also   hal p c      which malice is either implied or express fitzherberts justice of peace p    lambards eirenarcha c   p   0 also   inst c vii p    or as judge hale calls it malice in law or ex presumptione legis   hal p c      and malice must necessarily be implied when a man wilfully strikes or wounds another with any offensive weapon whatever because that is an act that must apparently introduce harm p c      p     and the intention to do harm makes it murder ibid     so that the allowance which the writers of the two last centuries have made for sudden anger without preserving a proper distinction of the case wherein it really deserves consideration is unjust in itself as well as dangerous to society for few men would entertain such absurd notions of honor as to think themselves obliged to revenge affronts with their swords or pistols if the risque of being hanged up as felons and murderers for their own gentlemanlike satisfaction was rendered obvious by just and proper decisions of the law on this point  in every charge of murder the fact of killing being first proved all the circumstances of accident necessity or infirmity are to be satisfactorily proved by the prisoner unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him for the law presumes the fact to have been founded in malice until the contrary appears judge foster      the cases of homicide which are justified or excused by the abovementioned circumstances of accident and necessity are well understood and by many eminent writers sufficiently explained under the heads of misfortune and selfdefence but with respect to those cases of homicide which are attended with circumstances of infirmity the third branch of circumstances mentioned above the writers on crown law in general have been very indiscriminate notwithstanding that the true distinction between murder and manslaughter depends entirely on a clear stating of those cases of infirmity which really deserve consideration and excuse  judge foster indeed is for the most part nice and accurate in his distinctions yet he has paid so great a regard to the authority of precedents that he has been unwarily led away as well as other writers from the necessary conclusions of his own arguments upon this point i shall nevertheless make use of his words as far as they express my own opinion of the subject  whoever would shelter himself under the plea of provocation must prove his case to the satisfaction of the jury the presumption of law is against him till that presumption is repelled by contrary evidence what degree of provocation and under what circumstances heat of blood the furor brevis will or will not avail the defendant is now to be considered  words of reproach how grievous soever are not a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder nor are indecent provoking actions or gestures expressive of contempt or reproach without an assault upon the person p   0 but i think myself obliged to add that even an assault see my remarks in p  etc on mr hawkinss assertions relating to this point upon the person is not a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder though this learned judge seems to think otherwise see sect iii p     unless all the circumstances which are necessary to render it excusable by the plea of selfdefence can clearly be proved for if the killing in a sudden fray is not ex necessitate as in selfdefence or in the lawful defense of others it must be esteemed voluntary and voluntary is the same thing as wilful which necessarily includes malice for bracton says crimen non contrahitur nisi voluntas nocendi intercedat and voluntas et propositum distinguunt maleficium etc the guilt is not incurred unless the intention of injuring intervenes for the intention and purpose or design marks the felony or malicious deed lib iii c    so that malice must necessarily be presumed whenever the killing is not ex necessitate especially if the fatal blow be wilfully given with a weapon for in that case a man must necessarily be supposed to strike cunt occidendi animo  with murderous intent because the voluntas nocendi is apparent and consequently the malice in such a case is not only implied but clearly expressed so that the sudden anger is only a further proof of the malice and  intention to do harm  bracton has accurately laid down the proper distinction to be observed in the plea of an excusable necessity for killing  quo casu distinguendum est utrum necessitas illa fuit evitabilis vel non si autem evitabilis et evadere posset absque occisione tune erit reus homicidii and a felonious homicide or manslaughter in the days of bracton had the same meaning that we now apply to murder si autem inevitabilis quia occidit hominem sine odii meditatione in metu and dolor animi se et sua liberando cum aliter  mortem propriam fleta lib i c    evadere non posset non tenetur ad poenam homicidii in which case it is necessary to distinguish whether that necessity was avoidable or not for if it was avoidable and might have been evaded without killing then he shall be guilty of manslaughter i e murder in those days but if it was inevitable for that he killed the man without any prepence of hatred but in fear and grief of mind in delivering himself and his own when otherwise he could not escape he shall not in such case be held or be liable to the penalty of murder  bract lib iii c   and staunford remarks that the necessity ought to be so great that it ought to be esteemed inevitable or otherwise it shall not be excused so that the whole matter consists says he in the inevitable necessity without which the killing is by no means excusable nota que la necessite doit etre cy graunde que il doit estre existime inevitable ou autrement il nexcusera etc eins tout la matier consist in le inevitable necessite sans quel le tuer nest ascun voi excusable staunford p c lib i c   so that the learned judge foster certainly goes too far when he insinuates in the passage before cited that an assault upon the person without mentioning the necessary exception concerning inevitable necessity is a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder for a farther distinction besides that of inevitable necessity is also to be observed which is very accurately laid down even by judge foster himself in p     though the same would be useless if an assault upon the person was to be admitted as a sufficient provocation to the act of killing it ought to be remembered says he that in all other cases of homicide upon slight provocation but i have already shown that no provocation whatever can justify a voluntary or wilful killing  if it may be reasonably collected from the weapon made use of or from any other circumstance that the party intended to kill or to do some great bodily harm such homicide will be murder the mischief done is irreparable and the outrage is considered as flowing rather from brutal rage or diabolical malignity than from human frailty and it is to human frailty and to that alone the law indulgeth in every case of felonious homicide  the first instance which he gives by way of illustration to this doctrine is cited from judge hale vol i p     if a come into the wood of b and pull his hedges or cut his wood and b beat him whereof he dies this is manslaughter because though it was not lawful for a to cut the wood it was not lawful for b to beat him but either to bring him to a justice of peace or punish him otherwise according to law but here lord hale is not sufficiently distinct in stating the case because circumstances are wanting which are necessary for the determination of such a case whether it ought to be esteemed manslaughter or murder the accurate judge foster was sensible of this want of necessary circumstances and therefore adds but it must be understood says he that he beat him not with a mischievous intention but merely to chastise him for the trespass and to deter him from committing the like for if he had knocked his brains out with a bill or hedgestake or had given him an outrageous beating with an ordinary cudgel beyond the bounds of a sudden resentment whereof he had died it had been murder for these circumstances are some of the genuine symptoms of the mala mens the heart bent upon mischief which as i have already shown enter into the true notion of malice in the legal sense of the word p      the next instance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horses tail which was says he held to be murder for it was a deliberate act and savoured of cruelty but the third instance viz that of stedman the soldier killing a woman with a sword which judge foster mentions as a case that was held clearly to be no more than manslaughter was most certainly wilful murder for though it appeared that the woman had struck the soldier on the face with an iron patten yet she afterward fled from him and he pursuing her stabbed her in the back  now if such a case of wilful killing is to be esteemed only manslaughter it entirely perverts the just arguments already quoted from the same author concerning the cases wherein human frailty deserves to be indulged may i not use his own words against him that these circumstances the pursuing and stabbing the woman in the back are some of the genuine symptoms of the mala mens the heart bent upon mischief whereas if he had struck her merely with his fist or with a small stick not likely to kill and had unluckily and against his intention killed it had been but manslaughter for this is the necessary distinction for which i contend in all cases of killing where the striking not the killing is voluntary and i cannot so well express my meaning as in the words of judge foster himself though that sensible and acute reasoner is afterward misled from the truth of his own doctrine by paying too much regard i mean an indiscriminate regard to the practice of the courts which in this point has frequently been erroneous  in page   0 after the  st section already quoted concerning the circumstances which are not a provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder he adds this rule will i conceive says he govern every case where the party killing upon such provocation makes use of a deadly weapon or otherwise manifests an intention to kill or to do some some great bodily harm but if he had given the other a box on the ear or had struck him with a stick or other weapon not likely to kill and had unluckily and against his intention killed it had been but manslaughter the difference between the cases is plainly this in the former the malitia the wicked vindictive disposition already mentioned evidently appears in the latter it is as evidently wanting the party in the first transport of his passion intended to chastise for a piece of insolence which few spirits can bear in this case the benignity of the law interposeth in favor of human frailty in the other its justice regards and punishes the apparent malignity of the heart p   0 and      nevertheless the same author in p     endeavors to excuse killing in sudden rencounters without preserving this necessary distinction concerning the use of a deadly weapon and the intention to kill  to what i have offered says he with regard to sudden rencounters let me add that the blood already too much heated kindles afresh at every pass or blow and in the tumult of the passions in which mere instinct selfpreservation has no inconsiderable share the voice of reason is not heard and therefore the law in condescension to the infirmities of flesh and blood has extenuated the offense but the law in reality makes no such condescension though the courts of law have indeed indiscriminately done so and have occasioned a multitude of bad precedents wherein wilful murder has been excused under the name of manslaughter and this unhappy difference between the law and the corrupt practice of the courts with respect to this point has unwarily led the more modern writers on crownlaw into concessions which are absolutely contradictory to the just doctrines laid down in other parts of their excellent works  when i speak of such respectable and justly revered authors as sir edward coke sir matthew hale lord chief justice holt etc no person can conceive that i am misled by personal or party prejudice against their opinions and as i have really the highest esteem and veneration for their memory not only as great and learned lawyers but as true patriots and above all as sincere christians and worthy honest men i should not presume to controvert any point that has been laid down by such excellent lawyers so accomplished as above was i not armed by their own authority for no other authority is sufficiently authentic for the purpose of correcting such deservedly esteemed writers though i must acknowledge my obligation to the more ancient writers for the discovery of the errors of which i complain  the proper distinction to be observed between murder and manslaughter is well laid down by sir matthew hale murder says he being aggravated with malice presumed or implied but manslaughter not   hales p c     see also the statute    hen   c    made at marlbridge a d       title what kind of manslaughter shall be adjudged murder murder from henceforth shall not be judged before our justices where it is found misfortune only but it shall take place in such as are slain by felony and not otherwise   this rule is good and unexceptionable and therefore it must appear that even sir matthew hale himself is mistaken in the paragraph preceding this quotation where he says that manslaughter or simple homicide is the voluntary killing of another without malice express or implied for though there may be a voluntary striking without malice yet i hope i have already proved that there cannot be a voluntary killing without malice express or implied except in the legal execution of justice and in the case of selfdefence and its several branches which some writers rather improperly have indeed called voluntary lambards eirenarcha     sir edward cokes   inst p    and    though they proceed from an inevitable necessity see the note in page   nevertheless even the great sir edward coke and before him the learned lambard in his eirenarcha p   0 was guilty of this same impropriety of expression some manslaughters says sir edward coke   inst cap viii p    be voluntary and not of malice forethought upon some sudden falling out delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mitius he who provoked by anger offends ought to be more mildly punished and this for distinction sake says he is called manslaughter but it is a very indiscriminate distinction if i may use such an expression concerning the writings of so great a man because the maxim delinquens per iram etc can only be admitted in case where the malice is neither express nor implied for instance when the striking is voluntary but the killing or manslaughter is involuntary and unexpected as when a man in sudden anger gives an unlucky blow merely with his fist or with a small stick or small stone see judge fosters comment on rowleys case wherein the difference of striking with a dangerous weapon and with a small stick or cudgel not likely to destroy is well expressed pages     and     i have always thought rowleys case says he a very extraordinary one as it is reported by coke from whom hale cites it the son fights with another boy and is beaten he runs home to his father all bloody the father takes a staff runs three quarters of a mile and beats the other boy who dies of this beating this is said to have been ruled manslaughter because done in sudden heat and passion for which he cites    rep    and   hale     surely continues judge foster the provocation was not very grievous the boy had fought with one who happened to be an overmatch for him and was worsted a disaster slight enough and very frequent among boys if upon this provocation the father after running three quarters of a mile had set his strength against the child had dispatched him with an bedgestake or any other deadly weapon or by repeated blows with his cudgel it must in my opinion have been murder since any of these circumstances would have been a plain indication of the malitia that mischievous vindictive motive before explained but with regard to these circumstances with what weapon or to what degree the child was beaten coke is totally silent but croke sets the case in a much clearer light and at the same time leads his readers into the true grounds of the judgment his words are rowley struck the child with a small cudgel godbolt calls it a rod meaning i suppose a small wand of which stroke he afterward died i think it may be fairly collected from crokes manner of speaking that the accident happened by a single stroke with a cudgel not likely to destroy and that death did not immediately ensue the stroke was given in heat of blood and not with any of the circumstances which import the malitia the malignity of the heart attending the fact already explained and therefore manslaughter i observe that lord raymond lays great stress on this circumstance that the stroke was with a cudgel not likely to kill meaning only to correct which undesignedly occasions death for in such cases the malice is not implied whereas in a voluntary homicide even a malice prepensed is implied according to sir edward cokes own definition of that term viz that it is voluntary and of set purpose though it be done upon a sudden occasion for if it be voluntary the law implies malice   inst c xiii p     sir william blackstone has also fallen into the same error in his  th vol chap xiv p     where he informs us that manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another without malice either express or implied which may be either voluntarily upon a sudden heat or involuntarily but in the commission of some unlawful act in both of which he is also mistaken for with respect to the latter his doctrine cannot be admitted except in cases where the circumstances of the unlawful act amount only to a bare trespass which he himself elsewhere allows judge foster in his second discourse of homicide p     where he treats of involuntary homicide in the commission of an unlawful act informs us that if it be done in the prosecution of a felonious intention it will be murder but if the intent went no farther than to commit a bare trespass manslaughter though i confess say he lord coke seems to think otherwise that is lord coke did not even make an allowance for  a bare trespass but seems to have been of opinion that every case of involuntary homicide is to be treated as murder whenever the act which occasions death may be esteemed unlawful see   inst p    to which judge foster refers but that learned judge could not mean that he differed in opinion from lord coke concerning the first case there stated under the head of unlawful viz the unlawful shooting at a deer whereby a boy was killed by the glance of the arrow because that case must necessarily be esteemed murder according to judge fosters own rule abovementioned for lord coke has clearly stated a felonious intention viz a meaning to steal a deer in the park of b etc it must therefore appear that he refers only to the  d case there mentioned of a man shooting at a cock or hen or any tame fowl of another mans for a person might wantonly shoot at another mans pigeons or poultry without any intention to steal them which i conceive would amount to no more than a bare trespass in judge fosters sense of the word because voluntas et propositum distinguunt maleficia furtum vero non committitur sine affectu furandi fleta lib i c    p    whereas if lord coke had added in the supposed case that there was an intention to steal the tame fowl judge foster could not reasonably have dissented from his opinion because the crime must necessarily have been adjudged murder according to his own rule for the very same case has been so laid down by lord chief justice holt in a very clear manner see pages    and    of this tract in order to explain lord cokes assertion though judge holt himself is as apparently mistaken in his judgment of the other case wherein the occasion was an intention to steal a deer which is at least as felonious as the intention of stealing a hen that is if the deer be tame and enclosed in a park as stated by lord coke by which the property is rendered apparent but if the case had been stated that the deer was in a forest or open chase the offense without the accident would be only a trespass see hawkins p c book i c xxxiii    and the idea of this latter position may probably have occasioned lord holts mistake for this circumstance would have rendered the accidental killing of the boy only manslaughter agreeable to his opinions compare pages    and    wherein lord holts opinions of these two cases are mentioned   for i propose in the course of this tract to mention several allowed cases on good authority wherein even the involuntary or undesigned killing is not deemed manslaughter but murder when the acts which occasioned death were unlawful and with the respect to the former it is a manifest inconsistency in all these great writers to rank voluntary killing under the head of manslaughter in the modern confined sense of that once general term because a voluntary killing except in the case of selfdefence through inevitable necessity which some writers have rather improperly called voluntary lambards eirenarcha     the last member says he of voluntary homicide is where one man kills another in his own defense etc and sir edward coke speaking of selfdefence in   inst p    and    says this is voluntary and yet no felony sir matthew hale is more accurate for when he speaks of homicide ex necessitate he informs us that this necessity makes the homicide not simply voluntary but mixed partly voluntary and partly involuntary and is of two kinds etc   vol      is certainly the same thing as a wilful killing and either of them must be allowed to be the proper definition of what we now understand by the term murder though the meaning of that word was originally very different see le mirroir de justice      c i sect xiii p  0  and lambards eirenarcha c vii p     because in a voluntary or wilful killing malice is necessarily implied and consequently voluntary killing is excluded from the favor due to manslaughter by the rule which these learned writers themselves admit viz that manslaughter is without out malice express or implied so that they are really guilty of a contradiction in terms because the malice or intention of killing is undeniable if the killing be voluntary and where a man does any cruel and voluntary act whereby death ensues it is murder though done of a sudden see a little book dedicated to lord bathurst in      entitled the laws of liberty and property p     and therefore as it is a maxim that allegans contraria non est audiendus jenk cent fo    i am compelled to reject the definition of manslaughter given by these learned writers as far as it is contradictory to to that excellent rule already cited for the distinction of manslaughter from murder which they themselves admit viz that manslaughter is without malice express or implied  the errors of which i complain were not originally occasioned by these celebrated authors but by a previous corrupt practice in the courts which had been introduced by degrees and at last unhappily prevailed through a false idea of mercy and consideration for sudden anger and also through the want of preserving the proper distinction of cases wherein manslaughter in sudden anger is really excusable the proper distinction to be observed is when the intention of killing is not necessarily impiled in the act itself as when a man strikes another merely with his hand in sudden anger or thrusts him suddenly from him whereby he falls and receives a hurt which occasions death in these and similar cases the striking or thrusting is indeed voluntary yet the killing or manslaughter is not so but entirely undesigned and unexpected which proper and necessary distinction the law commentators have unhappily neglected for though the act of striking or thrusting in anger bears some resemblance to malice and though such an act is certainly unlawful in itself yet it is reasonable to make some allowance for the frailty of human nature and the sudden passion of a man that is provoked whenever a more criminal malice is not necessarily impiled in the act itself which occasions death and in this lenity we are justified by the laws of god whereby such cases of manslaughter in sudden anger as i have mentioned were excused without any other penalty than that of banishment to a city of refuge if he thrust the thrusting here mentioned which some writers seem to have misunderstood does not mean a thrust with a sword or other weapon for the word  has no such meaning but properly signifies a violent thrusting or shoving away as with the hand or a sudden driving away as chaff is drove before the wind as bythner remarks proprie dicitur de vento qui rapta prosequitur lyra prophetica p   him suddenlywithout enmity here a proper distinction is preserved between sudden anger and enmity  numb xxxv     the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge etc v    yet the very same action if done in hatred  see the  0th verse and even a blow with the hand in enmity  see the   st verse apparently meaning when there was an express proof of malice or intention to kill were to be deemed unpardonable he shall surely die  but it is remarkable that these are the only two cases wherein an express proof of malice was required for in all the examples given in the same chapter of killing with a weapon or with a stone wherewith a man may die meaning such a stone as from its shape or size might be deemed a sufficient weapon to occasion death there is not the least mention made of malice  hatred or  enmity which is a sufficient proof that the same were necessarily implied from the stroke when given with a weapon for in that case the command was peremptory if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer  retsch or killer perhaps from thence the english word wretch the murderer the word murder was anciently understood in the same general sense as the hebrew  to kill so that judge foster is mistaken when he says p  0  that our oldest writers made use of the term murder in a very narrow limited sense the sense was afterward indeed restrained to hidden manslaughter whereof the author was not known but in later times it was still once more changed to the sense in which it is at present understood viz that of wilful manslaughter wherein malice prepensed is either express or implied see lambard   book cvii p     and   0 in old time says he every killing of one man by another was of the effect called murder because death ensued of it for as postellus notes of the hebrew word moth came the latin mors and thereof our elders the saxons called  and  as we now sound it afterward about the time of m bracton murder was restrained to a secret killing only and therefore he in the definition of murder says that it is occulta occisio etc with whom britton agrees also but since the statute    edw iiic   by which the presentment of englesherie was taken away murder is taken in a middle degree neither so largely as it first was nor so narrowly as it afterward became to be for murder is now construed to be where one man of malice prepensed kills another feloniously that lives within the realm under the protection of the queen whether it be openly or privilie and whether the party slain be english or alien and then he proceeds to show that the malice prepensed may be either apparent or implied shall surely be put to death v    the same also if he smote him with a stone wherewith he may die or with an hand weapon of wood but in none of these cases is there the least mention of malice which was therefore most certainly implied and the congregation to which our trials per pares are in some degree similar were to judge according to these judgments see   th verse for the slayer was not to die until he stood before the congregation in judgment see   th verse and then if it did not appear that the killing was at unawares  in error see   th verse or as the same meaning is expressed in different words in deuteronomy xix    ignorantly or without knowledge agreeable to the example there laid down for all other cases of mere misfortune as when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lights upon his neighbor that he die etc deuteronomy xix   or as it may rather be rendered the iron glanceth from the tree  and finds his neighbor that he die which corresponds in some measure with that less explicit case mentioned in exodus xxi    where god is said to deliver him into his hand or rather to make him meet his hand as mr haak translated it in      as if a man should accidentally come in the way of a stroke that was aimed at some other object for as god is the lord of life and death whose providence is over all his works the scripture teaches us to ascribe to him all such events as in common phrase are called accidental dr dodd and so castalio translates the passage in eum fortefortuna incurrerit which he further explains in a note as follows in hebraeo est deus ejus manui injecerit sed deus pro fortuna hebraice ideo dicitur quod quae putant homines casu fieri utpote quae non praeviderint ea dei providentia fiunt cui nihil fortuitum esse potest etc the learned seldom who was most deservedly esteemed for his knowledge in the laws both of god and men supposed also that the text in exodus xxi    might relate to involuntary homicide and he accordingly refers to it from his first division of that head prima est quando  ex errore and ignorantia simplici atque infortunio nec tamen sine culpa levi ex negligentia aliqua qualem prudentiores seu cordatiores sugerent contracta omnino interea nolens quis hominem occiderat juxta illud in lege sacra exodus xxi    qui non est insidiatus sed deus tradidit illum in manum ejus ponam tibi locum quo confugiat   tom tract de jure naturali and gentium cap ii de homicidio involuntario seu quod casu sactum ac errore etc  the malice was presumed from the weapon with which the stroke was made for the hatred and enmity  were never enquired after in any cases where a wilful stroke was given with an instrument of iron or a weapon of wood or even with a stone wherewith a man may die that is if it were such a stone as was apparently capable of occasioning the death of a man see numb xxxv    to    all which crimes were unpardonable by the law of god he shall surely die  and the levitical law is certainly in this point still binding even under the dispensation of the gospel because the reason and justice of it still subsists as in other moral laws  so that the allowance usually made for sudden anger when the blow is given with a weapon is so far from deserving the name of a proper distinction in the crime of killing as some contend that it is apparently founded in a want of that proper distinction which the laws of god and reason require concerning cases of manslaughter wherein sudden anger is really excusable which can only be when the killing is not voluntary or at least the intention of killing not apparent as in the cases beforementioned of a man striking another merely with his hand see a case supposed by judge holt in his edition of kelyngs reports     regina versus mawgridge suppose says he upon provoking language given by b to a a gives b a box on the ear or a little blow with a stick which happens to be so unlucky that it kills b who might have some imposthume in his head or other ailment which proves the cause of his death this blow though not justisiable by law but is a wrong yet it may be but manslaughter because it does not appear that he designed such a mischief or fist in sudden anger or the sudden thrusting see the case of thompson and daws cited by lord chief justice holt in the case rex versus plumer kelyng p     thompson thrust away daws and threw him down upon an iron in the chimney which broke one of his ribs of which he died this upon a special verdict was held to be only manslaughter though the peace was broke and the person slain came only to keep the peace and it is the same if he had been constable that is if he did not declare his intention as it is afterward explained and charge the offending parties in the kings name to keep the peace this case is properly excuscable manslaughter because it did not appear that the killing was voluntary though the  thrusting away was voluntary and therefore the malice or intention was neither express nor implied as in murder a man down by which he is hurt in falling so that death unexpectedly ensues in these and similar cases the malice or the intention of killing is not necessarily implied in the action itself and therefore if all the other circumstances are also free from premeditated malice and laying in wait the law has reserved a reasonable use of an unreasonable popish indulgence called the benefit of clergy to relieve the undesigning manslayer if the occasion was not unlawful from the too great severity of the common law for in such cases we may safely admit sir edward cokes maxim delinquens per iram provocatus puniri debet mitius   inst    he who provoked by anger offends ought to be more mildly punished   but a false idea of mercy and consideration for sudden anger unhappily prevailing in the courts this lenity was indiscriminately extended even to cases where the prepensed malice was necessarily implied by the stroke so that the wretch who stabbed his neighbor in brutal anger escaped with impunity to the scandal of public justice the bad effects of this false mercy and injustice became so notorious in the reign of king james i that the legislature was obliged to seek a remedy and a statute was then made   jac i c   by which the benefit of clergy was taken away from the offense of mortally stabbing another though done upon sudden provocation judge blackstones com b   c xiv p     but unfortunately this remedy proved almost as indiscriminate as the abuse intended to be corrected by it for it takes no notice of any other crime than that of stabbing as if sudden anger was not equally criminal when a man is killed by throwing a hammer or other weapon or by a shot with a pistol ibid p     whereas in truth no new law was wanted nothing but a better administration of the old laws beforementioned for in all such furious sallies of sudden anger the malice was necessarily implied or presumed from the weapon as well in the laws of god which i have already shown as in the law of nations   ex telo praesumitur malum consilium says the learned grotius nisi contrarium appareat from the weapon the evil intention is presumed unless the contrary should appear and in his second book de jure belli and pacis he remarks that either iron a club or a stone comes under the denomination of a weapon teli autem nomine ferrum fustis and lapis venit c i p      the reason of the severity in the divine law against striking with a weapon is well expressed by dr wells in his paraphrase on numbers xxxv    to    forasmuch says he as though he might have no malice to him beforehand yet his striking him with a sword or hatchet etc shows he had an intention to do him mischief and as another writer remarks though perhaps he had no formed intention to kill the person yet he ought to have moderated his passion and could not be ignorant that such an instrument was capable of inflicting a deadly wound  and therefore when a man is killed with a weapon except it be by misfortune or in selfdefence regularly it is necessary that the person that kills another in his own defense fly as far as he may to avoid the violence of the assault before he turn upon his assailant for though in cases of hostility between two nations it is a reproach and piece of cowardice to fly from an enemy yet in cases of assaults and affrays between subjects under the same law the law owns not any such point of honor because the king and his laws are to be vindices injuriarum and private persons are not trusted to take capital revenge one of another   hale p      when the slayer could retire no further to save himself without striking or else in such lawful and reasonable cases wherein a man is not obliged to give back as in the case of a peace officer if a jailer be assaulted by his prisoner or if the sheriff or his minister be assaulted in the execution of his office he is not bound to give back to the wall but if he kill the assailant it is in law adjudged sedefendendo though he gave not back to the wall the like of a constable or watchman etc   hale p     for which he quotes co p c p      co rep    b machallys case who is assaulted in his duty or when any other man endeavors to keep the peace ou il purra dire que il le tua en defendaunt nostre pees etc britton p    b or to save another person from violence and oppression for it is the duty of every man to interpose in such cases for preserving the public peace and preventing mischief foster p     for which he refers to stanf    and   inst    and in the latter place there are several cafes mentioned wherein a private person may lawfully interfere by warrant in law without writ  lord hale also allows that every man is bound to use all possible lawful means to prevent a felony as well as to take the felon and if he does not he is liable to a fine and imprisonment therefore if b and c be at strife a a bystander is to use all lawful means that he may without hazard of himself to part them etc  if a be traveling and b comes to rob him if c falls into the company he may kill b in desence of a and therefore much more if he come to kill him and such his intent be apparent for in such case of a felony attempted as well as of a felony committed every man is thus far an officer that at least his killing of the attempter in case of necessity puts him in the condition of se defendendo in defending his neighbor   hale p     and     ou il purra dire que tout fist il le fait nequedent ne le fist il mye par felony purpense mes par necessite soy defendaunt ou sa femme ou sa meason ou sa meyne ou son seigniour ou sa dame de la mort etc britton p    b  and again ei qui just possidet licitum erit cum armis contra pacem venientem ut expellat cum armis repellere ut per arma tuitionis et pacis quae sunt justitiae repellat injuriam et vim injustam et arma injuriae sed tamen cum talis discretionis moderamine quod injuriam non committat non enim poterit sub tali pretextu hominem interficere vulnerare vel male tractare si alio modo suam tueri possit possessionem ei igitur qui vult viribus uti erit viribus viriliter resistendum cum armis vel sine juxta illud cum fortis armatus etc bract l   c       b  or a woman a woman in defense of her chastity may lawfully kill a person attempting to commit a rape upon her the injury intended can never be repaired or forgotten etc foster     in the necessary defense of chastity or when any person resists the attack of a robber thorp dit que chescun home peut prender larons et sils ne voilent soi render mes estoient al defens ou fuont in tiel cas il les peut occire sans blame staundford p    also if a thief assault a true man either abroad or in his house to rob or kill him the true man is not bound to give back but may kill the assailant and it is not felony   hale p     for which he quotes co p c p     but this rule is subject to just restrictions for even a thief is not to be killed but through necessity si alio modo suam tueri possit possessionem etc see the preceding quotation from bracton  judge hale indeed seems to think that a thief may lawfully be killed if he cannot otherwise be taken if a person says he be indicted of felony and flies or being arrested by warrant or process of law upon such indictment escapes and flies and will not render himself whereupon the officer or minister cannot take him without killing of him this is not felony etc but if he may be taken without such severity it is at least manslaughter in him that kills him therefore the jury is to enquire whether it were done of necessity or not   hale     for which he cites   e   coron       assiz    stamf p c lib   cap   fol    b but this doctrine requires some further restriction for the necessity of taking a thief or retaking a prisoner or that of executing a civil writ is not so great as to justify killing when the person endeavors to escape merely by flight the necessity can only be founded in his resistance from which no man is bound to give back and this will appear by lord hales own words in another place viz but if the prisoner makes no resistance but flies yet the officer either for fear that he or some other of his party will rescue the prisoner strikes the prisoner whereof he dies this is murder for here was no assault first made by the prisoner and so it cannot be se defendendo in the officer  and again if a man be in danger of arrest by a capias in debt or trespass and he flies and the bailiff kills him it is murder etc   hales     the same point is still more accurately explained by judge foster chap   p     i rather choose to say says he it will be murder or manslaughter as circumstances may vary the case for if the officer in the heat of the pursuit and merely in order to overtake the defendant should trip up his heels or give him a stroke with an ordinary cudgel or other weapon not likely to kill and death should unhappily ensue i cannot think that this will amount to more than manslaughter if in some cases even to that offense the blood was heated in the pursuit his prey a lawful prey just within his reach and no signal mischief was intended but had he made use of a deadly weapon here is the proper distinction for which i contend it would have amounted to murder the mischievous vindictive spirit the malitia i have already explained which always must be collected from circumstances determines the nature of the offense    i say excepting these and similar cases if a man wilfully strikes another with a weapon in sudden anger the design of killing is by the weapon rendered express as i have before observed though the prepensed malice may perhaps more properly upon a sudden provocation be said to be implied and it certainly is implied or presumed in law though the sudden anger was but a moment before the fatal stroke i would willingly except from this rule if i may be allowed to do so that sudden anger which of all others is most deserving of indulgence and privilege as being incited by the most atrocious injury and affront that one man can possibly receive from another so far does it surpass in villainy every other act of injustice and dishonesty i mean the case of a husband taking the adulterer in the manner to this case alone as lord bacon informs us the ancient roman law restrained the privilege of passion to that rage and provocation only says he it gave way that it was an homicide which was justifiable but for a difference to be made adds the learned chancellor in case of killing and destroying man upon a fore thought purpose as in the case of duelling between foul and fair and as it were between single murder and vyed murder it is but a monstrous child of this latter age and there is no shadow of it in any law divine or human  so that if no proof can be produced by the prisoner of an inevitable necessity as in se defendendo the act must in reason and justice be deemed wilful murder of malice prepensed such as was sufficiently excluded from the benefit of clergy by two express acts of parliament    hen viiic i and   edw vicxii previous to the undistinguishing act of james i against stabbing  by an act of the   edw iii it was ordained that a charter of pardon shall not be granted but only where the king may do it by his oath this statute was confirmed and enforced by two subsequent statutes of the same reign  0 ed   c   and    ed   c    in the plainest terms that words are capable of expressing yet were they not sufficient to root up the disloyal practice of pardoning murderers for in the following reign king richard the ii as if in preparation to his own destruction paid so little regard to these just and necessary laws that in the parliament of his   th year the commons made grievous complaint see    r   st   of the outrageous mischiefs and damages which have happened to his said realm for that treasons murders and rapes of women be commonly done and committed and the more because charters of pardon have been easily granted in such cases and the said commons requested quested our lord the king that such charters might not be granted the three former statutes were then as they still are unrepealed and no subsequent statute had at that time been made that could possibly be construed to affect them or abate their force so that the kings disloyalty in granting such prohibited charters was notorious and his answer to the commons was not less disloyal than his practice viz that he will save his liberty and regality as his progenitors have done heretofore richard however consented to admit some considerable limitation of his pretended prerogative in pardoning murder see   stat c   whereby it is ordained that no charter of pardon from henceforth shall be allowed for murder or for the death of a man slain by await assault or malice prepensed treason or rape of a woman unless the same murder etc be specified in the same charter on a slight view the word unless may seem by a negative implication to admit the allowance of a charter of pardon for murder but sir edward coke has remarked upon it that the intention of the said act of    r   was not that the king should grant a pardon for murder by express name in the charter but because the whole parliament conceived that he would never pardon murder by special name for the causes aforesaid therefore was that provision made which was grounded says he upon the law of god quicunque effuderit humanum sanguinem fundetur sanguis illius ad imaginem quippe dei creatus est homo nec aliter expiari potest nisi per ejus sanguinem qui alterius sanguinem effuderit genesis    number      so that this learned lawyer really resolves the intention of the said act into the doctrine of the divine law for which i contend viz that blood i e wilful murder cannot be expiated but by the blood of the guilty and happily the act seems also to have been effectual to accomplish that intention for the learned judge blackstone after citing sir edward cokes opinion that it was not the intention of the parliament that the king should ever pardon murder under these aggravations etc adds and it is remarkable enough says he that there is no precedent of a pardon in the register for any homicide than that which happens se defendendo or per infortunium and with respect to the determination of the court of k b cited by salkeld     that the king may pardon on an indictment of murder as well as the subject may discharge an appeal i observe that the force of the learned judge holts argument for that doctrine rests on the repeal in    r   c   of the restrictions and great difficulties which are put upon those that shall be suitors for a pardon of murder in this act of    r   which said he were found grievous to the subject but that worthy and upright judge would have acted on this point more like himself if he had previously examined the nature of the supposed grievance whereby he would have known whether it was really true and just or only fained for if the alleged grievance to the subject was only an unjust suggestion the whole statute of repeal as far as relates to this point is null and void for the want of truth as well as for being contrary to the  d foundation of english law for contra veritatem nihil possumus and again contraveritatem lex nunquam aliquid permittit   inst     plowden etc but above all the fatal end of king richard ii should warn and deter all future monarchs from presuming to assert a prerogative to pardon murder the illfated monarch by his ignorance of the nature of royal prerogative in a limited or politic government prepared the way for his own destruction not considering that his regality had no foundation but the law and that his neglect of the latter did necessarily undermine the former which he afterward severely experienced when compelled to deliver up both crown and regality with a public confession of his own unworthiness to bear them and it is remarkable that the murders which had increased through his criminal indulgence were awefully retalited afterward in his own blood for at last he was himself also most cruelly and wickedly murdered contrary to the laws of god and man as if the blood which he had unjustly refused to cleanse from the land and expiate by the blood of the guilty had fatally rested on his own head that is to say where a man slays another in his own defense or by misfortune now with respect to the first case viz  in his own defense or se defendendo all writers both ancient and modern agree that the killing of a man must be it must be inevitable necessity pleas of the crown      p    upon an inevitable cause  d inst chap   p    and     but care must be taken that the resistance does not exceed the bounds of mere defense and prevention for then the defender would himself become an aggressor   blackstone    this is not excuseable se defendendo since there is no absolute necessity  etc   blackstone     eins tout la matier consist in le inevitable necessite sans quel le tuer nest ascun voi excusable staunford p c lib   c    he must fly so far as he may and till he be let by some wall hedge etc  that his necessity of defense may be esteemed altogether great and inevitable etc lambards eiren c   p     see note in p    inevitable and that the manstayer must be able to prove that he retired and that he was obliged ex necessitate to strike in order to save his own life a plea which cannot be admitted in favor of a man who has accepted a challenge or who has drawn his sword in sudden anger merely to revenge an affront  and with respect to the second pardonable case mentioned in the said act of edw iii viz by misfortune i must observe that there are some cases of homicide that may even be said to happen by misfortune or without intention which are nevertheless deemed murder and the severity of the law in this respect will enable me by comparison to point out more clearly the absurdity and injustice of excusing homicide in consideration of sudden anger when the mortal stroke is given with a weapon in rencounters  the cases of misfortune or accident which are deemed murder are those wherein the act which undesignedly occasions death is in itself unlawful for if the act be unlawful i mean if it be malum in se the case will amount to felony either murder or manslaughter as circumstances may vary the nature of it if it be done in prosecution of a felonious intention it will be murder but if the intent went no further than to commit a bare trespass manslaughter judge foster p     though i confess says he lord coke seems to think otherwise  if the act be unlawful says lord coke it is murder as if a meaning to steal a deer in the park of b shoots at the deer and by the glance of the arrow kills a boy that is hidden in a bush this is murder for that the act was unlawful although a had no intent to hurt the boy nor knew not of him   inst    lord chief justice holt indeed says it is but manslaughter in which he is mistaken see note in ps       and    and judge holts own opinion on another case quoted in p     see his edition of kelyng rex versus plummer     but whether this be deemed murder or manslaughter the killing is merely accidental or by misfortune and therefore is certainly a much less crime than that of aiming at and striking a man with a weapon or shooting at him in sudden anger howsoever great the previous affront may have been for in the former case though the shooting at a deer belonging to another person is both unlawful and voluntary yet the manslaughter which it accidentally occasions is involuntary and without intention whereas in the voluntary aiming and shooting at a man the act itself is not only unlawful but implies malice or rather i may say the malice is expressed by the act and the sudden anger is so far from being an excuse that it is absolutely a further proof of the malice and intention of killing the malice was also implied in the case of the lord dacres though his lordship was not half so criminal in his unlawful hunting as the passionate man who strikes with a weapon see how the case is mentioned by lord chief justice kelyng rep p    published by judge holt  the lord dacres and mansell and others in his company came unlawfully to hunt in a forest judge kelynge was mistaken in this point for the lord dacres probably would not have been treated with such severity if the trespass had been in a forest or open chase but it was in a park belonging to mr pelham in surry crompton    so that the unlawful hunting was more than a bare trespass see note p       and    see also   hawkins cap xxxi    where another ground for the imputation of murder in that case seems to be assigned viz a resolution of diverse persons to resist all opposers in the commission of a breach of the peace though it be only as he calls it a bare breach of the peace  and being resisted one of the company when the lord dacres was a great way off and not present killed a man judged murder in him and all the rest and the lord dacres was hanged  lord chief justice holt supposes a case in his rep of rex versus plummer p     in the same book which is in some degree similar so says he if two men have a design to steal a hen and the one shoots at the hen for that purpose and a man be killed it is murder in both because the design was felonious see also the last paragraph of p     inst concerning the shooting at a tame fowl of which this case supposed by judge holt is an explanation but surely the design must be much more felonious when a man wilfully strikes his neighbor with a weapon in sudden anger because this must necessarily be allowed to be an act committed felleo animo with a fell furious and mischievous mind and intent which is lambards definition of felony c vii p      the implication of malice in the owner of a beast that kills a man after warning given will also further illustrate what has been said for though mere carelessness or inconsideration might occasion his neglect so that the accident may in some degree be esteemed a misfortune yet the law implies malice for if one keep a mastiff dog says sir james astry in his charge to grand juries p    that is used to bite people near the common highway or bull or beast that has hurt any one after notice they kill any one that will be murder in the owner although not present when the fact was done and yet in this and the other precedent cases here is no express malice to be proved but what the law construes to be so this is agreeable to the doctrine of judge staunford p c lib i cap   que si home ad un jument que est accustom male fair et le owner ceo bien sachant negliga luy eins suffra daller a large et puis le jument tua un home que ceo est felony in le owner eo que per tiel sufferance le owner semble daver volunte a tuer see also crompton p    b and   hawkins c xxxi   and according to bracton the common law imputes the death of a man by a beast to any man who follows or drives the beast at the time of the misfortune  vel dum insequitur quis equum vel bovem et aliquis a bove vel equo percussus fuerit et hujusmodi hoc imputatur ei bract lib iii c iv p   0 b if this law were still enforced we should not have such continual complaints of accidents in the streets by cattle that are enraged and made mad through the cruelty of the twolegged brutes who drive them for the first step that ought to be taken in such cases is to seize the drivers and nineteen times out of twenty it will be found that the poor beast will recover itself when they are gone from the excess of fear and rage which the brutality of the hurrying drivers  si quis operam rei dederit illicitae ut cum quis boves velociter fugaverit quorum unus obviando hominem cornu occiderit fugatori imputabitur quia diligentiam quam potuit non adhibuit fleta lib i c xxiii p    had occasioned so that it is plain where the guilt is to be imputed but yet even a brutal driver is not so base and detestable as the man who wilfully strikes with a weapon in sudden anger and again he who aims to strike or shoot at a man and accidentally kills a different person whom perhaps he did not see contrary to his intention or by misfortune as it were is nevertheless deemed guilty of wilful murder though he had not the least anger or resentment against the person killed homme sagitta a un ex malicia praecogitata et luy miss et tue autre qui estoit decost et a qui and malice unc il est murder eo que il ad intent de murder cromptons edition of fitzherberts justice of peace p     as if a man says judge holt out of malice to a shoots at him to kill him but misses him and kills b it is no less a murder than if he had killed the person intended lord chief justice holts rep of rex versus plummer in kelyngs rep p     for which he quotes dyer p     cromp p  0  plowdens com p     saunderss case   rep    agnes gores case  but surely the man who actually kills the person he aims at in his anger is at least as culpable so that if sudden anger deserves no lenity in the former case it certainly deserves none in the latter several cases also are mentioned by sir william blackstone wherein sudden anger is not excusable even though the death may be said to be by misfortune as there was no real intention of killing yet rendered by the circumstances equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter see comment b iv chap xiv p     and  00 also if even upon a sudden provocation says he one beats another in a cruel and unusual manner so that he dies though he did not intend his death yet he is guilty of murder by an express malice that is by an express evil design the genuine sense of malitia as when a parkkeeper tied a boy that was stealing wood to a horses tail and dragged him along the park when a master corrected his servant with an iron bar and a schoolmaster stamped on his scholars belly so that each of the sufferers died these were justly held to be murders because the correction being excessive and such as could not proceed but from a bad heart it was equivalent to a deliberate act of slaughter but is not an express evil design as apparent in the act of striking a man with a weapon in anger be the anger ever so sudden as it is in these cases where death was not really intended for surely the design of killing is by the weapon rendered express if one executes his revenge upon a sudden provocation in such a cruel manner with a dangerous weapon as shows a malicious and deliberate intent to do mischief and death ensues it is express malice from the nature of the fact and murder woods inst   book p  0  and this must always be the case when men presume to decide their quarrels with dangerous weapons be quarrels ever so sudden and unpremeditated for the malice is by the weapons expressed and the malice prepensed is therefore implied ex telo praesumitur malum consilium etc see p     which equally fulfils the genuine sense of malitia though perhaps the prepensed malice may more properly  upon a sudden provocation as above be said to be implied than express but whether it be express or implied it undoubtedly constitutes murder for malice is the leading circumstance which distinguishes manslaughter from murder and therefore an express evil design such as is apparent in the voluntary killing of a man cannot be admitted under the head of simple homicide or manslaughter because the necessary difference is wanting in the degree of the offense according to the excellent rule before cited from sir matthew hale viz  murder being aggravated with malice presumed or implied but manslaughter not etc   hale p c      i may probably seem guilty of much tautology in this little work but hope my readers will excuse it in consideration of the necessity i am under of repeatedly comparing the crimes of striking with a weapon in sudden anger and of voluntary killing with so many other different cases wherein even involuntary and accidental killing have been solemnly adjudged murder and i apprehend that the severity of the law in the lastmentioned cases must sufficiently demonstrate such a general abhorrence in our law to the shedding of human blood that we cannot reasonably suppose the same law capable of admitting an excuse for voluntary manslaughter on any private difference howsoever great the provocation nevertheless mr hawkins ventures to assert a very different doctrine in his pleas of the crown   book c xxviii    i see no reason says he why a person who without provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever in such a manner as plainly shows an intent to murder him as by discharging a pistol or pushing at him with a drawn sword etc may not justify killing such an assailant as much as if he had attempted to rob him for is not he who attempts to murder me says he more injurious than he who barely attempts to rob me and can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my life and it is not only highly agreeable to reason that a man in such circumstances may lawfully kill another but it seems also to be confirmed by the general tenor of our law books etc  but howsoever specious this argument may appear i hope i have already proved by the general tenor of our law books that the justifiable killing of a man must be through an inevitable necessity and therefore what mr hawkins afterward advances in his comparison of such a case with homicide in se defendendo cannot in the least justify either his opinion on that point or his assertion concerning the general tenor of the law books  he endeavors to represent the voluntary killing of a man as justifiable homicide and consequently he must suppose it a less crime than excusable homicide in se defendendo  he founds his opinion in the supposition of some precedent quarrel in the latter in which says he both parties always are or at least may justly be supposed to have been in some fault so that the necessity to which a man is at length reduced to kill another is in some measure presumed to be owing to himself etc  but may it not as justly be supposed that the person who kills without such necessity is also in some fault is not the presumption of law against him as i have elsewhere shown by the bloody fact when he cannot prove that he endeavored at least to retreat in order to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and is not fact a more substantial ground for a criminal charge than any idea that a court can possibly form concerning the murderous intentions which the killer may attribute to the person killed  the single circumstance that the killer was under no necessity of endeavoring to retreat and avoid the assailant is not only a proof that his own intentions though he might not be the first aggressor were nearly as criminal as those he attributes to the person killed but it also affords a strong presumption that the latter was not very strenuous or sanguine either in his attack or in his supposed intention to commit murder so that the very pretense by which mr hawkins endeavors to justify such a voluntary killing must necessarily fall to the ground whenever the killer is unable to prove that he endeavored to avoid the attack i have already made the necessary exceptions concerning civil officers in the legal execution of justice etc and though the deceased might have had a weapon drawn yet that circumstance affords no positive proof of his criminal intention for he might have thought himself obliged to draw in his own defense through a reciprocal suspicion of his adversarys criminal intentions and as he cannot plead his own cause it is reasonable that the law should presume that he really did draw in his own defense especially as the circumstance that the killer was under no necessity of endeavoring to avoid him affords a sufficient ground for such a presumption  and even in cases where it may be supposed that the person killed might really have had an intent to murder we ought to remember that the laws of england do not punish men merely for their criminal intentions without some fact and therefore it would be highly absurd to suppose that the law without some apparent necessity would entrust every individual indiscriminately with a supreme authority which it denies even to the highest and most solemn courts of justice i mean an authority to inflict capital punishment without a previous trial per pares and that merely for a criminal intention which in many cases might as easily through fear passion or violent prejudice be mistaken or imaginary as be real  and therefore an assault upon the person is not as i have before insisted in p   against the opinion of judge foster provocation sufficient to free the party killing from the guilt of murder  the case of gentlemen in the army nevertheless seems peculiarly hard upon such unhappy occasions the first principle of their profession is courage and the world in general is too depraved to distinguish in what cases a man of true courage may retreat with honor from the assault of an enemy so that military men are liable to be unjustly despised whenever they act reasonably in cases either of insult or assault  yet at the same time it ought to be remembered that those men who submit to the slavish yoke of other mens depraved opinions or unreasonable customs in contradiction to that natural knowledge of good and evil which they inherit in common with the rest of mankind from our first parents cannot justly be deemed men of honor and consequently are unworthy of rank in the honorable profession of arms and though such men may support an outward appearance of courage in the eye of the world by daring to violate the laws of god and man in private quarrels yet that very act affords the most manifest token of the want of real and steady courage for unless the submission to that depraved custom can be attributed to inconsideration or to the want of knowledge it must necessarily be supposed that the duellist had not sufficient courage to assert his natural right of acting agreeable to the dictates of his own reason and conscience and was unable to face the terrors of an adverse fortune in a good cause and therefore like a wretched coward he yielded himself a prisoner and slave to the fashionable depravity  i am far from meaning however to charge all soldiers with cowardice that have fought duels sometimes passion and false pride but more frequently inconsideration and ignorance of the laws of god and man as i have before hinted occasion the base submission and conformity to those false and unreasonable notions of honor which almost universally prevail  nor do i so much blame the military gentlemen for this unnatural depravity as i do the professors of the law who ought to have set them a better example and yet have rather contributed to the ignorance of the times by the many gross perversions of our law which they have admitted into the books gentlemen of the army are not obliged indeed to acquire a critical knowledge of the law but they must not forget that they are men as well as soldiers and that if they do not maintain the natural privilege of men viz that of thinking for themselves and acting agreeable to the dictates of their own conscience as members of the community they are unfit for british soldiers of whom the law requires an acknowledgement of her supremacy  for the law will not excuse an unlawful act by a soldier even though he commits it by the express command of the highest military authority in the kingdom and much less is the soldier obliged to conform himself implicitly to the mere opinions and false notions of honor which his superiors may have unfortunately adopted  even in public military service or warlike expeditions by national authority the law manifestly requires the soldier to think for himself and to consider before he acts in any war whether the same be just for if it be otherwise the common law of this kingdom will impute to him the guilt of murder  and though the law does not actually punish such general crimes as may unfortunately have obtained at any time the sanction of government yet the time will certainly come when all such temporizing military murderers must be responsible for the innocent blood that is shed in an unjust war if they have rendered themselves accessaries to it by an implicit and therefore criminal obedience to the promoters of it item fit homicidium in bello says the learned bracton et tunc videndum utrum bellum sit justum vel injustum si autem injustum tenebitur occisor si autem justum sicut pro defensione patriae non tenebitur nisi hoc fecerit corrupta voluntate et intention bracton lib   c   de corona p       men of true honor therefore at the same time that they are sensible of their duty as soldiers and subjects to their king must be mindful that they are subject also to the empire of reason and are bound thereby in common with all mankind to maintain the dignity and natural freedom of human nature and those soldiers who in addition to their natural reason have a true sense of religion will not only be mindful that they are soldiers and subjects to an earthly king but that they are also soldiers and subjects to the king of kings whose laws and precepts they will on all occasions prefer to every other command and will obey the same with such a steady courage as may be equal to every adversity and undeserved suffering that threatens them this doctrine is censured by a critic in the monthly review for jan      who calls it a strange principle in an age of infidelity indeed it may perhaps be allowed in one sense to be a strange principle but then we have the greatest reason to lament the ignorance and depravity of those men who esteem it so in any other sense than that of being too often neglected and transgressed for i trust that no man who admits or believes the divine authority of the holy scriptures will doubt the truth of it if this strange principle had not been equally true the english nation would long ago have been enslaved and even the very standing army itself would by this time have been reduced to that abject state of political slavery which disgraces the standing armies of unlimited monarchies and renders them very truly the abomination of desolation and the belluina potestas or power of the beast against which the vengeance of the almighty is denounced in the holy scriptures see a note on the word command or imperium in p    of my tract on the means of national defense by a free militia   it was this indispensible this happy disposition and sense of superior duty which prevailed even in an unlawful standing army that had been raised and was expressly designed for arbitrary purposes and which nevertheless contrary to all expectation exerted itself in saving this kingdom at the glorious revolution from the political slavery which then threatened it as well as from the more intolerable tyranny of the romish religion  the soldier therefore who has not courage enough to profess on all occasions a strict obedience to the laws of his country according to the dictates of his own reason and conscience in preference to every command and every other opinion whatever is unworthy of the british military service being qualified rather to be inlisted with the slavish troops of absolute monarchs or to serve in the black banditti of the emperor of morocco  but i must return once more to the opinions of the professors of law  it is said this opinion is in the true style of a tradition such as those by which the jews of old perverted the law that if he who draws upon another in a sudden quarrel make no pass at him till his sword is drawn and then fight with him and kill him is guilty of manslaughter only etc   hawkins pleas of the crown cxxxi    for which he quotes kelynge       and     but the pretense for this indulgence is as frivolous as the doctrine is false viz because says mr hawkins that by neglecting the opportunity of killing the other before he was on his guard and in a condition to defend himself with like hazard to both he showed that his intent was not so much to kill as to combat with the other in compliance with those common notions of honor etc  but is not the intent to kill or to do some bodily harm and certainly at least the risque of killing included in the intention to combat with dangerous weapons and is it justice nay is it common sense to excuse a notorious crime by the plea of an intention to commit another crime almost as bad  i have already shown by fair comparison with a variety of cases that the crime of wilfully striking or combating with weapons in sudden anger is a much more unlawful act than many others wherein even involuntary and accidental homicide has been solemnly adjudged murder and has been generally admitted as such by the sages of our law in their reports and it will therefore be highly disgraceful to our law but more particularly because deservedly to the professors of it if they should still persist in the unreasonable and unjust practice of punishing lesser crimes with more severity than the crying sin of voluntary manslaughter which as i have already proved in my preface is absolutely unpardonable in this world by the laws of god  glory in the highest to god and on earth peace toward men
