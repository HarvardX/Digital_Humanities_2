the conduct of christians made the sport of infidels in a letter from a turkish merchant at amsterdam to the grand mufti at constantinople on occasion of some of our national follies but especially the late scandalous quarrel among the clergy  london printed for s baker at the black boy and anchor in paternoster row      price sixpence  the conduct of christians etc the introduction kara selym oglan merchant of amsterdam is by birth an armenian of the lesser georgia on the confines of persia he was born of christian parents of the greek church but being taken away young by his mothers brother and carried into aleppo he was then bred a mohammedan and his said uncle being a very considerable merchant he removed him afterward to constantinople  here he lived some years in a flourishing condition and his wealth and commerce increasing and having contracted an acquaintance with some of the dutch and french turkey merchants he resolved to travel he took his first tour through france and germany going in the habit of an armenian merchant or as we vulgarly style them a grecian and at length with two of his brothers he settled in holland where he grew in wealth and general correspondence to an exceeding degree  his occasions or his curiosity led him at length to come over to england where it seems by the tenor of his correspondence he resided when some very late affairs were transacting and which is more remarkable he was it seems an eyewitness of the late remarkable churchquarrel between two christian muftis or bishops as he calls them from whence whether he went over to holland himself or wrote to his brothers to convey the following letter to the mufti at constantinople is not essential to the story but the letter it self as it came to our hands is as follows  kara selym the meanest of the slaves of the invincible emperor of the ottomans residing in the land of unbelievers to thee venerable muli ibrahim esad the wisest of the wise most excellent among those that excel great sacrificer to god and his prophet mahomet interpreter of impenetrable oracles and priest of the heavenly law  i bow my head to the dust under thy venerable feet o thou divine image of heavenly wisdom beseeching thee to inflame my soul with an ardour becoming a true mussulman inhabiting the tents of infidels and idolworshippers  mahomet our immortal prophet who from the beginning cursed the whole race of unbelievers among whom i dwell gave them for a guide the worst of all the infernal furies i mean a spirit of discord and eternal strife and this offspring of hell so influences them to this day that they not only constantly incline to factions and divisions among themselves but it is even as their food to them to quarrel and wrangle to fight and cast stones at one another nay it is their political support and they maintain the several interests among them and cause the strength of their states to subsist by the means of continual strife and disorder  thou know immortal esad the innumerable divisions which reign here among these despisers of our law and how they maintain eternal wars with one another a temper ever auspicous to our invincible empire whose foundations were laid in the first dissentions of the princes of the nazarenes their divisions were the first encouragements to mighty ottoman the founder of the empire of the mussulmans after him the invincible mahomet justly styled the great who fixed the happy port and seated the ensigns of our prophet in the metropolis of the grecian empire next to his undaunted resolution and the daring courage of his bassas which gave an edge to the weighty sabres of his jannizaries and envigorated the soldier with an ardour not to be resisted i say next to this he made the divisions of the grecian empire the footsteps to his glory and the avarice and strife of the votaries to the cross opened the door to the innumerable armies of the east  nothing can be more delightful venerable and sanctified muli than to read the histories of these nazarenes which they have written innumerable volumes of in their several languages and keep together in repositories which they call libraries i have taken unwearied pains to master their several tongues that i might know the original of the respective countries but above the rest their customs and manners and by this industrious search i suppose i have made some observations which may be useful to thee with whom are reposed as in a treasury the foundations of wisdom and understanding  be it known then unto thee venerable and sage the bright oracle of council and knowledge that these nazarenes among whom i dwell are a people justly detestable by the faithful believers for those vices in practice which are unknown to the followers of our holy prophet and they particularly expose themselves to our just hatred in the following things in which thou may credit me fully that i lie not unto thee  i swear by thy sacred person and office by the hoary head of my father and grandfather by the gray hairs now increasing on my face that i scarce believed there were such people suffered to live on the face of the earth as i find these christians to be well has our holy prophet in the divine oracles of the sacred alchoran commanded us to have no intimate ties either of relation or friendship with these people who he has called faithless treacherous perjured and has declared to be unqualifyd for the conversation of innocent persons who do no evil and are therefore exposed to the snares of those that lie in wait to betray  verily it is no new thing in these countries for fathers to betray their children and for children again to maltreat despise and curb their parents these are crimes which our more just laws punish with death the just authority as well as reverence of parents being kept sacred by the instinct of affections proceeding from natures economy in mans soul are likewise preserved secure and uninvaded by the mussulmans law and the rebelling son who insults his parents receives his due reward at the hand of the executioner o much to be reverenced and admired justice among the faithful followers of our great prophet how much do many of these profligate people who they call christians deviate from thy rules and dishonor even that nature whose dictates they know as well as feel in their own breasts equally with other creatures  here variance and strife reigns in families and children hold their parents in open defiance to the scandal of humane nature eternal alla in their language is the name of god alla in saying that tremendous word i bowed my head three times and turning my face toward the rising of the sun i worshipped laying my hands upon my beard also repeating the words three times with all reverence and true devotion alla alla alla said i how does my soul detest these nazarenes who howbeit they loudly profess to serve and worship him whom they call god and that crucified prophet who they exalt equal to the one god that made them and the world yet hold they his name in so little reverence as to repeat it without any regard to the majesty of his dreadful being even on the most common and trivial occasions  so little do they give homage to the unutterable divinity of the creator that with an impious levity they will in the selfsame hour worship and blaspheme using his tremendous name this moment with a seeming but hypocritical devotion and the next moment without the least reverence no not so much as seeming or in appearance can repeat the same awful words in sport and recreation can any thing be more to be abhorred in the world blessed by us be the immortal mahomet who has commanded us to detest and abhor men who by such abominable practices justly call upon us to have them in detestation  nor is this all by far which is hateful to just men in the manners of these people for being as i shall tell thee further on my particular affairs in one of the islands of the northern ocean called brit  after i had spent some time to learn the speech used therein i found the people of that country albeit they seemed more devout and religious than other nations and had among them innumerable temples for their worship yet were they in one of the vilest and most unnatural excesses of crime so far gone beyond the wickedness of all the nations in the world that i cannot but give thee an idea of them as of the worst of all christians appealing to thy unerring knowledge to discern if i do injustice to these wretched people yea or no  these people as i said appear religious and have built innumerable temples to their god in these they worship in great seeming devotion lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven and praying with loud repeatings and responses to their god to have mercy upon them to hear them saying such words as these i alla zeidama zeidama reis musa yeidasi alla which in their language is sounded thus o christ hear us we beseech thee to hear us good lord lord have mercy upon us etc   and yet if we follow these christians out of their mosques or temples of worship and come to converse with them in their common affairs we shall hear the same mouth that before called to their god to have mercy upon them call upon him with horrible rage and blasphemous fury to damn them horrid infidelity or unsufferable blasphemy is it possible that these men can believe that this god they pray to is able to damn them no that cannot be they are too wise to call upon him to do it if they believed him to be able nor is this any testimony of the excess of their ordinary passions when they thus imprecate the wrath of their god for it is the cursory way of their speech it might admit excuse were it done as in some fierce provocations and in extraordinary motions of the spirits which urge the people of other nations to swear or curse but as i said that these go beyond all nations in this wickedness viz of praying to god to punish and damn themselves so they do it in sport in jest for their diversion and even for no occasion at all which testifies that they esteem not their god as the nature of a divine infinite being directs men to esteem him but look on him as a being that merits to be mocked and ridiculed not worshipped and adored  when first i heard this with my own ears having learned the speech of the country as above i stood amazed and turning my face toward the mysterious tomb of our great prophet i blessed the name of mahomet thrice lifting up my hands to heaven giving thanks to god that i was not a christian and above all that i was not a british christian after which looking round me i stamped thrice on the ground saying surely the great one god that reigns omnipotent is not in this place what do i here and vowed to mahomet to be gone and not to set the foot of a believing mussulman again upon that unholy place  were it to happen for the good of mankind sublime patron of the true believers that thou would be but one month in this place thou would assuredly cause the very name of christian to be detested among all the true worshippers of our immortal alla when thou should relate to them from that mouth whence flow the everlasting oracles of truth what horrid impieties what contempt of all religion what dishonor to the very notion of a god reigning over the universe abounds in the common practice of these people as we the true mussulmen worship one god so we pay our fear and homage ever to him tremble and cover our eyes at the mention of his name and are not to be brought by any excess of passion or wine or any other intemperance to speak irreverently of that power we worship but these people pray to him one moment and blaspheme him the very next moment in the most infamous manner and this with an infidelity and contempt of his omnipotence inexpressibly scandalous  i could not soon deliver my thoughts from the just abhorrence which this thing had given me of the christian name o mabomet said i beloved of heaven surely these are the people of whom thou have said god shall destroy the wickedest of men from the face of the earth why have not thy immortal crescents been here displayed and the innumerable teftas or legions of thy servant the invincible emperor whom thou crownest with victory been extended to these islands to remove such a race of men from the face of the earth  but as i was musing upon these things i determined that while i stayed in this  to me amazing country and especially because i resolved never to come so far within the dominions of lucifer the prince of blasphemies any more i say i determined to know as much as i could receive of the disposition and conduct of the people of this country that i might lay it before thee and that thou may curse them with the curses of mahomet and might continue to bless the undesiled land where inhabit the true children of virtue  upon farther search into the wickedness of these lands i found them to be infamous in my eyes beyond all the nations of the earth on several other occasions for know renowned among the servants of our prophet that as we believe the nazarenes are the most wicked people upon the face of the earth for the detestable crimes of fraud injustice rapine adultery and drunkenness so when i am speaking to thee of the crimes of those they call brit  whom i esteem by far the wickedest of all other christians i shall not speak in thy sacred ears of the crimes they commit in common with the rest of the race of unbelievers but of those inimitable excesses in which they are supposed to run beyond the rest of mankind and in which they make themselves detestable even in the eyes of other christians who are not indeed able to match or come near them in wickedness  i have given thee one example i shall now give thee another viz that they are a nation who have so little dread upon them of the unutterable name of god that albeit they have diverse good laws forbidding the sin of swearing by the name of their god that yet they are the most subject to the detestable crime of perjury of any nation which i have conversed with under the sun and this more especially is caused by two things which we the true worshippers of god and believers of the truth wisely and carefully shun and avoid   the want of a due reverence to the god which they worship of whom if they believed his justice they ought to be so afraid as that they could by no means swear by his name in such trivial things as they do or as to give so little regard to what they have sworn after they have attested it in his sacred name i advertise thee here that by the swearing here mentioned i do not mean the common swearing in discourse of which indeed the whole race of the christians of every nation are most horribly guilty so that even in the streets nothing is heard more common than that the young children take the name of their fathers god into their mouths horribly swearing cursing and profaning his name whom at the same time they pretend to acknowledge and to worship and this not only without punishment by the magistrates but even without so much as a reproof from their fathers  but this i say is a sin in common with other of the nations of the unbelievers and therefore i am not now upon that but upon their swearing in decision of controverted things between one and another by the authority of their laws in which case this nation above all the christian tribes are execrably guilty for as much as they make slight of that thing called an oath invoking the name of their god to the meanest trifles familiarizing the very taking an oath by the frequency of it so that the often calling their god to witness in their little private cases is made to depreciate not only the solemnity of the oath it self but even to destroy that awe which all nations ought to entertain of the deity which they worship  but secondly this is not all for if i am not misinformed of the nature of the same of the oaths which these horrid men called nazarenes are obliged by their laws to take nay which they are often obliged to repeat they are of such a nature as that it is almost impossible but that they should be broken and yet the wretches tremble not when they take them and to confirm the truth of this to thee for the offense is of such a nature that thou may even suspect that by living so long among infidels and christians i should have learned to lie as they do i say to confirm this to thee i here signify to thee that while i lived in that country called brit  a book or writing was published among them written by one whose heart was touched with the infamy of such a practice in which the author who was a man skilled in their law and of the degree whom they call there sergeants at law undertook to charge the schools of their priests which are kept at two cities remote from their capital city i say undertook to charge them with this most detestable crime of perjury and that not from a mere casual neglect or breach of their law but even by the necessity of their foundation and the laws of their said schools which as he made plain to the world imposed such oaths at the entrance of the scholars into their said schools and afterward at their taking degrees on their farther advancement in the knowledge of letters as it was impossible for them to keep and as it was by the practice of the several schools absolutely necessary to break so that in a word most venerable muli the youth of these schools if this lawyer says true are brought up to this miserable necessity of provoking the divine justice to blast and destroy them and yet these are the race of their priests and the instructors of their people what then must be the people who they instruct this thou will easily conclude must be according to that wicked example for our prophet has told us that evil laws cannot produce good government  these venerable father of wisdom are some of the crimes practiced in that part of the country of the nazarenes which i have related and for which i doubt not thou will declare them infamous in thy heavenly zune or book of principles which i know thou art compiling for the instruction of the faithful  but neither are these the sum of their just characters for innumerable follies attend them in the rest of their conduct which no doubt thou will ascribe to heavens just vengeance on a nation of unbelievers for sins against the knowledge they have had given to them for over and above the horrible sins of forswearing as above and calling upon their gods to damn them they have one thing which is their peculiar and which i think is their punishment for other crimes rather than that it is in it self a crime and this that they are the most wrangling contentious selfdivided people in the universe  it would offend thy ears thou who art the patron of peace if i should enter into the tedious recital of their eternai feuds as well about the affairs of state as of religion the history would require a volume of ten times the extent of the holy alchoran and take up the life of a younger man than i am to write the same  it happened to be when i was there a time of more than ordinary turns and changes in their state and thoi resided there but few years i saw no less than four faces on the courts and divans of their princes  it was my lot to be first there in the reign of their queen whose ambassador at the thrice happy port kissed the robe of our mighty emperor and whose name was anna a princess not able by reason of her sex to influence the turbulence of her courtiers but why do i say as a woman if i may believe the relation they give of themselves no masculine monarch they have had has been able by the authotity either of his wisdom or of his office to guide the ambitious designs of his courtiers in that country but as they are ever hunting after profits and preferments so they are ever forming factions and parties against one another which they support vigorously by drawing over the nobility to favor now one side now the other till they grow formidable even to the monarch himself who finds himself under the necessity of coming into the feud and to espouse now this side then another as his interest guides him and this especial character you may take from me of their temper viz that however zealous they are or rather seem to be for the public good while they are in power and employ yet if the prince happens to frown and to displace at any time one of these men they make no scruple to join with the adverse party and turn enemies to that very administration which they were espousing before  if it was thus during the reign of the politic kings who went before it may with much more reason be supposed to be so in the late queens reign who being in her self of a peaceable disposition would very fain have contented all sides and was obliged to leave her administration in the hands of those people who she employed who contending so furiously one with another as not to be appeased much less hindered by her authority she seemed to be little more than a name among them the parties guiding her as this or that side appeared more numerous to act now this way now that even in contradiction under the influence of one side to the maxims of the other nor was it so in her reign only but even in the reign of the king her immediate predecesfor and it begins very much to be so even in the reign of the successor nor does his bearing the character of the wisest and most mighty prince among the nazarenes or christians alter the case the influence of parties being still so great that even that wisdom for which this prince is so famous directs him to act very much by the agency of the parties as he thinks fit to let this or that faction have the leading influence in his affairs only with this difference that he does not suffer this blindly and uninformd as has at other times been the case but rather necessarily to support his own interests which might otherwise be in hazard to public disaffections if he did not permit one party to flatter themselves with the notions of being in his favor that they might balance the insolence of those who really were the object of his aversion  whatever is the case most true it is that the court in this divided part of the world is continually formed into and led by parties and factions of politicians who are heaving and thrusting at one another with that violence as that it is hard to say there is at any time a calm interval in which they are not inthe utmost confusion on this account  in these disorders it is no less strange to see how both sides constantly claim to themselves the title of patriots and tell the world they are acting for the public good and yet if any one however violent in that side and which at that time is in favor happens to be turned out he never fails to go over to the other extreme as likewise the other if taken in fails not to join with the party in place still continuing to pretend to an unalterable zeal for the public good by this means it is not to be expressed how natural it is to these men to change their party and principles and to call evil good and good evil just as their interest guides for be it known to thee immortal father of sage councils there was scarce a great courtier in that country or a chief minister in the administration of their affairs who has not thought it convenient to his interest to be on every side now on this side now on that then again on this turning as often even as the advancement of his avarice or ambition guided  even at this juncture that court is agitated or disturbed with the discontents of some of those men who at the acceffion of the prince now reigning were the most zealous for his inteest and the warmest in the prosecuting and pushing on the resentments of the public against those who opposed him and yet no sooner did this prince find himself obliged to dismiss some of these from their employments in his court but they immediately shook hands and contracted friendship with those who they had treated as criminals before and it is not much doubted that were the like measures taken with some if not all that remain they would do the same  how much more advantageous to the public peace and agreeable to the nature of government is the divine authority of the grand seignior our glorious emperor who when he finds it for the good of his government to displace from the great employs of state or remove from the councils of his imperial divan his grand viziers or other officers of state gives them their quietus by the more easy and indisputed authority of the bowstring removing thereby all the caballing and intrieguing of parties in order to replace favorites and effectually prevent faction and disorder had the british princes exercised this authority with their displaced courtiers who perhaps as well deserved that treatment as any of our more faithful bassas the spirit of strife and faction had long since been banished from that court but it seems they have certain laws and constitutions among themselves which abridge their princes of so wholesome an authority and this perhaps may be a reason why the courtiers take such freedoms which in our happy port is never heard of which laws as they are one way the safety of the ministers so they are the other way the reason of those insults upon their princes and those factions and divisions among the courtiers and people of which i have been relating some part  but to pass from these things i must inform thee that these are the least of these public confusions in this country sure the gods of these christians are going to cast them off and are resolved to bring them to destruction by the agency of their own follies seeing they suffer them to fall into such breaches and such continual quarrels as are not consistent with their being as a nation and which exposes them to the scorn and contempt even of all their fellow creatures while i was among them such a feud began among there dervices or priests as has administered matter of laughter to all the world at the same time that it has left them at home in the utmost wrath and confusion  did these nazarenes but know how justly we laugh at their unaccountable and most ridiculons contentions and how it confirms the followers of our great prophet in their most just abhorrence of that religion which is not able to preserve the peace and harmony of its professors surely they would be wiser  doubtless divine patron of the faithful religion is a foundation of celestial blessedness to which it leads by the paths of peace love unity and all manner of beneficence those who cloth themselves with the chaste robes of religion and harbor within a reserve of bitterness are like the snakes of arabia and libya which under the most beauteous and admirable skin painted with all kinds of delightful colors and sending forth a most odoriferous smell harbor an incurable poison  but to return to the case in hand it will be needful for thee to be faithfully informed of the infernal spirit of contention which rages among these christians that thou may thereby make those nazarenes who come among us at the illustrious port ashamed of their country and of their religion and may successfully exhort them to believe in the pure doctrines of mahomet and to embrace the faith of the mussulmen which teaches justice and peace love and virtue and implacably hates and detests those pretended religions which permits such fountains of strife and contention to flow among those who call themselves religious  certainly the paths which lead to paradise must partake of that haven of peace strife rage contention and hatred burning in the breast of men is a fire kindled from the eternal lake where evil spirits inhabit and therefore partakes of the nature of that place in vain therefore do these christian priests strive to persuade men that they are the servants of the high god with whom dwells peace while they are armed with rage envy contention and unnatural malice against each other waging war with one another even to the murdering the good name of their neighbor by all possible slander which is worse than killing his body  and that thou may not think i do injustice even to these infidels i shall give thee illustrious guide of verity a brief account of the war kindled among those british dervises of whom i spoke  and first thou may understand that there has been a division first among them not merely religious but rather political some of the churchmen choosing rather to suffer the loss of their ecclesiastic livings than to take oaths of fidelity and recognition to the present king whom they esteem an usurper tthese to maintain their separation renounce certain doctrines formerly held among them to wit of the king being supreme head of the church from whence they infer that the present government of the church is schismatical that they are not lawfully deposed and turned out of their benefices but that the civil power has usurped upon the church which they had nothing to do with and that the right of succession to ecclesiastic promotion is still theirs  the civil government answers this with coertion as indeed such trifling deserved and being supported by the great divan which they call their parliament they regard not the objections of the priests and this is a division which in its self has much embarrassd the nation  but there is a new war since broken out among the priests which are on the side of the government and are opposers of those they call here the deprived clergy  assuredly i do not miscall it when i say it is a war although it be not carried on with sabre or gun or any other carnal instrument of offense a war of the tongue in these countries is oftentimes more fatal than that of the sword and though these men rather scold than fight yet to use their own words they cast firebrands arrows and death they cast firebrand words enflamed from hell words of bitterness to provoke and enrage the persons they are bent against and raise the passions to a flame their words are arrows dipped in poison and are sure to give mortal wounds to the reputation of the persons they are cast at and death because to kill the fame of our neighbor is according to the rules of our exalted prophet mahomet a wilful and most cruel murder  all these circumstances attend the case which as i have hinted happened in this place the history take briefly thus there was a certain rabbi or priest of the christians who had been lately exalted by the favor of the prince to the degree of a mufti or patriarch or as they call him here a bishop of one of their provinces this person being for reputation eminent and in learning and popular esteem very advantageously represented to the government was called to make an harangue or oration before their king he discharged the work very much to the satisfaction of the prince and of all the assembly so that he received the kings command to make the same public by print  but he had no sooner done so than some of the priests of the same temple envying him the glory which his preaching so they call it here had brought to him on these occasions raised a terrible commotion against certain doctrines and positions which he bad there laid down and asserted objecting that they were not suitable to the rules laid down in their law or alchoran a book which they universally believed to be the rule of their faith concerning those doctrines and which they call the bible  the opposition made to this discourse was so great that much strife and loss of charity was found between them many opposing this mufti and that with such warmth as to use him very scurvily upon this occasion nay at length the great divan or assembly of the priests in that temple took him to task resolving to censure both this mufti and his book supposing his principles to be false and doctrines unsound  this was carrydon with such warmth that it was feared the mufti would have been run down by that assembly when on a sudden the king by whose license they act here in such cases interposed his authority and for the present took away their power of acting atall sending them away before they had power to do what mischief they had intended  the truth is that assembly which they call here in their language the convocation has not been eminent as i could learn for any considerable actions of late years which is principally by some learned men laid to the door of these causes    the too absolute power of the prince without whose license they are not empowered to act no nor so much as to conveen   a kind of natural indisposition in them to act with unanimity and agreement in any thing this assembly being sent away the said mufti seemed then to have the victory more eminently as to his said doctrines as well as to his party when behold the other priests taking fire at this fell upon him with so much the greater violence till in a word almost all the churchmen in the nation were embarrassd in the quarrel on one side or another and so far were they from regarding him the more for the respect which was shown him by their king that indeed he was the more furiously attacked upon that account so that the parties which divide the state here began to embark in this religious broil and so call it as they do almost in all such things a party cause  but as if by the nature of the thing the said priests were fated to make themselves contemptible among the people and indeed infamous to all the world another incident occurred which brought the quarrel to be more abstractly a mere quarrel of the priests and the state differences or parties to have no concern in it and as the occasion of this as well as the manner of carrying it on was most particularly scandalous to the name of christians in general as such so it must be the more agreeable to thee to have a full account of the same  the first quarrel as i have told thee being checked by the kingly power was taken up by the priests and carried on in defense of what their assembly or convocation had begun and some writings passed on both sides full of invectives and foul language such as they frequently give to one another in this country in such cases reproaching one another with ignorance insincerity and equivocation in a most scandalous manner insomuch that some of their own people who were wiser than the rest began to admonish them on both sides to consider how they exposed themselves to the laughter and ridicule of their enemies as indeed was most just for as there is several divisions and schisms in this wretched country in their religion some worshipping after one way and some after another some entertaining notions of their god after this way and some after that with infinite animosity and confusion so all those sects or sorts of christians who were not of the same with those who had the name of the established church were well pleased to see the confusion which this breach among the priests of that church had put them into and insulted them most openly upon that occasion jesting in particular with them for that they on one and the same side preached up the schismatic doctrines and yet possessed as they said the episcopal authority and the profits of it both which they preached down by their words and doctrines  on the other hand it was said that those priests who opposed these new doctrines did it because they were loath to let their power of oppressing and persecuting those who separated from them in opinion go out of their hands thus while they foolishly contended they exposed their own nakedness even as priests not only to the said sects or sorts of nazarenes who differed from them but indeed made their whole profession it self appear ridiculous to those who were the enemies of the whole system  had thou seen venerable apostle of mahomet how furiously these people called christians opposed one another how scandalously they treated the personal characters of their opposers how they embraced all occasions to expose one another as hypocrites and deceivers one side calling the other usurpers of authority which their great prophet the messiah had reserved to himself and oppressors of the consciences of men by ecclesiastic scarecrows and engines of human invention not appointed from heaven the other side in the mean time recriminating and charging the first with destroying the regal authority of the prince in ecclesiastic causes and deflowring the church plundering her of all power of government and discipline and rendering her as a virgin exposed to be ravished by every intruder i say had thou been here it must necessarily have caused in thee a holy detestation of that religion which was thus macerated and mangled by its own professors thou would have been fired the more with zeal for the pure and undivided principles of the mussulmen and confirmed them in the faith and doctrines of mahomet among whose innumerable worshippers no such divisions are heard of much less any such scandalous contenders are found  but if these disputes were scandalous to the nazarene religion it self and injured the reputation of the dervises who were inexcusably guilty of the most shameful conduct to one another i say if this was scandalous to their religion and exposed the priests thereof to the censures of the people thou will be surpised when thou shall hear that what follows made them perfectly despicable and contemptible even to the whole world the case was thus  one of the priests of the convocationparty and who most vigorously had opposed the mufti or bishop in the principles which as i said he had advanced in his sermon before the king charged him with hypocrisy and prevarication and with affirming a solemn falsehood viz in saying that he preached his sermon without the knowledge of any man living whereas he had as this priest alleged shown it to a certain person and submitted it to his correction before it was preached and not only so but that the said person had advised with him and prevailed to put certain saving words or clauses into his said sermon which should serve to bring him off from the critical reflections which might be made upon him by his enemies  this was a home stroke upon the bishop and could he not have cleared himself must have rendered him infamous among all that pretended to honesty or reputation for it loaded him with the scandal of being a premeditated liar and as his enemies would have improved it he must have been ruined by it but he as on the one side he avowed himself innocent of the charge so being resolute to cast the scandal back upon his enemies with all the advantage possible and fully to expose them he called upon his opposite to make good the charge declared it to be false attested the contrary in the most positive terms defied him to produce the man and if not demanded of him to recant and acknowledge the scandal in a word he told him if he did not he must be content to have the world believe him to be something which he thought too bad to name indeed i could have told him what to name viz a brsh christian which if it were not contemptible above all christians to us before must needs be so now as these men have managed their scheme any one would believe that upon this publication the friends of this man were in pain for him for though he was not a mufti or bishop yet he was one of those who the jews at constantinople call rabbis and are here styled doctors and was a man of learning who had been honored formerly with representing the church  so they call their body of religious people here at the general meetings of the learned men of their professions in germany which commission he discharged with great reputation but he soon delivered his friends from the pain they were in about him and that not only on his own account but on the account of all the party i mean the politicians who had espoused that part of the quarrel and cast off the whole charge from himself upon another mufti who as it happened was of the same party with the first so that from this time the quarrel was among those who were friends before in politics and it could be made a party cause no longer as is mentioned before  this gave some cause of triumph to the party and friends of the doctor and made them secretly rejoice that it fell among their enemies not caring how much they were exposed nor did the first mufti abate them an inch for their being of his own party but pretending the calumny should lie where it ought to lie he proceeded by daily public notices in print to push at the discovery of the fraud as he called it and the doctor having named the person and fixed it upon that person beyond all possibility of denial stood effectually clear  this person being a man of equal dignity in the church with the first all the eyes of the nation were turned upon him the first mufti or bishop spared him not neither his equality of office his seniority of age or his being of the same politic party weighed with him he challenged him in the same earnest manner as he had done the doctor before  it would have pleased you illustrious father of the true believers to have seen what wretched work these men made of this new contest the new defendant acquitted himself most scandalously ill he prevaricated contradicted himself shuffled equivocated in a word he left no stone unturned to disengage himself from the noose in which he was taken but still had the misfortune to make his case worse by every step he took to make it better  first he would have doubled with the doctor and denied part of the words alleging that he had said the additions to the sermon were made not before it was preached but before it was published but the doctor affirmed positively that it was otherwise and brought such circumstances to prove it as put an end to that dispute then the bishop named another doctor of the same church but he denied it under his hand and exposed the bishop as a doting old man who had heard somebody say the words but did not know who and had named him to them having told the story so often till he believed it to be true the battle now was transferred from the bishop and the bishop to the bishop and this other doctor who is called a dean and here began a contest so scandalous as blessed be our great prophet was never heard of among the professors of the faith of mahomet nothing but the nazarenes could ever be guilty of such a scandalous contention  were it not that nothing can be so vile but we may find examples of it among the pretenders to religion in these parts of the world it would be matter of astonishment to see two men dressed up in robes of religion dignified with titles among the teachers of the people and esteemed as reverend fathers in their church opposing each other with an equally obstinacy and fury affirming with the greatest imprecations two contraries one of which only can be true the one pledging his eternal salvation on the truth of his part the other imprecating his god to help him here and judge him hereafter according to the truth of his part and yet one of these we all know must speak falsely  blessed ibrahim king of the priests of mahomet what wicked people are these nazarenes doubtless their great prophet jesus who we believe to have been an holy person will not approve of this their behavior and if he is to judge them at last as they affirm to believe he will certainly condemn them to some terrible punishment for such abominable things as these  in the mean time had not heaven denied the people of these nations the knowledge of the just oracles of our law or were they in the neighborhood of righteous people who are honored with the truth when they behold the upright dealings of the faithful mussulmen the abhorrence we entertain of all such wicked doings as these they would no doubt embrace the ways of light and truth  for it is most evident that the common people of these lands do sincerely detest the faithless dealings of these men and it brings them into the utmost contempt with those who are to be guided to happiness by their direction how much more must it serve to make the name of a christian odious to us who are guided by principles and rules which teach us to do justice and to speak truth with our lips  surely these men had much better embrace the law of mahomet which guides to immortal pleasures and leads us by the path of virtue and justice seeing no such strife no such contention no such feuds and above all no such abominable prevarications are to be found among us the righteous mussulmen believers in god and followers of his great prophet  i wonder the imperial port of our invincible emperor crowned with the moon and shined on with the radiant light of heaven suffers these insidels to traffic in and reside there and to carry on their negociations without demanding the like liberty for the followers of mahomet who were they planted here would by their just and righteous dealings in contradiction to the inimitable fraud and knavery their perfect uniformity of religion and unity in affection in contradiction to the continual fraud dissension and division here practiced soon shame these nazarenes out of their religion and bring thousands to acknowledge that so far as the word christian is pretended to signify a man of honesty and religion the turks are better christians than many of these  finis
