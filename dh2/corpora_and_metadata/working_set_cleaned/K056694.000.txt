an account of the proceedings against the rebels and other prisoners tried before the lord chief justice jefferies and other judges in the west of england in      for taking arms under the duke of monmouth  with a complete list of all the persons that suffered the counties they suffered in the crimes they were tried for and the punishments inflicted on them  also an account of what was done against those in scotland who took arms there under the earl of argyle etc and against the protestants in ireland by the late king james and his deputy tyrconnel  published from an original manuscript  to which is prefixed the duke of monmouths the earl of argyles and the pretenders declarations that the reader may the better judge of the cause of the several rebellions  with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again mat     the third edition  london printed for andrew bell at the cross keys and bible in cornhill near stocks market and j baker and tho warner at the black boy in paternoster row      price one shilling  introduction the faction now having lost all hopes of success by their unnatural rebellion they apply themselves with the utmost industry and malice to cry down the proceedings of justice against the rebels who are taken as barbarous and cruel and having no precedent in history this clamor is so very ill founded and so remote from truth that it might be justly thought needless to give it any answer but since it is made use of by the party farther to incense the ignorant mob against the government it cannot be thought amiss to convict our adversaries of falsehood by putting them in mind of the barbarous cruelty of the late king james ii against those who took arms under the duke of monmouth and the earl of argyle in scotland and likewise of that princes barbarity to the protestants in ireland after the revolution  these things are still remembered by thousands of eyewitnesses and therefore can admit of no contradiction but from such as have bid defiance to truth because they know the interest of tyranny and popery which they espouse can never be supported by any other methods than cruelty and falsehood  i shall begin with the proceedings in that kings reign against those who took arms in the west of england under the duke of monmouth the lists of those who were executed or otherwise punished on that account are in the following treatise and more large and exact than what has yet been published so that i shall say nothing of them here but proceed to give some account of the difference betwixt that and the present rebellion  every one knows that those who joined the duke of monmouth did not do it till after king james ii had declared himself a papist and contrary to law encouraged those of his own persuasion to set up their worship publicly and he had likewise in an arbitrary and tyrannical manner invaded our civil liberties as may be seen by the duke of monmouths declaration and that of the earl of argyle  the declaration of james duke of monmouth and the noblemen gentlemen and others now in arms for the defense and vindication of the protestant religion and the laws rights and privileges of england  as government was originally instituted by god and this or that form of it chosen and submitted to by men for the peace happiness and security of the governed and not for the private interest and personal greatness of those that rule so that government has always been esteemed the best where the supreme magistrates have been invested with all the power and prerogatives that might capacitate them not only to preserve the people from violence and oppression but to promote their prosperity and yet where nothing was to belong to them by the rules of the constitution that might enable them to injure and oppress them and it has been the glory of england above most other nations that the prince had all entrusted with him that was necessary either for the advancing the welfare of the people or for his own protection in the discharge of the office and withal stood so limited and restrained by the fundamental terms of the constitution that without a violation of his own oath as well as the rules and measures of the government he could do them no hurt nor exercise any act of authority but through the administration of such hands as stood obnoxious to be punished in case they transgressed so that according to the primitive frame of the government the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of the subject are so far from jostling one another that the rights reserved unto the people tended to render the king honorable and great and the prerogatives settled on the prince were in order to the subjects protection and safety but all human things being subject to perversion as well as decay it has been the fate of the english government to be often changed and wrested from what it was in the first settlement and institution and we are particularly compelled to say that all the boundaries of the government have of late been broken and nothing less unattempted for turning our limited monarchy into an absolute tyranny for such has been the transaction of affairs within this nation for several years last past that though the protestant religion and liberties of the people were fenced and hedged about by as many laws as the wisdom of man can devise for their preservation against popery and arbitrary power our religion has been all along countermined by popish counsels and our privileges ravished from us by fraud and violence and more especially the whole course and series of the life of the d of y has been but one continued conspiracy against the reformed religion and the rights of the nation for whoever considers his contriving the burning of london his instigating a confederacy with france and a war with holland fomenting the popish plot and encouraging the murder of sir ed godfrey his charging treason against protestants suborning witnesses to swear the patriots of our religion and liberties out of their lives his hiring execrable villains to assassinate the late earl of essex and causing those others to be clandestinely cut off in hopes to conceal it his advising and procuring the prorogation and dissolution of parliaments in order to prevent their looking into his crimes and that he might escape the justice of the nation such can imagine nothing so black and horrid in it self or so ruinous and destructive to religion and the kingdom which we may not expect from him   the very tyrannies which he has exercised since he snatched the crown from his brothers head do leave none under a possibility of flattering themselves with hopes of safety either in their consciences persons or estates for in defiance of all the laws and statutes of the realm made for the security of the reformed protestant religion he not only began his reign with a barefaced avowing himself of the romish religion but called in multitudes of priests and jesuits for whom the law makes it treason to come into this kingdom and has empowered them to exercise idolatries and besides his being daily present at the worship of the mass he has publicly assisted at the greatest fopperies of their superstition neither has he been more tender in trampling upon the laws which concern our properties seeing in two proclamations whereof the one requires the collecting of the customs and the other the continuing that part of the excise which was to expire at the late kings death he has violently and against all the law of the land broken in upon our estates neither is it any extenuation of his tyranny that he is countenanced in it by an extrajudicial opinion of seven or eight suborned and forsworn judges but rather declaring the greatness and extent of the conspiracy against our rights and that there is no means left for our relief but by force of arms for advancing those to the bench that were the scandal of the bar and constituting those very men to declare the laws who are accused and branded in parliament for perverting them we were precluded all hopes of justice in westminster hall and by packing juries together by false returns new illegal charters and other corrupt means he does at once deprive us of all expectations of succor where our ancestors were wont to find it and hopes to render that which ought to be the peoples fences against tyranny and the conservator of their liberties the means of subverting all our laws and of establishing of his arbitrariness and confirming our thraldom so that unless we could be contented to see the reformed protestant religion and such as profess it extirpated popish superstition and idolatry established the laws of the land trampled under foot the liberties and rights of the english people subverted and all that is sacred and civil or of regard amongst men of virtue or piety violated and unless we could be willing to be slaves as well as papists and forget the example of our noble and generous ancestors who conveyed our privileges to us at the expense of their blood and treasure and withal be unmindful of our duty to god our country and posterity deaf to the cries and groans of our oppressed friends and be satisfied not only to see them and our selves imprisoned robbed and murdered but the protestant interest throughout the whole world betrayed to france and rome we are bound as men and christians and that in discharge of our duty to god and our country and for the satisfaction of the protestant nations round about us to betake our selves to arms which we take heaven and earth to witness we should not have done had not the malice of our enemies deprived us of all other means of redress and were not the miseries that we already feel and those which do further threaten us worse than the calamities of war and it is not for any personal injuries or private discontents nor in pursuance of any corrupt interest that we take our swords in our hands but for vindicating our religion laws and rights and rescuing our country from ruin and destruction and for the preserving our selves wives and children from bondage and idolatry wherefore before god angels and men we stand acquitted from and do charge upon our enemies all the slaughter and devastations that unavoidably accompany intestine war   now therefore we do hereby solemnly declare and proclaim war against j d of y as a murderer and an assassin of innocent men a traitor to the nation and a tyrant over the people and we would have none that appear under his banner to flatter themselves with expectation of forgiveness it being our firm resolution to prosecute him and his adherents without giving way to treaties and accommodations until we have brought him and them to undergo what the rule of the constitution and the statutes of the realm as well as the laws of nature scripture and nations adjudge to be punishment due to the enemies of god mankind their country and all things that are honorable virtuous and good   and though we cannot avoid being sensible that too many have from cowardice covetousness and ambition cooperated to the subverting of our religion and enslaving their country yet we would have none from a despair of finding mercy persevere in their crimes nor continue the ruin of the kingdom for we exclude none from the benefit of repentance that will join with us in retrieving that they have been accessory to the loss of nor do we design revenge upon any but the obstinate and such as shall be found at this juncture yielding aid and assistance to the said j d of y   and that we may both govern our selves in the pursuit of this glorious cause wherein we are engaged and give encouragement to all that shall assist us in so righteous and necessary an undertaking we do in the presence of the lord who knows the secrets of all hearts and is the avenger of deceit and falsehood proclaim and publish what we aim at and for the obtaining whereof we have both determined to venture and are ready to lay down our lives and though we are not come into the field to introduce anarchy and confusion or for laying aside any part of the old english government yet our purposes and resolutions are to reduce things to that temperament and balance that future rulers may remain able to do all the good that can be either desired or expected from them and that it may not be in their power to invade the rights and infringe the liberties of the people   and whereas our religion the most valuable thing we lay claim unto has been shaken by unjust laws undermined by popish counsels and is now in danger to be subverted we are therefore resolved to spend our blood for preserving it to our selves and posterity nor will we lay down our arms till we see it established and secured beyond all probability of being supplanted and overthrown and until all the penal laws against all protestant dissenters be repealed and legal provision made against their being disturbed by reason of their consciences and for their enjoying an equal liberty with other protestants   and that the meekness and purity of our principles and the moderation and righteousness of our end may appear unto all men we do declare that we will not make war upon or destroy any for their religion how false and erroneous soever so that the very papists provided they withdraw from the tents of our enemies and be not found guilty of conspiring our destruction or abettors of them that seek it have nothing to fear or apprehend from us except what may hinder their altering our laws and endangering our persons in the profession of the reformed doctrine and exercise of our christian worship   our resolution in the next place is to maintain all the just rights and privileges of parliament and to have parliaments annually chosen and held and not prorogued dissolved or discontinued within the year before petitions be first answered and grievances redressed   and seeing many of the miseries under which the nation does groan arise from displacing such out of the number of judges as would not for the promoting popish and arbitrary designs wrest and misapply the laws and from constituting corrupt and mercenary men in their rooms on purpose to stretch the laws beyond the reason and intention of them and to declare that for law which is not we can neither with silence pass over the mentioning of them nor should we have peace in our selves if we did not endeavor to prevent the like mischief in time to come for by reason of ill mens being advanced to the bench and holding their places only durante been placito many persons have been condemned in exorbitant fines for no crimes or for very small ones many statutes made for the safety of the subject particularly the habeas corpus act have been wickedly eluded to the oppression of the innocent and loyal men the popish lords that were impeached in parliament for a most hellish conspiracy have to the subverting the rights of the house of lords been discharged and set free the imposing a mayor and sheriffs upon the city of london by fraud and violence have been justified and those who in discharge of their duty opposed it illegally prosecuted and arbitrarily punished london and other cities and corporations have been robbed of their charters upon unrighteous judgments of pretended forfeitures sir thomas armstrong executed without being allowed the benefit of a trial colonel algernoon sidney condemned to die upon the deposition of one scandalous witness and that loyal and excellent person the late william lord russel murdered for alleged crimes in reference to which if all had been true which was sworn against him yet there was nothing which according to law could have reached his life upon the considerations aforesaid we further declare that we will have care taken for the future for the debarring ignorant scandalous and mercenary men from the administration of justice and that the judges shall hold their places by the ancient tenure of quam diu se been gesserint and to leave it to the wisdom of a parliament to settle some way and method for the approbation of such as shall be advanced to the degree and dignity of judges   and forasmuch as the invasion made on the right of cities buroughs and towns corporate the seizure of their charters whether by surrender or upon pretense of forfeiture have been wholly arbitrary and illegal we likewise therefore declare we will to our utmost endeavor to see them repossessed in what they formerly had and could legally lay claim to and that we do esteem all judgments given against them and all surrenders made by a corrupt and perjured party amongst them null and void in law and do hold and declare their old charters notwithstanding the new ones lately granted to be good and valid and accordingly we do invite and encourage all honest burgesses and freemen to reassume the rights and privileges which by virtue of the said old charters belonged to their several and respective corporations and to deliver themselves from those late parasites and instruments of tyranny set up to oppress them   moreover for the restoring the kingdom to its primitive condition of freedom and safety we will have the corporation and militia acts repealed and all outlawries of treason against any person whatsoever upon the late pretended portestant plot reversed and also all other outlawries banishments warrants judgments imprisonments and injurious proceedings against any other persons upon any of the penal statutes made against protestant dissenters made null and void and we will have new laws enacted for placing the election of sheriffs in the freeholders of the several countries for settling the militia in the several shires and for preventing all military standing forces except what shall be raised and kept up by authority and consent of parliament   and whereas several gentlemen and others who have been worthy and zealous assertors of the protestant interest and laws of the kingdom are now in custody in diverse places within the realm upon most unjust accusations pretenses proceedings and judgments we do hereby further declare the said imprisonments to be illegal and that in case any violence shall be offered to them or any of them we will revenge it to the utmost upon such of our enemies as shall fall into our hands   and whereas the said j d of y in order to the expenditing the idolatrous and bloody designs of the papists the gratifying his own boundless ambition after a crown and to hinder enquiry into the assassination of arthur earl of essex has poisoned the late king and thereby manifested his ingratitude as well as cruelty to the world in murdering a brother who had almost ruined himself to preserve and protect him from punishment we do therefore further declare that for the aforesaid villainous and unnatural crime and other his crimes before mentioned and in pursuance of the resolution of both house of parliament who voted to revenge the kings death in case he came to an untimely end we will prosecute the said j d of y till we have brought him to suffer what the law adjudged to be the punishment of so execrable a fact   and in a more particular manner his grace the duke of manmouth being sensible of the barbarous and horried parricide committed upon his father does resolve to pursue the said j d of y as a mortal and bloody enemy and will endeavor as well with his own hand as by the assistance of his friends and the law to have justice executed upon him   and the said james duke of monmouth the now head and captain general of the protestant forces in this kingdom assembled for the end aforesaid from the generousness of his own nature and the love he bears to these nations whose welfare and settlement he infinitely prefers to whatsoever concerns himself does not at present insist upon his title but leaves the determination thereof to the wisdom justice and authority of a parliament legally chosen and acting with freedom and in the mean time does profess and declare by all that is sacred that he will in conjunction with the people of england employ all the abilities bestowed upon him by god and nature for the reestablishment and preservation of the protestant reformed religion in these kingdoms and for restoring the subjects of the same to a free exercise thereof in opposition to popery and the consequences of it tyranny and slavery to the obtaining of which end he does hereby promise and oblige himself to the people of england to consent unto and promote the passing into laws all the methods aforesaid that it may never more be in the power of any single person on the throne to deprive their subjects of their rights and to subvert the fundamental laws of the government designed for their preservation   and whereas the nobility and gentry and commons of scotland are now in arms upon the like motives and inducements that we are and in prosecution of ends agreeable with ours we do therefore approve the justice of their cause commend their zeal and courage expecting their and promising our assistance for carrying on that glorious work we are jointly engaged in being obliged avoiding tediousness to omit the recounting many oppressions under which that kingdom has groaned and the giving a deduction of the several steps that have been taken for introducing of popery and tyranny we think fit therefore to signify both to our countrymen and foreigners that we intend a larger testimony and remonstrance of the grievances persecutions cruelties and tyrannies we have of late lain under and therein a full and more particular account of the unparalled crimes of the d of y and we make our appeal unto god and all protestant kings princes states and people concerning the justice of our cause and the necessity we are reduced unto of having our recourse to arms and as we do beseech require and adjure all sincere protestants and true english men to be assisting to us against the enemies of the gospel rights of the nation and liberties of mankind so we are confident of obtaining the utmost aid and succor which they can yield us with their prayers persons and estates for the dethroning the said tyrant etc nor do we doubt being justified countenanced and assisted by all protestant kings princes and commonwealths who either regard the gospel of jesus christ or their own interest and above all our dependence and trust is upon the lord of hosts in whose name we go forth and to whom we commit our cause and refer the decision betwixt us and our enemies in the day of battle now let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seems good unto him  a declaration of archibald earl of argyle lord kintyre cowall campbell and lorn heritable sheriff and lieutenant of the shires of argyle and tarbette and heritable justice general of the said shires  i shall not publish my case published already in print in latin and in dutch and more largely in english nor mean i to repeat the printed declaration emitted by several noblemen gentlemen and others of both nations now in arms because the sufferings of me and my family are therein mentioned i have thought it fit for me to declare for my self that as i go to arms with those who have appointed me to conduct them for no private and personal end only for those contained in the said declaration which i have concerted with them and approved of so i do claim no interest but what i had before the pretended forfeiture of my family and have a sufficient right to   and that i do freely and as a christian forgive all personal injuries against my person and family to all that shall not oppose but join and concur with us in our present undertaking for the ends mentioned in the said declaration and hereby i oblige my self never to pursue them in judgment nor out of judgment and i do further declare that obtaining the quiet and peaceable possession of what belonged to my father and my self before our pretended forfeitures i shall satisfy all debts due by my father and my self as any heir or debtor can be obliged   and as my faithfulness to his late majesty and his government has sufficiently appeared to all unbyassed persons void of malice so i do with grief acknowledge my fault in too much complying with and conniving at the methods that have been taken to bring us to the sad condition we are now in though god knows never concurring in the design   i have now with gods strength suffered patiently my unjust sentence and banishment   years and half and have never offered to make any uproar or defense by arms to disturb the peace upon my private concern but the king being now dead and the duke of york having taken off his mask and abandoned and invaded our religion and liberties resolving to enter into the government and exercising it contrary to law i think it not only just but my duty to god and my country to use my utmost endeavors to oppose and redress his usurpations and tyranny   and therefore being assisted and furnished very nobly by several good protestants and invited and accompanied by several of both nations to lead them i resolve as god shall enable me to use their assistance of all kinds toward the ends expressed in the said declaration   and i do hereby earnestly invite and obtest all honest protestants and particularly all my friends and blood relations to concur with us in the said declaration and as i have written several letters so having no other way fully to intimate my mind otherwise i do hereby require all my vassals any where and all within my several jurisdictions with their fencible men within their command to go to arms and to join and concur with us according to the said declaration as they shall be answerable at their peril and that they obey the particular orders they shall receive from me from time to come  by these it is plain that those unfortunate lords and others who joined them took up arms in defense of our religion and liberties which were then invaded and as it afterward appeared were designed to be totally subverted  but the present rebellion is raised in opposition to our laws for maintaining the protestant succession and british liberties which james ii had destroyed as far as he could and would in all probability have completed the ruin of them had not god by a wonderful turn of providence spirited the nations to call in the prince of orange to their rescue nor would the pretender have failed to prosecute the same wicked designs which had been set on foot by his supposed father as will appear by his declaration published at perth as follows  the pretenders declaration  james viii by the grace of god of scotland england france and ireland king defender of the faith etc to all our loving subjects of what degree or quality soever greeting as we are firmly resolved never to lose any opportunity of asserting our undoubted title to the imperial crown of these realms and of endeavoring to get the possession of that right which is devolved upon us by the laws of god and man so must we in justice to the sentiments of our own heart declare that nothing in the world can give us so great satisfaction as to owe to the endeavors of our loyal subjects both our own and their restoration to that happy settlement which can alone deliver this church and nation from the calamities which they lie at present under and from these future miseries which must be the consequences of the present usurpation during the life of our dear sister of glorious memory the happiness which our people enjoyed softened in some degree the hardship of our own fate and we must further confess that when we reflected on the goodness of her nature and her inclination to justice we could not but persuade our self that she intended to establish and perpetuate the peace which she had given to these kingdoms by destroying for ever all competition to the succession of the crown and by consenting to us at last the enjoyment of that inheritance out of which we had been so long kept which her conscience must inform her was our due and which her principles must lead her to desire that we might obtain but since the time it pleased god to put a period to her life and not to suffer us to throw our self as we then firmly purposed to have done upon our people we have not been able to look upon the present condition of our kingdoms or to consider their future prospect without all the horror and indignation which ought to fill the breast of every scotsman we have beheld a foreign family aliens to our country distant in blood and strangers even to our language ascend the throne we have seen the reins of government put into the hands of a faction and that authority which was designed for the protection of all exercised by a few of the worst to the oppression of the best and greatest number of our subjects our sister has not been left at rest in her grave her name has been scurrilously abused her glory as far as in these people lay insolently defaced and her faithful servants inhumanly persecuted a parliament has been procured by the most unwarrantable influences and by the grossest corruptions to serve the vilest ends and they who ought to be the guardians of the liberties of the people are become the instruments of tyranny whilst the principal powers engaged in the late wars do enjoy the blessings of peace and are attentive to discharge their debts and ease their people great britain in the midst of peace feels all the load of war new debts are contracted new armies are raised at home dutch forces are brought into these kingdoms and by taking possession of the duchy of bremen in violation of the public faith a door is opened by the usurper to let in an inundation of foreigners from abroad and to reduce these nations to the state of a province to one of the most inconsiderable provinces of the empire   these are some few of the many real evils into which these kingdoms have been betrayed under pretense of being rescued and secured from dangers purely imaginary and these are such consequences of abandoning the old constitution as we persuade our selves very many of those who promoted the present unjust and illegal settlement never intended   we observe with the utmost satisfaction that the generality of our subjects are awakened with a just sense of their danger and that they show themselves resolved to take such measures as may effectually rescue them from that bondage which has by the artifice of a few designing men and the concurrence of many unhappy causes been brought upon them   we adore the wisdom of divine providence which has opened a way to our restoration by the success of those very measures that were laid to disappoint us for ever and we must earnestly conjure all our loving subjects not to suffer that spirit to faint or die away which has been so miraculously raised in all parts of our kingdom but to pursue with all the vigor and hopes of success which so just and righteous a cause ought to inspire those methods which the finger of god seems to point out to them   we are coming to take our part in all the dangers and difficulties to which any of our subjects from the greatest down to the meanest may be exposed on this important occasion to relieve our subjects in scotland from the hardships they groan under on account of the late unhappy union and to restore the kingdom to its ancient free and independent state we have before our eyes the example of our royal grandfather who sell a sacrifice to rebellion and of our royal uncle who by a train of miracles escaped the rage of barbarous and bloodthirsty rebels and lived to exercise his clemency toward those who had waged war against his father and himself who had driven him to seek shelter in foreign lands and who had even set a price upon his head   we see the same instances of cruelty renewed against us by men of the same principles without any other reason than the consciousness of their own guilt and the implacable malice of their own hearts for in the account of such men it is a crime sufficient to be their king but god forbid that we should tread in these steps or that the cause of a lawsul prince and an injuried people should be carried on like that of tyranny and usurpation and owe its support to assassins we shall copy after the patterns abovementioned and be ready with the former of our royal ancestors to seal the cause of our country if such be the will of heaven with our blood but we hope for better things we hope for the latter to see our just rights and those of the church and people of scotland once more settled in a free and independent scots parliament on their ancient foundation to such a parliament which we will immediately call shall we entirely refer our and their interests being sensible that these interests rightly understood are always the same let the civil as well as religious rights of all our subjects receive a confirmation in such a parliament let consciences truly tender be indulged let property of every kind be better than ever secured let an act of general grace and amnesty extinguish the faults even of the most guilty if possible let the very remembrance of all which have preceeded this happy moment be utterly blotted out that our subjects may be united to us and to each other in the strictest bonds of affection as well as interest   and that nothing may be omitted which is in our power to contribute to this desirable end we do by these presents absolutely and effectually for us our heirs and successors pardon remit and discharge all crimes of high treason misprision of treason and all other crimes and offenses whatsoever done or committed against us or our royal father of blessed memory by any of our subjects of what degree or quality soever who shall at or after our landing and before they engage in any action against us or our forces from that time lay hold on mercy and return to that duty and allegiance they owe to us their only rightful and lawful sovereign   by the joint endeavors of us and our parliament urged by these motives and directed to these views we may hope to see the peace and flourishing estate of this kingdom in a short time restored and we shall be equally forward to concert with our parliament such further measures as may be thought necessary for leaving the same to future generations   and we hereby require all sheriffs of shires stewarts of stewartries and their deputies and magistrates of burghs to publish this our declaration immediately after it shall come to their hands in the usual place and manner under the pain of being proceeded against for failure thereof and forfeiting the benefit of our general pardon  given under our signmanual and privysignet at our court at commercy the   th day of october in the   th year of our reign it is to be observed that the declarations by the duke of monmouth and the earl of argyle insist on such acts of tyranny committed by james ii as all the world knew to be true whereas the pretender and those who have now rebelled for the support of his claim have no such thing to charge upon king george but traitorously misrepresent the legal methods which he has taken with consent of parliament for the defense of our religion and liberties and retrieving the honor of the nation on purpose to inflame the highchurch mob  it also deserves a remark that though the duke of monmouth was so weak as to be prevailed on by the importunity of those who joined him to take the title of king yet he did not positively assert this title to the crown in his declaration but left it to be determined by parliament whereas king james ii never offered to submit the examination of the pretenders birth to a parliament to whom the prince of orange referred it but on the contrary abandoned the kingdom with his queen the pretender and all the material witnesses as if he had been conscious to himself that such an examination would have fully discovered the cheat nor has the pretender offered to make any proof of his legitimacy or even to give such a feigned security for our religion and liberties as james ii did but on the contrary did absolutely refuse the scots coronation oath that was in force before the union of the crowns because it obliged him to maintain the protestant religion as established in that nation in the reign of mary queen of scots and confirmed by her son james vi of scotland and the first of great britain  this is enough to show the difference betwixt the causes of the rebellion against king james ii and that against king george and though the latter has been much more universal and formidable than the other it will appear by the following accounts that the proceedings against the present rebels have been kept within the due bounds of law and tempered with great clemency whereas those against the rebels in the time of james ii did not only exceed law but were carred on with such barbarity as is shocking to human nature  an account of the proceedings against the rebels and other prisoners in the west southampton ss alice lisle widow indicted for

smith william cossens  account of what was done against those in scotland who took arms there under the earl of argyle etc and against the protestants in ireland by the late king james and his deputy tyrconnel it is proper in the next place to give a brief account how the scots who took arms in their own country against the tyranny of king charles and king james ii were treated there were several insurrections there occasioned by the barbarous oppression of the presbyterians for not conforming to the tyranny in church and state then set up which they protested they could not in conscience do since that government was not only contrary to the fundamental laws of the nation but to their principles and the solemn obligations which the king and kingdom lay under by oaths against it and that it was attended by such an unlimited prerogative given the king by a packed parliament as empowered him by virtue of his supremacy which they called an inherent right to the crown  that he and his successors might settle enact and emit such constitutions acts and orders concerning the administration of the external government of the church and the persons employed in the same and concerning all ecclesiastical meetings and matters to be proposed and determined therein as they in their royal wisdom should think fit these are the very words of the first act of the  d sessions of the first parliament of charles ii and of the first act of the second parliament  to force a conformity to this sort of government in church and state which king charles ii had solemnly abjured at his taking the crown of scotland upon him high commission courts were not only set up by the prerogative which acted contrary to law but soldiers were employed to oppress pillage harrass imprison fine and confine beat and bind like beasts those who refused it sir james turner a bloody and atheistical man commanded in three such expeditions against the western shires of scotland in           and      where he and his troops exacted from the poor people of galloway and nithsdale for their nonconformity betwixt   and  000 l sterling besides the great charge they were at by giving free quarters and money to the soldiers to forbear the barbarities which they practiced on their persons and families there was also levied by way of fine without any crime alleged from     gentlemen and others near  000 l sterling besides free quarters to the soldiers sent to levy it which amounted to as much and notwithstanding the money which was paid to those barbarous troops to make them forbear cruelties it was their common custom to destroy all the provisions and substance of those they quartered upon and to fill the bellies of their servants and dogs before they would suffer the poor families to eat any of their own provisions nor did they behave themselves thus only to those who did not conform but to many gentlemen and others who did it being plainly the design of the court to ruin the west of scotland because that part of the kingdom had always from the time of the reformation signalized their zeal for their religion and liberty it was usual with them after they had ruined the tenants to quarter upon their landlords and thus they harrassd and plundered that part of the country three times successively in the years abovementioned and besides the money thus exacted they forced people to give bonds for such other sums as they thought fit by which they beggared abundance of families and when any complained to the commanding officer of those inhumanities they were commonly beaten or otherwise barbarously treated the soldiers did likewise behave themselves so atheistically that they publicly mocked at all religion uttered most horrible curses and oaths ravished women and in short their behavior was more like savages and pagans than civilized men and christians and after they had thus ruined the country they extorted certificates from the people that they had been civilly used on purpose to prevent their making application to the government for redress and when they had nothing left to pay what the soldiers demanded they were barbarously used in their persons and carried to prisons tied hand and foot like beasts after the country had been   months thus oppressed in sir jamess third expedition three countrymen met four of his soldiers carrying a poor old man one of their neighbors in that manner to dumfries they begged the soldiers to unty him who instead of doing it attacked the countrymen with their swords but were worsted in the scuffle one of them wounded and the other three threw down their arms this encouraged these men with some others to attack  0 or    more of the soldiers who were in like manner oppressing the people in that same parish and these they also disarmed having killed one that made an obstinate resistance the neighborhood knowing that sir james would take a terrible revenge upon them about    of them took horse and with a few footmen marched to dumfries where they took sir james and disarmed his men having done this they marched to the west where the people were oppressed in the like manner and being joined by others came at last to be   or  00 upon this lieutenant general dalzeel was ordered to march against them with the regular troops they were declared rebels and ordered to lay down their arms within    hours after the proclamation was published without the least assurance of pardon and all the subjects were ordered to assist the general on pain of rebellion this poor handful being thus made desperate they marched within two miles of edinburgh and a cessation was agreed between the general and them for one night until their grievances and petition might be presented by him to the council this made them secure and the general contrary to agreement surpised them just at the time when his messenger was delivering their petition to the council they made a stout resistance and repulsed his advanced troops three times but being vastly inferior in number and fatigued with long marches hunger rain and cold they were defeated on the   th of november       0 of em killed and above   0 of them taken many of whom were executed with the greatest cruelty and barbarity and some of them tortured by an engine called a boot to make them discover others and such as had given them any assistance or relief besides it was made treason for any one to harbor such of them as had escaped this was the first insurrection in scotland known by the name of pentlandhills which was the place where they fought  these barbarities served only to incense the country and to make the people of the western shires more averse to conformity than before this occasioned many severe laws to force them to a compliance which not having the designed effect an army of barbarous highlanders was twice brought down upon the country which they plunders treated the people with all sort of inhumanity garrisoned gentlemens houses contrary to law imposed bonds and oaths upon the people without authority of parliament and committed such other outrages as if they had been in an enemies country but all this not prevailing with the people to conform or to abstain from worship in the fields when they could not do it in houses troops were employed to attack the people wherever they were assembled which obliged them frequently to stand on their defense and all that did so being made guilty of death this brought on the second insurrection at bothwellbridge in      where the poor oppressed people being vastly outnumberd by the kings army under the command of the duke of monmouth about  00 of em after a stout resistance were killed the rest put to flight and above  000 taken and carried to edinburgh where they were a long time kept in an open churchyard without any shelter from cold or rain several ministers and others were executed and about   00 taken there and at other places before sold for slaves to america and other parts  00 of which were cast away near orkney through the barbarity of the captain of the ship who ordered them to be kept under hatches when his ship struck otherwise they might have escaped as well as he and his men and about  0 others of their fellow prisoners  the country was made a perfect scene of horror and cruelty by the pursuits which were made after those who escaped from the field and the proscribing or putting to death such as were found to give them any relief though their nearest relations and acts were made to make it death for any presbyterian ministers to preach or people to hear them in house or field  these barbarous oppressions made a part of the people so mad that some of them thought themselves absolved from giving any further obedience to king charles ii or those commissioned under him and therefore took upon them to declare that he had forfeited his crown by his perjury and tyranny and that they would no more own him as their sovereign though this was known to be contrary to the declared principles of the presbyterians and perfectly inconsistent with what they held themselves to be obliged to by the solemn league and covenant which bound them to maintain the kings just prerogative and the authority of parliaments from whom their kings derived their authority and without whose consent they held they could not be deprived of it yet the practice of those few desperate men was made a handle to oppress all the presbyterians and to impose new oaths and bonds upon them in the mean time that handful of men who had thus thrown off the kings authority were pursued from place to place and killed without any trial wherever they were found and the soldiers had an illegal power given them by the council to tender a bond or oath to all that they pleased to disown the declaration of those men and if they refused it they were presently to kill them and thus they murdered without any trial about    people in several parts of the country and in such a barbarous manner that they would not allow those poor people time to recommend themselves to god before they were shot or stabbed but answered them with this atheistical sarcasm what the devil have you been doing so many years have not you had time enough to pray in the caves and mountains  the murmuring faction cannot pretend that the present rebels were forced by any such extremities as these to take arms nor have they any ground to complain of any such inquisitorlike proceedings against their friends and it is well for them it is so otherwise there had been such a havoc long ever now among the highchurch party that few or none of them would have been left to belch out lies and treason every day against the government  i come now to the last insurrection in scotland before the revolution which was that under the earl of argyle already mentioned the causes of it are to be seen in his declaration as above so that there is little more to be said of it but that his lordship not being able to raise above  000 men because of the precautions which the government had taken against him upon the early notice they had of his design he only wandered about for   or   weeks in the western highlands where being blocked up by the kings men of war and straightened for provisions abundance of his men deserted and coming at last toward dumbarton and glasgow he was intercepted by a numerous army and his men perceiving that the enemy was ten times their number and being also wearied out with long marches want of provisions and sleep most of them withdrew in the night and the few that kept together were after some skirmishes with a party of the enemy whom they defeated obliged likewise to disperse the earl himself with a few more were taken and executed at edinburgh as about  0 of his men were at his seat at innerary in the highlands and many others taken up afterward on suspicion or otherwise were banished to america  it is observable that the earl was not executed upon the account of this rebellion but because of an explanation which he offered of the test that had been made for all those in places of power and trust when the parliament of scotland settled the succession upon the duke of york this was so much the more extraordinary that several of the episcopal party had been allowed to take it with such explanations because it was contradictory in it self and were never called in question for it but the reason why the earl was picked out to be a sacrifice was the greatness of his quality and power which the court knew would make it difficult for them to  their pish and tyrannical designs  scotland so long as a person of his weight and interest in the try was left in being  after his  james ii thought he might do what  would in scotland he persecuted the presbyterians with the height of barbarity and overturned the constitution by an arbitrary proclamation feb        wherein he granted an unlimited toleration by his sovereign authority prerogtive royal and absolute power which he alleged all his subjects ought to obey without reserve this with other things mentioned in the  declaration of rights brought on the revolution there as appears by the   th act of their convention apr         wherein they charge him with having invaded the fundamental constitution of the kingdom that he altered it from a legal limited monarchy to an arbitrary despotick power and in a public proclamation asserted an absolute power to annul all the laws and particularly arraigned those which established the protestant religion  i come next to take a view of king james iis administration in ireland soon after his accession to the british throne he sent that bigoted papist and tyrant the earl of tyrconnel to be lord lieutenant of that kingdom at the request of the popish clergy there who in their letter to the king of july      said  that tyrconnel was the person that did first espouse and chiefly maintain their cause for the last    years and was the only man on whose fortitude and popularity they durst with cheerfulness own their lovalty and assert his majestys interest therefore they prayed that his majesty would be pleased to lodge his authority in his hands to the terror of the faction meaning the protestants  tyrconnel fully answered their expectations and in a little time cashiered the protestant army in ireland which consisted of about  000 men and formed another of papists most of whom were the descendants or near relations of those that had been attainted for the rebellion and massacre in      or had signalized themselves by notorious villainies and implacable hatred to the english and protestant interest in that nation  in the next place he set up judges there who were engaged by interest and inclination to destroy the protestant religion and one of them called rice a prosligate papist who was advanced to be lord chief baron had the impudence to declare he would draw a coach and six horses through the act of settlement which was the chief security the protestants had in that kingdom sir alexander fitton who had been convicted of forgery at westminster hall and chester and fined for it by the lords in parliament was taken out of goal and made lord high chancellor of ireland because he turned papist and was so zealous to show himself a true convert that he several times declared with the height of impudence from the bench that the irish protestants were all rogues and that there was not one among  0000 of em but was a traitor rebel and villain  the privy council in ireland was composed of a majority of papisis so that the protestants named as members of it declined to act because they were sensible that they could do their religion and the english interest no manner of service  there wanted nothing else but to model a house of commons to the designs of the court and in order to that the charters of all corporations were seized by quo warrantos without any cause or shadow of law so that the magistracies of corporations were filled up with papists and men of desperate or no fortunes and the new charters had a clause by which the chief governor was empowered to turn out and put in whom he pleased without showing a reason  the protestant clergy were oppressed by tyrconnel and the popish priests did openly demand the tithes belonging to them and forbad their people to pay the tithes to the protestant incumbents on pain of damnation this passed afterward into an act by which the papists were to pay their tithes only to their own priests and afterward as any protestant bishop or clergyman died papists were put into their places by the kings privy signet or sign manual  in the next place tyrconnel stopped the salaries of the university of dublin because they would not contrary to the laws and their oaths admit a vicious ignorant papist into a vacant fellowship and when king james arrived there after the revolution the protestant vice president fellows and scholars were all turned out their furniture library communion plate and every thing belonging to the college was taken away the house made a garrison and their chambers made prisons for protestants though king james had promised to preserve their liberties and properties and rather augment than diminish the privileges which had been granted them by his predecessors at last most of the churches in and about dublin were seized on by the government and an order was issued forbidding more than   protestants to meet under pain of death so that all religious assemblies through the whole kingdom were prohibited to protestants  to complete their ruin an act of attainder was passed in parliament in order to which every member of the house of commons returned the names of all such protestant gentlemen as lived near them or in the county or borough for which he served or if he was a stranger to any of them he sent to the country for information about them when the bill was presented to the king for his assent the speaker told him that many were attainted in that act upon such evidence as satisfied the house and the rest upon common fame  in this act no fewer were attainted than two archbishops one duke    earls   countesses    viscounts   viscountesses   bishops    barons    baronets    knights    clergymen      esquires and gentlemen and all of em unheard declared and adjudged traitors convicted and attainted of high treason and adjudged to suffer the pains of death and forseiture the famous proscription of rome during the last triumvirate came not up in some respects to the horror of this for there were condemned in this little kingdom more than double the number that were proscribed through the vast bounds of the roman empire and to make this of ireland yet the more terrible and to put the persons attainted out of a possibility of escaping the act it self was concealed and no protestant allowed a copy of it till four months after it was past whereas in that of rome the names of the persons proscribed were affixed upon all the public places of the city and the very day the proscription was concerted and thereby opportunity was given to many of the noblest families in rome to preserve themselves by a speedy flight for better times  the conclusion let our murmerers speak from their consciences if they have any can the most abandoned of them have the face to say that there is not a very great difference betwixt the cause of those who took arms against tyranny and popery in the three nations during the reigns of king charles and king james ii and of such as have taken arms to set up an impostor and to bring in tyranny and popery in the reign of king g e o r g e is there not a very great difference betwixt those who ventured their lives and fortunes to save us from the slavery of france and idolatry of rome and those who would have delivered us up in chains to both  and as the difference betwixt the causes is remarkable the difference betwixt the conduct of the parties is no less so can envy and malice charge the whigs in those reigns to have joined with papists in pulling down places of protestant worship whilst masshouses passed untouched can they be charged to have joined with papists to insult prince and parliament in order to interrupt the course of justice against an incendiary for preaching sedition and treason can they be charged with a rebellion to screen a ministry from justice who had betrayed their religion their liberty their country their trade their sovereign and all europe into the hands of france can they be charged with taking arms for ministers who had persuaded their sovereign to break oaths and leagues to betray our allies in council and cam and to utter the grossest contradictions and alshoods from the throne can they be charged with concurring in a design to defeat a protestant succession and set a papist on the throne by execrable tricks and perjuries and particularly by taking oaths to the government on purpose to undermine it or can they be charged when in arms with burning and plundering their native country or to have joined with domestic and foreign papists to set up a popish pretender and murder and dethrone a protestant king and his whole royal family  the faction though casehardend to the greatest degree cannot charge such things upon those who took arms against the maleadministrations of king charles ii and king james ii  then as to the difference betwixt the treatment of those who took arms against those princes and our present rebels can the faction have the impudence to say that our generals have treated the present rebels as kirk did those who took arms under the duke of monmouth when he ordered  0 of the poor wounded prisoners to be immediately hanged at taunton without allowing their poor wives and children to speak to them and at the same time made his pipes to play his drums to beat and his trumpets to found that the people might not hear what they said at the place of execution after which he ordered their quarters to be boiled in pitch and set up in several parts of the town for which when he was afterward questioned he pleaded the orders of the king and his general  can they say that our judges have hectored juries to bring in any of the rebels guilty after they had three times acquitted them as jefferies did in the case of the lady lisle  can they say that our judges have trapanned any of the rebels to confess themselves guilty in hopes of pardon as jefferies did and then hang them up afterward by scores without allowing them time to prepare for death  can they say that our judges have extorted any sums from the rebels for procuring them pardons or much less that they have extorted    00 l from any rebel of note for a pardon as he did in order to purchase himself an estate  can they say that our judges have condemned above  00 persons upon very slight or no evidence as he did at taunton and wells where above     were executed and their quarters dispersed in the principal places and roads of the country  can they say that our judges have prosecuted girls of   or   years old for high treason because they presented a few colors to the rebels as jefferies did and forced their parents to pay as much for their pardon as would have made them handsome fortunes  let them look upon the lists above and compare them with the lists of those tried lately at liverpoole and published in the flyingpost of feb    and then tell us whether the clemency of king james ii or that of king george is the greatest  let them turn their eyes to the abovementioned accounts of the proceedings against the rebels in scotland in the reigns of the two brothers and see if they can find such barbarities now as were practiced there at that time  have any of the present rebels been tortured with boots and thumbkins to make them discover the rest and who gave them any relief or encouragement  can they tell us of any that have been proscribed or put to death for entertaining the present rebels though their nearest relations  let them tell us if they can where any of the present rebels have been drowned on purpose under the pretense of being transported to foreign plantations  can they give us any instances that the present rebels have been examined upon captious questions by privycouncils and judges and hanged for not answering such questions as was practiced in scotland  can they tell us of any parties of soldiers sent out to murder those whom they met in the fields and roads that would not disown the pretenders declaration or title and let them tell us if they can whether innkeepers and hostlers are empowered to examine their guests and travelers upon such questions and of magistrates being empowered to hang such persons immediately as had not certificates of their having disowned the pretender and his title or would not do it when brought before them  have the present rebels taken in the act been exposed without cover to the rigor of the season by hundreds together and left to strave as those that were taken at bothwellbridge in scotland  let them next take a tour to ireland and find out instances there where the pretenders friends have been attainted in parliament upon common fame and the act concealed that they might have no opportunity to make their escape  a great deal more might be said of the inhuman and barbarous proceedings of those reigns but this is more than enough to convict our murmurers of falsehood who cry out against the gentle methods of justice now made use of to punish such as have raised the most unnatural and illgrounded rebellion that was ever heard of upon earth  i shall conclude with one rebuke to the jacobite females who take upon them to make treason their ordinary tattle that it is well for them that they dont live under such an administration as that of charles and james ii in scotland when poor country girls were hanged without mercy for saying that charles had forfeited his title to the crown by breaking the original contract or covenant on which he took it and that james being a professed papist had no right to the crown because it was coutrary to the fundamental laws of the nation and particularly that of king james vi which obliged al their princes to swear at their coronation that they were protestants would maintain that religion as then established and abolish all false religion idolatry and heresy i would also advise those jacobite ladies who make so bold with the present government at their teatables
