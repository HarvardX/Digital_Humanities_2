a discourse concerning the action of the sun and moon on animal bodies and the influence which this may have in many diseases  by richard mead m d f r s  in two parts  london printed in the year   0   a discourse concerning the action of the sun and moon on animal bodies part i that some diseases are properly the effects of the influence of the heavenly bodies and that others do vary their periods and symptoms according to the different positions of one or other of those luminous globes is a very ancient and certain observation upon this score hippocrates epist ad thessalum filium advises his son thessalus to the study of geometry and numbers because the knowledge of the stars is of very great use in physic  de aere aquis and locis  and the earliest histories of epidemick distempers particularly do all turn upon the alterations made in our bodies by the heavens  but when in later times medicine came to be accommodated to the reasonings of philosophers no body being able to account for the manner of this celestial action it was allowed no farther share in affecting our health than what might be imputed to the changes in the manifest constitution of the air excepting perhaps something of truth which still remains disguised and blended with the jargon of judiciary astrology  in order therefore to set this matter in a little clearer light i shall in the first place show that the sun and moon regarding their nearness and direction to the earth only besides the effects of heat moisture etc thereby caused in our atmosphere must at certain times make some alterations in all animal bodies then enumerate some histories and observations of such changes and enquire of what use such thoughts as these may be in the practice of physic  it is a constant observation of those who write the history of the winds that the most windy seasons of the year are the time about the vernal and autumnal equinox for be the air never so calm before or after we never fail of having winds at that juncture every body likewise knows that in the most quiet weather we are sure of some breeze at midday and midnight as also at full sea i e always about the time the sun or moon arrive at the meridian seamen and country people reckon upon this and order their affairs accordingly and the changes of the weather as to winds or calms especially about the new and full moon are too well known to require any authority to confirm such remarks those who desire a fuller account of these observations may see it in de chaless navigation gassenduss natural philosophy and j goad his astrometeorologica  these things being matters of fact and in a manner regular and universal it may very well seem strange that philosophers have not been more accurate in their enquiries into the reason of such appearances true indeed it is that the origin of winds is various and uncertain but however so constant and uniform an effect must undoubtedly be owing to one necessary cause  it has been now a considerable time since sufficiently made out that our atmosphere is a thin elastic fluid one part of which gravitates upon another and whose pressure is communicated every way in a sphere to any given part thereof from hence it follows that if by any external cause the gravity of any one part should be taken off or diminished that from all sides around this part the more heavy air would rush in to restore the equilibrium which must of necessity be preserved in all fluids now this violent running in of the heavier air would certainly produce a wind which is no more than a strong motion of the air in some determined direction if therefore we can find any outward cause that would at these stated seasons we have mentioned diminish the weight or pressure of the atmosphere we shall have the genuine reason of these periodical winds and the necessary consequences thereof  the flux and reflux of the sea was a phoenomenon too visible and too much conducing to the subsistence of mankind and all other animals to be neglected by those who applied themselves to the study of nature however all their attempts to explain this admirable contrivance of infinite wisdom were unsuccessful till sir isaac newton revealed to the world juster principles and by a truer philosophy than was formerly known showed us how by the united or divided forces of the sun and moon which are increased and lessened by several circumstances all the varieties of the tides are to be accounted for and since all the changes we have enumerated in the atmosphere do fall out at the same times when those happen in the ocean and likewise whereas both the waters of the sea and the air of our earth are fluids subject in a great measure to the same laws of motion it is plain that the rule of our great philosopher takes place here viz that natural effects of the same kind are owing to the same causes newton princip p  0    what difference that known property of the air which is not in water makes in the case i shall show anon setting aside the consideration of that for the present it is certain that as the sea is so must our air twice every    hours be raised upwards to a considerable height by the attraction of the moon coming to the meridian so that instead of a spherical it must form itself into a spheroidal or oval figure whose longest diameter being produced would pass through the moon that the like raising must form itself into a spheroidal or oval figure whose longest diameter being produced would pass through the moon that the like raising must follow as often as the sun is in the meridian of any place either above or below the horizon moreover that this elevation is greatest upon the new and full moons because both sun and moon do then conspire in their attraction least on the quarters in that they then drawing different ways it is only the difference of their actions produces the effect lastly that this intumescence will be of a middle degree at the time between the quarters and new and full moon  from the same principles the motion upwards of the air will be strongest of all about the equinoxes the equinoctial line being over that circle of the globe which has the greatest diameter either of the luminaries when in that are nearer and the agitation of the fluid spheroid revolving about a greater circle is greater besides the centrifugal force arising from the diurnal rotation is there greatest of all this will still be more considerable about the new and full moons happening at these times for the reasons just now mentioned and the least attraction will be about the quadratures of these lunar months because the declination of the moon from the equator is then greatest the different distances of the moon in her perigaeum and apogaeum are the reason that these full changes fall out a little before the vernal and after the autumnal equinox now the inverse of all this happens when the luminaries are in the solstitial circles lastly in the same parallel when the moons declination is toward the elevated pole the attraction is strongest when the moon is in that places meridian and weakest when she is in the opposite places meridian the contrary happens in the opposite parallel by reason of the spheroidal figure of the earth and its atmosphere  whatever has been said on this head is no more than applying what sir isaac newton has demonstrated of the sea to our atmosphere and it is needless to show how necessarily those appearances just now mentioned of winds at the stated times etc must happen hereupon it will be of more use to consider the proportion of the forces of the two luminaries upon the air to that which they have upon the water of our globe that it may the more plainly appear what influence the alterations hereby made must have upon the animal body  sir isaac newton has demonstrated princip lib   prop    that the force of the sun to move the sea is to the force of gravity as   to       00 let that be  and that the force of the moon to raise the sea is to gravity as   to  0      let this be   and since the centrifugal force of the parts of the earth arising from its diurnal motion is to gravity as   to     let this be   the same philosopher has taught us ibid lib   prop    that the centrifugal force raises the water at the equator above the water at the poles to the height of    00 feet wherefore if that force which is as  0   raises the ocean to    00 feet the united forces of the sun and moon which are as   will raise the same to    feet for    00 0       proxime  now we know that the more easily the water can obey the attraction with the more force are the tides moved but since as mr halley has determined it philos trans no     our atmosphere is extended to    miles whereas the middle depth of the ocean is but about half a mile it is plain that the air revolving in a sphere about  00 times larger than that of the ocean will have a proportionably greater agitation  besides rocks shelves and the inequality of shoars are a great stop to the access and recess of the sea but nothing repels the rising air whic his also of such thinness and fluidity that it is easily driven and runs every way  nor ought we to omit that it is the universal law of bodies attracted that the force of attraction is reciprocally as the squares of their distances so that the action of the sun and moon will be greater upon the air than upon the water upon the account of its nearness  but the consideration of the elasticity is still of greater moment here of which this is the nature that it is reciprocally as the pressure so that the incumbent weight being diminished by the attraction the air underneath will upon this score be mightily expanded  these and such like causes will make the tides in the air to be much greater than those of the ocean nor is it necessary to our purpose to determine by nice calculations their particular forces it is sufficient to have proved that these motions must both be universal and also return at certain intervals  now since the raising of the water of the ocean    feet produces torrents of such a prodigious force we may easily conceive what tempests of winds if not otherwise checked the elevation of the air much higher perhaps above a mile will necessarily cause and there is no doubt to be made but that the same infinitely wise being who contrived the flux and reflux of the sea to secure that vast collection of waters from stagnation and corruption which would inevitably destroy all the animals and vegetables on this globe has ordered this ebb and flood of the air of our atmosphere with the like good design that is to preserve in case all other causes should fail as they may and at times do in some countries the sweet freshness and brisk temper of this fluid so necessary to life and keep it by a kind of continual circulation from deadness and stinking  this reasoning is liable to only one objection that i know of and that is this that the appearances we have mentioned cannot be owing to the causes now assigned since by calculation from them the mercury must at new and full moon subside in the barometer to a certain degree which yet we do not observe to happen  in answer to which besides that there have been some observations made of the sinking of the mercury at those times and it may perhaps be the fault of the observers that these have not been reduced to any rule we are to consider that although winds and alterations in the pressure of the atmosphere are the necessary consequents of the lunar attraction and true causes of the different rise of the mercury in the barometer yet these may be produced many other ways too and therefore though regularly the mercury would always fall at the new and full moon those other causes may be strong enough even to raise it at those seasons in as much as two contrary winds for instance blowing toward the place of observation may accumulate the air there so as to increase both the height and weight of the incumbent cylinder in like manner the direction of two winds may be such as meeting at a certain angle they may keep the gravity of the air in the middle place unaltered and a thousand such varieties there may be by which the regularity of appearances of this nature may be hindered now the other springs from which such changes in the air may arise are these    elastic vapors forced from the bowels of the earth by subterraneous heats and condensed by whatever cause in the atmosphere    a mixture of effluvia of different qualities in the air may by rarefactions fermentations etc produce winds and other effects like those resulting from the combination of some chemical liquors and that such things happen we are assured from the nature of thunder lightning and meteors    from the eruptions of vulcanoes and earthquakes in distant places winds may be propagated to remoter countries    the divided or united forces of the other planets and of comets may variously disturb the influence of the sun and moon etc we know that there happen violent tempests in the upper regions of the air while we below enjoy a calm and how many ridges of mountains there are on our globe which interrupt and check the propagation of the winds so that it is no wonder that the phenomenon we have ascribed to the action of the sun and moon are not always constant and uniform and that every effect does not hereupon follow which were there no other powers in nature able to alter the influence of this might in a very regular and uniform manner be expected from it  these things being premised it will not be difficult to show as was proposed in the first place that these changes in our atmosphere at high water new and full moon the equinoxes etc must occasion some alterations in all animal bodies and that from the following considerations    all living creatures require air of a determined gravity to perform respiration easily and with advantage for it is by its weight that this fluid insinuates itself into the cavity of the breast and lungs now the gravity as we have proved being lessened at these seasons a smaller quantity only will insinuate itself and this must be of smaller force to comminute the blood and forward its passage into the left ventricle of the heart whence a slower circulation insues and the secretion of the spirits is diminished    this effect will be the more sure in that the elasticity of the atmosphere is likewise diminished animals want air as heavy so elastic to a certain degree for as this is by its weight forced into the cavity of the thorax in inspiration so the muscles of the abdomen press it into the bronchi in expiration where the bending force being somewhat taken off and springy bodies when unbended exerting their power every way in proportion to their pressures the parts of the air push against all the sides of the vesiculae and promote the passage of the blood  we have a convincing instance of all this in those who go to the top of high mountains for the air is there so pure as they call it that is wants so much of its gravity and elasticity that they breathe with very great difficulty    all the fluids in animals have in them a mixture of elastic aura which when set at liberty shows its energy and causes those fermentations we observe in the blood and spirits now when the pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of our body is diminished the inward air in the vessels must necessarily be enabled to exert its force in proportion to the lessening the gravity and elasticity of the outward hereupon the juices begin to ferment change the union and cohaesion of their parts break their canals etc  this is very plain in living creatures put into the receiver exhausted by the airpump which always swell as the air is more and more drawn out their lungs at the same time contracting themselves and falling so together as to be hardly discernible esperienze dell academia del cimento p m       ere we proceed to matters of fact it may be worth the while to take notice that effects depending on such causes as these must of necessity be most visible in weak bodies and morbid constitutions when other circumstances concur to their taking place for this reason whatever mischiefs do hence follow cannot in the least disparage the wise contrivance of infinite power in ordering these tides of our atmosphere the author of nature we know has made  things to the greatest advantage that could be for the whole system of animals on our globe but it was impossible that such a disposition should not in some cases be prejudicial to a few the position and distance of the sun are so adjusted as to give in the most beneficial manner possible heat and light to the earth yet this notwithstanding some places may be too hot for some weakly bodies some autumns too sultry to agree with some animals and some winters too cold to be endured by some tender creatures the whole however we must own is most carefully provided for besides as most of these last mentioned inconveniences are by easy shifts to be avoided so there are such powerful checks put to this aerial flux and reflux so many ways of abating the damages accruing from it now and then that these are of no account in comparison of the mighty benefits hence arising in which the race of mankind does universally share  a discourse concerning the action of the sun and moon on animal bodies part ii there are no histories in physic which we may more safely take upon the credit of the authors who relate em than such as we are now going to mention in some cases a point may perhaps be strained to serve a darling hypothesis which the writer has taken up but here we are much more likely to have pure matter of fact because hitherto no one has pretended the appearances of this kind to be within the reach of any scheme of philosophy  epileptical diseases besides the other difficulties with which they are attended have this also surprising that in some the fits do constantly return every new and full moon the moon says galen  de dich critic lib   governs the periods of epileptick cases upon this score they who were thus affected were called  alexand trallian lib   c    and in the histories of the gospel  matthew c xvii v    by some of the latins afterward lunatici apuleius de virtutib herbar cap   and     bartholin anatem centur   h    tells a story of one epileptick who had apparent spots in her face which according to the time of the moon varied both their color and magnitude  but no greater consent in such cases was perhaps ever observed than what i saw some time since in a child about five years old in which the convulsions were so strong and frequent that life was almost despaired of and by evacuations and other medicines very difficulty saved the girl who was of a lusty full habit of body continued well for a few days but was at full moon again seized with a most violent fit after which the disease kept its periods constant and regular with the tides she lay always speechless during the whole time of flood and recovered upon the ebb the father who lives by the thames side and does business upon the river observed these returns to be so punctual that not only coming home he knew how the child was before he saw it but in the night has risen to his employ being warned by cries when coming out of her fit of the turning of the water this continued    days that is to the next great change of the moon and then a dry scab on the crown of the head the effect of an epispastick plaster with which i had covered the whole occiput in the beginning of the illness broke and from the sore though there had been no sensible discharge this way for above a fortnight ran a considerable quantity of limpid serum upon which the fits returning no more i took great care to promote this new evacuation by proper applications with desired success for some time and when it ceased besides two or three purges with mercurius dulcis etc ordered an issue in the neck which being thought troublesome was made in the arm the patient however has never since felt any attacks of those frightful symptoms  whether or no it be through want of due heed and enquiry that we have not in all the collections of histories and cases any instance of the like nature so particular as this is i know not this is certain that as the vertigo is a disease nearly related to the epilepsy and the hysterical symptoms do partake of the same nature so both one and the other are frequently observed to obey the lunar influence in like manner the raving fits of mad people which keep lunar periods are generally in some degree epileptic too  tulpius observe med lib   cap    and piso de morb a serosa colluvie obs    afford us remarkable instances of periodical palseys  every one knows how great a share the moon has in forwarding those evacuations of the weaker sex which have their name from the constant regularity they keep in their returns and there is no question to be made but the correspondency we here observe would be greater still and even universal did not many accidents and the infinite varieties in particular constitutions one way or other concur to make a difference it is very observable that in countries nearest to the equator where we have proved the lunar action to be strongest these monthly secretions are in much greater quantity than in those near the poles where this force is weakest this hippocrates de aere aquis and locis takes notice of and gives it as one reason why the women in scythia are not very fruitful  the case being thus with females it is no wonder if we sometimes meet with periodical haemorrhages answering to the times of the moon in males also for as a greater quantity of blood in proportion to the bulk in one sex is the reason of its discharging itself through proper ducts at certain intervals when the pressure of the external air being diminished the internal aura can exert its elasticity so in the other if at any time there happens to be a superabundancy of the same fluid together with a weak tone of the fibers it is plain that the vessels will be most easily burst when the resistance of the atmosphere is least and this more especially if any accidental hurt or rarefying force has first given occasion to the other causes to take effect  i know a gentleman of a tender frame of body who having once by overreaching strained the parts about the breast fell thereupon into a spitting of blood which for a year and half constantly returned every new moon and decreasing gradually continued always four or five days the fits being more or less considerable according as his management about that time contributed to a greater or lesser fullness of the vessels  we have two notable instances of the like nature in our philosophical transactions the one no     of a person who from his infancy to the   th year of his age had every full moon an eruption of blood on the right side of the nail of his left thumb at first to three or four ounces and after his sixteenth year to half a pound each time which when by searing the part with a hot iron it stopped he fell into a sputum sanguinis and by frequent bleeding etc was very difficultly saved from a consumption the other philes trans no     is a story of an innkeeper in ireland who from the   d year of his life to the   th in which it killed him suffered a periodical evacuation at the point of the forefinger of his right hand and although the fits here kept not their returns so certain as in the forementioned case it may be either from the irregular way of living of the patient or the mighty change every effusion made in his habit of body the quantity seldom amounting to less than four pounds at a time yet there is this remarkable circumstance in the relation that the first beginning of this haemorrhage was at easter that is the next full moon after the vernal equinox which is one of the two seasons of the year at which we have proved the attraction of the air or lessening of its pressure to be greater than at any other time whatsoever  but we are besides this to consider that the static chair and nice observation taught sanctorius medicin static sect   aph    that men do increase a pound or two in their weight every month which overplus is discharged at the months end by a crisis of copious or thick turbid urine  it is not therefore at all strange that we should once a month be liable to the returns of such distempers as depend upon a fullness of the vessels that these should take place at those times especially when the ambient air is least able to repress the turgency and that though new and full moon are both of equal force yet that sometimes one and sometimes the other only should influence the periods according as this or that happens to fall in with the inward repletion  the afflux of humors to ulcers is sometimes manifestly altered by this power de experiment circq sanguin p m     baglivi was acquainted with a learned young man at rome who labored under a fistula in the abdomen penetrating to the colon which discharged so plentifully in the increase and so sparingly in the decrease of the moon that he could make a very true judgment of the periods and quadratures of that planet from the different quantity of the matter that came from him  nephritic paroxysms have frequently been observed to obey the lunar attraction tulpius observat lib   c    vid etiam observe    relates the case of mr ainsworth an english minister at amsterdam who had a fit of the gravel and suppression of urine every full moon of which he found no relief till the moon decreased unless by bleeding at the arm after his death two large stones were taken out of his bladder and the pelvis of the left kidney was enlarged to that degree by the quantity of urine so often stopped there as to contain almost as much as the bladder itself  i was present not long since at the dissection of a child about five or six years old who died of the frequent returns of nephritic fits attended with vomitings and a diarrhaea the kidneys and ureters were quite stuffed with a slimy calculous matter and it was very instructive to see the different degrees of concretion in the several parts of it from a clear limpid water to a hard friable substance dr groenvelt who had tended the boy in his illness observed him to be seized with his pains at every full moon for several months together which generally ended with the voiding of a stone  what influence the moon has in asthmas asthma and tuss    van helmont takes notice exacerbatur paroxysmus says he lunae stationibus and aevi tempestatibus quas ideo praesentit and praesagit treatise of the asthma p    and sir john floyer who has given us a more particular history of this disease than any author observes that the fits usually return once in a fortnight and frequently happen near the change of the moon  it is a more uncommon effect of this attractive power that is related by the learned kerckringius observat anatomic    he knew a young gentlewoman whose beauty depended upon the lunar force insomuch that at full moon she was plump and very handsome but in the decrease of the planet so wan and illfavored that she was ashamed to go abroad till the return of the new moon gave fullness to her face and attraction to her charms  though this is indeed no more than an influence of the same kind with that the moon has always been observed to have upon shellfish and some other living creatures for as the old latin poet lucilius says apud a gellium lib  0 c   luna alit ostrea and implet echinos muribu fibras et pecui addit    and after him manilius astronomic lib   sic submersa fretris concharum and carcere clausa ad lunae motum variant animalia corpus   it is very well worth the pains to enquire what share such an alteration in the weight and pressure of the atmosphere may have in the crises or changes of acute diseases the ancients made great account of critical days and regulated their practice according to the expectation they had from them this part of physic is grown now into disuse quite slighted and even ridiculed and that i suppose chiefly for these two reasons in the first place because the earliest observations of this kind which were drawn into rules being made in eastern countries when these came to be applied to the distempers of the northern regions without allowance given for the difference of the climate they were oftentimes found not to answer and secondly fevers of old were treated with few or no medicines the motions of nature were carefully watched and no violence offered to interrupt her work the histories therefore of crises though of great use and certainty under such management as this were at length unavoidably set aside and lost when acute cases came to be cured according to this or that hypothesis not only by evacuations but hot or cold alteratives too there being no longer any room for those laws of practice which supposed a regular and uniform progress of the distemper  wherefore in order to understand a little both what might induce the first masters of our profession to so nice and strict an observance in this point and what grounds there may be now for a more due regard to their precepts even upon the score of the lunar attraction only i propose the following remarks    all epidemick diseases do in their regular course require a stated time in which they come to their height decline and leave the body free  this is so constant and certain that when a fever of any constitution which is continual in one subject happens from some other cause in another to be intermitting the paroxisms do always return so often as all together to make up just as many days of illness as he suffers whose distemper goes on from beginning to end without any abatement  dr sydenham a sworn enemy to all theories learned thus much from downright observation and gives this reason why autumnal quartans holds six months because by computation the fits of so long a time amount to     hours or    days the period of a continual fever of the same season de febr intermit ann      page m      so galen takes notice that when an exquisite tertain is terminated in seven paroxisms a true continual at the same time has its crisis in seven days that is the fever lasts as long in one as in the other in as much says he as a fit in an intermitting fever answers to a day in a continual comment in aphor    lib   and de crisib lib   c   now this so comes to pass because    in these cases there is always a fermentation in the blood which goes not off till the active particles are thrown out by those organs of secretion which according to the laws of motion are most fitted to separate em and    as different liquors put upon a ferment are depurated in different times so the arterial fluid takes up a determined period of which it is discharged of an induced effervescence    the symptoms during this ebullition do not proceed all along in the same tenor but on some days particularly they give such evident marks of their good or bad quality that the nature of the ensuing solution may very well be guessed at and foretold by em  things being thus those days on which the disease was so evidently terminated one way or other might very justly be called the days of crisis and those upon which the tendency of illness was discovered by most visible tokens the indices of the critical days  and thus far the foundation was good but when a false theory happened unluckily to be joined to true observations this did a little puzzle the cause hippocrates it is plain knew not to what to ascribe that remarkable regularity with which he saw the periods of fevers were ended on the seventh fourteenth one and twentieth day etc pythagoras his philosophy was in those ages very famous of which harmony and the mysteries of numbers made a considerable part odd were more powerful than even and seven was the most perfect of all our great physician espoused these notions epidem lib   sect   and confined the stages of acute distempers to a septenary progression  de septimestri parta  upon which this inconvenience followed that when a crisis fell out a day sooner or later than this computation required his measures were quite broken and that this must necessarily oftentimes happen will appear by and by  upon this score asclepiades rejected this whole doctrine as vain vid celsum lib   c   and celsus finding it to be too nice and scrupulous observes that the pythagorean numbers led the ancients into the error ibid   galen being aware of this succeeded much better in his reasoning upon the matter and very happily imputed the critical changes not to the power of numbers but to the influence of the moon which he observes has a mighty action upon our earth exceeding the other planets not in energy but in nearness de diebus decretor lib   so that according to him the septenary periods in diseases are owing to the quarterly lunar phases which are the times of the greatest force and which return in about seven days ibid   the result of the whole affair in short is this a crisis is no more than the expulsion of the morbific matter out of the body through some or other of the secretory organs in order to which it is necessary that this should be prepared and comminuted to such a degree as is required to make it pass into the orifices of the respective glands and therefore as the most perfect crisis is by sweat both by reason that the subcutaneous glands do naturally discharge more than all the other put together and also that their ducts being the smallest of any whatsoever comes this way is certainly very well divided and broken so the most imperfect is an haemorrhage because this is an argument that what offends is not fit to be cast off in any part and consequently breaks the vessels by the effervescence of the blood an abscess in those organs which separate thick slimy juices is of a middle nature betwixt these two  now it is very plain that if the time in which either the peccant humor is prepared for secretion or the fermentation of the blood is come to its height falls in with those changes in the atmosphere which diminish its pressure the crisis will then be more complete and large and also that this work may be forwarded or delayed a day upon the account of such an alteration in the air the distention of the vessels upon which it depends being hereby made more easy and a weak habit of body in some cases standing in need of this outward assistance thus a fever which requires about a week to its period may sometimes as hippocrates observed have a good crisis on the sixth and sometimes not till the eighth day  in order therefore to make true observations of this kind the time of invasion is to be considered the genuine course of the distemper must first be watched which is not to be interrupted by any violent methods the strength of nature in the patient is to be considered and by what secretions the crisis is most likely to be performed and it will then be found that not only the new and full moons but even the southings whether visible or latent of the planet are here of considerable moment  for confirmation of which we need only to reflect on what mr paschal has remarked concerning the motions of diseases and births and deaths philos transact no  0   dividing the  into four senaries of hours the first consists of three hours before the southing of the moon and three after the second of the six hours following and the third and fourth of the remaining quarters of the natural day he takes notice that none are born or die a natural death in the first and third senaries which he calls first and second tides but all either in the second or fourth senaries which he calls first and second ebbs in like manner that in agues the tumult of the fits generally lasts all the tidingtime and then goes off in kindly sweats in the ebbs from whence he very rationally concludes that motion vigor action strength etc appear most and do best in the tiding senaries and that rest relaxation decay dissolution etc belong to the ebbing senaries  a corollary it having been explained in the beginning of this discourse how those influences of the heavens which favor the returns of diseases may likewise raise winds at the same times and that we feel the different effects of these according as other causes do concur to the motion of the air it will not be amiss to show in one instance or two how much natural history confirms this reasoning  there happened on the   th of november   0  a little before midnight a most terrible storm of wind the fury of it is still fresh in every ones mind which lasted above six hours  it is not to the present purpose to relate its history and causes what we observe is that the moon was at that time in perigaeo and just upon the change to new upon both which accounts its action in raising the atmosphere must be great and hence indeed the tides which followed were also very great and the mercury in the barometer at least in most places fell very low  this influence was without all doubt assisted by some such other causes of winds as we have mentioned these we cannot know but may however take notice how much the manifest state of the air contributed to this calamity  after a greater quantity of rains than ordinary had fallen in the summer and autumn in those places where the storm was felt the winter came on much warmer than usual so that the liquor in a thermometer of which the   th degree notes frost never fell below the  00th vid philos transact no       hence we may very well believe that the atmosphere was at that time filled with atoms of salts and sulphur out of the vapors raised by the heat from the moist earth which being variously combined and agitated gave that deadly force to the motion of the air  a proof of this we have not only from the frequent flashes of lightning observed a little before the storm but also from what the country people took notice of the next day viz that the grass and twiggs of the trees in fields remote from the sea tasted very salt so that the cattle would not feed on them  our histories mention another storm which if not equal to this last in violence is however thought the greatest that had then ever been known and memorable from the time at which it happened viz on the  d of september      the day on which the usurper oliver cromwell died  no ephemerides that i know of relate the condition of the air that year but it is sufficient to remark that whatever other causes concurred their force was accompanied with a full moon just before the time of the autumnal equinox  upon the same score it comes to pass that in those countries which are subject to frequent inundations these calamities are observed to happen at the time of the moons greatest influence so that the learned baccius del tevere lib   p     has rightly enough laid the cause of such mischiefs upon immoderate tides of the ocean being unhappily accompanied with the attractive force of some or other stars  dr childrey in his britannia baconica page     has from several instances shown the lunar action in damages of this kind  such and the like natural causes have storms and tempests for as to the question of divine power whether or no
