shilling   entered at stationershall  preface as this is wrote for the benefit of persons afflicted with the venereal disease in its various stages for the regulation of their diet and conduct on any emergency that may happen when it is not in their power to apply immediately to their surgeon and also proper instructions for conducting themselves while under cure i have therefore not given any anatomy of the parts nor entered into the minutiae of the disease more than is necessary for restoring the constitution and given means for future prevention such a small work as this will appear peculiarly necessary to every one in the first place from the symptoms of the disease prudent persons will be on their guard and libertines have a method to prevent any future injury by which means posterity will be benefited and unhappy sufferers will here have full directions which will not only be acceptable to them but to all persons of either sex  advice etc the venereal disease in ancient records      and      public stews and brothels were tolerated under certain regulations and those girls that had the burning as it was called were separated from the rest and forbid to lie with man while she had it falstaff hints at the disease in the second part of henry iv act ii scene iv   fall if the cook help to make the gluttons you help to make diseases doll we catch of you doll we catch of you grant that my poor virtue  grant that  also see leviticus chap       and  0 may be obtained three ways viz first by impure connection secondly by contact of parts midwives ought to be excessive careful to have no cuts or sores on their fingers as numbers of cases have occurred where they have obtained a confirmed lues by the contact of parts  and lastly hereditary be it obtained which way it will we ascribe it to the french i e the french pox they call it the neapolitan the neapolitan the spanish and the spanish the indian in its first stage it is called the gonorrhoea or clap what is commonly called the dry clap is when there is no discharge with difficulty of making water from the increase of the swelling and inflammation an ischury or total suppression of urine is the consequence  in the second the confirmed pox or lues venerea and that every one may know when they have obtained this horrid disease and to what stage they have advanced i shall lay down every symptom as they occur  gonorrhoea i believe the gonorrhoea to be merely a local complaint the lues venerea constitutional this is proved in the hospitals every day for if a patient should go through a ptylysmis or spitting and contract a gonorrhoea during the cure the constitutional disease would be removed but the local continue its signs the first symptoms are an agreeable sensation in the genital parts in general and the testicles have a creeping wormlike motion which stimulates to venery next a gradual discharge comes on first a limpid thin humor which increases until it comes a sharp stinking purulent matter the parts inflame and now great pain is felt in passing the urine like so many needles this increases to such a height that the patient dreads to make water and from the pain and fear he does not let it flow but passes it in jerks his physiognomy at this period is very unfavourable this is called a dysuria an inflammable symptom young people at the first time have it worse than others  the misery is now increased by a chordee so called from its similarity to a chorde binding down the penis  i e the penis becomes frequently erect in a disagreeable manner curved downwards with exquisite pain in those that have long foreskins it inflames cannot be drawn back and is called phymosis there is sometimes vesicles or bladders filled with water on the surface  in those that are short it contracts and swells up behind the nut sometimes to such a degree as to endanger the patients life and is named a paraphimosis i have known it to swell and contract till the inflammation increased so as to stop the circulation in the nut which by this means mortification came on and they have lost this part  from the inflammation deep corroding ulcers venereal ulcers are always known by their being jaggd at the edges and running in different ways with a sloughlike appearance now appear called chancres the first appearance of a chancre is not unlike the thrush in the mouths of children parents cannot be too careful who suckle their children as they may obtain this disease from a small chancre on the nipple or on the breast of the nurse nor can youth be too careful who they salute as prostitutes frequently have small ulcers on their lips tongue etc whenever these appear even in the slightest manner we should consider it as the confirmed pox and treat it under that head   in women it makes its appearance in about three or four days the patient feels a pleasing irritation which soon degenerates into pain a prickling shooting sensation within the parts which inflame and swell is sore and painful the urine is hot and scalding to such a degree that the patient dreads to make water she feels a contractive from the inflammable attack of the virus in women there is a peculiar constriction toward one side or the other in the vagina which answers to the chordee in men and painful sensation in the lower part of her body with a creeping motion within the sides about the hips dull pains across the back the discharge is at first slime then thin watery sharp foetid bloody and at length becomes a deep green  buboes and swelled testicles in this stage will sometimes arise either from sudden colds or the virus being repelled by improper treatment  in the first the notice of the patient is attracted by a pain in the groin and upon examination he finds a small lump the size of a pea there is no inflammation externally but after handling the part becomes more painful and increases to the size of a nut the part is more sensible it throbs the body is inflamed a slight fever comes on universal lassitude pains in the limbs headache thirst etc still increasing to the size of a pigeons egg becomes inflamed matter forms and it is now at its maturity the second makes its approach with a painful wormlike motion in one or both testicles the running abates and frequently stops they swell and inflame dull heavy burdensome pains come on with sudden twinges and stitches extending into the loins they now become a painful load a fever succeeds and the crisis is at hand by either suppuration gangrene or cancer when the pain and inflammation in the testicle abate the running returns if the inflammation runs high it is then that bleeding plentifully is of service also purging fomentations etc which must be left to the surgeons care   the confirmed pox or second stage women may have the dry or latent pox for a length of time in their habit as long as their menstrual discharges continue but the moment these cease the whole frame falls into confusion  is now ushered in by venereal excrescences or warts which make their appearances about the private parts they are neither hard nor soft open moist or dry they put on forms like pinheads or ragged at bottom some is pendent others like a cocks comb or mulberries the first symptoms the patient feels is an irregular intermittent fever pain in the head arms legs knees great lassitude and dejection of spirits the pain increases especially at night and when warm in bed it is past bearing nor can they get any sleep till toward the morning i have observed in the hospitals patients laboring under nocturnal pains from a venereal cause that when they have had no rest for a month etc before they come into the venereal ward they have not been in the ward above two days before they have generally good nights owing to the minute particles of mercury floating in the atmosphere they breathe  the head grows heavy sometimes with a dull pain sixed in one spot like a nail drove in by degrees small lumps arise on the scull arms legs and thighs nodes which become painful and torment the patient alternately scurfy places appear in different parts of the body face eyebrows and forehead gradually increasing till it invades the hair which it incircles the crown of venus the ears are corroded and filled up with scabby stinking matter the eruptions increase the lips become sore and crack the mouth and nostrils are now infected and run a thick ischor the skin becomes rough and covered with branny scales the eyes are dull heavy red and staring the face becomes blotted the neck stiff the mouth sore the cheeks firey the nose swells is distorted and stuffed with scabs the tongue enlarges the throat is sore the hairy scalp is now covered with a crust and loses its natural color the hands swell the nails grow thick and drop off the voice changes and the language is unintelligible the lungs depressed the mouth stiff and open the breath loathsome and foetid and the mind filled with wretchedness and despair to close this horrid scene the burning pains increase a heavy pulse universal weakness dimness of sight hiccup stranguary difficulty of speech and respiration the nodes break open the scaly scalp cracks the nose and throat is corroded the teeth drop out the breath is insupportable and the whole fabric is now a mass of stinking carrion if the malady continues till limb from limb drops off the vitals are attacked and the unhappy sufferer expires the putrid carcass is hurried to the grave offensive to all  having thus far given the history of the disease from the beginning to the end that every one may know how to avoid those who are unfortunate enough to have any of the above appearances i shall now proceed to give advice to those who labor under its baneful influence  on the first appearance of the disease let me injoin you to temperance soberness and chastity three moral virtues here indispensably necessary your diet neither purging nor a low diet are necessary in the cure of the gonorrhoea drastic purging will increase the inflammation must be moderate and roast meat is preferable to boiled beef and mutton to veal or lamb the former is the more easy of digestion but mutton is the easiest of all avoid spices or high sauces for as it is in its first stage a topical inflammation every thing which increases the circulation of the blood will promote the disease consequently all excessive exercises must be avoided such as riding on horseback leaping jumping etc you may drink wine but beware of intoxication or you will suffer the next day severely though at this time venus attracts your thoughts yet pay no homage at her shrine in short eat when you are hungry but small quantities at a time let your drink be moderate and be satisfied when your thirst is quenched the passions of the mind have here great influence avoid them they irritate the disease and when indulged to excess they have been known to bring on alarming symptoms i must lay particular stress on cleanliness a species of lues venerea prevails in the west of scotland which the natives call sibbins or sivvins owing to uncleanliness  especially in the fair sex for without this the disease rapidly increases from the corroding virus lying on the parts or hid in the folds by which means the irritation is increased and consequently the inflammation will extend bringing on chancres buboes etc which in many instances by timely care might have been avoided and to this end always wash the parts with a little milk and water two or three times a day or what is better a scruple of calomel in two or three ounces of rose water and between the folds put a little lint which change every time to those who in the first stage use injections retain them in the parts as long as possible to let it come away immediately is of very little service by the improper use of astringent injections astringent injections are such as the vitriol alum and the preparations of lead about  0 or    drops of the extract of lead in four ounces of soft water are sometimes necessary to wash the parts when a pariphimosis takes place it acts as a seditive and will abate the inflammation but ought to be sparingly used the running at first is frequently stopped and the unhappy sufferer thinks he is cured till alas appearances too soon inform him of his fatal mistake on the contrary injections that are serviceable at first increase the discharge your body should be kept moderate neither bound nor loose if you find a painful sensation in your groin or testicle and at this time it is not convenient to apply for advice suspend the testicle in a bag and rub it with a little mercurial ointment mixed with camphor the same by the buboe but remember in the latter rub rather below the part that the lymphatis may carry it through the glands but if they still increase apply a poultice of bread and milk mixed with the blue mercurial ointment which in general will carry them off there certainly is no occasion to bring the buboe to suppuration giving the patient unnecessary pain and trouble i do and always think it advisable to suppress them especially at the beginning as they frequently arise from irritation which causes inflammation in the glands and hence obstructions i must here ask the gentlemen of the faculty if abating the inflammation lessening the irritation and by any means removing the obstructions can pox the patient on the contrary i think letting it proceed to suppuration and exposing a surface to the air is the most likely means in the world i knew a worthy practitioner in the country so bigoted to the idea of a suppurated buboe curing the diseafe that after he has applied his caustic he seldom took any further notice of it but if the patient applies too late and suppuration is at its height i seldom open them in men  in women never if an opening is required i guage the lancet between my finger and thumb and by drawing the same across the buboe from left to right and vice versa as occasion may require open it with ease and safety by this means the patient is not frightened with the knife nor tortured with the caustic the dressing cannot be too slight and for the first day or two apply a poultice of white bread and milk mixed with a little mercurial ointment over all this takes off the callous edges so much complained of when the knife is used  or relieve till you can get assistance buboes sometimes by ill treatment or a bad habit of body become phagedenic i e when the lips of the wound are hard loose and for the space of an inch does not adhere to the surface of the ulcer underneath this a probe may be passed all round there is a livid appearance discharges a thin fluid very different from the true pus some practitioners have been induced to give mercury at this time while suppuration is going on and likewise after matter has been evacuated which will irritate inflame and produce a truly phagedenic sore when this is the case i would recommend the bark and sarsaparilla the patient at the same time should have a milk and vegetable diet with country air there is no medicine that so speedily removes the effects of mercury as sarsaparilla given in powder or decoction and bark will strengthen the system after this treatment has been used for some time and the sore brought into a good state it will be apt to spread and break out again from being affected by the venereal matter returning when mercury must be had recourse to but with a great deal of caution if the sore should again have phagedenic appearances mercury must be desisted from and the bark and sarsaparilla as before and when at a favorable state the mercury again continued these kind of ulcers are the most difficult to cure in all surgery outward applications should be mild the best is a white bread poultice  if a phimosis comes on soak the part in milk and water syringe the glands with the calomel injection frequently after which put up a little lint round the nut with a probe or skewer the pariphimosis treat the same but always have your surgeons advice especially in the latter as delays here would be injurious i would always advise as long as any scalding continues to drink plentifully of linseed tea or to eat gum arabic these mucilaginous substances will abate the acrimony of the urine if any hard knot should arise rub them with the ointment beforementioned another symptom attending this stage is a chordee no pleasant companion but it is soon removed by rubbing the part with a little ointment and applying a plaster of the same upon it  having thus far given you cautions i will now proceed to a more pleasant subject namely symptoms of an approaching cure which is when the scalding abates the discharge thickens the green appearance gradually vanishes yellow succeeds till at last it is white and does not stain the linen and may now be called a common gleet which is removed by balsamic medicines fresh air and moderate exercise to which i will add frequent topical cold bathing the parts are always after a gonorrhoea relaxed or lame and nothing is more conducive to restore the tone of the fibers than topical cold bathing what i mean by this is to pour a bottle of cold water on the parts as soon as you rise in the morning this some call cabbaging if from ill treatment or neglect the urethra is filled with carnosities or callofities so as to obstruct the passage of urine where there are strictures in the urethra the urine is always divided into two streams and there is always matter on the bougie where the stricture or ulcer is a bougie will sometimes cause a chordee in an healthy person but as above it is the most painful at the part affected  then bougies become absolutely necessary but always be careful to tie a piece of thread round the top bind and fasten it gently around the nut  though thus far i have treated it as a simple inflammation and supposed it to be cured on that principle yet always take some alterative medicine mercurials in small doses are the best alterative medicines and during their course i always give the following diet drink  take of sassafras chips   oz sarsaparilla   oz guaiacum shavings   oz mezerian root   drams pour on this three quarts of boiling water and when cold it is fit for use a gill four or five times a day  to guard against any lurking mischief for i am certain too great security here or relying on the words of boasting pretenders it is become the fashion in modern quackery to advertise to cure without taking a single grain of mercury true so i am satisfied it is frequently done but if there be one out of five that have any virus left in the constitution it ought to induce all to take a few small doses i am certain it is from this our hospitals are so crowded  from this lurking mischief breaking at a distant period in various forms well deserving the name of hydra  has in the end been the ruin of many for the disease lying dormant for a number of years has afterward broke out in the various forms abovemenmentioned which had they taken some alterative medicines would never have happened where this is the case alterative medicines are the speediest and safest cure they act without injuring the system and joined with cleanliness never fail in the most confirmed pox the first thing to be thought of is frequently cleaning the teeth and gargling the throat change of linen frequently washing the body and beware of catching cold if any scaley eruptions appear wash them with bran and water or warts clip them off with a pair of scissars and apply the ointment over them if your throat or nostrils are affected use the fumes of mercury the best method of applying mercury in fumes is to put ten or fifteen grains of cinnabar on a hot iron drawing the smoke into the throat or up the nose twice a day through a funnel  or apply immediately to your surgeon if nodes arise rub them every night with the ointment keep the body temperate and in some cases it is advisable to wear a flannel jerkin and drawers next the skin when you find all the symptoms abate and vanish leave not off your medicines too suddenly after which i would advise a course of bark exercise change of air and cold bathing to take off the irritability the disease has caused in the system  before this advice is closed i shall give a few hints on the use of mercury  in the first place i do not agree with salvation even in the worst of cases it is from this imprudence that this sacred medicine has been thrown aside a medicine which when administered with caution is not injurious to the human frame on the contrary expel it from the materia medica how many millions would suffer from the scurvy gout rheumatism yaws bilious complaints etc it should be given in small doses without any perceptible action in this manner what are its effects it increases the action of the lymphatic system the consequence is the glands before obstructed have now a free circulation the offending virus is absorbed and thrown off by the pores of the skin urine stool etc the blood is purified and the body now restored to health on the contrary if too large a quantity is taken a foul breath rotten gums carious teeth etc ensues the glands are irritated to secretions beyond their power the appetite is lost the intestinal canal affected the head swells the tongue hangs out of the mouth and saliva is continually running from it copious sweats and universal debility follow at this period few come near him from the offensive smell suppose he stops here and the disease is cured how dearly is it paid for when so safe a remedy is at hand he lingers out the rest of his life with a debilitated irritable constitution  how many by this are brought to an early grave from this cause salivation is now justly exploded  to sum up the whole i would advise that in the first stage of a gonorrhoea or clap the method of cure shall be to lessen the inflammation and irritability of the system to promote gentle perspiration to correct the acrimony of the fluids and to protect the body from infection injections that will abate the inflammation that are void of astringency are preferable they are applied to the part diseased and certainly will cure more speedily than medicines taken by the mouth with proper injections where they have applied as soon as they have discovered the injury i have completely cured in a few days the most virulent gonorrhoea what medicines are taken internally should be antiinflammatory after this when the scalding is abated the color gone a simple gleet only remaining balsamics are the most proper but after all it is prudent to guard the constitution by a few alterative medicines in the lues venerea alteratives are what we must depend on but when joined to balsamics and others that will promote a gentle perspiration they are sure of success by these principles i have always succeeded in the worst of cases and weak debilitated habits arising from excesses of any kind whatsoever by cordial tonic medicines cold bathing change of air and exercise are sure to meet with relief  i must here guard youth from that diabolical practice of machinery so far is it from being a preservative that numbers have been poxed from too great a security there is now another fashionable vice no less injurious in debilitating the system by forcing nature further than her strength will bear and bringing on a train of nervous complaints i mean whipping i cannot help wishing with dr faulk that fools who lasciviously use this exercise to stir up their lust might be switched after emission as they endured it before which would soon cure them of this diabolical practice  to conclude i shall now lay down the most safe means of preventing this loathsome disease after intercourse with a suspected person always wash the parts with a little warm water or soap or if not at hand your own urine be careful to wash between the folds or round the glands and when you get home use the following  calomel   scruple rose water   ounces i cannot speak too highly of this preparation it is the most safe and efficacious application to old ulcers and cancers of every kind it producing good matter in a few dressings and when the ears are affected and discharge a foetid matter they should be syringed with it three or four times a day  and leave some of it on some throw it up the parts with a syringe and they are sure of success even if a slight gonorrhoea has taken place it will cure without any further application in women it is the best easiest and safest remedy not only here but also in the flower albus it being thrown up the vagina   times a day and the patient taking a little bark to strengthen and brace the system nothing else is further required by having this by them they may at all times keep free from the disease some choose to rub a small quantity of blue mercurial ointment on the groin and parts this too like the other is certainly destroying the infection in the bud and advisable when the other cannot be procured but there is one caution always to have the calomel pure and mild what i prepare for the purpose and for private practice undergoes a number of washings in lime water etc to take off every minute particle of acid  the end postscript no   0 wardour street
