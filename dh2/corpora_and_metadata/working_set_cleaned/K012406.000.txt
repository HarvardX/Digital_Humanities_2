across along the strand a shepherd walked and hung his head viewing the footsteps on the sand which a bright nymph had made  the tide says he will soon erase  the marks so lightly here impressed  but time or tide will never deface  her image in my breast  am i some savage beast of prey  am i some monster grown  that thus she flies so swift away  or meets me with a frown this said he took a running leap a lovers leap indeed and plunged into the sounding deep where hungry fishes feed the melancholy hern stalks by around the squalling seagulls yell aloft the croaking ravens fly and toll his passing bell ii  song  nancy  french air what the deuce do you think i am a fool pray and so plain i am not fit to be seen sure i am pretty enough in my own way and my dear i am now past fifteen yes
