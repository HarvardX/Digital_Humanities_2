an oration on the utility of public infirmaries occasioned by the opening of the radcliffe infirmary at oxford  by joseph bromehead m a of queens college  london sold by j and f rivington in st pauls churchyard and d prince in oxford  mdcclxxii  price one shilling  advertisement the following little piece was hastily drawn up in the year      when the heads of the university announced their intention of opening the radcliffe infirmary with an encoenia they afterward dropped this design but the author having lately employed a leisure hour in correcting and somewhat enlarging his oration now begs leave to lay it before the public  an oration on the utility of public infirmaries if we closely examine the moral qualities which are denominated virtues and which mankind have agreed to honor with applause we shall find that almost all regard man as he is a social being born to do good offices to others upon this principle it is found likewise that our approbation of virtuous actions is usually proportioned to the extent of their influence and utility thus a legislator and a patriot must ever be more admired than a man of prudence wisdom and integrity exerted only in the contracted sphere of private life  but of all the social qualities benevolence is the most immediately useful it is indeed the source of all the rest and naturally induces that great end and cement of society mutual beneficence this virtue too like all others becomes more illustrious in proportion as its consequences are more extended  to the strong and universal prevalence of this amiable quality it is owing that the magistrates and legislators in most countries have instituted some provision to alleviate the miseries of the indigent and helpless this also in the opulent the liberal and the ingenuous has produced the undertaking of works of the present kind of hospitals infirmaries and receptacles for the relief of various distresses  indeed the goods of fortune the means of health and felicity which come to the rich by inheritance or acquisition are not their sole exclusive property the poor have a claim of right for their share and the relation that subsists between them and the rich certainly obliges the latter to assist them under diseases casualties and heavy calamities  it perhaps may not be unnecessary to remind the sons of ease and affluence that the laborious poor not only form the bulk of the nation but are likewise the part on which the strength the prosperity and even the existence of the whole depends to them as distributed through the humbler and more toilsome offices of society we owe all the necessaries of life and all its conveniences the labor of the husbandman the manufacturer and mechanic is confessedly essential to the welfare of the community and yet a present subsistence for themselves and their families is their only recompense every sun rises to light them to their fatiguing labor which often ends not with the closing day they contentedly toil on from youth to age and while they perhaps repose their weary limbs in the hut of poverty see their sons entering upon the same course of unnoticed hardships and unrewarded industry surely then their lot at the best is not to be envied but what a deplorable change must they feel should they be attacked by any one of that host of diseases which make such havoc amongst the human race that strength which supported them in their daily toil now fails them that health of body and ease of mind which lightened the burden of poverty are now no more sickness by disabling them from earning a subsistence occasions want and want excludes the means of recovery from sickness the two greatest of natural evils united double each others weight and accumulate distress thus in more sultry climes the scorching sun every where oppresses the fainting traveller with his beams but should they be reflected from the declivity of some barren mountain the heat becomes intolerable the very air is tainted and all nature sickens  without health without the means of recovering it or even of subsisting whither then must these abandoned sons of affliction look for relief to the casual munificence of private benefactors uncertain hopeless prospect to their own friends or kindred alas their pity is all they have to bestow to their children since some of them no doubt are fathers of families  but here the scene is truly calamitous the little mourners stand round the sick bed of their parent and while they feel deeply feel for his sufferings cannot be insensible to their own he turns an hopeless eye toward them perceives them in want of that bread which he had hitherto provided for them by his labor perceives them foretasting those distresses which at his death are to be their sad inheritance  but waving these peculiar circumstances of misery let us only reflect on that variety of distempers to which poverty is exposed without the means of relief and in this view what objects of compassion present themselves before us objects which must awe the pride of man and awaken his tenderness  numbers of all diseased all maladies of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms of heartsick agony all feverous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer colic pangs demoniac phrenzy moping melancholy and moonstruck madness pining atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums what a group of human miseries all various yet all languid deformed and loathsome a benevolent mind shudders at their very names but could you have the wretched sufferers before your sight could you mark the dire tossing of restless anguish and listen to the deep groans of despair surely every eye would drop a sympathizing tear and every gentle heart would bleed  it may justly be a matter of wonder that our civil police has made none or at least no adequate provision for the poor when laboring under these calamities they are the servants of the public and therefore entitled to its protection besides a stronger tie subsists they whose distresses thus loudly implore our compassion what are they want indeed and misfortunes have much disguised them and misery has worn them to the bone yet they have the same nature and except a few accidental variable distinctions are the same with us they have an original alike divine a mind alike intelligent to be a man and to be miserable is a sufficient claim on the generous and humane shall we then leave those to perish whom it is the interest of their country and the duty of all mankind to assist and preserve medicine and every other relief in the calamity of bodily diseases are natural provisions for the present indigent and infirm state of the sons of men in spite indeed of all these assistances sickness will still slay its thousands and thin the world by its destroying sword but nothing surely can more contradict the order of nature and the will of providence than that numbers should fall victims not so much to the fury of disease as to the neglect and cruelty of those who ought to supply them with the means of recovery yet how many of our sick and disabled poor must be left to this unhappy lot if no public infirmaries are established to receive them  these indeed open their friendly doors for such poor deserted wretches these bind up their wounds and exert all the power of medicine to heal their diseases  where no charitable asylums of this kind are erected it is a common resource with our sick poor though a fatal one to apply to mercenary and pernicious empirics whose ignorance either immediately deprives them of their lives or injures their healths beyond reparation but in these houses of charity they are sure to find able physicians and every thing provided for their convenience and cure that art can suggest or munificence supply  public infirmaries are not only the best but the only means by which the necessitous can procure the several kinds of assistance which their various bodily diseases require in large commercial towns what other provision can be made against those casualties which so frequently happen to the poor laboring part of the inhabitants or to the still more unfortunate stranger  here give me leave to add to these general advantages one peculiar to this place a fashion has of late prevailed to send such of our youth as are designed for the profession of physic to foreign academies which though far inferior to our own in every other respect have been thought superior in this the reason of a custom so injurious to the interest of our country and the honor of our seats of learning is far from being satisfactory however by the present institution the very shadow of it is removed important as every public infirmary must be the importance of this is still more extensive it affords not only the best assistance to the sick and disabled but likewise the best opportunities of observation and improvement to young students in the medical science on whose future skill so much depends it has the happy the singular excellence of at once relieving the misery of individuals and making that misery beneficial to the community we now at length may justly boast that ours is the most complete seminary in europe for so important a study whether we regard botany anatomy the theory or practice of medicine to no profession is learning more necessary and here students can best consult the rich treasures of antiquity and the parents of the healing art here they may add every liberal accomplishment and acquire that general and extensive knowledge for which the english physicians are deservedly distinguished when we consider the general and local advantages of the infirmary here erected what public honors and benefits may we not date from this auspicious era may we not foretell that as our alma matter already reckons in the list of her sons the greatest names in medicine she will now add to the glorious catalogue and see in her train future linacres williss radcliffes and friends who shall emulate the science and reputation of those who have gone before them  but enough perhaps has been said to prove how much these institutions concern the public interest and honor indeed one would think it impossible that any persons should object to or refuse supporting these excellent undertakings which are so beneficial in all their views one would think it i say impossible but if any such should be with such we will not contend let avarice refuse its assistance and if possible its applause  though public infirmaries have political advantages so undeniable and selfevident yet we may safely affirm that they stand on a firmer basis that they are supported by arguments stronger than the deductions of reason arguments which every generous breast must feel when we reflect on the malignity of the diseases the weight of the complicated afflictions which they are intended to relieve we are we cannot but be interested and disposed to compassionate the sufferers partly from the consciousness of being liable to the same evils and partly from thy nobler impulses o benevolence here the truly humane mind like a welltuned instrument of music obeys the sudden touches of pity and the sweet harmony of its social affections wholly passive in the sympathy of its own goodness while the rich and powerful indulge the tender sensations of humanity and promote such wellplannd works of beneficence as the present institution they at once communicate happiness to others and inexpressibly augment their own they feel that they are obeying the dictates of purest nature and wisest reason that they are fulfilling the ends of society and the will of its great author whose darling attribute is mercy whose very essence is love most wisely did he distribute men into these subordinate ranks and implant these generous principles   he formed a whole the whole to bless on mutual wants built mutual happiness whatever may be the vices of the present age the most censorious cynick must allow that it has its share of that philanthropy and tenderness which we would here recommend history informs us that it was the barbarous policy of some ancient states to expose infants if infirm to abandon diseased persons and even to destroy those who were rendered useless to the community by age and decrepitude but polished times and nations are strangers to such unfeeling sentiments a disposition to compassion and to offices of kindness will ever gain ground in proportion to civilization and improved elegance of manners perhaps this virtue expands itself most when the powers of the mind are softened by luxury and all other virtues are in the wane it is certain that the earliest societies had less of it warriors and heroes were their greatest characters  however this may be i need not hesitate to congratulate my country since a bountiful and beneficent spirit is and has ever been its national characteristick for this i may appeal even to the ruder ages of ignorance and superstition to those hospitable and intentionally religious to those venerable and princely foundations over whose general undistinguished ruins humanity and piety must for ever mourn through the mistaken zeal of our ancestors these abounded more in our isle than in any other christian country and if at their dissolution these noble edifices and endowments had been applied to the uses which the public interest required poverty sickness and decrepit age had never wanted an asylum nor had the sacred will of the dead been so flagrantly violated or their ashes so impiously disturbed some of them it must be owned in the capital by the care and earnestness of an excellent prelate were saved from the sacrilegious talons of courtharpies and consecrated to the relief of misery and disease but so small was the number that it seemed only to point out how much might and ought to have been done had the least degree of public spirit justice or honor influenced those infamous plunderers here then was lost the grand opportunity of establishing receptacles for distress in every part of the kingdom and with equal indignation and sorrow must we look back on this deep this indelible stain of the annals of our reformation  but now indeed we see fairer and brighter prospects around us a spirit of charity has diffused itself amongst all ranks of people amongst our merchants our lawgivers and nobles the liberality of our forefathers is at least equalled and their wisdom in choosing objects of that liberality much surpassed in our metropolis almost every species of distress has been considered pitied and relieved  the deserted infant whose misfortunes begin with its existence meets that redress for which it cannot petition  the unhappy prostitute though she has survived innocence finds she has not survived compassion she sees an hospitable retreat open for her misery and shame sees a friendly hand reached out to recover her stumbling feet to the paths of virtue and peace  i might lead your attention to that mansion within whose walls we behold the noble fabric of the human mind in its melancholy ruins  but this is a sight of all others the most humiliating and painful for persons in a state so consummately calamitous the bleeding pity of their fellowcitizens has made a munificent provision  like the wounded tree of arabia it weeps healing balm  worthy the kings of a martial and generous people are those royal foundations which receive the maimed veteran who has fought the battles of his country there after all his toils and dangers he sits down to recite in the honest loquacity of age his hardy deeds and count his glorious scars  brave man peaceful shall be the evening of a life exposed in the service of britain  thy hoary head is covered with wellearned laurels  i need not mention the various infirmaries and hospitals for the sick enough has already been said on the excellence of these houses of mercy and this is a species of patriotick charity which has not been confined to our chief city in other parts of the kingdom receptacles have been established for those who groan under the complicated wretchedness of poverty and disease and every one of this illustrious audience every one i doubt it not will join me in wishing that the streams of beneficence may still flow in so useful a channel and that each of our provincial towns may be blessed with such an institution as that which oxford at length enjoys  whilst the benevolent speculatist the sincere lover of his country contemplates all these establishments as the monuments of national virtue and the sources of innumerable advantages to the state the lover of the arts will consider them in an additional point of view will regard the structures which are destined to the purposes of public munificence as exhibiting to foreign nations and to posterity the most striking proofs of the taste and magnificence of his countrymen and contemporaries the houses of private citizens however opulent are seldom equal in the beauty of their structure to edifices of public use and contrivance where the purposes of private and domestic utility are only to be answered the genius of the artist is necessarily circumscribed he may indeed in these give proofs of the elegance of his taste and the correctness of his ideas but from the grand and magnificent he is unavoidably precluded but public edifices of every kind have most of all contributed to display the arts of design in their full luster in every age and country where those arts have been cultivated to them we owe the memory both of laudable actions and of illustrious artists and by them the flourishing nations of antiquity have transmitted to us the most durable records of their former splendour and greatness to them the first and most celebrated cities of the world at this day owe their chief ornament  the number of magnificent churches colleges and other public buildings throughout the christian boundaries and especially in italy have afforded an ample field to the genius of the architect the statuary and the painter in one city only the immense fabric of st peters the church of st john lateran the vatican library the hospital of the holy ghost and almost innumerable other edifices of public use will always present rome though fallen from her ancient glories as highly deserving the attention of the curious traveller and will immortalize the names as well of those artists who contributed their talents to their erection and embellishment as of the popes their patrons  in spain in france in our own country and in every nation where the arts have fixed their residence their influence is most conspicuous in the beauty and grandeur of public structures  no city or people can be more indebted for decorations of this kind to the munificence of a private citizen than we are to that admirable person from whose extensive benefactions to this seminary has arisen the design and establishment of an infirmary in this place it would therefore be unjust to close these reflections without some tribute to his memory  superior to the common views of a lucrative profession he esteemed wealth only valuable as it enabled him to extend his good offices to mankind hence the vast fortune which he acquired by his singular talents in the important science of physic was while he lived a fund of charity and beneficence and the noble bequests made by him at his death to this place of his education will continue the good effects of his liberality and his gratitude to the remotest times  he was a man undoubtedly born for the benefit and ornament of his country his virtues were of that kind whose luster will appear more amiable to the undazzled eye of wisdom than the trophies of conquerors and the splendid qualities of those whom the illjudging multitude calls great amongst the military honors of ancient rome the only one perhaps with which a benevolent man would wish to intwine his brow is the civic crown and if he who preserved the life of a single citizen deserved to be so distinguished what crowns must we weave for radcliffe  such was the wisdom which guided his beneficent soul such was the propriety which regulated the disposition of his wealth that though dead he still remedies the distresses and diseases of men and claims from them a dailyincreasing tribute of grateful applause the helpless objects who are relieved from misery or rescued from death by his bounty shall hang around his monument the useless crutch and the votive tablet  even those on whom providence has bestowed affluence though they are not affected by his munificence may be animated by his example  but it is unnecessary to expatiate on merit so transcendent and i will not obscure his praises by my feeble attempts to display them as the benefits resulting from his welldirected and boundless liberality will assuredly extend to future ages we may safely trust his fame to posterity  finis
