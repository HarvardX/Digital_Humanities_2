advocate his cause to plead you will yourselves be patrons of the dead no party his benevolence confined no sect  alike it flowed to all mankind he loved his friends forgive this gushing tear alas i feel i am no actor here he loved his friends with such a warmth of heart so clear of interest so devoid of art such generous freedom such unshaken zeal no words can speak it but our tears may tell  o candid truth o faith without a stain o manners gently firm and nobly plain o sympathizing love of others bliss where will you find another breast like his  such was the man  the poet well you know often has he touched your hearts with tender woe often in this crowded house with just applause you heard him teach fair virtues purest laws for his chaste muse employed her heavntaught lyre none but the noblest passions to inspire not one immoral one corrupted thought one line which dying he could wish to blot oh may tonight your favorable doom another laurel add to grace his tomb whilst he superior now to praise or blame hears net the feeble voice of human fame yet if to those whom most on earth he loved from whom his pious care is now removed with whom his liberal hand and bounteous heart shared all his little fortune could impart if to those friends your kind regard shall give what they no longer can from his receive that that even now above yon starry pole may touch with pleasure his immortal soul coriolanus a tragedy act i scene i the volscian camp attius tullus volusius volusius whence is it tullus that our arms are stopped here on the borders of the roman state why sleeps that spirit whose heroic ardour urgdy ou to break the truce and poured our host from all the united cantons of the volsci on their unguarded frontier such designs brook rot an hours delay their whole success depends on instant vigorous execution  tullus volusius i approve thy brave impatience and will to thee in confidence of friendship disclose my secret soul thou know galesus whose freedom caius marcius once his guest of all the spoil of sacked corioli alone demanded and who thence to rome from gratitude and friendship followed marcius whence lately to our antium he returned with overtures of peace proposed by rome  volusius i know him well an antiquated sage of that romantic school pythagoras established here on our hesperian shore whose gentle dictates only serve to tame enfeebled mortals into slaves  tullus galesus doubtless possesses many civil virtues is gentle good for rectitude of heart and innocence of life by all revered  volusius pardon me tullus if my faithful bluntness deems you too liberal in his praise in peace such may perhaps do well when prating rules an idle world but in tempestuous times they are stark naught these visionary statesmen fit rulers only for their golden age the rugged genius of rapacious rome for other men and other counsels calls  tullus your thoughts are mine  i only meant to tell thee the part he bears in this illtimed delay soon as our gathered army marched from antium the roman senate whose attentive caution watched all our motions took at once the alarm and sent a herald ere we past their borders with formal ceremony to demand the cause of our approach  had i been master i would have answered at the gates of rome but this galesus who attends our camp among the volscian deputies so pleaded the laws of nations made such loud complaints against the infraction of the public faith so teased us with the pedantry of states that i was forced unwilling to permit his freedman titus to be sent to rome with our demands if these the senate grants we then are in the toils of peace entangled in spite of all my efforts to avoid them  volusius o it is a wild chimera peace with rome dream not of that unless die volscian courage be quite subdued and only seeks to gild a vile submission with that specious name learn wisdom from your neighbors peace with rome has quelled the latins tamed their freeborn spirit and by her friendship honored them with chains  tullus she never will grant it on the just conditions i now have brought the volsci to demand the restitution of our conquered cities and fair alliance upon equal terms i know the roman insolence will scorn to yield to this and titus must return within three days the longest term allowed him of which the third is near elapsed already then even galesus will not dare to stop us with superstitious forms and solemn trisles from letting loose thunbridled rage of war against those hated tyrants of hesperia  volusius thanks to the gods my sword will then be free then poor corioli thy bleeding wounds thy treasures sacked thy captivated matrons shall amply be revenged by thy volusius then tullus from the losty brows of marcius thou may regain the wreaths his conquering hand by partial fortune aided tore from thine  tullus o my volusius thou who art a soldier a tried and brave one too say in thy heart do thou not scorn me thou who saw me bend beneath the halfspent thunder of a foe warm from the conquest of corioli which rushing furious in with those whose sally he had repelled he feizd almost alone and gave to fire and sword yet thence he flew scorning the plunder of our richest city his wounds undrest without a moments respite to where our armies on the fearful edge of battle stflood and asking of the consul to be opposed to me with mighty rage resistless bore us down  volusius true valor tullus lies in the mind the neveryielding purpose nor owns the blind award of giddy fortune  tullus my soul my friend my soul is all on fire thirst of revenge consumes me the revenge of generous emulation not of hatred this happy roman this proud marcius haunts me each troubled night when slaves and captives sleep forgetful of their chains i in my dreams anew am vanquished and beneath his sword with horror sinking feel a tenfold death the death of honor but i will redeem  yes marcius i will yet redeem my fame to face thee once again is the great purpose for which alone i live  till then how slow how tedious lags the time while shame corrodes me with many a bitter thought and injured honor sick and desponding preys upon itself  volusius it fast approaches now the hour of vengeance to this famed land to ancient latium due unballancd rome at variance with herself to order lost in deep and hot commotion stands on the dangerous point of civil war her haughty nobles and seditious commons reviling fearing hating one another while on our part all wears a prosperous face our troops united numerous high in spirit as if their genrals soul informed them all o longexpected day  tullus go brave volusius go breathe thy ardour into every breast that when the volscian envoy shall return whom ere the close of evening i expect one spirit may unite us in the cause of generous freedom and our native rights so long oppressed by romes encroaching power  scene ii tullus alone galesus said that marcius stands for consul o favor thou his suit propitious jove that i may brave him at his armys head in all the majesty of sovereign power that the whole conduct of the war may rest oh us alone and prove by its decision which of the two is worthiest to command  scene iii tullus officer tullus ha why this haste you look alarmed  officer my lord one of exalted port his visage hid has placed himself upon your sacred hearth beneath the dread protection of your lares and sits majestic there in solemn silence  tullus did you not ask him who and what he was  officer my lord i could not speak i felt appalled as if the presence of some god had struck me  tullus come dastard let me find this man of terrors  scene iv the back scene opens and discovers coriolanus as described above coriolanus tullus tullus after some silence illustrious stranger  for thy high demeanor bespeaks thee such  who art thou  coriolanus rising and unmuffling his face view me tullus  after some pause do thou not know me  tullus no that noble front i never saw before what is thy name  coriolanus does not the secret voice of hostile instinct does not thy swelling heart declare me to thee  tullus gods can it be   coriolanus yes i am caius marcius known to thy smarting country by the name of coriolanus that alone is left me that empty name for all my toils my service the blood which i have shed for thankless rome behold me banished thence a victim yielded by her weak nobles to the maddening rabble i seek revenge thou may employ my sword with keener edge with heavier force against her than ever it fell upon the volscian nation but if thou tullus do refuse me this the only wish of my collected heart where every passion in one burning point concenters give me death death from thy hand i sure have well deserved  nor shall i blush to take or life or death from attius tullus  tullus o caius marcius in this one short moment that we have friendly talked my ravished heart has undergone a great a wondrous change i ever held thee in my best esteem but this heroic confidence has won me stamped me at once thy friend i were indeed a wretch as mean as this thy trust is noble could i refuse thee thy demand  yes marcius thou have thy wish take half of my command if that be not enough then take the whole we have my friend a gallant force on foot an army marcius fit to follow thee go lead them on and take thy full revenge all should unite to punish the ungrateful ingratitude is treason to mankind  coriolanus embracing him thus generous tullus take a soldiers thanks who is not practiced in the gloss of words  thou friend indeed friend to my cause my quarrel friend to the darling passion of my soul all else i set at naught  immortal gods i am newmade and wonder at myself a little while ago and i was nothing a powerless reptile crawling on the earth cursed with a soul that restless wished to wield the bolts of jove i dwelt in erebus i wandered through the hopeless glooms of hell stung with revenge tormented by the furies now tullus like a god you draw me thence throne me amidst the skies with tempest charged and put the ready thunder in my hand  tullus what i have promised marcius i will do within an hour at farthest we expect the freedman of galesus back from rome who carried to the senate our demands their answer will i doubt not end the truce and instant draw our angry swords against them till then retire within my inmost tent unknown to all but me that when our chiefs meet in full council to declare for war i may produce thee to their wondering eyes as if descended from avenging heaven to humble lofty rome and teach her justice  coriolanus to thy direction tullus i resign my future life my fate is in thy hands and if i judge aright the fate of rome  the end of the first act act ii scene i galesus titus galesus indeed my titus i had hopes that rome vexed as she is with her domestic broils her frontier weak her armies unprepared might have complied with our demands and given us the same alliance granted to the latins  titus the senate scarce would hear the terms i offered but ordered me to bear this answer back if first the volsci take up arms the romans will be the last to lay them down  galesus alas this answer seals the doom of many a wretch unchaind bellona from her temple rushes with all the crimes and vices in her train earth fades at her approach to rural peace fair plenty and the social joy of cities soon will succeed rage rapine devastation each cruel horror sanctified by names o mortals mortals when will you content with natures bounty that in fuller flow still as your labors open more its sources abundant gushes over the happy world when will you banish violence and outrage to dwell with beasts of prey in woods and deserts  titus never till rome shall change her conquering maxims  galesus her haughty spirit now will soar beyond its usual pitch upborne by caius marcius stands he not for the consulate  titus he did but is no more a citizen of rome  galesus what mean thou titus  titus marcius is from rome banished for ever  galesus o immortal powers on what pretense could they to exile doom their wisest captain and their bravest soldier nor less renowned for piety for justice an uncorrupted heart and purest manners  titus the charge against him was entirely groundless what not his enemies themselves believed affecting of tyrannic power in rome his real crime was only some hot words struck from his fiery temper in the senate against those factious ministers of discord the tribunes of the people they to rage and frantic fury roused the mad plebeians by whom supported in their bold attempt they durst presume to summon to the bar of an enraged and partial populace the most illustrious senator of rome to this the nobles yielded  and with his gave up their own and childrens rights for ever  galesus o shameful weakness in a roman senate so much renowned for firmness yet my titus spite of my love to marcius i must own it the vigorous soil whence his heroic virtues luxuriant rise if not with careful hand severely weeded teems with imperfections his lofty spirit brooks no opposition his rage if once offended knows no bounds he deems plebeians with patrician blood compared the creatures of a lower species mere menial hands by nature meant to serve him  titus it was this high patrician pride undid him the furious people triumphed in his ruin as if they had expelled another tarquin while like a captive train the vanquished nobles hung their dejected heads in silent shame marcius alone seemed unconcerned though deep the latent tempest boiled within his breast choked up and smothered with excessive rage  galesus you were his guest at rome and therefore titus might on this sad occasion be permitted to join your tears with his domestic friends saw you that moving scene  titus i did galesus i followed marcius home  his mother there veturia the most venerable matron these eyes have ever beheld and soft volumnia his lovely virtuous wife amidst his children spread on the ground lay lost in dumb despair he swelling stood a while and could not speak thaffronted hero struggling with the man then thus at last he broke the gloomy silence it is done the guilty sentence is pronounced ungrateful rome has cast me from her bosom support this blow with fortitude and courage as it becomes two generous roman matrons i recommend my children to your care farewell i go i quit without regret a city grown an enemy to virtue  galesus oh godlike marcius oh unconquered strength and dignity of mind how much superior is such a soul to all the power of fortune  titus this said he sternly tried to break away when holding in her hand his eldest son veturia followed while the poor volumnia all drowned in tears and bearing in one arm their youngest yet an infant with the other hung clinging at his knees  he turning to them half softened half severe breathed from his soul these broken accents  cease your vain complaints mother you have no more a son and thou thou best of women thou my dear volumnia no more a husband  pierced with these dire words volumnia lifeless sunk and off he flung with wild precipitation  galesus thy sad tale blinds my old eyes with tears  but whither tell me o whither titus bent he then his course  titus where the blind genius of regardless rage and desperation led on to the gate capena called attended by the nobles he stalked in sullen majesty along nor deigned a word a godlike virtuous anger beamed through his features and sublimed his air with downcast eyes he walked or if aside he chanced to look each look was great reproach thus in emphatic silence that made words void and insipid all he parted from them the day preceding my return from rome nor has been heard of since lost in thabyss of his own woes  galesus o marcius noble marcius how shall my friendship succor thy distress where shall i find thee to partake thy sorrows and make myself companion of thy exile but titus we indulge discourse too long  go and assemble thou the volscian chiefs whilst i repair to tullus to inform and bring him to the council there to hear the fatal answer thou have brought from rome  scene ii changes to tulluss tent coriolanus tullus coriolanus forgive me tullus if i count the moments that stop the purpose of thy noble kindness and keep me here confined in tame inaction why lingers titus  tullus calm thy restless heart brave marcius every minute i expect him soon from the cloud that hides thee shall thou break with double brightness soon thy firey rage shall wither all the strength and pride of rome  coriolanus o righteous jove protector of the injured if from my earliest youth with pious awe i still have reverenced thy allpowerful justice still by her sacred dictates ruled my actions o let that justice now support my cause and arm my strong right hand with all her terrors when that is done be life or death my lot as thy almighty pleasure shall determine enter an officer to tullus officer my lord galesus asks admittance to you  tullus marcius retire an instant till i hear the business brings him hither  bid him enter exit officer and coriolanus enter galesus scene iii tullus galesus galesus tullus the roman senate has returned no other answer to our late demands but absolute denial and defiance  tullus it is what i expected  we shall teach them an humbler language soon  have thou assembled as i desired the volscian chiefs in council  galesus titus is gone to summon their attendance  tullus it is enough  come forth my noble guest and show galesus how the gods assist us  scene iv coriolanus tullus galesus galesus o my astonished soul what do i see what caius marcius caius marcius here beneath one tent with tullus  tullus ay and more with tullus now his friend and fellow soldier yes thou shall see him thundering at the head of volscian armies he who often has carried destruction through their ranks  your leave a moment while to our chiefs and fathers i announce their unexpected guest  scene v coriolanus galesus coriolanus thou good old man close let me strain thee to my faithful heart which now is doubly thine united more by the protection which thy country gives me than by our former friendship  galesus strange event this is thy work almighty providence whose power beyond the stretch of human thought revolves the orbs of empire bids them sink deep in the deadning night of thy displeasure or rise majestic over a wondering world the gods by thee  i see it coriolanus  mean to exalt us and depress the romans  coriolanus galesus yes the gods have sent me hither those righteous gods who when vindictive justice excites them to destroy a worthless people make their own crimes and follies strike the blow  galesus cherish these thoughts that teach us what we are and tame the pride of man there is a power unseen that rules thillimitable world that guides its motions from the brightest star to the least dust of this sintainted mold while man who madly deems himself the lord of all is naught but weakness and dependence this sacred truths by sure experience taught thou must have learnt when wandering all alone each bird each insect flitting through the sky was more sufficient for itself than thou  ah the full image of thy woes dissolves me the pangs that must have torn at parting from thee thy mother and thy wife i cannot think of that sad scene without some drops of pity  coriolanus who was it forced me to that bitter parting who in one cruel hasty moment chased me from wife from children friends and household gods me who so often had protected theirs who from the sacred city of my fathers drove me with natures commoners to dwell to lodge beneath their wide unshelterd roof and at their table feed o blast me gods with every woe debility of mind dishonor just contempt and palsyd weakness if i forgive the villains yes galesus yes i will offer to the powers of vengeance a great a glorious victim  a whole city  why tullus this delay  galesus may coriolanus be to the volscian nation and himself the dread the godlike instrument of justice but let not rage and vengeance mix their rancour let them not trouble with their fretful storm their angry gleams that azure where enthroned the calm divinity of justice sits and pities while she punishes mankind  coriolanus what said thou what against the powers of vengeance the gods gave honest anger just revenge to be the awful guardians of the rights and native dignity of human kind o were it not for them the saucy world would grow a noisome nest of little tyrants each carrion crow on eagle merit perched would peck his eyes out and the mungril cur at pleasure bait the lion  no galesus i would not rashly nor on light occasion receive the deep impression in my breast but when the base the brutal and unjust or worse than all the ungrateful stamp it there o i will then with luxury supreme enjoy the pleasure of offended gods a righteous just revenge  behold my soul enter an officer officer my lords thassembled chiefs desire your presence  galesus come noble marcius let my joyful hand conduct thee thither  doubt not thy reception will be proportioned to thy fame and merit  scene vi the back scene opens and discovers the deputies of the volscian states assembled in council they rise and salute coriolanus then resume their places galesus tullus coriolanus senators galesus assembled states and captains of the volsci behold the chief so much renowned in war our once so formidable foe but now our proffered friend and soldier  caius marcius   st senator we give him hearty welcome from our souls  coriolanus most noble chiefs and fathers of the volsci i need not say how by the peoples rage and the poor weakness of the timid nobles i am expelled from rome had i confined my wishes merely to a safe retreat some latin city might have given me that or any nameless corner what imports it where a tame patient exile rots in silence but volscian lords permit me to declare i would at once cut short my useless days rather than be that despicable wretch who neither can take vengeance on his foes nor serve his friends that is my temper chiefs i shall be glad to merit by my sword thasylum which i seek among the volsci rome is our common foe then let us join our common suffering passions and resentments yes though but one i bring so many wrongs so large a share of powerful enmity into the war as gives me the presumption to offer to the volscian states thalliance even of my single arm   tullus that single arm is in itself a numerous army marcius the volscians so esteem it  but proceed  coriolanus i will not mention volscian chiefs what talent the world allows me to possess in war but be it what it will you may employ it soldier or captain in whatever station you place me i will lose each drop of blood or with this hand i will fix the volscian standard on the proud towers of capitolian jove  tullus chiefs of the volscian league i give you joy of our new citizen the noble marcius the genius of the volscian state has sent him whetted by wrongs into a keener hatred than that we bear to rome it were contemning with impious selfsufficient arrogance this bounty of the gods not to accept with every mark of honor of his service i volscians i even attius tullus give first of you all my voice that caius marcius be now received to high command among us that instantly we do appoint him general of half our troops which here with your consent i to him yield  speak chiefs is this your pleasure   st senator it is  we give unanimous consent  tullus embracing him marcius i joy to call thee my companion and colleague in this war  coriolanus by all the gods thou art the generous victor of my soul yes tullus i am conquered by thy virtue  galesus though i have often on great occasions tullus beheld thee in the senate and the field covered with glory yet i must avow i never saw thee show such genuine greatness such true sublimity of soul as now to scorn the allpowerful charm of selfish passions chiefly the dazzling pride of emulation that noble weakness of heroic minds to sink thyself that thou may raise thy country to put the sword into thy rivals hand and twine thy promised laurels round his brow  o it is a flight beyond the highest point of martial glory and what few can reach go forth the chosen ministers of justice and may that awful power whose secret hand sways all our passions turns our partial views all to its own dread purposes attend you  coriolanus i burn to enter on the glorious task you now have marked me out how slow the time to the warm soul that in the very instant it forms would execute a great design it is my advice we march direct to rome we cannot be too quick let the first dawn see us in bright array before her walls perhaps when they behold their exile there backed by your force some conscious hearts among them may feel the alarm of guilt  tullus i much approve of this advice it is what i thought before ere strengthened marcius by thy mighty arm but now it is doubly right here volscian chiefs here let our council terminate  the troops have had repose sufficient strait to rome come let us urge our march  as yet the stars ride in their middle watch we shall with ease reach it by dawn   coriolanus yes we have time  too much six tedious hours till morn  but hence away my soul on fire anticipates the dawn  end of the second act act iii scene i coriolanus tullus volusius titus with a crowd of volscian officers acclamations behind the scenes coriolanus no more  i merit not this lavish praise true we have driven the roman legions back defeated and disgraced  but what is this nothing ye volsci nothing yet is done we but begin the wondrous leaf of story that marks the roman doom at length it dawns the destined hour that eases of their fears the nations round and sets hesperia free come on my brave companions of the war come let us finish at one mighty stroke this toil of laboring fate  we will or perish while noble tullus you protect the camp i with my troops all men of chosen valor and wellapprovd today will storm the city  titus beneath thy animating conduct marcius what can the volscian valor not perform thy very sight and voice subdues the romans when lifting up your helm you showed your face that like a comet glard destruction on them i saw their bravest veterans fly before thee their ancient spirit has with thee forsook them and ruin hangs over yon devoted walls enter an officer who addresses himself to coriolanus officer my lord a herald is arrived from rome to say a deputation from the senate attended by the ministers of heaven a venerable train of priests and flamens is on the way addressed to you  coriolanus to me what can this message mean  stand to your arms ye volscian troops and let these romans pass betwixt the lowering frown of double files what do they think me such a milky boy to pay my vengeance with a few soft words come fellow soldiers tullus come and see if i betray the honors you have done me goes out with a train of volscian officers scene ii tullus volusius who remain volusius after some silence are we not tullus failing in our duty not to attend our general  tullus how what said thou  volusius methought my lord his parting orders were we should attend the triumph now preparing over all his foes at once  romans and volsci come we shall give offense  tullus of this no more i pray thee spare thy bitter irony  volusius shall i then speak without disguise  tullus speak out with all the honest bluntness of a friend think thou i fear the truth  volusius then tullus know thou art no more the general of the volsci thou have by this thy generous weakness sunk thyself into a private man of antium yes thou have taken from thy laureled brow the wellearnd trophies of thy toils and perils thy springing hopes the fairest ever budded and heaped them on a man too proud before  tullus he bears it high  volusius death and perdition high with uncontrolled command  you see already he will not be encumbered with the fetters of our advice he speaks his sovereign will on every hand he issues out his orders as to his natural slaves  for you my lord he has i think confined you to your camp there in inglorious indolence to languish while he beneath your blasted eye shall reap the harvest of your honor  tullus no volusius whatever honor shall by him be gained reverts to me from whole superior bounty he drew the means of all his glorious deeds this mighty chief this conqueror of rome is but my creature   volusius wretched selfdelusion he and the volscians know he is thy master he acts as such in all things  now by mars could my abhorrent soul endure the thought of stooping to a roman chief i here would leave thee in thy solitary camp and go where glory calls  tullus indeed volusius i did expect more equal treatment from him but what of that  the generous pride of virtue disdains to weigh too nicely the returns her bounty meets with  like the liberal gods from her own gracious nature she bestows nor stoops to ask reward  yet must i own i thought he would not have so soon forgot what he so lately was and what i am  volusius gods knew ye not his character before did you not know his genius was to yours averse as are antipathies in nature high overweening tyranously proud and only fit to hold command over slaves hence as repugnant to that equal life which is the quickening soul of all republics the roman people cast him forth and we shall we receive the bane of their repose into our breast are we less free than they or shall we be more patient of a tyrant  tullus all this i knew but while his imperfections are thy glad theme thou have forgot his virtues  volusius i leave that subject to the smooth galesus and these his volscian flatterers  his virtues trust me there is no insolence that treads so high as that which rears itself on virtue  tullus well be it so  i meant that even his vices should on this great occasion serve the volsci  volusius confusion there it is there lurks the sting of our dishonor while this marcius leads the roman armies ours are driven before him behold he changes sides when with him changes the fortune of the war strait they grow volsci and we victorious romans  such no doubt such is his secret boast  ay this vile brand success itself will fix for ever on us and tullus thou it is thou must answer for it  tullus aside his words are daggers to my heart i feel their truth but am ashamed to own my folly  volusius o shame o infamy the thought consumes me it scalds my eyes with tears to see a roman borne on our shoulders to immortal fame just in the happy moment that decided the long dispute of ages that for which our generous ancestors had toiled and bled to see him then step in and steal our glory o that we first had perished all a people who cannot find in their own proper force their own protection are not worth the saving  tullus it must have way i will no more suppress it  know then my rough old friend no less than thee his conduct hurts me and upbraids my folly i wake as from a dream what demon moved me what doting generosity his woes was it his woes to see the brave reduced to trust his mortal foe perhaps a little that worked within my bosom  but volusius that was not all  i will to thee confess the weakness of my heart  yes it was pride the dazzling pride to see my rivalwarriour the great coriolanus bend his soul his haughty soul to sue for my protection protection said i were it that alone i had been base to have refused him that to have refused him aught a gallant foe owes to a gallant foe  but to exalt him to the same level nay above myself to yield him the command of half my troops the choicest acting half  that that was madness was weak was mean unworthy of a man   volusius i scorn to flatter thee  it was indeed  tullus curse on the slave galesus soothing he seized the fond moment of infatuation and clinchd the chains my generous folly forged how shall i from this labyrinth escape must it then be what cruel genius dooms me in war or peace to creep beneath his fortune  volusius that genius is thyself if thou can bear the very thought of stooping to this roman thou from that moment art his vassal tullus by that thou do acknowledge parent nature has formed him thy superior but if fixed upon the base of manly resolution thou say  i will be free i will command i and my country then  o never doubt it  we shall find means to crush this vain intruder even i myself  this hand  nay hear me tullus it is not yet come to that that last resource i do not say we should employ the dagger while other better means are in our power  tullus no my volusius fortune will not drive us or i am much deceived to that extreme we shall not want the strongest fairest plea to give a solemn sanction to his fate he will betray himself whatever his rage of passion talks a weakness for his country sticks in his soul and he is still a roman soon shall we see him tempted to the brink of this sure precipice  then down at once without remorse we hurl him to perdition  but hark the trumpet calls us to a scene i should detest if not from hope we thence may gather matter to mature our purpose  scene iii the back scene opens and discovers coriolanus sitting on his tribunal attended by his lictors and a crowd of volscian officers files of troops drawn up on either hand in the depth of the scene appear the deputies from the roman senate m minucius posthumus cominius sp lartius p pinnarius and q sulpitius all consular senators who had been his most zealous friends and behind them march the priests the sacrificers the augurs and the guardians of the sacred things dressed in their ceremonial habits these advance slowly betwixt the files of soldiers under arms as tullus enters coriolanus rising salutes him coriolanus here noble tullus sit and judge my conduct nor spare to check me if i act amiss  tullus marcius the volscian fate is in thy hands coriolanus is seated again and tullus places himself upon a tribunal on his left hand mean time the roman deputies advance up to coriolanus and salute him which he returns coriolanus what romans from the generals of the volsci is your demand  minucius o coriolanus rome nurse of thy tender years thy parentcity her senators her people priests and augurs her every order and degree by us thy everzealous stillunshaken friends sue in the most pathetic terms for peace and if in this constrained we from our maxim never to ask but give it must depart it is some consolation in the state to which thou have by thy superior valor reduced us that we ask it from a roman  coriolanus i was a roman once and thought the name was hot dishonored by me but it pleased your lords the mob of rome to take it from me nor will i now receive it back again  milucius the name thou may reject but can not throw the duties from thee which that name imports indissoluble duties bound upon thee by the strong hand of nature and confirmed by the dread sanction of allruling jove then hear thy countrys supplicating voice by all those duties i conjure thee hear us  coriolanus well  i will hear thee speak declare thy message  milucius give peace give healing peace to two brave nations fatigued with war arid sick of cruel deeds to carry on destructions easy trade afflict mankind and scourge the world with war is what each wicked each ambitious man who lets his furious passions loose may do but in the flattering torrent of success to check his rage and drop the avenging sword when a repenting people ask it of him that is the genuine bounty of a god then urge no further this your just resentment which injured as you are you needs must feel but never ought to carry into action against your sacred country whence you drew your life your virtues every mortal good that very valor you employ against her stop coriolalus ere beyond retreat you plunge yourself in crimes to the fierce joy of vengeance pushed to barbarous excess repentance will succeed and sickning horror consider too the slippery state of fortune the gods take pleasure often when haughty mortals on their own pride erect a mighty fabric by slightest means to lay their towering schemes low in the dust and teach them they are nothing return thou virtuous roman to the bosom of thy imploring country lo her arms she fondly spreads to take thee back again and by redoubled love efface her harshness return and crown thee with the noblest wreathe which glory can bestow  the palm of mercy  coriolanus marcus minucius and ye other romans respected senators and holy flamens attend and take to your demand this answer why court you me the servant of the volsci it is to them that you must bend for peace which on these only terms they will accord you restore the conquered lands your former wars have ravished from them from their towns an cities won by your arms withdraw your colonies and to the full immunities of rome frankly admit them as you have the latins then romans you have peace and not till then if these are terms which suit not your ambition they suit the state to which the volscian arms have now reduced you  we have learned from rome to use our fortune and command the vanquished  tullus aside death to my hopes i am now his slave for ever coriolanus addressing himself to the volsci this my illustrious patrons and protectors volsci to you i owed permit me now to do myself and injured honor justice turning again to the romans as to the liberty you idly vaunt to give me of returning to your city it is what i hold unworthy of acceptance can i return into the ungrateful bosom of a distracted state where to the rage of a vile senseless populace the laws are by your shameful weakness given a prey who are the men that hold the sway among you and whom have you expelled as even unworthy to live within the cincture of your walls  o the wild thought breaks in and troubles reason  with what ye romans can the sowerest censor the most envenomed malice justly charge me did i ever break your laws nay did i ever do aught that could disturb the sacred order the peace and social harmony of life or taint your ancient sanctity of manners what was my crime i could not bear to see your dignity debased to see the rabble tread on the reverend gray authority of senatorial wisdom yes for you in your defense i did enrage this monster and yet you basely left me to its fury then talk no more of services and friendship a friend who can and does not shield betrays me or if the power was wanting then your senate is sunk into servility and bondage nor should a freeman deign to sit among you  minucius the wisest are sometimes compelled to yield to popular storms yet i defend not marcius our timid conduct we have felt our error and now invite thee back to aid the senate with thy heroic spirit to restrain the giddy rage of faction and to hold the reins of government more firm hereafter as to the appeal which thou have nobly made in vindication of thy spotless fame with pleasure we confirm it and bear witness to all thy public and thy private virtues but let us also beg thee not to stain the brightness of that glory by a crime which unrepented would disgrace them all a dire rebellious war against thy country  coriolanus absurd what can you mean to call a people who with the last indignity have used me to call my foes my country no minucius it is the generous nation of the volsci these brave these virtuous men you see around me who when i wandered a poor helpless exile took pity of my injuries and woes forgot the former mischiefs of my sword heaped on me kindness honors dignities feared not to trust me with this high command and placed me here the guardian of their cause  be witness jove  it is alone their nation i henceforth will acknowledge for my country let this suffice  you have my answer romans  cominius this answer coriolanus is the dictate more of thy pride than magnanimity it is thy revenge that gives it not thy virtue art thou above the gods who joy to shower their doubled goodness on repenting mortals but think not i intend by this to urge our proffered peace so harshly treated further that were a weakness ill becoming romans yet i must tell thee it would better fuit a fierce despotic chief of barbarous slaves than the calm dignity of one who sits in the grave senate of a free republic to talk so high and as it were to thrust plebeians from the native rights of man   coriolanus ha do thou come the peoples advocate to me cominius come thou to insult me  cominius nay hear me marcius  these gray hairs empower me to set thee right before this great assembly and there was once a time thou would have heard thy general with more deference and patience  i tell thee then whoever amidst the sons of reason valor liberty and virtue displays distinguished merit is a noble of natures own creating such have risen sprung from the dust or where had been our honors and such in radiant bands will rise again in yon immortal city that when most deprest by fate and near apparent ruin returns as with an energy divine on her astonished foes and shakes them from her  your pardon volsci  but this coriolanus is what i had to say  coriolanus and i have heard it  rising from his tribunal and the priests advancing to address him he prevents them for you ye awful ministers of heaven let me not hear your holy lips profaned by urging what my duty must refuse i bow in adoration to the gods i venerate their servants but there is there is a power their chief their darling care the guardian of mankind which to betray were violating all  and that is justice so far my public character demands so far my honor  now what should forbid the man and friend to be indulged a little permit me to embrace thee good minucius thee lartius you pinnarius and sulpicius but chiefly thee cominius who first raised me to deeds of arms who from thy consolar brow took thy own crown and with it circled mine tho naught can shake my purpose yet i wish that rome had sent me others on this errand i thank you for your friendship the protection which you have given to those whom once i called by tender names i would not now remember how shall i  say  return your generous goodness o there is nothing you as friends can ask my grateful heart will not with pleasure grant you  cominius we thank thee coriolanus  but a roman disdains that favor you refuse his country  coriolanus to the volscian officers see that they be with due regard and safety conducted back to the roman senators i will suspend the assault till to these terms of which we will not bate the smallest part your senate may have time to send their latest answer then we cut all further treaty off romans farewell  the end of the third act act iv scene i tulus alone what is the mind of man a restless scene of vanity and weakness shifting still as shift the lights of our uncertain knowledge or as the various gale of passion breathes none ever thought himself more deeply founded on what is right nor felt a nobler ardor than i when i invested caius marcius with this illjudgd command now it appears distraction folly monstrous folly meanness and down i plunge betrayed even by my virtue from gulf to gulf from shame to deeper shame scene ii tullus galesus galesus i listened tullus to the important scene that lately passed before us with most strict unprejudiced attention and have since revolved it in my mind both as a man allyd to all mankind and as a volscian indeed our terms are high and by the manner in which they were prescribed by coriolanus are what we cannot hope will ever be granted they should be softened let us yield a little conscious ourselves to a great nations pride the pride of human nature could the romans stoop to such peace commanded by the sword they then were slaves unworthy our alliance  tullus gods do i hear in thee one of the chiefs entrusted with the honor of the volsci an advocate for rome  galesus i glory tullus to own myself an advocate for peace peace is the happy natural state of man war his corruption his disgrace   tullus his safeguard his pride his glory  what but war just war gave greece her heroes those who drew the sword as we do now against the sons of rapine to quell proud tyrants and to free mankind  galesus yes tullus when to just defense the warrior confines his force he is a worshipped name dear to mankind the first and best of mortals yet still if this can by soft means be done and fair accommodation that is better why should we purchase with the blood of thousands what may be gained by mutual just concession why give up peace the best of human blessings for the vain cruel pride of useless conquest  tullus these soothing dreams of philosophic quiet are only fit for unfrequented shades the sage should quit the busy bustling world ill suited to his gentle meditations and in some desert find that peace he loves  galesus mistaken man philosophy consists not in airy schemes or idle speculations the rule and conduct of all social life is her great province not in lonely cells obscure she lurks but holds her heavenly light to senates and to kings to guide their councils and teach them to reform and bless mankind all policy but here is is false and rotten all valor not conducted by her precepts is a destroying fury sent from hell to plague unhappy man and ruin nations  tullus to stop the waste of that destroying fury is the great cause and purpose of this war art thou a friend to peace  subdue the romans who who but they have turned this ancient land where from saturnian times harmonious concord still loved to dwell into a scene of blood of endless discord and perpetual rapine the sword the vengeful sword must drain away this boiling blood that thus disturbs the nations talk not of terms it is a vain attempt to bind the ambitious and unjust by treaties these they elude a thousand specious ways or if they cannot find a fair pretext they blush not in the face of heaven to break them  galesus why then affronted heaven will combat for us set justice on our side and then my voice shall be as loud for war as thine my sword shall strike as deep at least my blood shall flow as freely tullus in my countrys cause but as i then would die to serve the volscians so now i dare to serve them by opposing even with my single voice the impetuous torrent that hurries us away beyond the bounds of temperate wisdom and presume to tell thee it is thy passion not thy prudence dictates this haughty language  tullus yes it is my passion a passion for the glory of my country that scorns your narrow views of timid prudence our injured honor drew our swords and never shall they be sheathed while i command the volscians till rome submits to antium   galesus rome will perish ere she submit and she has still her walls the strength of her allies her native valor which often has saved her in the worst extremes and stronger yet than all despair to aid her  tullus all these will naught avail her if our fears come not to her assistance  but galesus why urge you this to me go talk to marcius the war has given him all his pride could hope for to see romes senate humbled at his feet he now may wish to reign in peace at antium and thou perhaps art come an envoy from him to learn if i shall prove a quiet subject  galesus through this unguarded opening of thy soul i see what stings thee  ah beware of envy if that pale fury seize thee thou art lost tullus it is easier far from the clear breast to keep out treacherous vice than to expel it farewell remember i have done my duty goes out tullus alone this man discerns my heart  well what of that am i afraid its movement should be seen i whose clear thoughts have never shunned the light must i now seek to hide them o misfortune to have reduced myself to such a state so much beneath the greatness of my soul that like a coward i must learn to practice the wretched arts of vile dissimulation by heaven i will not do it  i will not stoop to veil my discontent a moment longer but see my rival comes the happy marcius his haughty mien his very looks affront me  scene iii coriolanus tullus coriolanus tullus i have received intelligence that a strong body of the latin troops is in full march to raise the siege of rome another day will bring them to its aid but go thou forth and lead the valiant bands by thee commanded to repel these succors go and cut off from rome its last resource  tullus i lead my troops from the great scene of action from falling rome which ere tomorrows sun shall set may be our prey sure you forget my rank and station  i disdain the service give it to some you may command for me i own no master but the volscian states rome is my object i from antium brought the noblest army ever shook her walls and shall i now on that decisive day doomed by the gods to lay her pride in ashes shall i be absent from the glorious work it is the highest outrage even to think it  just gods do thou presume to give thy orders to me to me thy equal in command nay thy superior was it not my hand my lavish hand bestowed thy power upon thee and know proud roman that the man who gave it can at his will resume it  coriolanus i proposed this expedition to thee as thy friend not as thy general tullus we are both commanders here and for my share of power whenever the council of the volscian states who clothed me with it shall again demand it i at their feet will lay it down persuaded the cankered tongue of envys self must own that by my service i have well deserved it  tullus was it to them or me you hither came to crave protection was not then your fortune your liberty your life at my disposal i raised you from the dust a wretched exile an outcast helpless friendless driven to beg the lowest refuge which despair can seek shelter amidst thy foes my pitying goodness protected trusted and believed you grateful o illplacd confidence what for all this is thy return pride selfsufficiency councils apart from mine despotic orders the glory of the war all pilferd from me and to complete the whole a latin army now conjured up to draw me from the siege till by cajoling our tame chiefs and dazzling the senseless eyes of the low mob of soldiers thou shall be solely seated in the power which thank my folly now is shared betwixt us  coriolanus immortal gods hear i these words from tullus i will be calm  i will  thou do accuse me of the worst vice that can debase mankind of black ingratitude on what foundations what have i done to merit such a charge is it my fault if in the volscian army my name is as revered and great as thine can i forbid authority and fame to follow merit and success  you knew the man whom you employed and should have known he would not be a cipher in employment  tullus think thou my heart can better brook than thine to be that cipher that dishonored tool subservient to the ambition of another gods i had rather live a drudging peasant unknown to glory in some alpine village than at the head of these victorious legions bear the high name of chief without the power no marcius no i will command indeed and thou shall learn with all the volscian army to treat their general with respect  coriolanus respect o tullus tullus by the powers divine i bore thee once respect as high as man can show to man from thee my foe my rival i nor disdained nor feared to ask protection you gave me all i asked you gave me more with noble warmth of heart which to esteem added the ties to gratitude and friendship whatever since in council or in arms has been by me achieved was done for thee my glory all was thine the plams i gained only composed a garland for his brow who raised this banished man to tread on rome  tullus to tread on him who raised him  that i know is thy ambitious purpose but be certain however rome may bend beneath thy fortune thou shall not find an easy conquest here  coriolanus may jove with lightning strike me to the center if from the day i saw thy face at antium my heart has ever formed one secret thought to hurt thy honor or depress thy greatness i was thy friend thy soldier and thy servant but now i will as openly avow thy jealousy has with envenomed breath made such a sudden ravage in our friendship i know not what to think   tullus think me thy foe there is no lasting friendship with the proud  coriolanus nor with the jealous  but of this enough come let us turn our fire a nobler way we have a worthier quarrel to pursue  it were unjust dishonorable base our pride should hurt the volscian cause  tullus no marcius i mean to guard it better for the future the volscian cause is safest with a volscian i therefore claim insist upon my right that you shall yield me my command in turn the first attack was yours it is scanty justice the second should be mine  coriolanus tullus it is yours o it imports not which of us command give me the lowest rank among your troops all italy will know the voice of fame will tell all future times that i was present that coriolanus in the volscian army assisted when imperial rome was sacked that city which while he maintained her cause invincible herself made antium tremble  tullus what arrogant presumption  scene iv to them volusius entering hastily tullus ha volusius thy looks declare some message of importance  volusius tullus they do  i was to find thee marcius to thee a second deputation comes thy mother and thy wife with a long train of all the noblest ladies rome can boast in mourning habits clad approach our camp preceded by a herald to demand another audience of thee  coriolanus how volusius said you the roman ladies low indeed must be the state of rome when thus her matrons she sends amidst the tumults of a camp to beg protection for the men who lie trembling behind their ramparts  come once more and see me put an end to prayers and treaty  scene v tullus volusius volusius tullus it is well this answers to my wishes  tullus how what is well that humbled rome once more shall deck him with the trophies of our arms  volusius and hopst thou nothing from this blessed event they who have often blasted mighty heroes who often have stolen into the firmest hearts and melted them to folly they my friend will do what wisdom never could effect  tullus think thou the prayers and tears of wailing women can shake the man who with such cold disdain stood firm against those venerable consuls and spurned the genius of his kneeling country  volusius it was his pride alone that made him ours that passion kept him firm the flattering charm of humbling those who in their persons bore the whole collected majesty of rome these women are no proper objects for it he cannot triumph over his wife and mother on this my hopes are founded that these women may by their gentler influence subdue him  tullus whatever the event he shall no longer here as wave his passions dictate peace or war whether his stubborn soul maintains its firmness or yields to female prayers the volscian honor will be alike betrayed if rome prevails he stops our conquering arms from her destruction if he rejects her suit he reigns our tyrant but by the immortal gods his shortlived empire shall never see you radiant sun descend  volusius blessed be those gods that have at last inspired thee with resolution equal to thy cause the cause of liberty   tullus be sure volusius if that should happen which thy hopes portend should he by nature tamed disarmed by love respite the roman doom  he seals his own by heaven he dies  volusius let me embrace thee tullus now breaking from the cloud which like the sun thy own too bounteous beams had drawn around thee  tullus you was deceived my friend when i with tameness with tameness which astonished thy brave spirit seemed to submit to that unequal sway he arrogated over me know my heart never swelled so high as in that cruel moment my indignation like the imprisoned fire pent in the troubled breast of glowing aetna burnt deep and silent but collected now it shall beneath its fury bury marcius it is fixed our tyrant dies  volusius tullus my sword here claims to be employed  nor mine alone  there are some worthy volsci still remaining who think with us and pine beneath the laurels a roman chief bestows  tullus go find them strait and bring them to the space before his tent it is there he will receive this deputation then if he sinks beneath these womens prayers  or if he does not  but volusius wait i give thee strictest charge to wait my signal perhaps i may find means to free the volsci without his blood if not  we will be free  the end of the fourth act act v scene i trumpets sounding the scene discovers the camp a crowd of volscian officers with files of soldiers drawn up as before enter coriolanus tullus galesus volusius the roman ladies advance slowly from the depth of the stage with veturia the mother of coriolanus and volumnia his wife at their head all clad in habits of mourning coriolanus stands at the head of the volsci surrounded by his lictors but when he perceives his mother and wife after some struggle he advances and goes hastily to embrace them coriolanus advancing lower your fasces lictors  oh veturia thou best of parents  veturia coriolanus stop whom am i to embrace a son or foe say in what light am i regarded here thy mother or thy captive  coriolanus justly madam you check my fondness that by nature hurried forgot i was the general of the volsci and you a deputy from hostile rome  he goes back to his former station i hear you with respect speak your commission veturia think not i come a deputy from rome rome once rejected scorns a second suit you have already heard whatever the tongue of eloquence can plead whatever the wisdom of sacred age the dignity of senates and virtue can enforce behold me here sent by the shades of your immortal fathers sent by the genius of the marcian line commissioned by my own maternal heart to try the soft yet stronger powers of nature thus authorized i ask nay claim a peace on equal fair and honorable terms to thee to rome and to the volscian people grant it my son thy mother begs it of thee thy wife the best the kindest of her sex and these illustrious matrons who have soothed the gloomy hours thou have been absent from us we by whatever is great and good in nature by every duty by the gods conjure thee to grant us peace and turn on other foes thy arms where thou may purchase virtuous glory  coiriolanus i should veturia break those holy bonds that hold the wide republic of mankind society together i should grow a wretch unworthy to be called thy son i should with my volumnias fair esteem forfeit her love these matrons would despise me  could i betray the volscian cause thus trusted thus recommended to me  no my mother you cannot sure you cannot ask it of me  veturia and does my son so little know me me who took such care to form his tender years left to my conduct by his dying father have i so ill deserved that trust alas am i so low in thy esteem that thou should ever imagine i could urge a part which in the least might stain the marcian honor no let me perish rather perish all life has no charms compared to spotless glory i only ask thou would forbid thy troops to waste our lands and to assault yon city till time be given for mild and righteous measures grant us but one years truce mean while thou may with honor and advantage to both nations betwixt us mediate a perpetual peace  coriolanus alas my mother that were granting all  veturia can thou refuse me such a just petition the first request thy mother ever made thee can thou to her entreaties prayers and tears prefer a savage obstinate revenge have love and nature lost all power within thee  coriolanus no  in my heart they reign as strong as ever come i conjure you quit ungrateful rome come and complete my happiness at antium you and my dear volumnia  there veturia there shall you see with what respect the volsci will treat the wife and mother of their general  veturia treat me thyself with more respect my son nor dare to shock my ears with such proposals shall i desert my country i who come to plead her cause ah no  a grave in rome would better please me than a throne at antium how have thou thus forsaken all my precepts how have thou thus forgot thy love to rome o coriolanus when with hostile arms with fire and sword you entered on our borders did not the fostering air that breathes around us allay thy guilty fury and instill a certain native sweetness through thy soul did not your heart thus murmur to itself these walls contain whatever can command respect from virtue or is dear to nature the monuments of piety and valor the sculptured forms the trophies of my fathers my household gods my mother wife and children  coriolanus ah you seduce me with too tender views  these walls contain the most corrupt of men a base seditious herd who trample order distinction justice laws beneath their feet insolent foes to worth the foes of virtue  veturia thou have not thence a right to lift thy hand against the whole community which forms thy eversacred country  that consists not of coeval citizens alone it knows no bounds it has a retrospect to ages past it looks on those to come and grasps of all the general worth and virtue suppose my son that i to thee had been a harsh obdurate parent even unjust how would the monstrous thought with horror strike thee of plunging from revenge thy raging steel into her breast who nursed thy infant years   coriolanus rome is no more that rome which nursed my youth that rome conducted by patrician virtue she is no more my sword shall now chastise these sons of pride and dirt her upstart tyrants who have debased the noblest state on earth into a sordid democratic faction why will my mother join her cause to theirs  veturia forbid it jove that i should ever distinguish my interest from the general cause of rome or live to see a foreign hostile arm reform thabuses of our land of freedom pausing but it is in vain i find to reason more is there no way to reach thy filial heart once famed as much for piety as courage often have thou justly triumphed coriolanus now yield one triumph to thy widowed mother and send me back amidst the loud acclaims the grateful transports of delivered rome the happiest far the most renowned of women  coriolanus why why veturia will thou plead in vain tullus aside to volusius see see volusius how the strong emotions of powerful nature shake his inmost soul see how they tear him  if he long resists them he is a god or something worse than man  veturia o marcius marcius can thou treat me thus can thou complain of romes ingratitude yet be to me so cruelly ungrateful to me who anxious reared thy youth to glory whose only joy these many years has been to boast that coriolanus was my son and do thou then renounce me for thy mother spurn me before these chiefs before those soldiers that weep thy stubborn cruelty art thou the hardest man to me in this assembly look at me speak pausing during which he appears in great agitation still do thou turn away inexorable silent  then behold me behold thy mother at whose feet thou often have kneeled with fondness kneeling now at thine wetting thy stern tribunal with her tears  coriolanus raises her veturia rise i cannot see thee thus it is a sight uncomely to behold my mother at my feet and that to urge a suit relentless honor must refuse  volumnia advancing since coriolanus thou do still retain in spite of all thy mother now has pleaded thy dreadful purpose ah how much in vain were it for me to join my supplications the voice of thy volumnia once so pleasing how shall it hope to touch the husbands heart when proof against the tears of such a parent i dare not urge what to thy mother thou so firmly have denied  but i must weep  must weep if not thy harsh severity at least thy situation o permit me taking his hand to shed my gushing tears upon thy hand to press it with the cordial lips of love and take my last farewell  coriolanus yet yet my soul be firm and persevere   volumnia ah coriolanus is then this hand this hand to me devoted the pledge of nuptial love that has so long protected blessed and sheltered us with kindness now lifted up against us yet i love it and with submissive veneration bow beneath the affliction which it heaps upon us but o what nobler transports would it give thee what joy beyond expression could thou once surmount the furious storm of fierce revenge and yield thee to the charms of love and mercy oh make the glorious trial  coriolanus mother wife are all the powers of nature leagued against me i cannot  will not  leave me my volumnia  volumnia well i obey  how bitter thus to part upon such terms to part perhaps for ever  but tell me ere i hence unroot my feet when to my lonely home i shall return what from their father to our little slaves unconscious of the shame to which you doom them what shall i say pausing he highly agitated nay  tell me coriolanus  coriolanus tell thee what shall i tell thee see these tears these tears will tell thee what exceeds the power of words to speak whatever the son the husband and father in one complicated pang can feel  but leave me  even in pity leave me cease cease to torture me my dear volumnia you only tear my heart but cannot shake it for by the immortal gods the dread avengers of broken faith   volumnia kneeling oh swear not coriolanus oh vow not our destruction  veturia daughter rise let us no more before the volsian people expose ourselves a spectacle of shame it is in vain we try to melt a breast that to the best affections nature gives us prefers the worst  hear me proud man i have a heart as stout as thine i came not hither to be sent back rejected baffled shamed hateful to rome because i am thy mother a roman matron knows in such extremes what part to take  and thus i came provided drawing from under her robe a dagger go barbarous son go double parricide rush over my corse to thy beloved revenge tread on the bleeding breast of her to whom thou owst thy life  lo thy first victim  coriolanus seizing her hand ha what do thou mean  veturia to die while rome is free to seize the moment ere thou art her tyrant  coriolanus o use thy power more justly set not thus my treacherous heart in arms against my reason here here thy dagger will be well employed strike here and reconcile my fighting duties  veturia off  set me free  think thou that grasp which binds my feeble hand can fetter too my will no my proud son thou can not make me live if rome must fall  no power on earth can do it  coriolanus pity me generous volsci  you are men  must it then be  confusion  do i yield what is it is it weakness is it virtue  well   veturia what speak  coriolanus o no  my stifled words refuse a passage to the throes that wring my heart  veturia nay if thou yieldest yield like coriolanus and what thou do do nobly  coriolanus quitting her hand there  it is done  thine is the triumph nature to veturia in a low tone of voice ah veturia rome by thy aid is saved  but thy son lost  veturia he never can be lost who saves his country  coriolanus turning to the roman ladies ye matrons guardians of the roman safety you to the senate may report this answer we grant the truce you ask but on these terms that rome meantime shall to a peace agree fair equal just and such as may secure the safety rights and honor of the volsci to the troops volsci we raise the siege go and prepare by the first dawn for your return to antium as the troops retire and coriolanus turns to the roman ladies tullus to volusius aside it is as we wished volusius  to your station but mark me well  till thou shall hear my call i charge thee not to stir one offer more my honor bids me make to this proud man before we strike the blow  if he rejects it his blood be on his head  volusius well i obey you he goes out coriolanus be it thy care galesus that a safeguard attend these noble matrons back to rome  scene ii coriolanus tullus coriolanus i plainly tullus by your looks discern you disapprove my conduct  tullus caius marcius i mean not to assail thee with the clamor of loud reproaches and the war of words

promise thou have been protected have had thy amplest most ambitious wish thy wounded pride is healed thy dear revenge completely sated and to crown thy fortune at the same time thy peace with rome restored thou art no more a volscian but a roman return return thy duty calls upon thee still to protect the city thou have saved it still may be in danger from our arms  coriolanus insolent man is this thy fair proposal  tullus be patient  hear by hospitable jove i mean thee well  yes one last bounty more i frankly will bestow i have already from rome protected thee now from the volsci from their just vengeance i will still protect thee retire i will take care thou may with safety  coriolanus with safety  heavens  and think thou  coriolanus will stoop to thee for safety no my safeguard is in myself a bosom void of blame and the great gods protectors of the just  o it is an act of cowardice and baseness to seize the very time my hands are fettered by the strong chain of former obligations the safe sure moment to insult me  gods were i now free as on that day i was when at corioli i tamed thy pride this had not been  tullus thou speak the truth it had not o for that time again propitious gods if you will bless me grant it  know for that for that dear purpose i have now proposed thou should return i pray thee marcius do it and we shall meet again on nobler terms  coriolanus when to the volsci i have cleared my faith doubt not i shall find means to meet thee nobly we then our generous quarrel may decide in the bright front of some embatteld field and not in private brawls like fierce barbarians  tullus thou can not hope acquittal from the volsci   coriolanus i do  nay more expect their approbation their thanks i will obtain them such a peace as thou durst never ask a perfect union of their whole nation with imperial rome in all her privileges all her rights by the just gods i will what would thou more  tullus what would i more proud roman this i would fire the cursed forest where these roman wolves haunt and infest their nobler neighbors round them extirpate from the bosom of this land a false perfidious people who beneath the mask of freedom are a combination against the liberty of humankind the genuine seed of outlaws and of robbers  coriolanus the seed of gods  it is not for thee vain boaster it is not for such as thou so often spared by her victorious sword to talk of rome but with respect and awful veneration whatever her blots whatever her giddy factions there is more virtue in one single year of roman story than your volscian annals can boast through all your creeping dark duration  tullus i thank thy rage this full displays the traitor  coriolanus ha traitor  tullus first to thy own country traitor and traitor now to mine

sober dictates of wellweighd resolution thou and i are in that state for which resistless nature has formed us foes again  begone  return  to head the roman troops i grant thee quittance full and complete of all those obligations thou have so often insultingly complained fettered thy hands they now are free i court the worst thy sword can do whilst thou from me have nothing to expect but sore destruction quit then this hostile camp once more i tell thee thou art not here one single hour in safety  coriolanus think thou to fright me hence  tullus thou will not then thou will not take the safety which i offer  coriolanus till i have cleared my honor in your council and proved before them all to thy confusion the falsehood of thy charge as soon in battle i would before thee fly and howl
