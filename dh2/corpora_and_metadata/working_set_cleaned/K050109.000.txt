a letter to r  b  esquire author of the new comedy called the wishes now in rehearsal at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for m cooper in paternoster row       price six pence  a letter to r  b  esquire sir it was not many days ago that i wrote you a letter upon the subject of your comedy now upon the point of being acted at drury lane theater as i had reasons for not disclosing myself i did not subscribe my name to it my counsel of course was despised however i am not one of those anonymous letterwriters who are to be discouraged by one rebuff for as my motive contrary to the usage of my fraternity was a good one and had your benefit in view i shall for your sake persist in it and address you now in a more earnest and more public manner than in my last  your piece was last winter put into my hands by a friend without any account whence he came by it i read it through more than once and it was upon my own knowledge of it that i gave you my advice not to produce it at our summer theater at the same time wishing you to reserve it till the winter when it might be secure of a better representation this i said not in the least doubting but that the manager of either theater would accept it gladly and without hesitation since then to my inconceivable surprise i have been informed that it was offered and refused at both theaters this accounts for the manner in which i got a sight of it for it is plain while it ought to have been in the hands of its respectable judges mr    and mr    it migrated into those of other people who have no manner of connection with them  i confess to you sir i was never more surprised in my life than when i heard this account my surprise however carried an exception to it in the person of mr    for i might have considered that as he has long been in possession of the first name for those agile performances in which our mute harlequin excells it was not at all likely he should countenance any invasion upon his merit the dangerous tendency of this innovation might justly alarm him lest all that illustrious collection of birds and beasts witches and wiredancers of which he enjoys the inestimable possession might be rendered useless and contemptible and in the end the performances of the head contrary to all custom and usage be made of more dignity than the operations of the heels this inversion of things i might have thought that experienced practitioner could never approve of and indeed how you or your friends could think of tendering a piece to him of such a nature i cannot well conceive  but that any one who professes himself a man of taste a lover of the belles lettres a sovereign critic in dramatic performances and one who is himself a dabbler in the business should so far forget himself as to reject a work of so much wit and ingenuity so much novelty and such inimitable raillery staggered me beyond measure and i was led almost to think i had mistaken its merit and formed too favorable an opinion of it while i was thus wavering and almost upon the point of receding from my opinion i received such a confirmation of my judgment by the reception it had met with from some of the most celebrated wits of the age as put an end to my doubts at once and left me at a loss what motive to ascribe its rejection to that it should spring from want of taste and discernment i was loath to believe that jealousy or want of candor was the cause i was still inclined to think especially when i recollected what halfformed misshapen productions that gentleman had of late too frequently gave birth to with a compliance which although it carried the appearance of good nature with it certainly did no credit to his judgment this easiness of temper to authors of less merit led me to believe that there could be no obstacle to your success and though i knew him absolute in his decisions i flattered myself he would be just the event convinced me of my mistake and the conclusions i draw from it are such as i never admit without regret  the persons sir whom you have had the good fortune to please are such i understand whose names do honor not only to every one under their protection but to the country to which they belong  nay if i am not misinformed i may add a name to the list a truly royal one whose approbation i dare believe you esteem above any earthly favor or enjoyment whatsoever this approbation i am told was accompanied with a liberality peculiar to himself which though it could scarce enhance your happiness i make no doubt increased his own thus distinguished by the applause as well as bounty of your sovereign it would be ridiculous to suppose you any longer regret the rejection you met with in your application to the theater if you received any thing like mortification on that occasion it is now reflected back upon him who occasioned it and who had not taste to discern that merit which your sovereign was pleased to reward the happy era is now commenced which if any one alive has cause to regret it can be he only whose decrees are no longer absolute and whose decisions are now made liable to be reversed his monopoly is destroyed men of wit and genius have now a new channel open to their productions and he who was before the supreme censor of their works will now be reduced to his proper profession and become the subservient instrument in the representation of them  the complaint that there are no comedies wrote in this age does not in my opinion reflect upon our writers but is the consequence of our manners there are no longer any glaring characters amongst us modern refinements have polished away all those humourous peculiarities which supplied topics of ridicule to the pens of shakespeare johnson and fletcher even cibbers beau no longer exists our cotemporaries think they have conjured up a fresh spirit of humor in the passion of jealousy it may be so but it is no mark of the times no body is jealous nowadays thanks to the wives of this age they prevent all that painful and excruciating uncertainty which a more guarded behavior might occasion the comic writer is now left without materials even the court his neverfailing resource for invective is now so formed as to afford no employment for his pen unless he steps out of his office and commences panegyrist in this dearth of characters i think great praise is due to you sir who have attempted to introduce amongst us these whimsical recruits and to transplant the wit of italy into your native climate i will not venture to say your attempt will succeed and for these reasons first because improvement is as hard to introduce in this country as prejudice is found difficult to remove secondly our english harlequin being in general as great a favorite with the mob as our english punchinello is i conclude that every man who can jump through a hoop himself or who delights to see another do it will set his face against your interloper thirdly there being no feats of agility in your piece by which your performers are put in manifest danger of their lives i cannot see how it is possible the galleries can set it out fourthly and lastly from its being admired by all people who have taste and the opposition it has received from those who have none i conclude it will be damned by a very great majority  if in reply to these suggestions of mine you remind me of the very powerful protection under which you are sheltered i must acquaint you that for that very reason every freeborn englishman who loves to disappoint and insult his betters will be your declared enemy and opposer if you object to this that your end is answered that happy in the approbation you have already obtained you are above the censure of the vulgar and indifferent to their praise i think you judge right and am  sir yours etc  the end
