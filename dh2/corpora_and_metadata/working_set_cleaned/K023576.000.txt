cursory criticisms on the edition of shakspeare published by edmond malone  a faulcon towering in her pride of place was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killed macbeth london printed for hookham and carpenter new and old bondstreet  m dcc xcii  to the monthly and critical reviewers gentlemen i prefix this address in order to induce you before you pass sentence on the following pages to read them through strike but hear to enable you to do this i have desired my publishers to send each of you a copy for though you may have jack the giantkillers coat it has never been suspected that you possess fortunatuss purse and the title of a book read in a newspaper or through a shopwindow may not be always a sufficient ground for unqualifyed condemnation and virulent abuse  on second thoughts however i believe i might as well have saved them the trouble since you will most probably allow mr malone the grateful privilege of reviewing it himself the virtue and honor of this literary hero frequently condescending to bring down an unsuspicious enemy from the masked battery of a review and yet i see one of your gangs these societies of gentlemen as they modestly entitle themselves are with equal justice and ability characterised by dr brown as  two notorious gangs of monthly and critical bookthieves hackneyd in the ways of wickedness who in the rage of hunger and malice first plunder and then abuse maim or murder every honest author who is possessed of ought worth their carrying off yet skulking among other vermin in cellars and garrets keep their persons tolerably out of sight and thus escape the hands of literary justice estimate of the manners and principles of the times vol ii p    has the effrontery to boast that it  nothing extenuates nor sets down aught in malice that you nothing extenuate unless it be in favor of yourselves or your employers i can easily believe but the next line certainly requires if not a different reading an opposite construction it suits your purpose no doubt to delude the unwary by false colors as the devil when he commences innkeeper hangs out an angel for his sign the real meaning however is that you  set down all in malice shakspears morality in the hands of a reviewer is to be read backward like a witchs prayer  accustomed as you are to every species of misrepresentation you must by no means do me the injustice to say that i treat you with contempt for though a literary prostitute be in reality a most despicable character i cannot but consider you in if not a far superior at least a very different light  as two formidable in short and mischievous gangs of nocturnal banditti or invisible footpads equally cowardly and malignant who attack when there can be no defense and assassinate or destroy where you cannot plunder and yet surprising as it is while offenders of comparative insignificance are almost every day exposed on pillories or perishing in dungeons you have the luck to escape the resentment of the injured and the vengeance of the law upon my word gentlemen i admire your good fortune though i cannot persuade myself you deserve it and indeed as guilt is only hardened by impunity the sooner i think you are brought to justice the better nor is this event perhaps at so great a distance as you may imagine even the monster you know was caught at last and though you possibly conceive this brother assassin to have been as inferior to you in cunning as he certainly was in criminality it will not be amiss to let his fate be a warning to you  i shall make no apology for having taken up so much of your time which would most probably have been worse employed you may now proceed to gratify your malice and take your revenge and as i know you are fond of scripture quotations the lord reward you according to your works  i am gentlemen your humble servant  preface mr malone in the year    0 when publishing a supplement to shakspeare of plays which he never wrote modestly remarked that by a diligent collation of all the old copies thitherto discovered and the judicious restoration of ancient readings the text of this author seemed then finally settled since that period however he has been laboring with unceasing solicitude for the space of eight years to convince the public that he had if not directly asserted the thing which was not at least gone a little further than was consistent with the exact state of the case for if the text had been already diligently collated with all the old copies why should he make such a parade of having collated it himself if it had not been so collated why should he say it had this fact is therefore manifest upon mr malones own evidence that the text of shakspeare had never been collated whether diligently or not with all or any of the old copies by any person before mr malone to which one may add that even this great critics collation has not been either so diligent or so successful as he would induce us to believe of this the following instances occasionally noticed in the two first vols may serve as the specimen of a proof vol i p  0 if thou be pleased  both the folios read  you vol i p   0 for love is still more precious in itself  the old editt agree in reading  most vol i p      speed item she can sew  lance that is as much as to say can she so both the folios read sow which is manifestly requisite probably however the editor may suppose sew and so to have the same pronunciation vol i p     and that i cannot help in the old editions  cannot i vol i p     as easily as i do tear this paper both folios read  his vol ii p  0 but grace being the soul of your complexion should keep the body of it ever fair  in the folios  shall vol ii p    let me hear you speak further both editions  farther a word entirely different from further though too frequently confounded with it by ignorant persons the one being the comparative of forth the other a corruption of farer vol ii p     in what safe place you have disposed my money the old editions read  bestowed vol ii p     if it be sir pray eat none of it in the folio  i pray vol ii p     ay let none enter  the old copies  ay and let vol ii p   0 and much different from the man he was the folios read and much much different  the additional syllable being necessary to the meter which the editor could not perceive vol ii p ibi and therefore came it that the man was mad in the old copies  and thereof came it vol ii p     through the forest have i gone but athenian found i none all the old editions read  find which is not only more elegant but more grammatical   there is not reason to believe that each of the remaining volumes would not have contributed an equal number of these damning proofs but in fact the search required too large a portion of both time and patience   and also that it would have been much better for the said text if he had never collated it at all by a judicious restoration of ancient readings mr malone seems to understand the replacing of all the gross and palpable blunders of the first folio from which it has been the labor of such critics as row pope theobald warburton and hanmer to purge the text mr malone is a critic of a very different description  i have thought proper in the following pages to make a few observations on some of mr malones notes now mr malone will take this exceedingly ill for mr malone has a very high opinion of himself and a very mean one of every body else but i confess i do not seek to please mr malone i wish to rescue the language and sense of an admirable author from the barbarism and corruption they have acquired in passing through the hands of this incompetent and unworthy editor in a word i mean to convict and not to convince him  the total want of ear and judgment under which mr malone will be found to labor is undoubtedly a natural defect for which he would be an object rather of pity than of reprehension if he had not forced himself into an employment for which ear and judgment were essential and nature of course in depriving him of those indispensable requisites had utterly disqualifyed him want of courage in a common man may be considered as mere weakness of nerves in a commander it is punished with death  but it is not the want of ear and judgment only of which i have to accuse mr malone he stands charged with diverse other high crimes and misdemeanors against the divine majesty of our sovereign lord of the drama with deforming his text and degrading his margin by intentional corruption flagrant misrepresentation malignant hypercriticism and unexampled scurrility these charges shall be proved  not as mr malone proves things by groundless opinion and confident assertion but  by fact argument and demonstration how say thou culprit guilty or not guilty  whoever may think fit to censure the language of these criticisms mr malone has no such right having himself rifled the blooming beds of billingsgate to grace his commentaries with the choicest rhetorical flowers he seldom introduces the author of the remarks etc without a compliment on his profound ignorance or crude notions the feebleness of his attempts at jocularity the slenderness of his criticism and the like or the favorite epithet of a shallow or halfinformed remarker and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges it is surely lawful to return an enemy the shot of his own poisoned arrows and as for the rest whatever respect may be due to the errors of genius the blunders of ignorance and presumption deserve no quarter   since these sheets were printed off mr malone has issued proposals for a new and splendid edition of the plays and poems of this admired author in fifteen volumes royal quarto the reciprocal good opinion which the public and mr malone appear to entertain of each other does both parties infinite honor the one from his singular confidence the other from its refined taste having sufficiently and i trust satisfactorily proved how peculiarly qualifyed this ingenious gentleman is for an editor of our great poet i have only to add my sincerest wishes that completion of so magnificent a work may happen in time to afford me another equally favorable opportunity of giving my humble testimony to his very extraordinary merit  o while along the stream of time thy name expanded flies and gathers all its fame say shall my little bark attendant sail pursue the triumph and partake the gale cursory criticisms etc vol i part i preface pp xix xxi etc there cannot well be a more flagrant proof of disingenuity in the support of a particular opinion than is here manifested by the editor in his treatment of the second folio in order to substantiate his position that the editor of that book was entirely ignorant of our poet phraseology and meter and that various alterations were made by him in consequence of that ignorance which render his edition of no value whatever many of the instances adduced in support of this assertion are mere selfevident errors of the press the accidental omission or insertion of a single word or the inadvertent transposition of a couple of letters one passage of this kind is very remarkable the first folio reading  is straightway calm and boarded with a pirate  the editor of the second edition or some one for him had added the d and the printer made it claimed so where instead of carat in the first folio the second has raccat and instead of vigilance viligance we are to impute the compositors carelessness to ignorance or intentional corruption   faults to which every copy is equally subject and consequently prove that editors ignorance much less than his accusers malice which is the more remarkable as he has actually availed himself of a very considerable number of the corrections of the identical edition which he thus anxiously labors to depreciate as a sink of ignorance and corruption it must be evident that by this partial mode of proceeding the same charge might be brought home not only to the first folio but to almost any edition of any author a person who had only truth and justice in view would have exhibited a faithful statement a fair debtor and creditor account of the merits and defects of the two editions but this method mr malone is conscious so far from answering his purpose would have completely disproved and give the lie direct to his accusation since in fact for one instance of an alteration for the worse it will be easy to produce ten instances of alterations for the better and such at the same time as not only no ignorant or capricious person but not even a man of sense and sagacity would have hit upon without the assistance of manuscript corrections or personal information and after all it is not in the least improbable that both editions were printed by one and the same person there being only nine years difference in their dates and the one whether intentionally or otherwise just as inaccurate as the other both editors at least if two there were were shakspeares contemporaries probably his acquaintance possibly his friends and in all events equally familiar with the language of his time and his peculiar phraseology but leaving mr malones partiality and ingratitude out of the question i am by no means disposed to admit his judgment as to any ones ignorance of shakspeares phraseology and meter in neither of which i believe we shall find him a proficient some of these identical instances prove the direct reverse of what they are brought to do and convict the prosecutor of both ignorance and malignity  i his i e the second editors ignorance of shakspeares phraseology consists in printing   i can go no further instead of i can not go no further   i appointed him instead of  i am appointed him the syllable having slipped out in the press  the way to study death instead of the way to dusty death a mere accidental transposition of two letters which is constantly happening the following is of more consequence  the seventh fifth scene of the fourth act of this play antony and cleopatra concludes with these words  dispatch  enobarbus anthony who is the speaker desires his attendant eros to dispatch and then pronounces the name enobarbus who had recently deserted him and whose loss he here laments but there being no person in the scene but eros and the point being inadvertently omitted after the word dispatch the editor of the second folio supposed that enobarbus must have been an error of the press and therefore reads dispatch eros  such is mr malones account of the matter in which it is only necessary to supply a small omission of the very accurate writer viz that the line of which the two words in question are part is intended for meter of which he is too good a judge for the omission to have been designed this intention however would be defeated by the word enobarbus unless we are to accent it thus  my fortunes have corrupted honest men dispatch  enobarbus antony is continually repeating the name of eros he does it no less than five times in the preceding scene and once before in this the manuscript it is probable had in this place only an e of which the original printer improperly made enobarbus this mistake must have been some how or other made known to the editor of the second folio most likely by a ms correction in the copy he printed from he has therefore rightly corrected the word but at the same time has neglected to observe the transposition which had been made by his predecessor supposing the printer of each copy two different persons take the line therefore as shakspeare gave it and let us acknowledge our obligation to the second folio for so valuable an alteration corrupted honest men  eros dispatch if he had meant that anthony should apostrophise his absent officer he would have given it thus corrupted honest men  o enobarbus the editor of the second folio was therefore right in supposing if indeed he was not sure that enobarbus must have been an error of the press  in k henry viii are these lines   if we did think his contemplation were above the earth   not understanding this phraseology and supposing that were must require a noun in the plural number he reads   if we did think his contemplations were above the earth etc   now one would be glad to know where there is a single person to be found setting aside this petulant dogmatist who ever heard of such a phraseology or who does not know that were must require a noun in the plural number  it would be well if charges of no better foundation or greater strength could be brought against the ignorance of m malone  ii let us now examine how far he was acquainted with the meter of these plays ay marry now for it this is a subject upon which we are quite at home  in the winters tale we find  what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling in leads or oils  not knowing that fires was used as a dissyllable he added the word burning at the end of the line  he did so and it will be evident to every one who can read that the addition was absolutely necessary in point of quantity to the perfection of the line mr malone can not read and is totally ignorant of the consequences of his own absurd ideas he could never else have thought such a line as the following consistent with the laws of meter what wheels racks fiers what flaying boiling thus however he insists that shakspeare intended us to read  sworen charums instead of sworn charms suar for sure etc etc converting one syllable into two two into three or four and so on  instead of and so to arms victorious noble father with the second folio we are to read and so to arums victorious father because noble or some other word of equal quantity has been omited by the printer of the first  instead of  but prove it henry and thou shall be king as given by the editor of the second folio not knowing henry to be used as a trisyllable we are to read prove it henery and shall be king  instead of pours into captains wounds ha banishment pours being a dissyllable we are to adopt the following harmonious line  pours in to captains wounds banishment  instead of she is tickled now her fume can need no spurs he thinks it more in the authors manner to read she is tickcled now her fume needs no spurs  instead of the body of the city country court the body of city countery court   and instead of  burn hotter than my faith o but dear sir  buurn hotter than my faith o but sir   the editor indeed he says was even ignorant of the authors manner of accenting words for in the tempest where we find   spirits which by mine art i have from their confines called to enact my present fancies  he exhibits the second line thus i have from all their confines called to enact it is somewhat lucky however for the editor of the second folio that we are able to produce in his defense no less decisive a testimony than that of shakspeare himself the word in question occurs in julius caesar and caesars spirit ranging for revenge shall on these confines with a monarchs voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war   the reader will now judge for himself which of these two editors the prosecutor or defendant is most ignorant of his authors phraseology meter and manner of accenting words  had he consulted the original quarto says m malone he would have found that the poet wrote  so and so well but how if he could not get or never heard of the original quarto how then had he not in common with every other editor the right of supplying imperfections or correcting mistakes according to the best of his judgment it is no imputation upon the sagacity of dr thirlby or sir thomas hammer that they have suggested readings which however plausible are disproved by the more recent discovery of the old quartos all of which have not been yet seen even by mr malone who has at the same time been indebted to chance or favor for many of the others for which he has not on every occasion made the most grateful or liberal return  i shall now proceed to make the editor of the second folio some amends for the injustice malevolence and personal abuse of his hibernian adversary by displaying a few instances not only of his actual superiority to his predecessor if in fact either edition had any other editor than the compositor of the press but also where that superiority is admitted by mr malones own adoption the latter case is distinguished by an asterisk it was once my intention to have given what mr malone ought to have done a fair and faithful collation of the various readings of the two editions but the space and presswork required even by the following specimen and the necessity i should have thought myself under of going through them a second time which no one needs to be told is a word of time and patience will be a sufficient apology for not having carried it into effect at present however as mr malone has preserved all the errors of the second folio and i shall exhibit a considerable number at least of its emendations the reader will between us have a tolerably complete view of the controversy the first reading is that of the folio      the other that of the folio       tempest i will show thee every fertile inch of the island i will show thee every fertile inch of the i will    who to advance and who to trash for

afterward repenting as it were of his repentance he issued it out one instance may be sufficient to show his profound ignorance of the poet whom he attempted to illustrate he supposed the words ignomy and intergatory in a late edition of shakspeare to be errors of the press so when the clown in measure for measure says there were but two stewed prunes in the house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a fruitdish etc this remarker for distant would read instant  the veracity of this note is no less remarkable than its decency that the author of the pamphlet in question ever had the modesty to suppress it is an absolute falsehood known to his printer his bookseller and all who bought it the truth is that after a few copies were got abroad the further sale was delayed till a leaf could be reprinted in which some erroneous references had been detected and an expression used which was thought too strong for the person alluded to even if that person had been mr malone and another added to convict the editor or reviser of the late edition of a gross and wilful misrepresentation all this might take up a week when the publication was continued as to the rest both mr malone and the author of that pamphlet may have sufficient reason to wish that neither of them had ever betrayed more profound ignorance of this great poet than in barely prefering the reading of one edition to that of another that ignominy the correction of the second folio and of which ignomy is every where either a contraction or a corruption is requisite in the present instance will be evident to all except mr malone and perhaps the editor or reviser of the edition in question from the line itself ignominy in ransom and free pardon  intergatories is likewise nothing more than a contraction of interrogatories as shakspeare would always have written it if his meter had not required the sacrifice of a syllable which prose does not so in k john what earthly name to interrogatories  instant

observes should seem to have been written by the tinker in the taming of the shrew who talks of richard conqueror unfortunately however the observation is but one out of many instances of our halfinformed editors pleasantry being occasioned by his ignorance he supposes richard a blunder for edward because he does not know that there is such a personage as richard the confessor whereas there are no less than four confessors of that name any of whom might have been and one certainly was the hero of the above play in the first place there is saint richard the confessor an imaginary king of england supposed to be buried at lucca where he is said to have dyed on his return from a pilgrimage to rome another was bishop of chichester a third of st andrews in calabri and the fourth hermit of hampole near doncaster whose somniferous lucubrations have contributed in no small degree to the bulk of mr wartons history of english poetry all of these are expressly styled confessors in the english martyrologe   0  and other books of the same cast so that the editors attempt at jocularity is as feeble as his ignorance is profound  tempest p    pro go make thyself like a nymph of the sea be subject to no sight but thine and mine invisible to every eyeball else  the elder folio regulates the passage thus go make thyself like a nymph of the sea be subject to no sight but thine and mine invisible to every eyeball else   the second reads  like to nymph of the sea  and now comes our irish editor and pronounces as positively as if he had been at the copyists or compositors elbow that the words be subject were transfered to the second line by the carelessness of the transcriber or printer the regulation that i have made says he shows that the addition of the second folio was unnecessary  the only difference between the editor of the second folio and mr malone is that the former perfected the meter of the only defective line and the latter has destroyed that of each had this very fond and skillless editor possessed one thousandth part of the sense and sagacity he assumes the credit of he would have perceived that the blunder of the transcriber or printer consisted not in transposing the words be subject but in the insertion of two other syllables which certainly have no business there and could not possibly have come from shakspeare unless shakspeare had written like mr malone the regulation that i have made shows that the addition was necessary i appeal to those who have ears go make thyself like to a nymph of the sea be subject to no sight but mine invisible to every eyeball else   if this alteration have been made already it is more than i know  p    cursed be i that i did so  all the charms the latter word charms we are told like many others of the same kind is here used as a dissyllable  how other words of the same kind may be used is of little consequence all we want to know is why the word charms should be so used or in short how one syllable comes to be two the meter of the line is manifestly and simply perfect as consisting of ten monosyllables alternately short and long so that it is absolutely impossible to conceive a less exceptionable instance of heroic verse is this laborious octennial editor ignorant that his authors measure consists of ten syllables or is he like many of his wild countrymen unable to reckon to ten or to count his fingers the only reason i can perceive for his making charms a word of two syllables is that it cannot possibly be more than one  p     the fair soul herself weighed between lothness and obedience at which end of the beam she would bow the old edition reads  should  and mr pope by the omission of a single superfluous letter  which end the beam should bow an easy and apposite sense

for a much more violent alteration and no sense at all  p    bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none bourn the editor says might have been used as a dissyllable  certainly  by such a judge of harmony

editions reading  most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress whom i serve quickens what is dead and makes my labors pleasures  our notable critic for the improvement of the meter of which he is a complete judge alters it thus  most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious but the mistress etc and justifies the alteration by gravely telling us that our author and his contemporaries generally use odious as a trisyllable how then will he tell us do he and his contemporaries use it  it is evident that all we get by this capricious change is a transfer to one line of the defect of another at least to make any meter of the second we must read it thus as heavy to me as odious but as the editor will undoubtedly pretend our author and his contemporaries generally pronounced it  the insertion of a single syllable perfects the measure  most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as it is odious but the mistress etc   p    trin the sound is going away let us follow it and after do our work  ste lead monster well follow  i would i could see

verona p   0 o how this spring of love resembles the editor has inserted both mr tyrwhitts notes without taking the least notice of the conclusive reply already made to the latter and which it is unnecessary here to repeat in return for this piece of candor i shall only say that i do not in the least wonder to find him as ignorant of the principles of english orthography as he is of the sense and language of the author he has had the presumption to think himself qualifyed to illustrate mr tyrwhitt was a man of indisputable learning and critical abilities but perhaps on that very account

he thus makes of our allexcellent poets versification if worthless be a trisyllable it will be necessary to insert a vowel in order to receive the accent which it must be evident can neither fall upon worth nor less one must therefore read that you are welcome that you are worthiless   the editor seems to have acquired the secret of multiplying syllables from a wellknown story in joe millers jests where an equally ingenious oxford scholar proves two capons to be three and gets the third for his pains  they who look for information upon the subject in mr tyrwhitts note will be as much

perfectly ignorant of but what in fact is utterly unintelligible and absolute nonsense  yond in the above passage being an evident misprint for the under which had been written in the copy ye vnd and

a loss for not the meter surely surely if ever man was peculiarly disqualifyed by nature for an editor of shakspeare or in short for a reader of poetry it was this identical mr malone could it have been imagined that a writer in the eighteenth century would be so profoundly ignorant of the commonest rules of versification so totally destitute of every idea of harmony and arithmetic as to propose such a stanza as the following taffata phrases silken terms precise threepild hyperboles spruce affection figures pedantical these summer flies have blown me full of maggot ostentation perhaps however

the quern and bootless churn this he adds would obviate the objection made by dr johnson viz that the mention of the mill seems out of place for she is not now telling the good but the evil that he does such a construction may be perfectly natural to the maker whose ideas seem to sport in a most lovely confusion but how is it possible for any other person to approve it nothing can be more easy and intelligible than the passage as it now stands and the objection taken by dr johnson does not seem well founded as the fairy may have enumerated mischievous acts only pucks labor in the quern might be either to disturb the family with the noise or if he actually ground the corn when it was not wanted or to throw the flour about the house  p     the human mortals want their winter here the position too hastily advanced by mr steevens of the mortality of fairies has been so fully and completely refuted that i do not at all wonder to find our present candid and liberal editor continuing

dodsleys collection of which the editor or reviser of the edition of      had been a very few years before employed in the republication he must therefore know that it proved the direct reverse of that for which he refered to it and consequently that he was asserting an untruth  i should like to know from the gentleman concerned or any other able casuist the exact difference between asserting that a book proves what the asserter knows it disproves and producing like lauder supposititious extracts for the purpose   but the reduction and omission are sufficient to prove that our modest editor was himself convinced of the fallacy of mr steevenss assertion and mr reeds authorities though he has not had the candor to acknowledge it see the quip modest pp        the passage three quoted from ariosto is thus translated by sir j harington but either ancient folk believed a lie or this is true a fayrie cannot die   the following instances from this very play were accidentally omited but she being mortal of that boy did die i am a spirit of no common sort   if ever any position was or can be demonstrated by literary evidence it is that the fairies of shakspeare were not subject to

the rules of heraldry it is the editors note the first house only e g a father who has a son living or an elder brother as distinguished from a younger has a right to bear the family coat the sons coat is distinguished from the fathers by a label the younger brothers from the elders by a mullet the same crest is common to both helena therefore means to say that she and her friends were as closely united as much as one person as if they were both of the first house as if they both had the privilege due but to one person viz to him of the first house the right of bearing the family coat without any distinguishing mark  every reader of this incomparable edition will have frequent occasion to observe that the editor draws out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument the present instance indeed is nothing in comparison to pages of inanity with which the work abounds and which on account of their true nomeaning are actually incapable of refutation or discussion what in the name of shakspeare of sense or reason has either the father or his eldest son to do with the passage in question the two seeming bodies united by one heart are resembled to coats in heraldry crowned with one crest and this happens either where the heir keeps his paternal and maternal coats or the husband his own and his wifes in separate shields as is done on the continent or as at present with us in the quarterings of the same shield in both cases there are two coats due but to one and crowned with one crest which is clearly the authors allusion but i am sorry to add that he must have entirely misunderstood since he has so strangely misapplyed the expression two of the first which in heraldical jargon always means two objects of the first color mentioned that is the field for instance in blazoning a coat they will say argent upon a fesse gules two mullets of the first that is argent the color of the field these words are therefore a melancholy proof that our great author sometimes retained the phrase after he had lost the idea or up the former without sufficient precaution as to the latter it is not indeed the only one but quandoque bonus dormitat homerus with respect to the note as it is the offspring of ignorance it becomes naturally the parent of contempt  p     i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where mr malone informs us is here used as a dissyllable the modern editors he says unnecessarily read  whereon  we must therefore it seems necessarily read i know a bank whear the wild thyme blows  this to be sure is no despicable line mr malone is a very pretty harmonist in his way but if we must have a dissyllable why not bank i know a baank where the wild thyme blows or thyme still better as old geoffrey might have had it  i know a bank where the wild thyme blows  vol iii merchant of venice p     away says the fiend for the heavens rouse up a brave mind and run away for the heavens that is as our editor explains it begone to the heavens now was it possible to imagine that a man who has been laboring for eight years with unceasing solicitude to give a faithful and correct edition of shakspeare should be so profoundly and completely ignorant of his meaning in this very simple passage can any thing be so unnatural and absurd as for the devil to advise the person he is tempting to go to heaven but why to the heavens or how get thither mr malone it is believed will find the journey somewhat more difficult than he seems to apprehend it would have been to honest lancelot in the mean time every one but this floundering commentator knows that for the heavens is nothing more than an adjuration or as we now say for the heavens sake  p    if a christian do not play the knave and get thee i am much deceived if a christian says lancelot on receiving a loveletter for lorenzo do not play the knave and carry thee away from thy fathers house i am much deceived such is the ingenious editors explanation which he would not have attempted of so easy a passage if the ignorant editor of the second folio thinking probably that the word get must necessarily mean beget had not altered the text and substituted did in the place of do in which he has been copied by every subsequent editor every subsequent editor must therefore be at least equally ignorant and i dare say if mr malone is to be the judge there never was editor commentator or critic of shakspeare who had a grain of sense beside himself a refutation cannot be expected of such peculiar absurdity lancelot he says is not talking about jessicas father but about her future husband but how does he know this who told him so can he be better acquainted with the subject of launcelots conversation than the man himself he is aware at the same time that in a subsequent scene he says to jessica marry you may partly hope your father got you not but he is now it seems on another subject that however is but the idle opinion of mr malone the editor of the second folio and all his successors and i will venture to add shakspeare himself and all his readers think very differently  p    shut doors after you fast bind fast find former editors had supplied a syllable which is equally necessary to the sense and to the meter but the delicate ear and critical acumen of their hibernian successor have enabled him to discover that  doors is here used as a dissyllable a previous acquaintance with the irish howl must be of infinite service in the perusal of this harmonious edition  ibi how like a younker and a prodigal this elegant and judicious emendation of the old copies which read younger was made by mr row our more ingenious editor however with becoming diffidence and profound knowledge doubts whether younker was a word of our authors time it however happens a little unluckily not only to be a word of our authors time but to be elsewhere used by our author himself what says falstaff in the second part of king henry iv will you make a younker of me again in the third part of k henry vi  trimmed like a younker prancing to his love if he has elsewhere doubted of his doubt it only proves how little he is any where to be depended on  p    for fear i surfeit bass what find i here  the latter word is here employed as a dissyllable  of this there can be no doubt as the line itself will prove for fear i surfeit what find i hear   p    as far as belmont jes in such a night did young lorenzo swear he loved her well   swear is here as in many other places a dissyllable  this as usual is confirmed by the meter as far as belmont in such a nght did young lornzo swar he lovd her well   who can say that our harmonious editor has not employed his eight years labor to advantage when he produces such lines as these  as you like it p      now go we in content go in we an accidental transposition of the first folio being thus properly corrected in the second our editor who will not allow that edition the merit or liberty of correcting the most glaring typographical blunder is not sure that the transposition is necessary for as he sagaciously observes our author might have used content as an adjective whence i presume we must necessarily infer that the correction has rendered it a substantive pronoun verb participle adverb conjunction preposition or interjection he seems a very pretty grammarian  p     the body of country city court every one who has either ear or eye will instantly perceive here the want of a syllable which was supplied by the editor of the second folio who reads the body of the country city court a reading which is essential to the sense and measure of the verse and which one may therefore reckon indisputably shakspeares the present editor however who is in fact what he would have the other thought to be utterly ignorant of our authors phraseology and meter omits the article under pretense that  country is here used as a trisyllable to reason with a man who has no more ear for poetry than dr johnson had for music and he scarcely knew a drum from a trumpet or a bagpipe from a guitar would be absurd every other person will see it was utterly impossible for shakspeare to write such a line as this or indeed for any one but mr malone to conceive it the body of countery city court what a pity it is that the public cannot have the pleasure of hearing mr malone read his own text i say pleasure because undoubtedly it would be a most laughable performance  p     over the wretched what though you have mo beauty the old copies reading  no beauty the editor will have it to be a misprint for mo or more as he has every where else thought proper to write it this he says appears clearly from the passage in lodges rosalynde which shakspeare has here imitated  because thou art beautiful be not so coy etc a passage which as it contains neither no nor mo can not certainly prove what it is brought to do the construction adopted by this penetrating critic is that though a woman has more beauty than her lover she is not on that account to insult him an idea which one can easily suppose never entered into any head but his own one would not therefore wish to deprive the present edition of an emendation so worthy of it but however mr malone may read his author certainly wrote over the wretched what though you have beauty he could not perceive that no or mo was as injurious to the meter as his quotation from lodge might have led him to suspect it was to the sense though i believe he understands both equally well but i well know that my learned friend is above taking notice of such slender criticism  p  0   i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain our perspicacious editor had some years ago conjectured that these words had an allusion to some wellknown conduit he has since found his conjecture confirmed and elsewhere observed that our author without doubt alluded to the ancient cross in cheapside in which was an alabaster image of diana and water prilling from her naked breasts so that unfortunately the very instance which he has adduced in confirmation of the above sagacious conjecture totally destroys it unless the tears of his cheapside diana flowed from her breasts instead of her eyes this would have done well enough in dublin  p     ah sir a body would think this was well counterfeited the old copy reads  ah sir etc corrected by the editor of the second folio  it ought indeed to have been so corrected by that editor but the fact is that the second folio reads  ah sir  taming of the shrew p     vincentios son brought up in florence vincentios according to mr malone is here used as a quadrisyllable mr pope he adds not perceiving this unnecessarily reads  vincentio his son which has been too hastily adopted by the subsequent editors  mr malone no doubt is able to perceive a great many thing which neither mr pope nor any body else would dream of though if mr pope did not perceive that a word of four syllables was a word of four syllables he must have been a more extraordinary person than he is generally reputed no no mr malone it was not because he did not perceive vincentios to be used as a quadrisyllable that he read vincentio his but because not having had the advantage of an irish education he perceived that such a line as the following could not have been written by shakspeare vincentios son brought up in florence  whatever people may choose to say of mr malones edition no one will deny him the exclusive merit of deforming his authors verse in the most ridiculous and asinine manner possible  p     but wrangling pedant this is probably the editor admits our author wrote  this lady is which he says completes the meter wrangling being used as a trisyllable now in my humble opinion it rather completes the evidence that the editor does not know what meter is he should have accented his lines what delectable harmony is here but wranggleing pedant this lady is  there is a poem entitled teisa which was published a few years ago entirely written in this way and on that account a sort of curiosity if it had not born the name of the author anna fisher and been upon a different subject i should have been positive that is was the production of our musical editor the said poem however and his own shakspeare are so far as i know the only specimens of this kind of meter extant either in the english or any other language  p     where be these knaves what no man at door  door is here and in other places used as a dissyllable right you have told us so once before let us therefore read the line as it should be in the irish way                     0  where   be   these   knaves   what   no   man   at   do  oo  0r  a dealer in dissyllables possessed of the slightest notion of harmony would rather have made one of knaves but an editor of common sense would read  the door  pericles p     to please the fool and death the fool and death mr malone observes

the world for patching up a broken verse now what for instance can run more smoothly than the following with adorations fertile tears ah to be sure mr malone is not a very good judge of harmony to be sure he is not  p    mar my purpose is indeed a horse of that color  sir and and your horse now would make him an ass  mar ass i doubt not  mr tyrwhitt believing that this conceit which though bad enough shows he thought too quick an apprehension for sir andrew should be given to sir toby an anonymous writer asks if the ingenious critic imagined it probable that maria would call sir toby whom according to his own account she adored and ass upon which our truly affable and diffident hibernian after premising that his learned friend is above taking notice of such slender criticism roundly asserts that maria is not speaking of sir andrew or sir toby but of malvolio i should insult the reader by descending to refute an assertion so wantonly confident and extravagantly absurd  p    and thanks and ever thanks often good turns theobald inserted the second thanks and added likewise the word and to perfect the meter mr malone who is a much better judge of meter suffers the former word to remain but rejects the latter having no doubt that turns was used as a dissyllable we must therefore take care to read and thanks and ever thanks often good tuurns but why mr malone should not good be a dissyllable since a dissyllable there must be as well as turns and then you see we shall have no need of interpolating the true original reading of the only ancient authentic copy  winters tale p     mr malone reads  for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think which being as fabian says exceeding good senseless is judiciously prefered to the correction of former editors  that

we can any where meet with  the pretty dimps ofs chin and cheek his smiles shakspeare had no conception of these little malonian beauties he only wrote the line thus the pretty dimples of his cheek his smiles leaving it for such superior geniuses as mr malone to improve and finish off  p  00 burn hotter than my faith per o but sir  the editor of the second folio who ignorant as he was seems to

johnson having observed that the improbability of this scene is scarcely balanced by the humor our irish editor perceives no improbability asserting roundly that falstaff does not mistake the prince for a bastard of the kings but means to inform him at once that he knows him a poins notwithstanding their disguise  the text which is too plain to be misunderstood by a reader of common sense will speak for itself and clearly prove that neither falstaff nor the hostess knows the prince till he says he is come to draw him out by the ears falstaff himself allows that he did not know the prince was within hearing but this perspicacious critic who can see into the midst of a millstone would be thought to know what passes better than either falstaff or falstaffs creator  p     eastcheap a room

might be many signs of the boars head in and about london besides that in eastcheap but why need shakspeare be at the trouble of carrying a sign from blackfriars and hanging it up in eastcheap where he must know it existed already if the boars head were not the sign of the boars head tavern in eastcheap let the editor tell us what it was if it were not shakspeare might have looked long enough about blackfriars playhouse before he had found either the boars head or the boars head tavern the sign which stow mentions was a bears head and he speaks of it  not as hanging at the time he wrote but  as having formerly been one of the signs of the stewhouses which had been long suppressed and which every one knows were not near blackfriars playhouse see his survay      p      p     fall i deny your major if you will deny the sheriff so  an anonymous writer we are informed supposes that falstaff here intends a quibble major which sheriff brought to his mind signifies as well one of the parts of a logical proposition as the principal officer of a corporation  to render this supposition probable says the editor it should be proved that the mayor of a corporation was called in shakspeares time major  the supposition would appear sufficiently probable although the pronunciation contended for could not be established by a quotation every one knows that mayor is major in latin which would be enough for the present purpose the proof required can only be necessary for one who has every where betrayed the profoundest ignorance of his authors language and who pretends to have collated editions which if we may judge from the blunders of his own he has never looked into the identical pronunciation in question happens fortunately enough to be preserved in one of our authors own plays the first part of k henry vi as printed in the only ancient authentic edition the folio of       major farewell thou doost but what thou may  king henry v p  0  flu gots ploot up to the preaches etc  nothing need or can be added to what has been already urged against this corrupted text and prevaricating comment see the quip modest etc p     how unfortunate is it how injurious to the memory of this great and admirable writer that his best scenes should be thus mangled and deformed by a restoration equally impudent and foolish of what he himself has thought fit to alter or reject such conduct deserves a pillory rather than a pamphlet  p     toward calais grant him there there seen if toward the editor observes be not abbreviated our author with his accustomed license uses one of these words as a dissyllable while to the other he assigns only its due length  arrah my dear this will be after mending the matter by making bad worse the line already wants one syllable if toward be abbreviated it will want two  and then there will be ten so that take two from ten and there remains ten our editor is a notable arithmetician in his way he can multiply one syllable into two or three reduce two or three to one and play a thousand such tricks which neither cocker nor breslaw ever once dreamt of i am apt to suspect however after all that the above observation labors under a capital error of the press and that instead of the words our author with his accustomed license we should read our editor with his accustomed ignorance  vol vi first part of king henry vi p    gloucester well meet to thy cost be sure the latter word being here used as a dissyllable we are to read the line thus gloster well meet to thy cost be suure than which nothing can be more malonious  harmonious i would say  p  0 a statelier pyramid to her i will rear than rhodopes or memphis every was mr steevens having proposed to read  of memphis as shakspeare unquestionably wrote this sagacious hibernian observes rhodope was of thrace not of memphis well and whoever supposed she was of memphis but her pyramid was there which is sufficient authority for the correction  p    enter mortimer mr steevens from the ms notes of mr edwards having observed that shakspeare has varied from the truth of history to introduce this scene between mortimer and richard plantagenet a halfinformed remarker on this note they are the words of the gentle edmond seems to think that he has totally overturned it by quoting the following passage from halls chronicle during which parliament held in the third year of henry vi      came to london peter duke of quimber  which of the duke of exeter etc was highly fested  during which season edmond mortymer the last earl of march of that name which long time had been restrained from his liberty and finally waxed lame disceased without issue whose inheritance descended to lord richard plantagenet etc as if a circumstance which hall has mentioned to mark the time of mortimers death necessarily ascertained the place where it happened also the fact is that this edmund mortimer did not die in london but at trim in ireland so far so good  this testy critic seems to smart so much from some corrections of that same halfinformed remarker that he may be readily allowed to avail himself of every opportunity of abusing him particularly where he happens to anticipate a quotation which an allinformed editor would have been glad to produce the passage in hall and it is copyed by hollinshed would be sufficient it was said to justify shakspeare even if the fact were otherwise and so it undoubtedly is notwithstanding either the great learning or little scurrility of edmond malone the historian does not to be sure expressly say that the earl of march dyed in the tower but no person of common sense can think that he meant to relate an event which happened to a sound free man in ireland as happening to a lame prisoner during the time a particular person was feasting in london in fact he does say that this nobleman dyed in prison and that by such prison he meant either the tower or some place of confinement at no great distance is almost certain not only from the circumstance already mentioned but from a passage in the preceding part of his book where he expressly tells us that the earl of march was ever kept in the court under such a keeper that he could nether do or attempt any thing against the king without his knowledge and dyed without issue if he did not mean the tower let mr malone say what prison he did mean to what purpose is it that the actual truth was otherwise our author had neither rymer nor dugdale nor sandford to consult and it cannot surely be expected that he should have gone to examine the record office he naturally took for fact what he found in history and if the historian were but halfinformed how could he help it he was writing a play not a chronicle i know much better i am persuaded than mr malone how little either hall or hollinshed is to be depended on in matter of fact is the death of edmond mortimer of greater consequence than the intended marriage of lady bona or the capture imprisonment and escape of k edward iv both which are absolutely fabulous and without the slightest possible foundation and why is not shakspeare who has adopted these two lying stories charged with having in these instances varyed from the truth of history the remark was natural enough to mr edwards who did not know what sort of histories our author consulted neither indeed is the editors defense of it otherwise being a pedantic parade of historical knowledge picked up for the occasion to fasten shakspeare with a charge which every one must think frivolous and which he knew to be unjust  second part of k henry vi p     she is tickled now her fume needs no spurs tickled it seems is here used as a trisyllable the editor of the second folio not perceiving this reads  her fume can need no spurs in which he has been followed by all the subsequent editors  the editor of the second folio then has had the use of his ears which is more than can be said of his hibernian successor it requires a certain degree of folly peculiar to this allaccomplished critic not to perceive  that whether tickled be a dissyllable or a trisyllable or a quadrisyllable cannot make the slightest difference the defect of the line being in another quarter  according to the hypothesis of our boeotian editor we ought to read the line as follows she is tickleed now her fume needs no spurs what a pity it is that mr malone does not appear upon the stage  third part of k henry vi p     prove it henry and thou shall be king henry being frequently used by shakspeare and his contemporaries as a word of three syllables must be thus pronounced prove it henery and thou shall be king  p     when i return with victory from the field folio  to the field the true reading is found in the old play  the true reading is found in the second folio which affords one out of many proofs that this edition is not what the editors malice or ignorance has chosen to represent it  p     ms the queen will all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in this castle  an anonymous remarker we are told very confidently asserts that this scene so far as respects yorks oath and his resolution to break it proceeds entirely from the authors imagination his oath however is in record and what his resolution was when he marched from london at the head of a large body of men and sent the message abovestated to his son it is not very difficult to conjecture  a little superficial reading and a consummate stock of assurance authorize this hypercritical commentator to abuse what he does not understand the anonymous remarker confidently if it must be asserts that the scene in question in which edward and richard persuade their father to break his oath had no foundation in history and gives this reason for it that neither the earl of march nor richard was then at sandal the latter being likewise a mere child scarcely more than if indeed so much as nine years old in fact he was but just turned of eight how therefore does the irish editor with all his pitiful caviling and malignity pick out from these words that york had never taken an oath and though he and warwick did leave london with   or  000 men and might send a message to his son to follow them it was with the kings own authority to suppress an insurrection against the established government nor could either his attacking or his defending himself against the queen or prince be any breach of his oath so that the remarkers assertion however confident is strictly true which is more than this ingenuous hibernian can always say of his own which are at the same time very seldom distinguishable by diffidence  it is not true that the queen and prince were at york nor do we find from any good authority that they were sent to by the king though if they had been sent to and instead of obeying the requisition had employed themselves in raising a rebellion it would have been perfectly consonant with the dukes oath and duty to have prevented or quelled it but in fact whatever concern the queen might have in the yorkshire insurrection she did not return from scotland till after the battle of wakefield  what sort of histories the irish editor consults i am at a loss to imagine and as he does not choose to cite them i shall for once follow his example i collect from another note p     where he says that neither of his daughters was married at the time when warwick was in france negotiating a marriage between lady bona and the king that the learned gentleman is content either with the same historians whom shakspeare used or with those who have followed them warwick never was in france for any such purpose as no one but such a halfinformed notewriter can be ignorant   the absurd note at p     being founded in gross misapprehension or profound ignorance is unworthy of more particular notice  p     so many years ere i shall sheer the fleece mr row we are told changed years to months which was followed by the subsequent editors and in the next line inserted the word weeks not observing that hours is used as a dissyllable years it seems is in that line likewise used as a word of two syllables  the reason of mr rows changing years to months and inserting weeks was not as this equally superficial and blundering commentator imagines purely on account of the measure but because the king has already mentioned weeks and years and afterward enumerates months these two curious dissyllables it must be confessed help the meter prodigiously but in fact the editor should be expected to rehearse his text to the purchaser as no one will ever be able to read it without his instructions the line in question would seem to be accented thus so minutes houers days months and years  p   0 now brother richard lord hastings and the rest one of the former commentators having very judiciously proposed to omit the word lord our ingenious editor observes that brother like many similar words is here used by shakspeare as a monosyllable and the meter was to his ear perfect he should rather have said that it is so to his own which indeed i can as easily believe as pardon since the gentleman unfortunately labors under a natural defect to which whoever interpolated the word must have been also subject though not in an equal degree the ears of shakspeare were formed very differently from mr malones observe how smoothly the verse will run now bror richard lord hastings and the rest  the editor is unable to perceive the consequences of his own system the luminous arrangement of his ideas is altogether wonderful  k richard iii p     when did thou sleep when such a deed was done q mar when holy harry died and my sweet son  the editor of the second folio says our acute critic changed when to why which has been adopted by all the subsequent editors though margarets answer evidently refers to the word found in the original copy  the editor of the second folio seems to have understood his authors meaning which is by no means the case with his flimsy antagonist why is evidently right how happens it exclaims the queen that heaven slept when such a deed was done margaret catching at the words such a deed adds when holy henry and my son were murdered  if when were right the queen would be guilty of a manifest absurdity as the question would answer itself but an irish editor must have an irish text  p     what heir of york is there alive but we and who is englands king but great yorks heir richard says the editor asks this question in the plenitude of power and no one dares to answer him but they whom he addresses had they not been intimidated might have told him that there was a male heir of the house of york alive who had a better claim to the throne than he edward earl of warwick the only son of the usurpers elder brother george duke of clarence and elizabeth the eldest daughter of edward iv and all her sisters had a better title than either of them  either this frivolous commentator is profoundly ignorant of the history of the monarch whom he chooses to call usurper or wilfully misrepresents it king richard it is well known had as good a title to the crown as the late king william or queen anne or the reigning house of hanover the issue of king edward had been bastardized the duke of clarence attainted and himself declared the undoubted heir of richard duke of york by act of parliament and what better title has the present king it might as well be said that when he by his champion challenged all the world to dispute his right he did it in the plentitude of power and that they whom he addressed had they not been intimidated might have told him that there was a male heir of the house of stuart alive who had a better claim to the throne than he an act of parliament is of no more force in the   th or   th century than it was in the   th  vol vii coriolanus p     the etymology which dr johnson has given in his dictionary  malkin from mal or mary and kin the diminutive termination  is i apprehend erroneous malone  mr malones apprehension arises from his ignorance of the english language the diminutives wilkin tomkin jenkin perkin simkin and etc sufficiently corroborate dr johnsons etymology and they who know to what the diminutive of margaret has given a name can be at no loss to account for the reason of malkin being degraded to signify a mop of clouts or a scarecrow neither of which significations by the way has anything to do with the text but such is the absurd consequence of an irish editor attempting the illustration of an english author  p     corioli as the editor makes an uncommon fuss with his pretensions of adhering to the old copy let him give reason why he has chosen to read corioli not only in opposition to his original but to shakspeares authority  norths plutarch this however is not mentioned as the only instance he has given us of his want of truth fidelity candor and consistency  p   0 sic you show too much of that  this speech is given in the old copy to cominius it was rightly attributed to sicinius by mr theobald  having neither theobalds edition nor the first folio at present before me i shall leave the above assertion to its credit but this i can say that the second folio which if it is not to be called an old copy is clearly not a very modern one gives the speech to sicinius and i for one do not believe that the first gives it to any body else if it does the second folio is good for something which is more than any one will be found to say of mr malones edition at the end of a century and a half should it so long have the unmerited good fortune to escape the figs and pepper to which it is destined  p     because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth the editor being as devoid of harmony as one of the long eared fraternity naturally thinks if he be capable of thinking  for as he elsewhere makes his author observe  cogitation resides not in the man who does not think  that all his readers must be as defectively organized as himself how else could he have printed such execrable hobbling lines as coming from shakspeare he will not have sense to perceive the superiority of the following arrangement  it is not intended for him to offer him harmonious verses would be literally throwing pearls to swine  because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you to but with such words that are but roted in your tongue but bastards of no allowance to your bosoms truth prompts you to is the reading of the second folio the words though and and syllables have been interpolated by such another editor as himself as they only serve to make nonsense of the passage but indeed sense or nonsense harmony or discord verse or prose are all the same to him  p     if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name has touched your ears a lot here dr johnson says is a prize it certainly is so though our sagacious hibernian believes him mistaken menenius he imagines only means to say that it is mo  an equal chance that his name had touched their ears which is precisely the effect of dr johnsons explanation but adds he if lot signified prize there being in every lottery many more blanks than prizes menenius must be supposed to say that the chance of his name having reached their ears was very small a criticism exactly calculated for the meridian of tipperary menenius says it is prizes to blanks something to nothing  0000l to a piece of waste paper etc a lot is what one gains in the lottery and our learned editor no doubt if he got a blank would say he had gained a loss neither shakspeare however nor menenius was an irishman  julius caesar p     are then in council and the state of a man such it seems is the reading of the elder copy the editor of the second folio omitted the article probably from a mistaken notion concerning the meter and all the subsequent editors have adopted his alteration many words of two syllables however are used by shakspeare as taking up the time of only one as whether either brother lover gentle spirit etc and i suppose concludes this profound critic  council is so used here  there can be no occasion i should think to make any remark upon a note of which the premises are so false and the conclusion so foolish neither our author nor any other author in the world ever used such words as either brother lover gentle spirit as monosyllables and though whether is sometimes so contracted the old copies on that occasion usually print where it is in short morally impossible that two syllables should be no more than one  p      if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself the editor believes that shakspeare wrote cassius on caesar never shall turn back and says the next line strongly supports this conjecture he must mean it is presumed in the irish way as a mere english reader would conclude that the next line totally destroys it if adds he the conspiracy was discovered and the assassination of caesar rendered impracticable by prevention cassius could have no hope of being able to prevent caesar from turning back and in all events this conspirators slaying himself could not produce that effect  it is much to be lamented that the legislature has not prevented this misconceiving blundering foreigner from dishonouring and debasing the margin of shakspeare by such palpable absurdities cassius says if the plot be discovered at all events either he or caesar shall never return alive for if the latter cannot be killed he is determined to slay himself the sense is as plain as the alternative is just and necessary or the proposed reading ignorant and absurd  p     even at the base of pompeys statue if even says the editor be considered as a monosyllable the meter of which to be sure he is an admirable judge will be defective but though it is not our authors practice to make this adverb a dissyllable yet clearly if we treat it as one the defect is removed and the meter exactly suited to the delicate ears of this irish midas whose admirers are to read the line thus even at thee base of pompeyes statue  p     for i have neither writ nor words nor worth the first folio by an evident blunder having writ is followed by our congenial editor who does not like to see a blunder corrected wit the reading of the second folio will receive the approbation of every one who has sense  p     our best friends made our means stretched to the utmost we are indebted for the three last words to the conceit of the present editor who has had the modesty to advance them to the honor of a place in the text the second folio from some good authority no doubt reads our best friends made and our best means stretched out which whether he understand it or not has an evident and easy sense and is perfectly in our authors manner  stretched to the utmost is much too malonish for so correct and elegant a writer  antony and cleopatra p     go to then your considerate stone sir w blackstone having remarked that the meter of this line is deficient the editor with his usual modesty observes that  your like hour is used as a dissyllable the meter therefore is not defective defective no certainly nothing can be more harmonious go to then youer considerate stone however as enobarbus to whom it belongs generally speaks in plain prose there is no occasion for any further attempt to harmonize it  p      good night dear lady  good night sir these last words which in the only authentic copy of this play are given to antony the modern editors according to mr malone have assigned to octavia i however he adds see no need of change he addresses himself to caesar who immediately replies good night the first of these modern editors happens to be his old friend the editor of the second folio which he pretends to have collated with so much care who appears from this and numberless other instances to have had a copy of the first folio corrected by the players who published it or some other wellinformed person that mr malone sees no need of change is the strongest possible reason for believing that a change is absolutely necessary and so it certainly is antony has already said good night sir to caesar in the three first words of his speech the repetition would be absurd  p     ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears that long time have been barren though the first word is evidently a misprint for rain as it has been given by sir t hanmer and others the editor suspects no corruption the term employed in the text he says is much in the style of the speaker what he means by that is difficult to say and is supported incontestably by a passage in julius caesar which incontestably does not support it at all the idea being perfectly distinct the term employed however as well as the note upon it is much in the style of the editor and it would be a pity to lose any opportunity of laughing at his bulls and blunders which it must be nevertheless admitted are as impertinent in the margin of shakspeare as a buffoon would be in a church  ram is likewise a vulgar word never used in our authors plays but once by falstaff where he describes his situation in the buckbasket though if in the tempest the negligence of a pressman had left  heavens ram grace this judicious critic would have supported that authentic reading in the same way for as he has elsewhere justly observed if such capricious innovations were to be admitted every line in these plays might be changed some people are too ignorant to innovate  p     spoke you of caesar how the nonpareil  how i believe was here printed by mistake for ho malone  it was not and ho which this ingenuous annotator found in the second folio is nothing more than an accidental transposition of oh oh antony oh thou arabian bird the editor can pilfer though he cannot praise  p  0  then world thou have a pair of chaps no more and throw between them all the food thou have they will grind the one the other where is antony dr johnsons emendation certainly deserved a place in the text and a very slight alteration would prevent its destroying the meter which any but our asinego of an editor will instantly perceive  grind the one the other  will never do the measure is perfect in the old reading which requires only one syllable for another shakspeare wrote they will grind each other where is antony  p     being so frustrate tell him he mocks us by the pauses that he makes the two last words of the first line are added by the present irish editor who observes that the defect of the meter of which he knows as much as a superannuated jackass shows that something was omitted former editors supplied the measure by reading being so frustrated tell him he mocks which it must be confessed does not afford an easy sense shakspeare however would never have written the above hobbling line which has no sort of pretensions to meter we may read being so frustrated he mocks us by  vol viii timon of athens p    the ear taste touch smell all pleased from thy table rise the ear it seems was intended to be contracted into one syllable and table also was probably used as taking up only the time of a monosyllable this nonsense is to justify the retention of all which better judges had found it necessary to omit or rather to change for smell mr malone reads the line thus that is if he can read at all thear taste touch smell all pleased from thy tail rise  p  0 the clamorous demands of datebroken bonds the old editions read  of debt broken bonds hanmer and others omit the syllable which the present editor has thus judiciously restored being unable to perceive that he was injuring the meter without improving the sense  p     this slave unto his honor has my lords meat in him the modern editors have concurred in reading  unto this hour  as unquestionably shakspeare wrote but the corruption being manifest nonsense is properly replaced in the present text where it will find nothing to put it out of countenance  p    the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic he crossed himself by it and i cannot think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear the meaning as elucidated by this perspicacious critic is as follows the devil did not know what he was about when he made man crafty and interested he thwarted himself by it and i cannot but think that at last the enormities of mankind will rise to such a height as to make even satan himself in comparison appear what he would least of all wish to be spotless and innocent which seems much more obscure than the text itself the editor has omitted three very weak notes of warburton johnson and tollett to make way for his own nonsense but why the passage should have required a note except to inform us that the commentator did not understand it is not easy to conceive the devils folly in making man politic is to appear in this that he will at the long run be too many for his old master and get free of his bonds the villainies of man are to set himself clear not the devil to whom he is by ignorant enthusiasts supposed to be in thralldom  p    your masters confidence was above mine else surely his had equaled our modest hibernian after giving an interpretation which he professes to think wrong because a shallow remarker has endeavored to represent it as unintelligible allows it may be so to him as the wit of some men meaning of course his own like falstaffs desert is too thick to shine and too heavy to mount this remarker however he proceeds to relate  after a feeble attempt at jocularity and saying that he shall take no further notice of this editors seesaw conjectures with great gravity proposes a comment evidently formed on the latter of them as an original interpretation of his own on which the reader may safely rely  friend butler somewhere tells us there is no argument like matter of fact we shall presently see who is the thief  in the edition of      the latter of this ingenious gentlemans seesaw conjectures is as follows the passage however may be explained thus  his may refer to mine as if he had said your masters confidence was above my masters else surely his i e the sum demanded from my master for that is the last antecedent had been equal to the sum demanded from yours  the remark is your master it seems had more confidence in lord timon than mine otherwise his  i e my masters debt  i e the sum due to him from timon would certainly have been as great as your master  i e as the money which timon owes to your master that is my master being as rich as yours could and would have advanced timon as large a sum as your master has advanced him if he  i e my master had thought it prudent to do so  very well now comes the true explication which the editor says he also formerly proposed an assertion if he mean in the edition of      which is evidently untrue the reader may compare them   his may refer to mine it should seem that the confidential friendship subsisting between your master and timon was greater than that subsisting between timon and my master else surely his sum i e the sum borrowed from my master the last antecedent had been as large as the sum borrowed from yours  it must be perfectly clear that the remarker could not be indebted to a note which so far as it is intelligible seems diametrically opposite to his idea it is equally so that the editor has availed himself of the above shallow remark to vary the expression of his seesaw conjecture and give it a sense it would otherwise never have had q e d  troilus and cressida p     and skillless as unpracticed infancy dr johnson says that mr dryden in his alteration of this play has changed skillless to artless not for the better because skillless refers to skill and skilful a very fond and skillless remarker on this note adds the editor asks and does not artless refer to art and artful  without interesting myself at all in what i do not profess to understand i shall only beg leave to say that if mr malone meant by this piece of insolent vulgarity to assert that there was any such question in the  remarks on the last edition etc      the assertion is a gross falsehood he seems to commit forgery for the sake of abuse  k lear p     here our learned editor incapable of distinguishing history from romance quotes geoffrey of monmouth for an historical fact in a subsequent page  0  he assures us that  nero is introduced in the present play above  00 years before he was born he should therefore seem to have some secret method for ascertaining the era of persons that never existed and of events that never happened it cannot however be by means of the black art as he is certainly no conjurer  p     your old kind father whose frank heart gave you all father brother rather he has already observed he says were sometimes used by shakspeare as monosyllables your old kind far whose frank heart gave you all  the folios read your old kind father whose

copy of      in the two subsequent copies and the folio we have  my niece what word was intended by it is difficult for him to say the editor of the second folio he adds substituted  my sweet which being an emendation equally just and beautiful and by his own admission more tender than what he calls the original word he rejects as an arbitrary substitution all the alterations in that copy being made at random not excluding those which this candid commentator has elsewhere thought fit to adopt  madam which is given to romeo in the first copy by a mere mistake of the compositor evidently belongs to the nurse who is supposed to call juliet from within shakspeare however thought proper to alter the word to sweet and give it to romeo or indeed one of the speeches may have dropped out at the press niece is a palpable misprint  p  00 hood my unmannd blood to hood a hawk that is to cover its head with a hood we are here told was an usual practice before the bird was suffered to fly at its quarry  if such a practice ever prevailed i conclude it must have been in our luminous editors native country it will appear a very strange doctrine to the amateurs of this savage amusement that the hawk should be flown at game which it was not suffered to see the fact is that they on this occasion took the hood off  p     but thou stewst tybalt there are thou happy too thus he says the first quarto in the subsequent quartos and the folio too is omitted  now reader be pleased to mark the candor the integrity of this ingenuous critic the editor of the second folio who he pretends has been the most arbitrary ignorant and capricious of the whole set reads exactly with the first quarto what say you to this m malone is this too an alteration made at random and suggested by ignorance and caprice  p     when the sun sets the air does drizzle dew the reading of some editions is  the earth does drizzle dew  which our editor says is philosophically true and ought to be preferred  no one i believe ever before heard of the earths drizzleing dew the editor seems to have got his philosophy our of dr hills inspector which to be sure is a very proper school for such a novice that shakspeare however thought it was the air and not the earth that drizzled dew is evident from other passages  so in k john before the dew of evening fall  again in k henry viii  his dews fall every where again in the same play the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her  again in hamlet dews of blood fell  i suppose we are in these places to read earth for heaven and rise or rose instead of fall or fell  hamlet p     lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter some epithet he says has been omitted in consequence of which the meter is defective there is not the smallest ground for such a supposition blazes is a quadrisyllable we may therefore read lends the tongue vows these blaaazes daughter  p     of carnal bloody and unnatural acts a feeble remarker as this herculean commentator elegantly observes asks was the relationship between the usurper and the deceased king a secret confined to horatio no he answers but the murder of hamlet by claudius was a secret which the young prince had imparted to horatio alone and to this it is he principally though covertly alludes  and pray what is all this to the signification of the word carnal but it is natural enough for a feeble remark to produce a pitiful cavil from a halfinformed hypercritic  othello p      must be beleed and calmed the leeside of a ship we are told is that on which the wind blows to lee or to be leed may therefore mean to fall to leeward or to lose the advantage of the wind  alexander the great after listening to the labored oration of a pedantic philosopher on the art of war observed that he had never heard a fool talk so learnedly this compliment cannot possibly be applied to our editor who always talks like himself pretending to know every thing and knowing nothing one would have thought that every fool knew that the lee side of a ship is that  not on which but from which the wind blows the editor has read in the newspapers of a leeshore which would be there rightly interpreted a shore on which the wind blows but it is so termed in reference to the ship as being a shore on its lee side beleed is a word formed like becalmed etc and means as other persons have rightly explained it that cassio intercepted the wind of favor or preferment  p     keep leets and lawdays the leet our learned editor observes according to lambard was a court or jurisdiction above the wapentake or hundred comprehending three or four hundreds the jurisdiction of this court is now in most places merged in that of the county court  there is i am persuaded some misrepresentation as well as some ignorance in this note as to the first charge he may acquit himself of it by producing a passage in which lambard has any such assertion upon the second count ignorance he must be clearly convicted the leet being a criminal court as well as a court of record never had nor possibly could have the slightest connection with the county court which is neither the one nor the other and consequently cannot have merged in it you see therefore m malone that your friend minshew is not always to be depended upon  vol x titus andronicus p     was there none else in rome to make a stale of the words

this edition were made at random and that the editor was entirely ignorant of our authors phraseology and meter how comes i that his arbitrary innovation of no less than three words should have been honored with a place in our authors text because for once he has omitted to perceive that shakspeare used the words none rome and other words of that kind as dissyllables and consequently the meter was to his ear perfect  was none in rome to make a stale  p     even from hyperions rising in the east the first folio says mr steevens reads eptons the quarto epions to which mr malone without blushing adds the correction was made in the second folio most inconsistently deserting the only true ancient authentic copies for the arbitrary emendation of an ignorant editor in an edition of no value whatever  p     it is observable that our equally modest and consistent critic thinks it highly probable that the second scene of the third act of this play was added by our author an opinion for which he has here attempted to ridicule a much more respectable character than himself and one whose judgment seems from this instance at least to have been altogether upon a par with his own see the preface p lix  appendix p     vol iv tw n p    he has observed he says that lover is elsewhere used by our poet as a word of one syllable so in a midsummer nights dream tie up my lovers tongue bring him silently  again in king henry viii is held no great good lover of the archbishops as to the first of these pretended instances it proves nothing being only whatever he may say to the contrary a misprint for loves and every one but this sagacious critic will perceive that the other is to be pronounced like what it is a word of two syllables is held no great good lover of the archbishops  p     h v  p     his nose was as sharp as a pen and a babbled of green fields on this difficult passage our editor had one conjecture which had luckily it seems escaped him when the play was printing but he unfortunately recollected it in time for his appendix it is that the word table is right and the corrupted word and which may have been misprinted for in and thus then the passage will mean  and his note was as sharp as a pen in a table of green fields a pen may have been used for a pinfold and a table for a picture the pointed stakes he adds of which pinfolds are sometimes formed were perhaps in the poets thoughts  risum teneatis if shakspeare had had the pointed stakes of a pinfold in his minds eye he would have mentioned it for though the stake may be sharp the pinfold is not but why waste a moment in the consideration of such miserable nonsense whoever knew the word pen used for pinfold or a pinfold placed amidst a parcel of green fields we have pens for geese indeed and pens for sheep but no one ever before heard of the pen of an ass  p     p     an anonymous writer we are told supposes that by the words  keep close pistol means keep within doors that this was not the meaning it seems is proved decisively by the words of the quarto  that this is not the meaning in the quarto may be proved decisively by the words of that edition but the meaning of the folio is to be ascertained by its own so that the supposition may be right enough  such are the observations which i have had to make upon this most sagacious of editors and his unparalleled edition i must not however be understood to say that i have paid equal attention to all his absurdities his pages abound with examples of profound ignorance idle conjectures crude actions feeble attempts at jocularity slender criticism shallow halfinformed fond skillless tasteless and unfounded remarks no less or possibly much more worthy of contempt and derision than those exposed in the present sheets they can only therefore serve as a hasty or imperfect sketch of what may be done by others if indeed either mr malone or his edition be entitled to any further notice it will be easily seen that in the course of this investigation i have endeavored as much as possible to avoid all controversy and mr malone i am sure has too exalted an opinion of his peculiar merits and too sovereign a contempt for those who dare call them in question to permit that the serenity of his mind should suffer a moments discomposure by the appearance of an insignificant pamphlet well knowing that of such flimzy materials are many of the hypercriticisms composed to which the labors of the editors and commentators on shakspeare have given rise  the end
