an essay on the present epidemic fever  an essay pointing out the cause effects and method of treating the present epidemic fever  in a letter to a young physician  si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti si non his utere mecum sherborne printed for the author in the year       the preface the following attempt to account for the cause of the present epidemic fever which has raged in the western parts of this kingdom this summer was drawn up at the instance of some friends and not with any direct intention to be published but the frequent alarms from all quarters and the terrors some had on account of the supposed danger of receiving infection determined me to lay my thoughts on this important affair before the public  as i really thought peoples fears on this account were groundless and without the least foundation so i endeavored to account for things in regard to the present epidemic in a way familiar and obvious to almost every ones capacity and to common observation  i know it is commonly objected how easy a matter it is to lay down an hypothesis and deduce and spin out consequences to make every phenomenon every symptom of a disease to be accounted for by that hypothesis but the following remarks at least as i imagine are founded upon matters of fact every ones experience the known laws and properties of matter and motion in regard to the solids and fluids of our bodies  if there be any thing in them materially wrong whereby it shall appear to any candid person that i have been mistaken i shall think myself obliged to him if he will take the trouble to give me better information and set me right but as for any little conceited nibler and dealer in small wares who will be snarling and finding fault when he has neither will nor capacity to instruct us better who pretends to have wit when he has scarce common sense or any one who will hint his dislike without offering to give us a better account or who will sententiously condemn because he would be looked upon as shrewd as for those or such like i heartily despise  as for the gentlemen of the profession who are of any standing and such as really deserve that name these remarks are not intended to offer them any thing that is new or uncommon these things must have fallen under their reflection and if there be any thing that may be deemed too presumptive or indecent in regard to the censure past upon the recommendation of the use of vinegar by the college of physicians to our sailors in the west indies i hope it will give them an opportunity of reconsidering that affair since a recommendation of the general use of it cannot but be of ill consequence in a state of the fluids already too much coagulated and stagnant as i think i have proved in the following sheets  in jugularem canis injeci aceti uncias duas cordis contractio paulo frequentior quoad caetera nulla in cane mutatio deinde iterata injectione ad uncias itidem duas respiratio difficilis and laboriosa quae tamen secta arteria iliaca unde exiit plurimum sanguinis nonnihil grumosi ad consuetam normam redacta est injectis tandem ulterius unciis duabus expiravit animal aperta vena iliaca erupit sanguis craffissimus and in massam densatus in venis caeteris uti and arteriis leviter concretus in cord praesertim in sinistro ventriculo aliqua ex part fortiter coagulatur  thus far the late ingenious and learned dr friend vid friends emmenalog   i injected says he into the jugular vein of a dog two ounces of vinegar whereupon the heart was contracted a little more frequently otherwise there was but little alteration in the dog then i injected two ounces more upon which respiration became difficult and troublesome but upon opening the iliac artery from whence was taken a good deal of grumous blood he breathed pretty well again then i injected two ounces more whereupon the animal expired opening the iliac vein the blood was very thick and congealed into a solid mass in the rest of the veins and arteries twas somewhat concreted in the heart especially in the left ventricle the blood was strongly coagulated  here seems to be a pregnant instance of the coagulating nature of vinegar when mixed with blood in the body and notwithstanding any other properties may lavishly have been bestowed upon it and ascribed to it and that by the greatest names such as that of attenuating stimulating abstersive antipestilential preventing and resisting corruption and putrefaction and such like yet as facts and experiments are stubborn and irresistible and will not give way to the greatest authorities and that we have no reason to distrust or call in question the veracity or the skill of the late dr friend in his relation and his making the above experiment so i think we may safely conclude that vinegar is not discriminately on all occasions and in any quantities to be thrown into the body  an essay on the present epidemic fever sir since you were pleased to signify your desire of knowing what my sentiments were concerning the present epidemic fever and what my method of treating it to your candor i submit the following observations  i would remark to you in the first place that notwithstanding the many outcries we have had from all parts of the country of the malignancy and contagious nature of the reigning fever there is nothing very particular or uncommon in it any more than that a particular constitution of air may be productive of a particular disorder and may induce what we call an epidemic disease  but properly speaking we know of but three contagious or infectious diseases viz the plague smallpox and the measles all which as far as we know have africa for their original if at least we except some few which are communicated by contact  if we consider the violent heats of the present summer after an excessive cold spring we need not i think be at a loss in accounting for the present reigning fever since every one knows who is ever so little versed or engaged in observations of this kind what an effect an eastern or northern air has in bracing up our fibers and rendering them rigid and elastic and how on the contrary a southern or southwestern air with excessive hot weather relaxes them the very great change from excessive cold to excessive hot weather and by so suddena transition could not but make a very great alteration in the temper of our bodies hypocrates who lived two thousand years ago and who was the most diligent observer of the causes and effects of diseases either before or after him that lived in the world told us that the change of the seasons was the principal parent of diseases and no wonder since we observe at different times and seasons of the year the difference of the spring weight heat cold and moisture of the air the blood and humors which were before by the elastic force of the solids comminuted and rendered fit for their several secretions are now by their sunk and relaxed state become heavy and too abounding and want that spur which is necessary to carry off the recrements and prevent a tendency to a stagnation and putrefaction the bloods viscidity continually increasing by the heats exhaling the finer and more fluid parts of it and the vis a tergo growing less and less by the relaxation of the fibers obstructions must necessarily arise and consequently there must be brought on an inactive putrid state of the fluids from hence i think may be accounted for the variety of symptoms and the frequency of the present epidemic fever without having recourse to any particular taint or infection communicated and brought to us from the west indies as has been idly suggested  from the same way of reasoning we may account for the sickness and mortality of our men in the west indies having passed from a northern to a southern climate from a cold to a hot air and great moisture occasioned by their heavy rains at particular seasons which contribute exceedingly to the relaxation of the fibers and to the inducing that putrid and accumulated state of the fluids which has been described and if our sailors were to bleed and afterward bath in the sea water which they have such good opportunities for at their arrival in the west indies it would contribute very much to the raising the elastic force of the solids and preventing that viscid stagnating and putrid state of the fluids  here i cannot but take notice that if this way of reasoning be just how injurious the use of vinegar must be in this state of the blood from the known properties of acids coagulating the mass  with humble deference to the judgment of so learned a body as that of the college of physicians i would submit it to them whether they were not a little too hasty in recommending the general use of vinegar to our men in the west indies for though a tendency of bracing the fibers may be urged in its favor yet its coagulating stagnating property must be injurious to a blood already too coagulated and stagnant according to the foregoing theory and now i am upon the story of vinegar i cannot help taking notice of the use has been made of it since its recommendation from the college some are not contented with the great benefit they imagine they receive from its internal use but look upon it as having something of a charm with it to keep off and prevent infection and the unfriendly taint of this epidemic fever and for this reason they sprinkle with vinegar walls floors and bedposts which have contracted this taint and which they have been told was a practice during the raging of the plague in england  whether there be any thing in vinegar opposite to the principles nature or effects of that direful and contagious disease it is not my business at present to enquire into but that it has any good effect either in promoting or especially in curing the present epidemic fever i think is far from being demonstrable  our jayl bridewell and workhouse fevers of late so mortal have not only the peculiar constitution of air already described for their cause but to that we may add confinement want of exercise numbers and nastiness and a want of proper and sufficient nourishment and support through the excessive dearth and scarcity of provisions all which have a prodigious tendency of sinking the solids beneath their natural standard of producing a depauperated viscid stagnating and corrupted state of the blood and juices of the body  if a great mans definition of a fever would in all cases hold good viz aucta circulatio sanguinis perhaps acids and vinegar might be of some service but in the present epidemic fever is most commonly found a depressed pulse occasioned as i imagine by too great a quantity of fluids in proportion to the strength and elasticity of the solids from whence obstructions arise and from whence may be deduced and accounted for that variety of threatening and oftentimes fatal symptoms we meet with in this disease and though no epidemic does or ever did appear exactly in the same shape very far from it on account of different constitutions different formation of parts mens different passions and different ways of living etc yet the same constitution of the air the same properties of the air they in common breathe in and the same properties of the food they in common feed on will produce in some measure the same sort of disease though differing in some perhaps in several circumstances and this is what we call epidemic from  among the people  i shall not undertake to give a very particular account and enumerate all the several symptoms attending this fever since they appear different in different constitutions ages sexes etc give me leave to point out a few and which seem to be the principal ones most commonly we find a low depressed pulse from a plenitude of fluids and want of proper force in the solids no very great thirst or very foul tongue an heavy pain of the head an oppression on the breast the urine pretty high colored though sometimes pale and without a sediment no very great complaint of heat a faintness prostration of strength sweats which give very little relief because not critical a diarrhoea or a delirium i say or a delirium because if a diarrhoea comes on toward the beginning of the fever it prevents most commonly a delirium  these are the principal circumstances which i have observed attending this fever and though a variety of appellations have been given to it but chiefly that of a malignant pestilential which i apprehend those who give it that name have scarce any fixed and determinate meaning and ideas of yet the principal thing to be regarded is what the disease itself is and how it is to be treated and since we have laid it down as a great and prime cause of this fever viz the immoderate heats of the summer setting in after an unseasonable winter and very cold spring so affecting the solids of our bodies whereby they were sunk beneath their natural standard by which means there became an accumulation or too great a load of humors hence the obstructions viscosities stagnations putrefactions and the direful train of symptoms observable in the present reigning disease we need not i think have recourse to though that cannot be demonstrably disproved a particular deleterious quality in the air to account for them since we know very little or nothing about this deleterious quality or can find out any thing specific or alexiterial to oppose and counteract it  the method of cure then must in a great measure depend upon evacuations of some kind or other to remove the accumulation and load which oppress and overbalance the solids to bring down and diminish the quantity of fluids that they may bear a proportion to the relaxed and sunk state of the solids and then by proper gently stimulating and attenuating medicines to raise the force and elasticity of the fibers to such a pitch as shall be sufficient to remove the remaining obstructions temper the viscidity put in action the stagnating and putrid mass and dispose the humors for their several excretions and prevent the like state arising  it frequently happens in this fever that nature sets up a method of cure herself so we should take care how we counteract her for instance if we find a diarrhoea coming on in the beginning which we very often find the patient will need scarce any other evacuation bleeding will be then unnecessary and twould be preposterous to endeavor by astringents to put a stop to it it is an effort of nature to relieve herself the blood throws off its enemy in plentiful streams through the intestinal glands and it has been observed that when it has been stopped by a too officious hand administering astringents or by any other accident fatal have been the consequences the patient has fallen into a delirium thereupon or into some other circumstances by which he has been carried off  during this struggle this plentiful discharge it is needless to remark that nature must be supported from time to time with some generous cardiacs  since this is a method that nature frequently takes to relieve herself we may without absurdity ask why the physician neglects this method and though purging in fevers has been looked upon by some as preposterous and going against the rules both of nature and of art as raising too great a commotion where there was but too great a struggle before yet i think that affair is not carried so far now as it has been formerly and that in most kinds of fevers some or other of them we see it necessary to use this evacuation but nature in this as in all other cases must be attended to her motions narrowly watched and carefully observed that the physician who is her servant does not look one way whilst she points out another  bleeding is another method nature takes to relieve herself as we frequently find by the plentiful haemorages at the nose in this disease opening a vein in that case is advisable because relief will be the sooner obtained and in most of the cases in this fever we find a necessity of this discharge to take off the plethora and bring the blood to an equilibrium with the fibers but it is not the least part of the skill of the physician to determine upon the quantity of blood which is to be taken off and here i apprehend are many mistakes made here is the rock which many pretenders to the art medical split upon and shipwreck the poor patient though they themselves the more is the pity escape here if they draw blood with an undistinguishing hand not discerning what proportion the strength of the fiber bears to the quantity of fluid in the vessels irretrievable mistakes are committed and here i cannot but observe how many ignorant conceited coxcombs ride out under a show of business with their lancet in their pocket and make diseases instead of curing them drawing their weapon upon every occasion right or wrong and upon every complaint ery out egad i must have some of your blood give the poor wretches a disease they never might have had draining the body and the purse torment them in this world and send them perhaps to another before their time to keep themselves the longer from that day of reckoning where they must account for the quantity of innocent blood they have shed in this world  the evacuation by vomiting is often a very necessary one especially where a nausea or an inclination to vomit appears but it is not to be ventured upon at all hazards or with all sorts of patients many circumstances may forbid its use and plainly contraindicate it or it may be necessary previously to lessen the quantity by bleeding after which by the action of vomiting the stomach is not only discharged of its disagreeable load but by the universal shock it gives to the solids it raises their action attenuates the fluids drives through obstructions and sits and prepares the humors in general for their several secretions  another evacuation in the disease under consideration is blistering and which is frequently of very great use not so much on account of the discharge as its property of stimulating and adding to the force of the fibers its tempering the viscidities and separating the preternatural cohaesions it makes a revulsion of the humors from a particular part viz from the brain by which a delirium or perhaps a phrenzy not uncommon in this fever is either prevented or taken off but pointing out geral rules for the use of blisters will not do for particular cases nor is it safe upon all occasions to lay on blisters before evacuations of other kinds have prepared the humors in some measure and paved the way to them and i believe it has often been a case whereby an unskilful management of blisters instead of relieving the brain by the great stimulation upon the solids the blood and humors have been thrown in upon its tender vessels with such a force as they have not been able to bear especially if the blisters have been accompanied as they often i may say almost always are with other violently warm stimulating medicines  the evacuation by sweating i mean that artificially made demands our consideration in the next place its being attempted at all adventures and without good reason is often of the worst consequence to the patient  if the present epidemic fever has for its cause an accumulation of fluids in too great proportion to the lessened elastic force of the solids and those become an heavy sizey putrid and inactive mass and peculiarly viscid through the great exhalations of their siner and more fluid parts by the extreme heats of the season who is there but sees how preposterous it is to be flinging in violently hot sudorifics in this present state of the fluids thus unprepared for them hence petechiae spots and eruptions of several kinds if not before by nature made are now by this method propelld and distributed to the surface from a stagnating putrid mass hence the deliria we frequently meet with among these patients but that such medicines as these may not with safety be made use of in some time or other of the distemper cannot be asserted but it must be at a time that the fluids are properly prepared and fitted for this particular excretion  so much for general visible evacuations it may be expected perhaps i should give a detail of the materials or medicines which are to be made use of in the foregoing described cases but that was not in my intention as thinking the giving recipes and strings of medicines can be of no use to the real physician so it might be of ill consequence and made an ill use of by the pretender i apprehend i have given such hints and made such observations through the course of these papers as to lay down a foundation for a rational method of cure in the present epidemic fever i must observe as i hinted before in the affair of bleeding that a disease is often brought on a patient by an officious ill judging illtiming hand rather than any present one removed in like manner it falls out that by the administration of many medicines improperly and unskilfully applied the disease is made a new one and quite changed from what it was at first and we need not wonder at the ill success that is observed from the variety and great quantities of alexipharmacs as they are termed poured down the throat in an undistinguishing manner perhaps more for the sake of the apothecary than the patient i say we need not be surpised to see the patient yield to the burden and fall a victim to the disease of medicine  since we have pointed out a method of cure and of relieving the patient in this epidemic fever it will not be displeasing i imagine to recommend a method of prevention and as we have proved that health in a great measure depends upon a due balance and just proportion between the solids and fluids of our bodies that is between the force or strength of the former and the quantity or quality of the latter so it is our highest concern and ought to be our principal care to endeavor as near as we can to keep to this standard since the immoderate heats of the present season as we have reason to think have so constituted the air whereby it has a tendency of taking off that equilibrium we have been describing and which is absolutely necessary for health by sinking the solids and increasing the quantity of fluids so it seems to be highly necessary we should lessen this quantity and raise that force and in these circumstances there seems to be no safer or speedier method of prevention than previously to empty the vessels by losing some blood and then to use the cold bath which has unspeakably good effects in giving force to the fibers whereby the blood is enabled to drive through all obstructions to scour the glands to attenuate the viscidities and prevent a stagnating putrid state the cause nay the very essence of the disease itself  gentle exercise such as riding on horseback or in a coach or walking at proper seasons not to sweat much a temperate way of living though not too low but indulging now and then in a glass of some generous liquor all contribute to keep up an equilibrium and prevent the reigning distemper in a word a due and regular use and application of the nonnaturals is the most likely means to preserve health such as calming the passions and affections of the mind proportioning our exercise and use of the air to our strength and the food we take in not watching over much but taking our usual moderate hours of sleep and above all taking care the natural evacuations of every kind be not immoderate and to excess  i am sir yours etc  finis
