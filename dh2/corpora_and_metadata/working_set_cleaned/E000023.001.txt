i birth of mangogul hiaouf zeles tanzai had already reigned long in great chechianea and this voluptuous prince still continued to be the delight of his subjects acajou king of minutia had undergone the fate predicted by his father zulmis was no more the count de —— was still living splendidus angola misapouf and some other potentates of the indies and asia were carried off by sudden deaths the people tired of obeying weak sovereigns had shaken off the yoke of their posterity and the descendants of those unfortunate monarchs rambled unknown or not regarded in the provinces of their empires the grandson of the illustrious scheherazad was the only one who maintaind his throne and he was obeyed in indostan by the name of schach baam at the time when mangogul was born in congo thus it appears that the death of several sovereigns was the mournful epoch of his birth his father erguebzed did not summon the fairies round the cradle of his son because he had observed that most of the princes of his time who had been educated by these female intelligences were no better than fools he contented himself with ordering his nativity to be calculated by one codindo a person fitter for a portrait than an acquaintance codindo was head of the college of soothsayers at banza the ancient capital of the empire erguebzed had settled a large pension on him and had granted to him and his descendants on account of the merit of their great uncle who was an excellent cook a magnificent castle on the frontiers of congo codindo was appointed to observe the flight of birds and the state of the heavens and to make a report thereof at court which office he executed very indifferently if it be true that they had at banza the best theatrical pieces and the worst playhouses in all africa in return they had the most beautiful college in the world and the most wretched predictions codindo informed of the business for which he was summoned to erguebzeds palace set out much embarrassed for the poor man could no more read the stars than you or i he was expected with impatience the principal lords of the court were assembled in the appartment of the great sultana the ladies magnificently dressd stood round the infants cradle the courtiers were hurrying to congratulate with erguebzed on the great things which he was undoubtedly on the point of hearing concerning his son erguebzed was a father and thought it quite natural to discern in the unformd lines of an infant what he was to be in fine codindo arrived draw near says erguebzed to him as soon as heaven had granted me the prince before you i ordered the instant of his birth to be exactly registered and without doubt you have been informed of it speak sincerely to your master and tell him boldly the destiny which heaven has reserved for his son most magnanimous sultan answered codindo the prince born of parents equally illustrious and happy can have no other than a great and fortunate destiny but i should impose on your highness if i plumed myself with a science which i do not possess the stars rise and set for me as for the rest of mankind and i am not more enlightened in futurity by their means than the most ignorant of your subjects but replied the sultan are you not an astrologer magnanimous prince answered codindo i have not that honour what the devil are you then says the old but passionate erguebzed an aruspex by the heavens i did not imagine that you had so much as thought of it believe me seigneur codindo suffer your poultry to feed in quiet and pronounce on the fate of my son as you lately did on the cold of my wifes parrot codindo immediately drew a glass out of his pocket took the infants left ear rubbd his eyes turnd his spectacles again and again peepd at that ear did the like to the right ear and pronounced that the young princes reign would be happy if it proved long i understand you replied erguebzed my son will do the finest things in the world if he has time but zounds what i want to have told me is that he will have time what matter is it to me after he is dead that he would have been the greatest prince upon earth had he lived i have sent for you to cast my sons horoscope and you make me his funeral oration codindo assured the prince that he was sorry he was not more knowing but beseeched his highness to consider that his knowledge was sufficient for the little time he had been a conjurer in effect the moment before what was codindo  chap ii education of mangogul i will pass lightly over mangoguls first years the infancy of princes is the same with that of the rest of mankind with this difference however that princes have the gift of saying a thousand pretty things before they can speak thus before erguebzeds son was full four years old he furnished matter for a volume of mangogulana erguebzed who was a man of sense and was resolved that his sons education should not be so much neglected as his own had been sent betimes for all the great men in congo as painters philosophers poets musicians architects masters of dancing mathematicks history fencing c thanks to the happy dispositions of mangogul and to the constant lessons of his masters he was ignorant in nothing of what a young prince is wont to learn the first fifteen years of his life and at the age of twenty he could eat drink and sleep as completely as any potentate of his age erguebzed whose weight of years began to make him feel the weight of his crown tired with holding the reins of the empire frighted at the disturbances which threatened it full of confidence in the superior qualifications of mangogul and urged by sentiments of religion sure prognostics of the approaching death or imbecility of the great descended from the throne to seat his son thereon and this good prince thought he was under an obligation of expiating by a retirement the crimes of the most just administration of which there is any account in the annals of congo thus it was that in the year of the world   0000000  0000   of the empire of congo   00000 000  began the reign of mangogul the      00 of his race in a direct line frequent conferences with his ministers wars carried on and the management of affairs taught him in a very short time what remained for him to know at getting out of the hands of his pedagogues and that was somewhat however in less than ten years mangogul acquired the reputation of a great man he gained battles stormed towns enlarged his empire quieted his provinces repaired the disorder of his finances restored arts and sciences raised edifices immortalized himself by useful establishments strengthened and corrected the legislative power even founded academies and what his university could never comprehend he executed all these great things without knowing one word of latin mangogul was not less amiable in his seraglio than great on the throne he did not take it into his head to regulate his conduct by the ridiculous customs of his country he broke the gates of the palaces inhabited by his women he drove out those injurious guards of their virtue he prudently confided in themselves for their fidelity the entrance into their appartments was as free for men as into those of the canonesses of flanders and doubtless their behaviour as decent oh how good a sultan he was there never was his equal but in some french romance he was mild affable chearful gallant of a charming figure a lover of pleasures cut out for them and contained more wit and sense in his head than had been in those of all his predecessors put together tis easy to judge that with such uncommon merit a number of the sex aspired to make him their conquest some few succeeded those who missd his heart endeavourd to console themselves with the grandees of the court young mirzoza was of the number of the former i shall not amuse myself with detailing the qualities and charms of mirzoza the work would be without end and i am resolved that this history shall have one  chap iii which may be regarded as the first of this history mirzoza had already fixed mangogul for some years these lovers had said and a thousand times repeated all that a violent passion suggests to persons who have the most wit they were got as far as confidences and they would impute it to themselves as a crime to conceal the most minute circumstance of their lives from each other these singular suppositions if heaven which has placed me on the throne had given me an obscure low birth would you have deignd to descend down to me would mirzoza have crownd me should mirzoza happen to lose the few charms which she is thought to have would mangogul love her still these suppositions i say which exercise the fancy of ingenious lovers which sometimes make tender lovers quarrel and frequently oblige the most sincere lovers to tell untruths were quite worn out between our pair the favorite who possessd in a supreme degree the necessary and uncommon talent of making a good narrative had drained the scandalous history of banza as she had not the best constitution she was not always disposed to receive the sultans caresses nor he always in the humour of offering them in short there were some days in which mangogul and mirzoza had little to say hardly any thing to do and in which without any diminution of love they amused themselves but indifferently those days were rare indeed but there were some and this was one of them the sultan was carelessly stretchd on a sopha opposite to the favorite who was knotting in silence the weather did not permit them to take a walk mangogul would not venture to propose a party of piquet and this posture had lasted near a quarter of an hour when the sultan yawning several times said it must be allowed that geliotta sung like an angel and that your highness is tired to death answered the favorite no madam replied mangogul endeavouring to smother a yawn the minute that one sees you is not that of tiresomeness if that is not a polite compliment tis no bodys fault but your own rejoind mirzoza but you ponder you are absent you yawn prince what ails you i know not said the sultan but i guess continued the favorite i was eighteen when i had the good fortune to please you it is full four years since you began to love me eighteen and four make twentytwo therefore i am now very old mangogul smiled at this calculation but if i am no longer worth any thing for pleasure added mirzoza i will at least demonstrate that i am very good for advice the variety of amusements which attend you has not been able to secure you against disgust you are disgusted prince there is your disease i do not allow that you have hit it off says mangogul but supposing you have do you know a remedy mirzoza answered the sultan after a moments pause that his highness seemd to take so much pleasure at the narratives she made him of the gallantries of the town that she was sorry she had no more to relate to him or that she was not better informed of those of the court that she would have tried that expedient till she thought of somewhat better i think it a good one says mangogul but who knows the stories of all those fools and tho they were known to any who could relate them like you let us learn them however replied mirzoza whosoever it be that tells them i am certain that your highness will gain more by the matter than you will lose by the form i shall join with you if you please in fancying the adventures of the court ladies very diverting says mangogul but tho they were to be a hundred times more so what does that avail if it be impossible to come at them there may be a difficulty in it answers mirzoza but in my opinion that is all the genius cucufa your relation and friend has done greater things why do you not consult him ah joy of my heart cried the sultan you are an admirable creature i make no doubt but the genius will employ all his power in my favour this moment i shut myself up in my closet and invoke him accordingly mangogul arose kissed the favorite on the left eye pursuant to the custom of congo and departed   evocation of the genius  chap iv evocation of the genius the genius cucufa is an old hypochondriac who fearing lest the concerns of the world and dealings with the rest of the genii might prove an obstacle to his salvation took refuge in the void in order to employ himself quite at leisure on the infinite perfections of the great pagoda to pinch scratch and make notches in his flesh to fret himself into madness and starve himself to death in that place he lies on a straw mat his body tuckd up in a sack his flanks squeezd with a cord his arms crossed on his breast and his head sunk into a hood which suffers nothing to issue but the end of his beard he sleeps but one would think him in contemplation all his company is an owl which nods at his feet some rats which gnaw his mat and bats which hover round his head the manner of evoking him is by repeating to the sound of a bell the first verse of the nocturnal office of the bramins then he lifts up his hood rubs his eyes puts on his sandals and sets out figure to yourself an old camaldolian monk carried in the air by two large hornowls which he holds by the legs in this equipage it was that cucufa appeard to the sultan may the blessing of brama be within these walls says he bowing amen answered the prince what do you want my son a very small matter says mangogul to procure me some pleasure at the expence of the court ladies oh my son replied cucufa you have a larger appetite than a whole monastery of bramins what do you pretend to do with this troop of extravagants to learn from themselves their present and past adventures that is all but that is impossible says the genius to have women confess their adventures is a thing that never was nor ever will be yet it must be added the sultan at these words the genius scratching his ear and combing his long beard with his fingers fell to thinking his meditation was short my child said he to mangogul i love you you shall be satisfied instantly he plunged his right hand into a deep pocket made under his armpit on the left side of his frock and together with images blessd beads little leaden pagodas and musty sweatmeats drew out a silver ring which mangogul at first took for one of st huberts rings you see this ring said he to the sultan put it on your finger my child every woman at whom you shall level the stone will relate her intrigues in a plain audible voice do not imagine however that tis by the mouth that they are to speak by what then will they speak says mangogul by the frankest part about them and the best instructed in those things which you desire to know says cucufa by their toys by their toys replies mangogul bursting into laughter that is particular talking toys that is an unheard extravagance my son said the genius i have performed many greater prodigies for your grandfather therefore depend on my word go and may brama bless you make a good use of your secret and remember that there are illplaced curiosities this said the old hypocrite nodded his head pulld his hood over his face took his hornowls by the legs and vanishd in the air  chap v mangoguls dangerous temptation scarcely was mangogul in possession of cucufas mysterious ring when he was tempted to make the first trial of it on the favorite i forgot to mention that besides the vertue of obliging the toys of those women on whom he turnd the stone to speak it had that also of rendering the person invisible who wore it on the little finger thus could mangogul transport himself in the twinkling of an eye to a thousand places where he was not expected and with his own eyes see many things which are frequently transacted without witnesses he had nothing more to do than to put on his ring and say i desire to be in such a place and he was there in an instant behold him then in mirzozas bedchamber mirzoza who gave over all hopes of the sultans company was in bed mangogul approachd her pillow softly and saw by the glimmering light of a night taper that she was asleep good say he she sleeps let us quickly shift the ring on another finger resume our natural shape turn the stone on this fair sleeper and awake her toy a little while—but what stops me—i tremble—is it possible that mirzoza—no it is not possible mirzoza is faithful to me fly from me injurious suspicions i will not i ought not to heed ye he said and put his fingers on the ring but taking them off as hastily as if it had been fire he cried within himself what do i do wretched man i insult cucufas advice for the sake of satisfying a silly curiosity i am going to run the hazard of losing my mistress and my life if her toy should be in the humor of talking extravagantly i should never see her more and i should dye of grief and who knows what a toy may have in its soul mangoguls agitation made him in some measure forget himself he pronounced these last words pretty loud and the favorite awoke ah prince said she less surprized than charmed at his presence you are here why did you not send me notice must you condescend to wait for my awaking mangogul answered the favorite by relating the success of his interview with cucufa shewd her the ring and did not conceal one of its properties from her ah what a diabolical secret has he given you cryd mirzoza but pray prince do you intend to make any use of it how said the sultan do i intend to use it i shall begin by you if you argue with me at these terrible words the favorite turnd pale trembled recoverd herself and conjured the sultan by brama and all the pagodas of the indies and congo not to try the experiment on her of a secret power which indicated a diffidence of her fidelity if i have been constantly honest continued she my toy will not speak a word and you will have done me such an injury as i shall never forgive if it happens to speak i shall lose your esteem and heart and that will make you run distracted hitherto you have in my opinion found your account in our connection why would you run the risk of breaking it off prince believe me follow the advice of the genius he has had great experience and advices of genius are always good to follow this is exactly what i was saying to myself answered mangogul when you awoke and yet if you had slept two minutes longer i cannot answer for what might have happened what would have happened says mirzoza is that my toy would have given you no information and that you would have lost me for ever that may be replied mangogul but now that i have a full view of the danger which i incurred i solemnly swear to you by the eternal pagoda that you shall be excepted from the number of those on whom i shall turn the ring at these words mirzoza brightened up and fell to joking at the expence of the toys which the prince should hereafter interrogate cydalisas toy said she has many stories to tell and if it be as indiscreet as its mistress it will not require much intreaty harias toy is no longer of this world and your highness will obtain no tales from it of fresher date than the days of my grandmother as for that of glauce i believe it is a proper one to be consulted she is a coquet and pretty and for that reason precisely it is replied the sultan that her toy will be mute why then said the sultana apply to that of phedima she is ugly and loves gallantry yes continued the sultan and so ugly that one must be as illnatured as you to accuse her of gallantry phedima is sober tis i who say it and who know something of the matter as sober as you please replied the favorite but she has a sort of grey eyes that speak the contrary her eyes belye her said the sultan warmly you tire my patience with your phedima might not one say that there is no other toy but this to examine but may i presume without offending your highness added mirzoza to ask which is the first you intend to honour with your choice we shall see anon said mangogul in the circle of the manimonbanda the congese name of the great sultana we shall have a good deal of work upon our hands and when we happen to be tired of the toys of my court we may chance make a tour thro banza possibly we may find those of the city women more reasonable than those of dutchesses prince said mirzoza i have some acquaintance with the former and can assure you that they are only more circumspect we shall soon hear from them but i cannot refrain from laughter continued mangogul when i think on the confusion and surprize of these women at the first words of their toys ha ha ha remember delight of my soul that i shall expect you at the great sultanas and that i shall make no use of my ring till you are come prince said mirzoza i rely on the promise you have made me mangogul smiled at her allarm reiterated his promise sealed them with kisses and retired  chap vi first trial of the ring alcina mangogul arrived before her at the great sultanas and found all the ladies very busy at cards he surveyd all those whose reputation was established fully resolved to try his ring on one of them and his only difficulty was in the choice while he was in suspence by whom to begin he spied a young lady of the household of the manimonbanda in a window she was toying with her husband which appeard singular to the sultan inasmuch as they had been married above eight days they had made their appearance in the same box at the opera in the same coach at the bois de boulogne they had finished their visits and the fashion of the times exempted them from loving or even meeting each other if this toy says mangogul is as silly as its mistress we shall have a diverting soliloquy at this instant the favorite appeard welcome said the sultan to her in a whisper i have cast my lead waiting for you and on whom askd mirzoza on that couple which you see sporting in that window answerd mangogul with a wink well set out replied the favorite alcina for that was the young ladys name was sprightly and pretty the sultans court had few women more amiable and not one of a gayer disposition one of the sultans emirs had filled his head with her he was not left in ignorance of what the chronicle had published concerning alcina the report alarmd him but he followed the custom he consulted his mistress about it alcina swore that it was pure calumny invented by some coxcombs who would have been silent if they had had any reason for talking but however that there was no harm done and that he was at full liberty to believe it or not as he thought proper this answer delivered with an air of confidence convinced the amorous emir of his mistresss innocence he closed the affair and assumed the title of alcinas husband with all its prerogatives the sultan levelled his ring at her a loud burst of laughter which seized alcina at some comical saying of her husband was suddenly cut short by the operation of the ring and immediately a murmuring noise was heard under her petticoats well now i am titled truly i am glad ont nothing like having a rank if my first advices had been heeded i should have been provided with something better than an emir but yet an emir is better than nothing at these words all the ladies quitted the game to seek from what quarter the voice issued this movement made a great noise silence says mangogul this deserves attention they obeyed and the toy continued one would be apt to think that a husband is a guest of great importance by the precautions which are taken to receive him what preparatives what profusion of myrtle water another fortnight of this regimen would have demolished me i had disappeard and the emir might have sought lodgings elsewhere or have shipped me off for the island jonquille here my author says that all the ladies grew pale lookd at each other in deep silence and grew vastly serious which he ascribes to their fear lest the conversation should grow warm and become general yet continued alcinas toy in my opinion the emir did neither require nor stand in need of so many formalities but i must still acknowledge the prudence of my mistress she guarded against the worst and i was treated for the great lord as for his little page the toy was on the point of continuing its extravagant harangue when the sultan observing that this strange scene shockd the modest manimonbanda interrupted the orator by turning off the ring the emir had vanishd at the first words of his wifes toy alcina without being disconcerted pretended to take a nap mean while the ladies whispered that she had the vapours yes says a petitmaitre —— vapours ch——y calls them hysterics as much as to say things which come from the lower region for this case he has a divine elixir it is a principle principiating principiated which revives——which——i will propose it to the lady the company laughd at this gibberish and our cynic resumed nothing more true ladies i who speak have used it for a deperdition of substance a deperdition of substance good marquiss said a young person pray what is that madam replied the marquiss it is one of those casual accidents which happen——but every body knows it by this time the pretended drowziness went off alcina sat down to play with as much intrepidity as if her toy either had not spoken a word or had made the finest speech in the world nay she was the only lady that playd without distraction this sitting was worth a considerable sum to her the rest did not know what they were about could not count the dots on the cards forgot their reckonings neglected their good luck dealt wrong and committed a hundred other mistakes of which alcina took the advantage in fine they broke up play and every one withdrew this adventure made great noise not only at court and in town but all over congo epigrams were handed about on it the discourse of alcinas toy was published revised corrected enlarged and commented by the agreeables of the court the emir was lampoond and his wife immortalized she was pointed at in the playhouse and followed in the public walks people flockd about her and she heard them buzzing yes tis she her toy made a discourse two hours long alcina bore her new reputation with admirable tranquillity she listened to these expressions and many more with a serenity which the rest of the women could not shew they were every moment under apprehensions of some indiscretions being committed by their toys but the adventure of the following chapter compleated their confusion as soon as the company had broke up mangogul gave his hand to the favorite and conduced her to her appartment she was far from having that lively chearful air which seldom quitted her she had lost considerably at play and the effect of the dreadful ring had plunged her into a pensiveness out of which she was not yet thoroughly recovered she knew the sultans curiosity and she had not sufficient confidence in the promises of a man less amorous than despotic to be free from uneasiness what ails you my souls delight said mangogul you are pensive i played with bad luck without example answered mirzoza i lost the possibility i had twelve tableaux and i dont think i markd three times that is vexatious replied mangogul but what think you of my secret prince said the favorite i persist in deeming it diabolical doubtless it will amuse you but that amusement will be attended with dismal consequences you are going to spread discord in every family undeceive husbands throw lovers into despair ruin wives dishonour daughters and raise a thousand other hurlyburlys ah prince i conjure you—— by the light said mangogul you moralize like nicole i would be glad to know why the concern for your neighbour touches you so to the quick no no madam i will keep my ring and what do i matter those husbands undeceived those lovers thrown into despair those wives ruined those daughters dishonoured provided i amuse myself am i then a sultan for nothing good night madam we must hope that future scenes will be more comic than the first and that you will take more pleasure in them by degrees i do not believe it sir replied mirzoza and for my part i promise you that you will find pleasant toys nay so pleasant that you cannot refuse giving them audience and what would you do if i sent them to you in quality of ambassadors i will if you desire it spare you the trouble of their harangues but as to the recital of their adventures you shall hear it either from their own mouths or mine tis a determined point and i can abate nothing of it resolve to familiarize yourself with these new speechmakers at these words he embraced her and went into his closet reflecting on the trial he had made and devoutly thanking the genius cucufa  chap vii second trial of the ring the altars the next evening there was to be a private supper in mirzozas appartment the persons invited came early before the prodigy of the preceding day people came by inclination this night they came purely out of politeness all the ladies had an air of constraint and spoke in monosyllables they were upon the watch and expected every moment that some toy would join in conversation notwithstanding their itch of bringing alcinas odd adventure on the carpet none of them dared to undertake opening the topic not that they were restrained by her presence tho included in the supperlist she did not appear it was judged that she had a swimming in her head however whether it was that they became less apprehensive of danger as the whole day long they had heard no body speak but from the mouth or whether they affected to appear courageous the conversation revived the women most suspected composed their countenances put on an air of assurance and mirzoza askd the courtier zegris if he knew any entertaining news madam replied zegris you have been informed of a match between the aga chazour and young siberina i assure you it is broke off upon what account interrupted the favorite on account of a strange voice continued zegris which chazour says he heard at the toilet of his princess since yesterday the sultans court is full of people who go with their ears cockd in hopes of catching i cant say how such declarations as most certainly the persons concerned have no inclination to make them that is silly replied the favorite alcinas misfortune if it be one is far from being averred we have not got to the bottom—— madam interrupted zelmaida i have heard her most distinctly she spoke without opening her mouth the facts were well articulated and it was not very difficult to guess whence this extraordinary sound issued i assure you that i should have died were i in her place died replied zegris folks survive other sorts of accidents how cried zelmaida can there be a more dreadful one than the indiscretion of a toy well there is no medium left one must either renounce gallantry or resolve to pass for a woman of pleasure indeed said mirzoza the option is severe no no madam replied another lady you will see that women will fix their resolution they will allow toys to prate as much as they please and will go their own way without troubling themselves with what the world shall say and after all what does it signify whether it be a womans toy or her lover that proves indiscreet are things less exposed upon a serious consideration of the whole affair continued a third if a womans adventures must be divulged tis better it should happen by her toy than her lover the notion is singular said the favorite and true replied she who had broachd it for pray observe that a lover is generally dissatisfied before he becomes indiscreet and therefore tempted to be revenged by exaggerating every thing whereas a toy talks without passion and adds nothing to the truth for my part said zelmaida i am not of that opinion in this case it is not so much the importance of the depositions as the strength of the evidence that ruins the criminal a lover who by his discourse dishonours the altar on which he has sacrificed is a kind of impious person who deserves no credit but if the altar lifts up its voice what answer can be made that the altar knows not what it says replied the second monima hitherto mute broke silence in order to say in a dragging lazy tone ah let my altar since you call it so speak or be silent i fear nothing from its talk mangogul enterd that very instant and monimas last words did not escape him he levelld his ring at her and her toy was heard to cry out do not believe her she lies her female neighbours gazing at each other askd whose toy it was that made this answer tis not mine said zelmaida nor mine said another nor mine said monima nor mine said the sultan every one and the favorite among the rest persisted in the negative the sultan taking the advantage of this incertainty and addressing the ladies said you have altars then pray how are they feasted as he was speaking he nimbly turnd his ring successively on all the women except mirzoza and every one of their toys answering in its turn these words were heard in different tones i am frequented batterd abandond perfumd fatigud ill servd disgusted c they all spoke their word but so precipitately that no just application could be made their jargon sometimes rumbling sometimes yelping accompanied with loud laughs of mangogul and his courtiers made a noise of a new kind the ladies agreed with a very grave air that it was very diverting how said the sultan sure we are too happy that the toys deign to speak our language and furnish half the expence of the conversation society must be a considerable gainer by this duplication of organs possibly we men shall speak also in our turn by something else besides our mouths who knows what agrees so perfectly well with toys may happen to be destind to make questions and responses to them nevertheless my anatomist is of a different opinion  chap viii third trial of the ring the private supper supper was served up the company sate down at table and at first they diverted themselves at monimas charge all the women unanimously agreed that her toy had spoke first and she must have sunk under this confederacy had not the sultan taken her part i do not pretend said he that monima is less gallant than zelmaida but i believe her toy has more discretion besides when the mouth and toy of a woman contradict each other which to believe sir replied a courtier i know not what toys will say hereafter but hitherto they have explaind themselves on a subject which is very familiar to them as long as they shall have the prudence to speak of nothing but what they understand i shall believe them as so many oracles others said mirzoza of greater authenticity might be consulted pray madam replied mangogul what interest can these have in disguising the truth nothing but a chimæra of honour could be their motive but a toy has none of these chimæras that is not the place of prejudices a chimera of honour said mirzoza prejudices if your highness had been exposed to the same inconveniences with us you would become sensible that whatever touches virtue is far from being chimærical all the ladies encouraged by the sultanas answer insisted that it was superfluous to put them to certain proofs and mangogul that these proofs were generally dangerous at least this conversation ushered in the champagne it moved briskly round they plied it close and it warmed the toys then it was that mangogul had intended to resume his frolicks he turnd his ring on a very gay sprightly young lady who sate pretty near him and directly opposite to her husband and immediately issued from under the table a plaintive noise a weak languishing voice which said oh how i am harrassed i can bear it no longer i am at deaths door how by the pagoda pongo sabiam cried husseim my wifes toy speaks and what can it say we are going to hear answered the sultan——prince you will permit me not to be of the number of its auditors replied husseim for if any thing ridiculous dropd from it do you think——i think you are a fool said the sultan to alarm yourself at the prattle of a toy do we not know a good part of what it can say and may we not guess the rest sit down then and endeavour to divert yourself husseim sat down and his wifes toy began to prate like a magpye shall i eternally have this huge flandrian valanto i have seen some who have made an end but this man——at these words husseim arose in a fury snatchd up a knife sprang to the other side of the table and would have pierced his wifes breast if his neighbours had not prevented him husseim said the sultan you make too much noise the company cannot hear might not one say that your wifes toy is the only one that has not common sense and what would become of these ladies if their husbands were of your humour how you are out of your wits for a pitiful little adventure of one valanto who never made an end return to your seat behave like a man of honour see that you watch yourself and not commit a second failure before a prince who admits you to his pleasures while husseim stifling his rage was leaning on the back of a chair his eyes shut and his hand on his forehead the sultan dexterously levelld his ring and the toy went on valantos young page would suit me pretty well but i know not when he will begin in the mean time till the one begins and the other makes an end i practise patience with the bramin egon he is a frightful figure i must own but his talent is to make an end and begin again oh what a great man a bramin is by the time the toy had got as far as this exclamation husseim blushd to fret for a woman who was so unworthy and fell a laughing with the rest of the company but he kept something in reserve for his spouse the entertainment being over every one went home directly except husseim who conducted his wife into a house of veiled maidens and there shut her up mangogul being informd of her disgrace paid her a visit he found the whole community busy in comforting her but still more in trying to get the secret of her exile from her tis for a mere trifle said she that i am here being last night at supper with the sultan the champagne was whipd about the tokay gallopd people hardly knew what they said when my toy must needs fall to prating i do not remember on what subject it talkd but it made my husband take dudgeon to be sure madam he is in the wrong replied the nuns people ought not to put themselves into such passions for trifles——how your toy has spoke pray does it speak still how charmd we should be to hear it it must certainly express itself with wit and a good grace they were gratified for the sultan turnd his ring on the poor recluse and her toy thankd them for their civilities protesting to them at the same time that how pleased soever it was with their company that of a bramin would suit it better the sultan embraced the opportunity to learn some particulars of the life of these virgins his ring interrogated the toy of a young recluse whose name was cleanthis and the pretended virgintoy confessed two gardeners a bramin and three cavaliers and related how by the assistance of a purging draught and two bleedings she had escaped giving scandal zephirina owned by the organ of her toy that she was indebted to the errandboy of the house for the honourable title of mother but one thing that astonishd the sultan was that tho those sequesterd toys expressed themselves in very indecent terms the virgins to whom they belongd heard them without blushing which made him conjecture that if they failed of the practical part in those retreats they had in return a large share of speculation in order to clear up this point he turnd his ring on a novice between fifteen and sixteen years of age flora said her toy has more than once ogled a young officer thro the grate i am certain that she had an inclination for him her little finger told me so this was a mortifying stroke for flora the ancient ladies condemned her to two months silence and discipline and ordered prayers that the toys of the community might remain mute  chap ix the state of the academy of sciences at banza mangogul had scarcely quitted the recluses among whom i left him when a report was spread thro banza that the virgins of the congregation of bramas coccyx spoke by their toys this report to which husseims violent proceedings had given credit rouzed the curiosity of the learned the phænomenon was thoroughly examined and allowed and the freethinkers began to seek in the properties of matter the reasons of a fact which they had at first deemed impossible the tattle of the toys gave birth to a great number of excellent works and this important subject swelld the collections of the academies with several memoirs which may be esteemed the utmost efforts of human understanding in order to model and perpetuate that of banza invitations with suitable encouragement had been and still continued to be given to all persons of the brightest parts in congo monoémugi beleguanza and the circumjacent kingdoms it took in under different titles all those who had distinguished themselves in natural history natural philosophy mathematicks and the greatest part of those who promised to make a figure in them one time or other this swarm of indefatigable bees labourd incessantly in the research of truth and every year the public reaped the fruits of their labours in a volume full of discoveries it was at that time divided into two factions the one composed of vorticists and the other of attractionists olibrio an able geometrician and great natural philosopher founded the sect of the vorticists circino an able natural philosopher and great geometrician was the first attractionist both olibrio and circino proposed to explain nature olibrios principles have at first sight a certain air of simplicity which seduces in the gross they account for the principal phænomena but they contradict themselves in the detail as for circino he seems to set out upon an absurdity but tis the first step alone that is expensive the minute details which ruin olibrios system establish his he follows a road dark at entrance but which grows more lightsome according as a person advances on the contrary that of olibrio lightsome at entrance grows darker and darker the philosophy of the latter requires less study than understanding one cannot be a disciple of the former without a large share of understanding and study one enters without preparation into olibrios school every body has the key of it that of circino is open to none but geometricians of the first class olibrios vortices are within the reach of all capacities circinos central powers are made for first rate algebraists only wherefore there will always be an hundred vorticists for one attractionist and one attractionist will always be worth an hundred vorticists such was the state of the academy of sciences at banza when it handled the subject of the indiscreet toys this phænomenon was very slippery it dodged the attraction and the subtile matter could not come within reach of it in vain did the president summon all those who had any notions to communicate them a profound silence reigned in the assembly at length persiflo the vorticist who had published treatises on many subjects which he did not understand rose up and said the fact gentlemen might well agree with the system of the world i should suspect that it has in general the same cause with the tides for pray take notice that this day is the equinoctial full moon but before i can depend on my conjecture i must wait to hear what the toys will say next month the company shrugd their shoulders they dared not remonstrate to him that he reasoned like a toy but as he is a man of penetration he perceived in an instant that they thought as much the attractionist reciproco opened and said gentlemen i have tables calculated by a theory on the highth of the tides in every port of the kingdom true it is that observations somewhat bely my calculations but i flatter myself that this small inconvenience will be repaired by the advantage that will result from them if the tattle of toys continues to square with the phænomena of the ebb and flow a third person started up went to the board traced his figure and said let a toy be a b and—— here the ignorance of the translators has deprived us of a demonstration which without doubt the african author had preservd after a blank of about two pages we read reciprocos reasoning was thought demonstrative and it was unanimously agreed from the essays he had given on dialectics that he would be able one day or other to make this deduction women have from time immemorial heard with their ears therefore they ought at this day to speak by their toys doctor orcotomus of the tribe of anatomists spoke next and said gentlemen i am of opinion that it would be properer to drop a phænomenon than to seek its cause in vapory hypotheses for my part i would not have opend my mouth if i had nought but trifling conjectures to offer but i have examined studied meditated i have seen toys in the paroxysm and i am got so far by means of my knowledge of the parts and experience as to be convinced that that which in greek we call delphys has all the properties of the windpipe and that there are some who can speak as well by the toy as by the mouth yes gentlemen the delphys is a string and wind instrument but much more a string than a wind one the outward air which lights on it properly does the office of a bow on the tendinous fibres of the wings which i shall call ribbons or vocal strings the gentle collision of this air and the vocal strings puts them into a trembling motion and it is by their quicker or slower vibrations that they utter different sounds the person modifies these sounds at discretion speaks and even might sing as there are but two ribbons or vocal strings and as they are to the eye of equal length it will doubtless be askd how they suffice to give the multitude of sounds grave and acute strong and weak of which the human voice is capable i answer in pursuing the comparison of this organ with musical instruments that their lengthening and shortening are sufficient to produce these effects that these parts are capable of distention and contraction is needless to be demonstrated in an assembly of literati of your rank but that in consequence of this distention and contraction the delphys can utter sounds more or less acute in a word all the inflexions of the voice and modulation of singing is a fact which i flatter myself i shall put out of doubt my appeal is to experiments yes gentlemen i engage to make both a delphys and a toy reason speak nay and sing too before ye thus harangued orcotomus promising to himself nothing less than to raise the toys to the level of the windpipes of one of his learned brethren whose success jealousy had attackd in vain  chap x less learned and less tedious than the preceding continuation of the academical sitting by the difficulties started against orcotomus before he could make his experiments it appeared that his notions were judged to have less of solidity than ingenuity if toys have the faculty of speech naturally say they why have they not made use of it till now if it was an effect of the goodness of brama who has been pleased to endow women with so strong a desire of talking to double the organs of speech in them it is very strange that they have so long been ignorant of or at least neglected this valuable gift of nature why has not the same toy spoke more than once why has none of them spoke of aught but the same subject by what mechanism does it fall out that one of the mouths is forcibly kept shut while the other speaks moreover added they if we judge of the prattle of toys by the circumstances in which most of them have spoken and by the things they have told there is all the reason in the world to believe it involuntary and that those parts would continue mute if it had been in the power of their possessors to impose silence on them orcotomus arose to answer these objections and insisted that toys talkd in all ages but so low that what they said was hardly heard even by those to whom they belonged that it is not surprizing that they have raised their voice in our days when the freedom of conversation is carried so high that one may without impudence and indiscretion converse on those things which are the most familiar to them that if they have spoke audibly but once we are not to infer that that will be the only time that there is a vast difference between being mute and keeping silence that if they have talkd but on one and the same subject only probably the reason is that it is the only one of which they have ideas that those who have not spoke as yet will speak that if they remain silent it is because they have nothing to say or that they are ill made or want ideas and terms in a word continued he to pretend that it was an effect of the goodness of brama to grant to women the means of gratifying their strong desire of talking by multiplying in them the organs of speech is to grant that if this benefaction dragd any inconveniences after it it was an effect of his wisdom to prevent them and this he has done by compelling one of the mouths to keep silence while the other speaks it is already but too inconvenient for us that women change their mind from one instant to another what then would it have been if brama had left them the power of being of two contradictory sentiments at the same time further the gift of speech has been given purely in order to be understood but the women who find it a difficult talk to understand one another with a single mouth each how could they possibly do it if they spoke with two at a time thus orcotomus answered several things and thought he had given satisfactory solutions to all difficulties but he was mistaken new doubts were raised and he was on the point of sinking under them when cimonazes came to his assistance then the dispute became tumultuous they strayd wide of the question they bewilderd themselves they returnd they bewilderd themselves a second time they grew angry they brawled from brawling they passd to injurious words and the academical sitting ended  chap xi fourth trial of the ring the echo while the prattle of the toys employed the academy in other companies it became the news of the day and the subject of the morrow and of several succeeding days it was an inexhaustible text true facts were blended with false every thing went down the prodigy had removed all incredulity in conversation people lived on it upwards of six months the sultan had made but three trials of his ring and yet in a circle of ladies who were allowed a stool at the manimonbandas one of them related a discourse held by the toy of a presidents lady next that of a marchioness then she disclosed the pious secrets of a devotee in fine those of several women who were not there and god knows the stories that were fatherd on their toys nor was there any parcimony of smutty tales from facts they came to reflections i must confess says one of those ladies that this witchcraft for it is a spell cast on toys keeps us in a cruel state how to be eternally under apprehensions of hearing an impertinent voice issuing from ones self but madam answered another this fright astonishes us with regard to you when a toy has nothing ridiculous to tell what does it signify whether it be silent or speak it signifies so much replied the first that i would freely give half my jewels to be assured that mine will never speak surely replied the second there must be substantial reasons for keeping measures with people to purchase their discretion at so high a price i have not better reasons than another said cephisa and yet i do not eat my words twenty thousand crowns is not too large a sum to buy tranquillity for i will frankly own that i have not more confidence in my toy than in my mouth and many silly things have slipt from me in my life i hear every day so many incredible adventures unveiled attested detailed by toys that even retrenching three fourths the remaining part is sufficient to destroy a reputation if mine should prove but half so great a lyer as all those i should be ruined was it not enough then that our conduct was in the power of our toys without our reputation being dependent on their discourses for my part answered ismene smartly without entering into endless arguments i allow things to go their own way if it be brama that has given the faculty of speech to toys as my bramin has convinced me he will not suffer them to lye it would be impious to assert the contrary wherefore my toy may talk as often and much as it will but after all what will it say then was heard a hollow voice which seemed to come out of the ground and answered by way of echo many things ismene not imagining whence the answer proceeded flew into a passion attackd her neighbours and increased the diversion of the company the sultan charmed with her mistake quitted his minister with whom he was in conference in a corner went to her and said i am afraid madam you have heretofore admitted some one of these ladies into your confidence and that their toys are so malicious as to recollect histories which your own might have forgot at the same time by moving his ring up and down with dexterity mangogul caused a very singular dialogue between the lady and her toy ismene who had always conducted her little affairs well enough and had never had a confidante answerd the sultan that all the art of calumniators would be ineffectual perhaps answerd the unknown voice how perhaps replyd ismene piqued at this injurious doubt what have i to fear from them every thing if they knew as much as i and what do you know many things i tell you many things that says much but means nothing can you tell any particulars without doubt and of what nature have i been really in love no have i had intrigues adventures exactly and with whom pray with petitsmaitres military men senators no comedians no you shall see it was with my pages my footmen my confessor or my husbands chaplain no mr impostor you are at your wits end not quite yet i can see no other person with whom one can possibly have adventures was it before was it after my marriage answer me then impertinent ah madam spare invectives if you please compel not the best of your friends to take some disagreeable steps speak my dear tell tell all i value your services as little as i fear your indiscretion explain your self i not only give you full permission but even dare you to it to what do you reduce me ismene said the toy breathing a deep sigh to render justice to vertue well then virtuous ismene have you quite forgot young osmin the sangiac zegris your dancing master alaziel your music master almoura ah what horrid calumnies cried ismene i had a mother who was too vigilant to expose me to such irregularities and my husband were he here would testify that he found me just such as he could wish very true replied the toy thanks to the secret of your intimate friend alcina this is so extravagantly and so grossly ridiculous said ismene that it deserves no refutation i cannot say continued she which of these ladies toys it is that pretends to be so knowing in my affairs but it has related things of which my own does not know a syllable madam answered cephisa i can assure you that mine has gone no farther than giving ear the rest said as much and they sate down to play without precisely knowing the interlocutor of the conversation above related  chap xii fifth trial of the ring play most of the ladies who made the party with the manimonbanda playd with great eagerness and it was not necessary to have mangoguls sagacity to perceive it the passion of gaming is one of those that puts on the least disguise it shews itself whether in winning or losing by strong symptoms but whence proceeds this fury said he within himself how can the ladies bear to pass whole nights round a pharaoh table to tremble in expectation of an ace or a seven this phrensy injures their health and beauty when they have any without reckoning the disorders into which i am sure it precipitates them i have a great desire said he to mirzoza in the ear to execute here a thought just come into my head and what is this fine thought which you meditate said the favorite it is answered mangogul to turn my ring on the most unbridled of these brelandiers to interrogate her toy and to transmit by that organ a good advice to all those weak husbands who allow their wives to stake the honour and fortune of their house on a card or a dye i like this notion mightily replied mirzoza but know prince that the manimonbanda has just now sworn by her pagodas that she would keep no more drawingroom nights if ever she found herself again exposed to the impudence of engastrimuthes what have you said my souls delight interrupted the sultan i have answered the favorite made use of the name which the modest manimonbanda gives to all those whose toys have the faculty of speech it is of the invention of her stupid bramin who values himself upon knowing the greek and being ignorant of the congese language replied the sultan however with the manimonbandas leave and that of her chaplain too i would desire to question manillas toy and it would be proper to make the interrogatories here for the edification of the neighbours prince said mirzoza if you take my word you will spare the manimonbanda the uneasiness this proceeding must give her which you may do without balking your own curiosity or mine why do you not go to manillas house i will go since you advise said mangogul but at what hour said the sultana about midnight answered the sultan at midnight she is at play said the favorite i will put off my visit then till two in the morning replied mangogul prince you dont consider rejoined the favorite tis the most pleasant hour of the four and twenty for female gamesters if your highness will be led by me you will take manilla in her first sleep between seven and eight mangogul followed mirzozas advice and visited manilla about seven her women were going to put her to bed he judged by the sadness predominant in her countenance that she had playd with bad luck she walkd to and fro stoppd lifted her eyes to heaven stampd with her foot coverd her eyes with her hands and muttered somewhat which the sultan could not understand her women who were undressing her followed all these motions in panicks and if they at length compassed getting her into bed it was not done without receiving harsh language and something worse now manilla is in bed having made no other night prayer but some curses against a damned ace which came seven times successively to her loss scarcely had she closed her eyes when mangogul levelld his ring at her instantly her toy exclaimed in a sorrowful tone now i am repiqued and capotted the sultan smiled to hear that every thing about manilla even to her toy spoke gaming no continued the toy i will never play against abidul he knows nothing but tricking speak to me no more of dares with him one runs the risq of some unlucky hits ismal is a pretty fair player but every body has him not that would mazulim was a treasure before he fell into the hands of crissa i dont know a more whimsical player than zulmis rica is less so but the poor lad is run dry what can one do with lazuli the prettiest woman of banza could not make him play high what a piddling player mollius is in truth desolation has spread among the gamesters and eer long we shall not know with whom to make a party after this jeremiad the toy fell to relating uncommon strokes of which it had been a witness and excessively extolld the constancy and resources of its mistress in bad luck were it not for me it said manilla would have ruind herself twenty times over all the sultans treasures would not have discharged the debts that i have paid in one match at breland she lost to a farmer of the revenue and an abbé above ten thousand ducats she had nothing left but her jewels but her husband had so lately redeemd them that she dared not to venture them nevertheless she took the cards and had one of those seducing hands which fortune sends when she is on the point of cutting your throat they urged her to speak manilla lookd at her cards put her hand into her purse whence she was sure to pull nothing returnd to her cards examined them again but without determining does madam stand it at last said the farmer yes i stake said she—i stake—i stake my toy for what value replied turcares for a hundred ducats said manilla the abbé withdrew esteeming the toy too high rated turcares declared at it manilla lost and paid the silly vanity of possessing a titled toy got the better of turcares he offered to supply my mistress with playmoney on condition that i should be subservient to his pleasures the bargain was struck in a moment but as manilla playd high and the farmer was not inexhaustible we soon saw the bottom of his coffers my mistress had appointed a most brilliant party at pharaoh all her acquaintance were invited they were to punt with nothing under ducats we depended on the purse of turcares but the morning of this great day the rascal wrote us word that he had not a penny and left us in the utmost consternation however we must extricate ourselves and there was not a moment to be lost we pitchd on an old chief of the bramins to whom we sold at a dear rate some complaisances which he had sollicited a long time this sitting cost him double the income of his ecclesiastical preferment turcares returned notwithstanding in a few days he said he was excessively concerned that madam had taken him at a nonplus he still reckond on her goodness indeed you reckon ill my dear replied manilla i cannot with decency receive you more when you were in a condition to lend the world knew why i admitted you but now that you are good for nothing you would blast my honour turcares was piqued at this discourse and so was i for he was perhaps the best lad in banza he waved his usual politeness and gave manilla to understand that she cost him more than three opera girls who would have amused him better alas cried he most mournfully why did i not stick to my little milliner she loved me to folly i made her so happy with a silk gown——manilla who did not relish comparisons interrupted him in a tone eno to make one tremble and bade him begone in an instant turcares knew her and chose rather to return peaceably down stairs than to leap thro the window after that manilla borrowed of another bramin who came said she to administer comfort in her afflictions the holy man succeeded the farmer of the revenue and we reimbursed him his comforts in the same coin she lost me several times more and tis well known that playdebts are the only ones that are paid among the beau monde if manilla happens to play with good luck she is the most regular woman in congo excepting her play she takes surprising care of her conduct she is never heard to swear an oath she entertains well she pays her mercer and other tradesmen is liberal to her servants redeems her nicknacks sometimes and caresses her lap dog and her husband but thirty times a month she risks these happy dispositions and her money on an ace of spades such is the life she leads and will lead and god knows how many times yet i shall be pawnd here the toy ceased and mangogul went to take repose he was awakend at five in the afternoon and went to the opera according to a promise made to the favorite  chap xiii of the opera at banza sixth trial of the ring of all the public diversions of banza none supported itself but the opera utmiutsol and utremifasolasiututut two celebrated musicians one of whom was growing old and the other was but just newfledged alternately occupied the lyric scene each of these two original authors had his partisans the ignorant and the greybearded dotards stood up for utmiutsol the smart young fellows and the virtuosi were for utremifasolasiututut and the people of taste as well young as old held them both in high esteem utremifasolasiututut said the latter is excellent when he is good but he sleeps at times and pray to whom does not that happen utmiutsol holds up better and is more uniform he is full of beauties yet he has not one of which there are not examples to be found and even more striking in his rival in whom there are strokes to be observed which are entirely his own and are not to be met with any where but in his works old utmiutsol is simple natural smooth sometimes too smooth and that is his fault young utremifasolasiututut is singular brilliant composed learned sometimes too learned but perhaps that is his hearers fault the one has but one opening beautiful indeed but repeated at the head of all his pieces the other has made as many openings as pieces and they all pass for masterpieces nature guided utmiutsol in the ways of melody study and experience discovered the sources of harmony to utremifasolasiututut who ever knew how to declaim and who will ever speak a part like the old man who will compose light catches voluptuous airs and symphonies in character like the young one utmiutsol is the only person who understood dialogue before utremifasolasiututut no body distinguished the delicate touches which separate the tender from the voluptuous the voluptuous from the passionate the passionate from the lascivious nay some partisans of the latter pretend that if utmiutsols dialogue is superior to his this is not so much owing to the inequality of their talents as to the difference of the poets whom they made use of read read cried they the scene of dardanus and you will be convinced that if we give good words to utremifasolasiututut utmiutsols charming scenes will be revived however that be in my time the whole town flockd to the tragedies of the latter and people stifled one another at the interludes of the former they were just then exhibiting in banza an excellent piece of utremifasolasiututut which would never have been represented but in nightcaps had not the favorite sultana had the curiosity to see it and besides the periodical indisposition of toys favored the jealousy of the fiddles and made the principal actress flinch she who supplied her place had not so good a voice but as she made amends by her manner of acting nothing hindered the sultan and the favorite from honouring the piece with their presence mirzoza was already come mangogul comes the curtain is raised they begin every thing went on marvellously well miss chevalier had effaced the memory of miss le maure and they were at the fourth act when the sultan bethought himself in the middle of a chorus which he thought lasted too long and had already cost the favorite two yawns to point his ring on all the singers never was there seen on the stage so odd and comical a sight thirty women were struck dumb on a sudden their mouths were wide open and they kept the same theatrical attitudes they held before and at the same time their toys made their throats sore with the violence of singing this a pontneuf that a vaudeville polisson another a very indecent parody and all of them extravagances relative to their characters on one hand was heard oh vraiment ma comere oui on the other quoi douze fois here qui me baise estce blaise there rien pere cyprien ne vous retient in fine they all wound themselves up into a strain so high so rude and so mad that they formed the most extravagant brawling ridiculous choir that had been heard before and since that of——no——d——on—— here the manuscript was wormeaten all this while the orchestra went on and the loud laughs of the pit and boxes joined to the sound of the instruments and the singing of the toys compleated the cacophony some of the actresses fearing lest their toys tired with quavering impertinences might resolve to speak them out ran behind the scenes but they escaped with the fright only mangogul being perswaded that the public would learn nothing new turnd off his ring in an instant all the toys were silent the bursts of laughter ceased the audience grew calm the play was resumed and finished peaceably the curtain dropd the sultana and sultan went off and the toys of our actresses went to their several appointments where they were to have a different employment from singing this affair made a great noise the men laughd the women were alarmed the bonzas were scandalized the academicians rackd their brains about it but what did orcotomus say orcotomus triumphd he had hinted in one of his memoirs that the toys would infallibly sing they had sung accordingly and this phænomenon which disconcerted his brethren was to him a new ray of light and compleated the confirmation of his system  chap xiv orcotomuss experiments it was on the fifteenth of the moon of —— that orcotomus had read his memoir to the academy and communicated his thoughts on the tattle of the toys as he then did with the greatest assurance promise to produce infallible experiments which he had repeated several times and always with success the majority of people was struck with his doctrine for some time the public preserved the favorable impressions they had received and for full six weeks orcotomus passd for having made considerable discoveries nothing was wanting to complete his triumph but performing before the academy the famous experiments which he had preached so loudly the assembly that met on this occasion was extremely brilliant the ministers of state graced the meeting the sultan himself did not disdain to be there but invisible as mangogul was a great monologue maker and the futility of the conversations of his time had tainted him with the habitude of soliloquy either orcotomus said he must be an arrant quack or the genius my protector a great fool if the academician who certainly is not a conjurer can restore speech to dead toys the genius who protects me was in the wrong to make a compact and sell his soul to the devil for the sake of communicating it to toys full of life mangogul was puzzling himself with such reflections when he found himself in the middle of his academy orcotomus had for spectators as appears all those in banza who were knowing in the subject of toys in order to be satisfied with his audience all he wanted was to give them satisfaction but the issue of his experiments proved very unhappy orcotomus took up a toy put his mouth to it blew into it till he was out of breath quieted it returned tried another for he had brought a variety of them with him of all ages sizes conditions and colours but in vain did he blow nothing was heard but inarticulate sounds vastly different from what he had promised then ran a buzzing murmur thro the company which disconcerted him for a moment but he recovered himself and alledged that such experiments were not easy to be made before so great a number of people and he was right mangogul got up in wrath went away and in the twinkling of an eye was in the favorite sultanas appartment well prince said she upon seeing him who has won the day you or orcotomus for his toys have performed wonders to be sure the sultan took some turns about the room without a word of answer but resumed the favorite your highness seems dissatisfied oh madam the impudence of that orcotomus is not to be matchd pray do not so much as mention him from this moment—what will you say o future generations when you shall be informed that the great mangogul allowed a hundred thousand crowns in yearly pensions to such fellows while gallant officers who with their blood had watered the laurels that surround his brow were reduced to twenty pound a year——by jove the thought distracts me i shall be out of humor this month to come here mangogul broke off and continued to walk about the room he hung down his head marched to and fro stopd and now and then stampd the floor with his foot he sat down a moment rose up in a hurry took his leave of mirzoza forgot to kiss her and retird to his own appartment the african author who has immortalized himself by the history of the high and marvellous exploits of erguebzed and mangogul continues in these words by mangoguls ill humor it was thought that he was on the point of banishing all the learned out of his dominions far from it the next day he arose in a gay mood performed his exercises at the ridinghouse in the morning in the evening suppd with mirzoza and some favorites under a magnificent tent in the gardens of the seraglio and never appeared more disengaged from affairs of state the dissatisfied and the disaffected of congo and the newsmongers of banza did not fail to spread their reports of this conduct for what do not people of this stamp find fault with is this said they in the public walks and coffeehouses is this governing a state to spend the day in tilting and the night at table well if i was sultan cried a little senator ruined by gaming parted from his wife and whose children had the worst of education if i was sultan i would make congo a flourishing empire i would be the terror of my enemies and the darling of my subjects within six months i would reestablish the police the laws the army and the navy in their full vigour i would have a hundred ships of the line our heaths should soon be grubd up and our highways repaird i would abolish the taxes or at least reduce them to one half as for pensions gentlemen of sublime wit by my faith ye should but just taste them with the tip of your tongues good officers pongo sabiam good officers old soldiers magistrates like us who devote our labours and night studies to dealing out justice to the people these are the men on whom i would shed my bounty gentlemen said an old toothless politician with greasy flat hair a coat worn out at elbows and ragged ruffles have ye quite forgot our great emperor abdelmalek of the dynasty of the abyssinians who reigned two thousand three hundred and eighty five years ago have ye forgot how he caused two astronomers to be impaled for an error of three minutes in their prediction of an eclipse and his first physician and surgeon to be dissected alive for having ordered him a dose of manna at an improper time moreover i ask you continued another what are those idle bramins good for that vermin who suck our blood and grow fat on it would not their immense overflowing riches better become honest folks like us from another quarter was heard forty years ago were the new cookery and the liquors of lorraine so much as known our rulers are plungd deep into luxury which threatens approaching destruction to the empire a necessary consequence of the contempt of the pagodas and dissolution of morals at the time when people eat but coarse meats and drank but sherbet at kanaglous table what regard would be paid to the cutpaper ornaments to martins varnishes and to rameaus music the opera girls were not more cruel then than at present and were to be had much cheaper the prince you see spoils many good things but if i was sultan—— if thou wert sultan answered in wrath an old officer who had escaped the dangers of the battle of fontenoy and had lost an arm close to his prince in the fight of laufelt thou wouldst commit greater impertinences than thou now dealst out eh friend thou canst not govern thy tongue and thou wouldst willingly rule an empire thou hast not sense to manage thy family and thou pretendst to guide a state respect the powers of the earth and thank the gods for having given thee birth in the empire and in the reign of a prince whose prudence instructs his ministers and whose soldiery admire his valor who has made himself dreaded by his enemies and beloved by his people and whose only fault is the lenity with which persons of thy stamp are treated under his government  chap xv the bramins after the learned had spent themselves on the toys the bramins took possession of them religion laid claim to their chitchat as a subject that came within its jurisdiction and its ministers pretended that the hand of brama manifested itself in that work there was held a general assembly of pontiffs and a resolution was taken to employ the best pens to prove in form that the thing was supernatural and that till their works could be published it should be defended by way of theses in the schools in private conversations in the direction of consciences and in public harangues now altho they unanimously agreed that the thing was supernatural yet as the people of congo admitted two principles and professed a sort of manicheism they were divided in opinion to which of these two principles the chitchat of the toys ought to be attributed those who had seldom or never been out of their cells and had turned over nothing but their books ascribed the prodigy to brama there is none but he said they that can interrupt the course of nature and time will shew that in all this he has most profound views those on the contrary who frequented the toilets and were oftner surprized at bedsides than in their closets fearing lest some indiscreet toy or other might unveil their hypocrisy laid their prattle to the charge of cadabra a mischiefmaking deity and a sworn enemy to brama and his servants this latter system was exposed to terrible objections and had not so direct a tendency towards the reformation of morals nay its defenders did not impose on themselves about it but the business was to screen themselves and in order to compass that religion had not a single minister who would not have sacrificed the pagodas and their altars a hundred times over mangogul and mirzoza assisted regularly at the religious service of brama and the whole empire was informed thereof by the newspapers on a certain day appointed for celebrating one of the principal solemnities in the great mosq they were present the bramin whose turn it was to explain the law mounted the rostrum pourd forth a volley of affected phrases and fulsome compliments on the sultan and his favorite and made an eloquent peroration on the manner of sitting orthodoxly in company he had already demonstrated the necessity thereof by numberless authorities when being instantaneously seized with a fit of sacred enthusiasm he spoke this declamation which had the greater effect as it came in quite unexpected what do i hear in all assemblies a confused murmur an unheard noise strikes my ears all things are turnd topsyturvy and the faculty of speech which the goodness of brama had hitherto appropriated to the tongue is now by an effect of his vengeance transported to other organs and what organs you know gentlemen o ungrateful people was there a necessity for a new prodigy to rouze ye from your lethargy and had not your crimes witnesses enough but their principal instruments must raise their voice doubtless their measure is filled up since the wrath of heaven has sought new chastisements in vain did you envelop yourself in darkness in vain did you choose mute accomplices do you not hear them at present they have given depositions against ye from every quarter and revealed your baseness to the universe o thou who governest by thy wisdom o brama just are thy judgments thy law condemns theft perjury lying and adultery it proscribes the blackness of calumny the intrigues of ambition the fury of hatred and the artifices of insincerity thy faithful ministers have not ceased declaring these truths to thy children and threatening them with the chastisements which thou in thy just anger reservedst for prevaricators but in vain the fools have delivered themselves up to the tide of their passions they followed the torrent they have despised our admonitions they have laughed at our threats they have regarded our anathemas as empty noise their vices are accumulated strengthend multiplied the voice of their impiety has ascended even to thy throne and we have not been able to prevent the tremendous scourge with which thou hast smote them after having long implored thy mercy let us now extoll thy justice overwhelmed by thy strokes doubtless they will return to thee and acknowledge the hand which is laid heavy on them but o prodigy of hardheartedness o excess of blindness they have imputed the effect of thy power to the blind mechanism of nature they have said in their hearts brama is not all the properties of matter are not known to us and the new proof of its existence is but a proof of the ignorance and credulity of those who object it to us on this foundation they have raised systems invented hypotheses tried experiments but from the highth of his eternal habitation brama has laughd at their vain projects he has confounded audacious knowledge and the toys have broke as glass the impotent obstacles opposed to their loquacity wherefore let those vainglorious worms confess the weakness of their reason and the vanity of their efforts let them cease to deny the existence of brama or to prescribe limits to his power brama is he is almighty and he does not shew himself to us more visibly in his dreadful scourges than in his ineffable favours but who has drawn down these scourges on this wretched country is it not thy injustice greedy incredulous man thy gallantries and silly amours worldly immodest woman thy excesses and shameful debaucheries infamous man of pleasure thy hardheartedness for our monasteries miser thy injustice corrupt magistrate thy usuries insatiable moneydealer thy effeminacy and irreligion impious and sycophant courtier and you on whom this scourge is particularly fallen women and maidens plunged into licentiousness tho we renouncing the duties of our calling should keep profound silence with regard to your irregularities you carry about you a more importunate voice than ours it accompanies you and will every where rebuke you for your impure desires your equivocal connections your criminal conversations such excessive care to please so many artifices to engage so much address to fix and the impetuosity of your transports and the fury of your jealousy why then do you delay to shake off the yoke of cadabra and return under the mild laws of brama but let us return to our subject well then i was saying that worldlings sit down heretically and that for nine reasons the first c this discourse made very different impressions mangogul and the sultana who were the only persons that knew the secret of the ring were convinced that the bramin had as happily hit off the tattle of toys by the assistance of religion as orcotomus by the light of reason the court ladies and petitsmaitres declared the sermon seditious and the preacher a visionary the rest of the audience esteemd him a prophet shed tears fell to prayers and even flagellations and did not change their courses of life the noise of this sermon spread to the very coffeehouses a wit pronounced in a decisive tone that the bramin had but very superficially handled the subject and that his discourse was but a cold insipid declamation but in the opinion of the devout women and the enlightened it was the most solid piece of eloquence that had been delivered in the temples these hundred years and in mine both the wit and the devout women were in the right  chap xvi the muzzles while the bramins were making brama speak airing their pagodas by processions and exhorting the people to repentance others were thinking how to reap benefit by the prattle of toys great cities swarm with persons whom misery renders industrious—they neither rob nor pick pockets but they are to pickpockets what pickpockets are to gamblers they know every thing they do every thing they go up and down they insinuate themselves they are found at court in the city at westminster hall at church at the play at ladies toilets in coffeehouses at balls operas and in academies they are any thing that you would have them be do you sollicit a pension they have the ministers ear have you a lawsuit they will sollicite for you do you love gaming they will make a party with you good chear they keep a good kitchen women they will introduce you to amina or acaris from which of the two would you please to purchase the distemper take your choice they will undertake your cure their chief occupation is to find the ridicules of private persons and to make advantage of the follies of the public from them it is that papers are distributed in the streets at the gates of temples at the playhouse doors and other public places by which you are advertised gratis that such an one living at the louvre st johns the temple or the abby at such a sign dupes mankind at home from nine in the morning to noon and abroad the rest of the day scarce had the toys began to speak when one of these sharpers filld the houses of banza with a printed bill of this form and tenor——advertisement to the ladies and underneath in small italic by permission of my lord the great seneschal and with the approbation of the gentlemen of the royal academy of sciences and lower down the sieur eolipila of the royal academy of banza member of the royal society of monoémugi of the imperial academy of biafara of the academy of the curious of loango of the society of camur in monomotapa of the institute of ereeco and of the royal academies of beleguanza and angola who has for many years given courses of baubles with the applause of the court the town and the province has in favour of the fair sex invented muzzles or portable gags which deprive toys of the use of speech without obstructing their natural functions they are neat and convenient he has some of all sizes of all prices and for all ages and he has had the honour to serve persons of the highest distinction with them there is nothing like being a member of a body of men be a work ever so ridiculous it is puffd into success thus it was that eolipilas invention gaind ground people flockd to his house the gay ladies went thither in their own equipages prudent women in hackneycoaches the devouts sent their confessors or footmen and nuns their doorkeepers every body must have a muzzle so that not one from the dutchess down to the coblers joan but had one either for the fashion or for reasons the bramins who had declared the prattle of toys to be a divine punishment and flatterd themselves with a reformation of manners and other advantages from it could not without horror see a machine which eluded the vengeance of heaven and their hopes scarcely had they come down from their pulpits but they mount again thunder roar make the oracles to speak and pronounce that a muzzle is an infernal machine and that there is no salvation for those who shall use them carnal women quit your muzzles submit cried they to the will of brama permit the voice of your toys to awaken that of your consciences and blush not to acknowledge crimes which you have not been ashamed to commit but their exclamations were of little avail the same fate attended muzzles that had formerly attended the gowns without sleeves the preachers were left to catch cold in the temples all the women took gags and quitted them not either till they found them useless or were tired of them  chap xvii the two devouts for some days past the sultan left the toys at rest important affairs on which he was busy suspended the effects of his ring in this interval it was that two women of banza made diversion for the whole town they were professed devouts they had managed their intrigues with all possible discretion and were in full enjoyment of a reputation which even the malice of those of their own class paid respect to in the mosques nothing was talkd of but their virtue mothers proposed them as patterns to their daughters and husbands to their wives the principal maxim of both was that scandal is the greatest of all sins this conformity of sentiments but above all the difficulty of edifying a clearsighted and crafty neighbour at an easy expence had got the better of the difference of their tempers and they were very good friends zelida received sophias bramin and it was at sophias house that zelida conferd with her director and by a little selfexamination the one could hardly be ignorant of what concerned the others toy but the whimsical indiscretion of these toys kept them both in cruel apprehensions they held themselves as on the point of being unmaskd and of losing that reputation of virtue which had cost them fifteen years dissimulation and management and which now embarassed them very much at some moments they would even forfeit their lives especially zelida to be as much blasted as the greatest part of their acquaintance what will the world say what will my husband do——what that woman so reserved so modest so virtuous that zelida like others is but——alas this thought distracts me——yes i wish i never had any reputation cried zelida in a passion she was then with her female friend who was making the same reflections but without such violent commotion zelidas last words made her smile laugh madam without constraint burst out said zelida touched to the quick to be sure you have good cause i am as sensible of the impending danger as you can be answered sophia with an air of indifference but how to shun it for you will agree with me that there is no likelyhood that your wish will be accomplishd contrive an expedient then replied zelida oh said sophia i am tired of rummaging my brain i can find none——to bury ones self in a country seat is one way but to abandon the pleasures of banza and renounce life is what i will never do i perceive that my toy will never approve it what is to be done then what to leave all to providence and laugh as i do at what the world will say i have tried all shifts to reconcile reputation with pleasures but since it is decreed that we must renounce reputation let us at least preserve pleasures we were uniques but now my dear we shall be like a hundred thousand others do you look on this as a hard fate yes without doubt replied zelida to me it seems hard to be like those for whom i had put on a sovereign contempt in order to avoid this mortification methinks i would fly to the worlds end set out my dear continued sophia for my part i stay—but à propos i advise you to furnish yourself with some secret to prevent your toy from blabbing on the road indeed replied zelida pleasantry here has a very ill grace and your intrepidity—— you are mistaken zelida there is not a grain of intrepidity in my proceeding to let things go their own way when we cannot stop them is resignation i see that i am to be dishonoured well then dishonour for dishonour i shall spare myself as much of the uneasiness as i can dishonourd replied zelida bursting into tears dishonourd what a shock i cannot bear it—oh accursed bonza tis thou that hast ruind me i loved my husband i was born virtuous i should have loved him still if thou hadst not made a wicked use of thy ministry and my confidence dishonourd dear sophia—— she had not power to make an end sobs intercepted her words and she fell on the carpet quite in despair as soon as zelida recovered her speech she cried out in a lamentable tone alas my dear sophia i shall die——i must die no i shall never survive my reputation but zelida my dear zelida do not be in a hurry to die perhaps said sophia——no perhaps shall stop me i must dye——but perhaps one might——one might do nothing i tell you——but speak my dear what might one do——perhaps one might hinder a toy from talking ah sophia you endeavour to comfort me by false hopes you deceive me no no i do not deceive you only hear me instead of distracting yourself like a mad creature i have heard talk of frenicol eolipila gags and muzzles pray what connexion is there between frenicol eolipila muzzles and the danger which threatens us what business has my toyman here and what is a muzzle it is this my dear a muzzle is a machine invented by frenicol approved by the academy and improved by eolipila who claims the honour of the invention but pray this machine invented by frenicol approved by the academy and improved by that silly fellow eolipila——oh you are of a vivacity that surpasses imagination well then this machine being applied to a toy renders it discreet in spite of its teeth——can this be true my dear it is so said we must know it replied zelida and immediately too she rang one of her women appeared and she sent for frenicol why not for eolipila said sophia frenicol is less taken notice of answered zelida the toyman came away with the messenger ah frenicol are you there said zelida you are welcome make haste my friend to extricate two women out of cruel anxiety—what is the business ladies would you please to have some rare toys—no we have two already and we would willingly—part with them i suppose pray ladies let me see them i will take them or we will make an exchange—you are mistaken mr frenicol we have nothing to truck—well i understand you you have some earrings which you would desire to lose so as that your husbands may find them in my shop——not that neither pray sophia inform him of the matter frenicol continued sophia we want two——what dont you understand no madam how would you have me understand when you say nothing——tis said sophia because when a woman is modest it gives her pain to speak plain on certain things but yet replied frenicol she must speak plain i am a toyman not a conjuror——you must guess however——faith ladies the more i look on ye the less i comprehend ye when a lady is young rich and pretty as you are she is not reduced to artifice moreover i declare sincerely that i sell them no longer i have left the dealing in those baubles to young beginners in the trade our devouts found the toymans mistake so ridiculous that they both burst out into a violent fit of laughter which disconcerted him permit me ladies to make my bow and withdraw you might well have spared yourselves the trouble of sending for me three miles off to divert yourselves at my cost stop stop friend said zelida still laughing on that was not our intention but by your misapprehending us such ridiculous notions came into your head——tis in your power ladies to put juster into it what is the business oh mr frenicol let me laugh at ease before i answer you zelida laughd till she panted for breath the toyman thought within himself that she had the vapors or was out of her senses and had patience at length zelida ceased——well said she the business relates to our toys our own toys do you understand me mr frenicol to be sure you cannot be ignorant that for some time past several toys have prattled like magpyes now we would be very glad that ours would not follow this bad example ah now i take it that is to say replied frenicol that you want a muzzle each——very right you have hit it off truly i have been told that mr frenicol was no fool madam your goodness is very great as to what you require i have of all sorts i go this moment to bring you some frenicol went accordingly in the mean while zelida embraced her friend and thankd her for her expedient and i says the african author went to take a nap waiting his return  chap xviii the toymans return the toyman returned and presented the ladies with two muzzles of the best sort——ah mercy cried zelida what enormous muzzles are these and who are the unhappy women whom these will fit this is an ell long indeed friend you must certainly have taken measure by the sultans mare——yes said sophia indolently after having measured them with her fingers you are in the right and there is but the sultans mare and old rimosa for whom these can do——i protest ladies that they are of the common size and that zelmaida zyrphila amiana and a hundred other ladies have of the same sort that is impossible said zelida——tis actually so however replied frenicol but they all said the same thing as ye have and as they have so may you undeceive yourselves by trying them on mr frenicol may say what he will but he shall never perswade me that this will fit me said zelida nor this me said sophia let him shew us others if he has any frenicol who had often experienced that women are not to be converted on that article shewd them muzzles for the age of thirteen well cried both at the same time these are such as we want i wish they may prove so whisperd frenicol aside how do you sell them said zelida but ten ducats a piece madam——ten ducats you forget yourself frenicol——madam that is the price in conscience——you make us pay for the novelty——i protest ladies tis but two sixpences for a shilling i must own they are neatly made but ten ducats are a great deal of money——ill abate nothing——we will go to eolipilas——you may ladies but there are workmen and workmen muzzles and muzzles frenicol held firm and zelida came to she paid for the two muzzles and the toyman went back fully perswaded that they would be too little for them and would soon be returned on his hands for a fourth part of the price he received for them he was mistaken mangogul not happening to come within reach of turning his ring on those two women their toys were not seized with the humor of talking louder than ordinary and happily for them for zelida having tried her muzzle found it too little by one half however she did not part with it fancying that it would be pretty near as inconvenient to change it as not to make use of it at all these circumstances came to light from one of her women who told them in confidence to her lover who related them in confidence to others who spread them all over banza under the seal of secresy nor was frenicol silent the adventure of the devouts became public and for sometime afforded employment to the calumniators of congo zelida became inconsolable upon it this woman more to be pitied than blamed conceived an aversion for her bramin quitted her husband and shut herself up in a convent as for sophia she threw off the mask despised censures patchd and painted frequented public places and had adventures  chap xix seventh trial of the ring the stifled toy tho the female cits of banza doubted whether toys of their rank would be honoured with the gift of speech yet they all furnishd themselves with muzzles in banza muzzles became as common as a general court mourning in this country here the african author observes with astonishment that neither the lowness of the price nor the commonness of muzzles put them out of fashion in the seraglio this once says he utility got the better of prejudice so trite a reflection was not worth the pains of repeating but to me it seems as if it was the defect of all the ancient authors of congo to fall into repetitions whether they thereby hoped to give a greater air of truth and facility to their productions or that they were far from having as much fecundity of invention as their admirers ascribe to them however that be one day mangogul walking in his gardens attended by his whole court took the maggot to level his ring at zelais she was handsome and suspected of several adventures yet her toy did no more than stammer and utterd only some few mangled words which had no meaning and which the blasters interpreted as they thought fit——pshuh says the sultan here is a toy that has a vast impediment of speech most certainly there must be somewhat that impedes its respiration wherefore he applied his ring more intensely the toy made a second effort to speak and in some measure surmounting the obstacle that stopd its mouth these words were heard very distinctly alas alas—i am—i am—i am stifled i can no more—alas alas i am stifled immediately zelais found herself going she grew pale her neck swelld and she fell with her eyes shut and mouth half open between the arms of those who stood around her any where else zelais would have been speedily relieved twas only debarrassing her of her muzzle and allowing her toy a freedom of respiration but how to lend the helping hand in mangoguls presence quick quick physicians cried the sultan zelais is dying some pages ran to the palace and returned with the doctors gravely marching after them orcotomus was at their head some gave their opinion for bleeding others for the kermes mineral but the penetrating orcotomus ordered zelais to be carried to a neighbouring closet examined her and cut the braces of her harness this muzzled toy was one of those which he boasted to have seen in the paroxysm however the bloating was excessive and zelais would have continued to suffer had not the sultan had pity on her condition he turnd off his ring the fluids returnd to their equilibrium zelais came to herself and orcotomus assumed the honour of this miraculous cure zelaiss accident and her physicians indiscretion made the muzzles lose much of their credit orcotomus without any regard to eolipilas interest proposed to himself to raise his own fortune on the ruins of the others advertised himself as a patentee physician of toys that had caught cold and some of his bills are to be seen at this day in the bystreets he began by getting money and ended by falling into contempt the sultan took pleasure in lowering the presumption of the empiric did orcotomus boast of silencing a toy that had never utterd a word mangogul had the cruelty to make it speak people went so far as to remark that any toy that was tired of silence need only have two or three visits from orcotomus in a little time he was rankd with eolipila in the class of quacks and they will both continue therein until it shall please brama to take them out shame was preferred to the apoplexy the one kills said the women the other does not wherefore they renounced their muzzles let their toys talk on and no body died thereby  chap xx eighth trial of the ring the vapors there was a time as we have seen when the women dreaded the prating of their toys were stifled and died away but another succeeded when they set themselves above this dread threw away their muzzles and had nothing beyond the vapors the favorite among her attendants had a very singular young lady her humour was charming tho uneven she changed countenance ten times a day but whatever face she put on was pleasing unique in her melancholy as well as in her gaiety there slipd from her in her most extravagant moments things of exquisite sense and in her fits of sadness she uttered very diverting extravagances mirzoza was so used to callirhoe for that is the name of this young mad girl that she could hardly be without her one time that the sultan complaind to the favorite of somewhat restless and cold which he remarkd in her prince said she embarrassed at his reproach without my three beasts my nightingale my lapdog and callirhoe i am good for nothing and you see that i have not the last and why is she not here said mangogul i cant tell answered mirzoza but i remember that some months ago she told me that if mazul made the campaign she could not avoid having the vapors and mazul set out yesterday i easily excuse her said the sultan for i look on her vapors to be well grounded but upon what account do a hundred other women take it into their heads to be vapord who have young husbands and besides take care to be well provided with lovers prince answered a courtier tis a fashionable disease it is genteel in a woman to have the vapors without a lover and the vapors she knows nothing of the world and there is not a citizens wife in banza who does not affect to have them mangogul smiled and resolved to visit some of these vaporish women immediately he went directly to salicas house and found her in bed with her neck quite bare her eyes flaming and her hair disheveld and at her beds side the little stammering humpbackd physician farfadi telling her stories while she was stretching out now one arm then another yawning sighing putting her hand to her head and exclaiming bitterly alas i cant bear it—throw the windows open—give me air—i shall faint i shall dye—— mangogul took advantage of the moment that her affrighted women were assisting farfadi in lightening the bedcloaths to turn his ring on her and instantly these words were heard oh how tired i am of this humor behold madam has taken into her noddle to have the vapors this farce will last eight days at least and may i dye if i know the cause for after farfadis efforts to ferret out this disease i think it is in the wrong to continue—good said the sultan turning off his ring i understand this dame has the vapors in favor of her physician let us try elsewhere he went from salicas house to that of arsinoe which is not far from it on entering her chambers he heard loud bursts of laughter and advanced thinking to find her in company but she was alone and mangogul was not much surprized a woman who gives herself the vapors says he gives them melancholy or merry as is most convenient he turnd his ring on her and presently her toy began to laugh unmercifully from these immoderate laughing fits it made a sudden transition to ridiculous lamentations on the absence of narces whom it advised as a friend to hasten his return and continued to sob weep groan sigh and be comfortless as if it had buried all its relations the sultan who could hardly refrain from laughing aloud at so whimsical an affliction turnd off his ring and departed leaving arsinoe and her toy to lament at leisure and inferring the falsity of the proverb  chap xxi ninth trial of the ring of things lost and found to serve as a supplement to the learned treatise of pancirollus and to the memoirs of the academy of inscriptions mangogul returning to his palace pondering on the ridiculous airs which women give themselves found himself whether thro absence of mind or some blunder of his ring under the portico of the sumptuous building which thelis has decorated with the rich spoils of her lovers he embraced the opportunity to interrogate her toy thelis was the wife of the emir sambuco whose ancestors had reignd in guinea sambuco had acquired a high reputation in congo by five or six signal victories which he had gaind over erguebzeds enemies as he was not a less able negotiator than a great captain he had been employd in embassies of the greatest consequence and executed his high trust with superior talents on his return from loango he saw thelis and was smitten he was then upon the brink of fifty and thelis was not above twentyfive she was rather agreeable than a beauty the women said she was well enough and the men thought her charming powerful matches sought her but whether she had already fixd her notions or that there was too great a disproportion of fortune between her and her admirers they were all rejected sambuco saw her laid at her feet immense riches a great name laurels and titles inferior to none but those of sovereigns and obtaind her thelis was or appeard virtuous for six whole weeks after her marriage but a toy born voluptuous seldom conquers itself and a quinquagenarian husband tho otherwise ever so great a hero is a madman if he flatters himself with conquering such an enemy altho thelis mixd prudence with her conduct her first adventures were not unknown this was sufficient for supposing afterwards that she had others undisclosed and mangogul desirous of full information hastened to pass from the porch of her palace into her appartment it was then the middle of summer the heat was excessive and thelis after dining had thrown herself on a couch in a back closet adorned with glasses and paintings she was asleep her hand leaning on a collection of persian tales which had lulld her to repose mangogul viewd her some time allowed that she had charms and turnd his ring on her i remember it as perfectly as if it had been yesterday nine proofs of love in four hours ah what moments zermounzaid is a divine man he is not the old frozen sambuco—dear zermounzaid i had been ignorant of true pleasures real good you alone made me sensible of them mangogul desirous of learning the particulars of theliss commerce with zermounzaid which the toy kept from him by dwelling on what affects a toy the most feelingly rubbd the stone of his ring for some time against his waistcoat and levelld it quite sparkling with light at thelis its influence soon reachd her toy which being thereby better informed of what was required of it reassumed its discourse in a more historical strain sambuco commanded the monoémugian army and i followed him to the field zermounzaid served under him in quality of a colonel and the general who honoured him with his confidence had put us under his escort the zealous zermounzaid did not abandon his post he thought it too pleasing to resign it and the danger of losing it was the only one he feard during the whole campaign while we were in winter quarters i entertained a few new guests cacil jekia almamoun jasub selim manzora nereskim all military men who were commended by zermounzaid but were inferior to him the credulous sambuco relied for his wifes virtue on herself and on zermounzaids care and being entirely taken up with the immense business of the war and the great operations which he was meditating for the glory of congo he never had the least suspicion either of the treachery of zermounzaid or the infidelity of thelis the war continued the armies took the field and we our litters as they went a very slow pace the main body of the army gaind ground of us and we found ourselves in the rear which zermounzaid commanded this gallant youth whom the sight of the greatest dangers had never made to swerve a foot from the path of glory could not resist that of pleasure he entrusted a subaltern with the care of watching the motions of the enemy who harrassed us and got up into our litter but he was hardly there when we heard a confused noise of arms and outcries zermounzaid leaving his business half done attempts to jump out but he is leveld with the ground and we become a prey to the conqueror thus i began by swallowing up the honor and services of an officer who from his valour and merit might have expected the highest military employments if he had never known his generals wife upwards of three thousand men fell in this action and therefore of so many good subjects have we robbd the nation let any one if he can imagine mangoguls surprize at this discourse he had heard zermounzaids funeral oration and did not know him by these features his father erguebzed had regretted this officer the newspapers after lavishing the highest eulogies on his fine retreat had attributed his defeat and death to the enemys superior numbers which as they said were found to be six to one all congo had lamented a man who had done his duty so well his wife obtaind a pension his regiment was given to his eldest son and an ecclesiastical preferment promised to his younger what horror cried mangogul but softly a husband dishonord the state betrayd subjects sacrificed crimes not only concealed but even rewarded as virtues and all that for a toy theliss toy which had stopt to take breath continued thus am i abandoned to the enemys discretion a regiment of dragoons was ready to fall upon us thelis seemd quite frighted and yet wishd nothing more ardently but the charms of the prey sowed discord among the plunderers the scimiters were drawn and thirty or forty men were massacred in the twinkling of an eye the noise of this disorder reachd the general officer he ran thither calmed the furious soldiers and sequestrated us under a tent where we had not time to know ourselves when he came and demanded the price of his good services woe to the vanquished cried thelis falling backward on a bed and the whole night was spent in feeling her misfortune the next day we found ourselves on the banks of the niger a saick was waiting for us and my mistress and i set out in order to be presented to the emperor of benin in this twentyfour hours voyage the captain of the vessel offerd himself to thelis and was accepted and i found by experience that the sea service is infinitely brisker than the land service we saw the emperor of benin he was young ardent voluptuous thelis made a conquest of him but those of her husband affrighted the monarch he demanded peace and the price at which he purchased it was but three provinces and my ransom different times different fatigues sambuco came to know i cant tell how the reason of the misfortunes of the preceding campaign and during this he deposited me with a friend of his a chief of the bramins on the frontiers the holy man made but a weak defence he was ensnared by the wiles of thelis and in less than six months devoured his immense income three lakes and two forests mercy cried mangogul three lakes and two forests what an appetite for a toy tis a mere trifle resumed the toy peace was made and thelis accompanied her husband in his embassy to monomotapa she gamed and very fairly lost a hundred thousand sequins in one day which i won back again in an hour a minister whose masters affairs did not fill up all his time fell into my clutches and in three or four months i eat him up a fine landed estate together with his castle well furnishd a park and equipage with the little pyed horses a favor of four minutes duration but well spun out brought us in feasts presents and jewels and the blind or politic sambuco did not disturb us i shall not bring into the accompt added the toy the marquisats counties titles coats of arms c which have been eclipsed at my appearance apply to my secretary who will tell you what is become of them i have closepared the horns of the dominions of biafara and am in possession of an entire province of beleguanza erguebzed made overtures to me a little before his death at these words mangogul turnd off his ring and silenced this gulph he respected his fathers memory and would hear nothing that might tarnish the splendor of the great qualities which he knew were in him returning to the seraglio he entertained the favorite with the vapored ladies and with the trial of his ring on thelis you admit this woman said he to your familiarity but in all probability you do not know her as well as i i understand you sir answered the sultana her toy has perhaps been foolish enough to give you a narrative of her adventures with the general micokof the emir feridour the senator marsupha and the great bramin ramanadanutio but pray who is ignorant that she keeps young alamir and that old sambuco who speaks not a word is as well apprized of it as you you have not hit the mark replied mangogul i have compelld her toy to make a full discharge had it swallowed any thing of yours said mirzoza no said the sultan but much belonging to my subjects to the grandees of my empire to the neighbouring potentates as estates provinces castles lakes forests diamonds equipages with the little pyed horses without reckoning their reputation and virtue sir added mirzoza i cannot tell what benefit you will reap by your ring but the more you try it the more odious my sex becomes to me even those whom i thought i justly held in some esteem are not expected they have thrown me me into such an humor that i beg your highness will allow me to indulge it alone for some moments mangogul who knew that the favorite was an enemy to all constraint kissd her right ear thrice and retired  chap xxii a sketch of mangoguls moral philosophy mangogul impatient to see the favorite again slept little arose earlier than usual and was in her appartment before sunrising she had already rung the bell a servant had just opened the curtains and her women were preparing to dress her the sultan lookd narrowly around her and seeing never a dog he asked her the reason of this oddity i see answered mirzoza that you think me singular in this article but there is nothing in it i assure you replied the sultan that i see dogs about all the women of my court and you will oblige me in informing me why they have them or why you have none most of them have several and not one of them but lavishes such caresses on her own as she seems not to bestow on her lover without some difficulty how come these beasts to deserve the preference what use is made of them mirzoza was puzzled at these questions however she made this answer to be sure one keeps a dog as a parrot or a canary bird it may be ridiculous to set ones heart on these animals but there is nothing wonderful in having them they sometimes amuse and never injure if they are caressed tis because such caresses are of no consequence besides do you believe prince that a lover is satisfied with a kiss such as a woman bestows on her pugdog doubtless i believe it says the sultan by jupiter the man must be very nice who would not be satisfied one of mirzozas women who had gaind the good will of the sultan and his favorite by sweetness of temper good parts and zeal said these animals are inconvenient and nasty they dirty ones clothes spoil the furniture tare laces and do more mischief in a quarter of an hour than would be sufficient to throw the most faithful ladys woman into disgrace and yet they are kept tho according to madam they are good for nothing but that added the sultan prince said mirzoza we stick to our fancies and the keeping of dogs must be one like many others which would be no longer fancies if we could give a reason for them the reign of monkeys is past the parrots still support themselves dogs fell and now they rise again squirrels have had their time and it is with animals as it has successively been with italian english geometry farthingales and furbelas mirzoza replied the sultan shaking his head has not all the knowledge that may be acquired on this subject and the toys—— is not your highness going to imagine said the favorite that you will be informd by harias toy why that woman who saw her son one of her daughters and her husband die without shedding a tear wept the loss of her lapdog for a whole fortnight why not replied mangogul truly says mirzoza if our toys could explain all our whims they would be more knowing than ourselves pray who disputes that with you replied the sultan for my part i believe that the toy makes a woman do a hundred things without her perceiving it and i have remarkd on more occasions than one that a woman who thought she was following her head was obeying her toy a great philosopher placed the soul i mean ours in the pineal gland if i allowed women to have one i well know where i would place it i excuse you from informing me rejoind mirzoza hastily but you will permit me at least said mangogul to communicate some notions to you which my ring has suggested to me concerning women upon a supposition that they have a soul the experiments which i have made with my ring have made me a great moralist i have neither the wit of la bruyere nor the logic of port royal nor the imagination of montaigne nor the wisdom of charron but i have collected facts to which perhaps they were strangers speak prince answered mirzoza ironically i will hear you with all my ears moral essays of a sultan of your age must be something curious the system of orcotomus is extravagant with the leave of his fellow academician hiragu yet i find some sense in the answers which he gave to the objections started against it if i allowed a soul to women i would willingly suppose with him that toys have spoken from the beginning but softly and that the effect of the genius cucufas ring is reduced to raising their voice upon this foundation nothing can be more easy than to define the whole sex the sober woman for example would be she whose toy is silent or is not attended to the prude she who pretends not to listen to her toy the intriguing woman she whose toy desires a great deal and who allows it too much the voluptuous she who gives ear to her toy with complaisance the courtezan she on whom her toy is making demands every moment and who refuses it nothing the coquette she whose toy is mute or is not attended to but who gives hopes to all the men that come near her that her toy will speak one day or other and it may happen that she will not lend it a deaf ear well delight of my soul what do you think of my definitions i think said the favorite that your highness has forgot the tender woman if i have not mentioned her answered the sultan tis because i dont know what the term means and that some able men pretend that the word tender abstracting from all connection with the toy is void of sense how void of sense cried mirzoza what there is no medium then and a woman must absolutely be a prude an intriguer a coquette a voluptuous woman or a libertin delight of my soul said the sultan i am willing to own the inaccuracy of my enumeration and will add the tender woman to the preceding characters but on condition that you will furnish me with a definition of her which will not coincide with any of mine most willingly said mirzoza i hope to compass it without quitting your system let us see added mangogul well then replied the favorite—a tender woman is she—— courage mirzoza said mangogul oh i beg you wont disturb me the tender woman is she——who has loved without a word utterd by her toy or——whose toy has never spoke but in favor of the single man whom she loved it would not have been polite in the sultan to chicane the favorite and ask her what she understood by love wherefore he avoided it mirzoza took his silence for consent and proceeded proud of having extricated herself from a difficulty which to her appeared considerable ye men believe because we do not argue in form that we do not reason know once for all that we could as easily discover the falsity of your paradoxes as ye that of our reasonings if we would give ourselves the trouble if your highness was less in a hurry to satisfy your curiosity on the subject of lapdogs i would in my turn give you a scrap of my philosophy but it shall not be lost i will reserve it for one of those days that you will have more time to bestow on me mangogul assured her that he had no better business than to profit of her philosophical notions that the metaphysics of a sultana of twenty two ought not to be less singular than the morals of a sultan of his age but mirzoza apprehending that this was pure complaisance in mangogul beggd some time to prepare and thus gave the sultan a pretext for flying whither his impatience might call him   sultan mangogul in harias chamber  chap xxiii tenth trial of the ring the dogs mangogul went immediately to harias house and as he took pleasure in soliloquy he said within himself this woman never goes to bed without her four dogs and either toys know nothing of those animals or hers will give me some account of them for thank god tis well known that she loves her dogs to admiration at the end of this monology he found himself in harias antichamber and his olfactory organ already informed him of madam having her usual company in bed with her these were a little shagdog a spaniel and two pugdogs the sultan drew out his snuffbox took two pinches of spanish by way of preservative and approached haria she was asleep but the pack who were upon the watch hearing some noise fell to barking and woke her peace my children said she but in so mild a tone that she could not be suspected of speaking to her daughters go to sleep go to sleep and dont disturb my rest nor your own haria was formerly young and pretty she had had lovers of her own rank but they all disappeard even sooner than her charms by way of comforting herself for this desertion she gave into a whimsical sort of pomp and her footmen were the handsomest fellows in banza she grew older and older and years threw her into oeconomy she restrained herself to four dogs and two bramins and became a model of edification and surely the most envenomd satyr could find no room to carp at this management and for above ten years haria was in peaceful possession of a high reputation of virtue and of those animals nay her tenderness for the pugdogs was so well known that the bramins were no longer suspected of sharing it haria renewed her intreaty to those beasts and they had the complaisance to obey then mangogul applied his ring and the superannuated toy set about relating the last of its adventures it was such a vast while since the first were atchieved that it had almost lost the very remembrance of them withdraw pompey it said with a hoarse voice you fatigue me i like dido better i find her more gentle pompey who was absolutely ignorant of the toys voice went on in his own way but haria awaking continued get away then you little rogue you hinder me from taking rest that is well some times but too much is too much pompey withdrew dido took his place and haria fell asleep mangogul who had suspended the energy of his ring turnd it on and the antiquated toy uttering a deep sigh fell to jabbering and said alas how i am grieved for the death of my large greyhound she was the best little wife the most caressing creature she never ceased giving amusement she was so sensible so genteel ye are but beasts in comparison of her that naughty master of mine killed her——poor zinzolina i never think of her without watering my plants i thought it would have been the death of my mistress she neither eat nor drank for two days and narrowly escaped losing her senses judge of her sorrow her director her friends nay her very pugdogs were kept from me orders were issued to her women to refuse the door of her appartment to my master under the penalty of being turnd off——that monster has robbd me of my dear zinzolina cried she let him not appear before me i am resolved never to see him more mangogul curious of learning the circumstances of zinzolinas death revived the electrical power of his ring by rubbing it on the skirt of his doublet pointed it at haria and the toy resumed haria ramadecs widow coiffed herself with sindor this youth was of good birth had no other fortune but a certain merit which pleases the sex and was after dogs harias predominant taste sindors indigence conquered his repugnance to harias years and dogs twenty thousand crowns a year blinded his eyes with regard to the wrinkles of his mistress and the inconveniency of the pugdogs and he married her he was in hopes of getting the better of our beasts by his talents and complaisant behavior and to bring them into disgrace from the very commencement of his reign but he was deceived after the expiration of some months when he thought he had merited much by his services he took into his head to remonstrate to madam that her dogs were not as good company in bed for him as for her that it was ridiculous to have more than three and that to admit more than one at a time was turning the nuptial bed into a kennel i advise you said haria in a furious tone to attack me with such speeches truly it well becomes a pitiful younger son from gascony whom i have taken from a garret which was not good enough for my dogs to give himself airs of nicety to be sure your sheets were perfumed my little squire when you dwelt in furnishd lodgings know this once for all that my dogs were long before you in possession of my bed and that you may choose either to quit it or be content to share it with them the declaration was peremptory and our dogs remaind masters of their post but one night as we were all asleep sindor in turning unluckily kickd zinzolina the hound not used to such treatment bit the calf of his leg and madam was immediately awaked by sindors cries what is the matter with you sir one would think your throat was cutting you dream it is your dogs madam that devour me and your greyhound has just torn off a piece of my leg is that all says haria turning from him you make a vast noise for nothing sindor piqued at this discourse jumpd out of bed swearing that he would never set his foot in it again till the pack was banishd thence he employd friends in order to obtain the exile of the dogs but they all failed in that important negotiation harias answer to them was that sindor was a knight of the post whom she had drawn out of a cockloft which he shared with rats and mice that it ill became him to be so nice that he slept the whole night long that she loved her dogs that they amused her that from her infancy she had taken a liking to their caresses and that she was resolved never to deprive herself of them till death tell him besides continued she addressing the mediators that if he does not humbly submit to my will he will repent it while he lives that i will retract the donation i have made him and will add it to the sums which i have bequeathed by my will for the support of my dear children between you and me added the toy sindor must have been a great fool to hope that she would do for him what could not be obtained by twenty lovers a director a confessor with a legion of bramins who had all lost their latin on that head mean while as often as sindor met our animals he was seized with such fits of passion as he could hardly conquer one day the unfortunate zinzolina fell in his way he took her by the neck and threw her out of the window the poor creature was killd by the fall then it was that a fine noise was made haria with inflamed countenance and eyes bathed in tears—— the toy was going to repeat what it had already told for toys willingly fall into repetitions but mangogul cut its words short its silence was not of long duration when the prince thought he had put this doting toy out of its road he restored it the freedom of speech and the tatler bursting out into a loud laugh resumed by way of recollection but à propos i forgot to tell you what passd on harias weddingnight i have seen a power of ridiculous things in my life but never one that came up to this after a splendid supper the bride and bridegroom were conduced to their appartment every body retired except madams women who undress her she is undressd put to bed and sindor alone remains with her observing that the shagdog the two pugs and the greyhound more alert than himself were taking possession of his bride permit me madam he said to remove these rivals a little my dear do what you can answered haria for my part i have not the courage to drive them away these little animals are so attached to me and i have been so long without any other company perhaps replied sindor they will have the politeness this night to surrender the fort to me which i must take possession of try sir said haria at first sindor tried gentle means and prayd zinzolina to retire to a corner but the untractable animal fell to growling the allarm spread among the rest of the troop and the pugdogs and shagdog barkd as if their mistresss throat was cutting sindor losing all patience at this noise tosses away one of the pugs drives off the other and seizes pompey by the paw pompey the faithful pompey abandoned by his allies endeavourd to repair this loss by the advantages of the post fixd on his mistresss thighs with eyes inflamed hair standing an end and open mouth he grind and shewd the enemy two rows of very sharp teeth sindor made several assaults on him and pompey repelld him as often with bitten fingers and torn ruffles the action lasted above a quarter of an hour with an obstinacy which gave diversion to none but haria when sindor had recourse to a stratagem against an enemy whom he despaired conquering by force he provoked pompey with the right hand pompey watching this motion did not observe that of the left and was seized by the neck he made most vigorous efforts to disengage himself but in vain he was obliged to quit the field of battle and surrender up haria sindor took possession of her but not without effusion of blood in all likelihood haria had resolved that her weddingnight should be a bloody one her animals made a good defence and disappointed not her expectations there says mangogul is a toy that could write a gazette better than my secretary and now well knowing what notions to form of lap dogs he returnd to the favorite prepare yourself said he as soon as he saw her to hear the most extravagant things in the world tis much worse than the baboons of palabria could you believe that harias four dogs were the rivals and the preferred rivals of her husband and that the death of a greyhound has raised a quarrel between that couple never to be made up what do you say replied the favorite of rivals and dogs i am quite in the dark i know that haria loves her dogs excessively but i know at the same time that sindor is a hottemperd man who perhaps did not use all that complaisance which women require to whom a man owes his fortune but yet whatever has been his conduct i cannot conceive that it has drawn rivals on him haria is so venerable that i could wish your highness would vouchsafe to explain yourself more intelligibly listen says mangogul and agree that women have excessively whimsical tastes to say nothing worse then he related harias history to her word for word as the toy had told it mirzoza could not refrain from laughter at the first nights battle but presently resuming a serious air i cant tell said she to mangogul what indignation seizes me i shall have an aversion for these animals and all those who keep any and i shall declare to my women that i will turn off the first who shall be even suspected of having a lapdog pray replied the sultan why will you extend your hatred so far you women are always upon extremes these animals are good for hunting are necessary in the country and have many other uses without reckoning that which haria makes of them in truth said mirzoza i begin to believe that your highness will find it a difficult task to light on a virtuous woman i told you so answered mangogul but let us not be over hasty you may one time or other upbraid me with being indebted to your want of patience for a declaration which i pretend to owe entirely to the trials of my ring i have some in my mind which will astonish you all secrets are not yet unveiled and i expect to draw more important discoveries from those toys which remain to be consulted mirzoza was in perpetual apprehensions for her own mangoguls discourse threw her into such uneasiness as she was not able to conceal from him but the sultan who had bound himself by an oath and in his heart had a regard for religion used his best endeavours to calm her mind gave her some very tender kisses and went to his council whither affairs of moment called him  chap xxiv eleventh trial of the ring the pensions congo had been disturbed by bloody wars in the reigns of kanaglou and erguebzed and those two monarchs had immortalized themselves by the conquests they had made over their neighbours the emperors of abex and angola lookd on the youth of mangogul and the beginning of his reign as favourable conjunctures to recover the provinces that had been taken from them wherefore they declared war against congo and attacked it on every side mangogul had the best council in all africa and old sambuco and the emir mirzala who were traind up in the former wars were placed at the head of the troops gaind victories on victories and formed generals capable of succeeding them an advantage of greater importance than even their successes thanks to the activity of the council and the good conduct of the generals the enemy who thought themselves sure of overcoming the empire did not advance as far as the frontiers made a poor defence of their own and saw their fortified towns and provinces ravaged but such constant and glorious successes notwithstanding congo grew weaker by aggrandizing itself the frequent raising of troops unpeopled the towns and country and the treasury was exhausted the sieges and battles had cost a vast number of lives the grand visir very lavish of the blood of the soldiery was accused of having hazarded battles that tended to nothing every family was in mourning not one but wept a father a brother or a friend the number of officers slain was prodigious and could be compared to naught but their wives who sollicited pensions the closets of the ministers were beset with them they pestered the sultan himself with petitions in which the merit and services of the deceased the grief of their widows the dismal condition of their children and other moving motives were not forgotten nothing seemed more equitable than their requests but on what fund to ground pensions which amounted to millions the ministers after having exhausted speeches and sometimes peevishness and rough language were obliged to deliberate on the means of bringing this affair to a final issue but they had an excellent reason for concluding nothing there was not a penny left mangogul tired with the false reasonings of his ministers and the lamentations of the widows hit upon the expedient which his ministry had been so long hunting after gentlemen said he to his council i am of opinion that before any pensions are granted it would be proper to examine if they are lawfully due this examination answered the great seneschal will be immense and of prodigious discussion yet how to resist the clamors and persecution of these women by whom you sir are particularly teazed it will not be as difficult a talk as you imagine mr seneschal replied the sultan and i promise you that by to morrow noon the whole affair shall be terminated by the laws of the strictest equity do you only bring them to my audience chamber by nine in the morning the council broke up the seneschal went into his office pondered profoundly and drew up the following proclamation which in three hours time was printed published by sound of trumpet and fixed up at all the most public places of banza by the sultans most excellent majesty and my lord the grand seneschal we ganderbeak grand seneschal of congo visir of the first bench trainbearer to the great manimonbanda chief and superintendant of the sweepers of the divan give notice that tomorrow morning at nine of the clock the magnanimous sultan will give audience to the widows of the officers slain in his service in order to decree on sight of their pretensions what to him shall seem meet given at our office the twelfth of the moon of regeb in the year     0000000  all the distressed women of congo and a great number of them there was did not fail to read the proclamation or to send their footmen to read it and less still to be at the appointed hour in the lobby of the audience chamber in order to avoid a crowd let no more enter said the sultan than six of these ladies at once when we have heard them let them pass thro the back door which leads to the outward courts you gentlemen be attentive and pronounce on their demands this said he made a signal to the first gentleman usher of the audiences and the six who happend to be next the door were introduced they entered in long mourning robes and made low reverences to his highness mangogul addressed the youngest and handsomest of them whose name was ifec madam said he how long is it since you have lost your husband three months answered ifec weeping he was lieutenant general in your highnesss service he was killd in the last battle and six children are the only legacy he left me—he left you interrupted a voice which tho issuing from ifec was not exactly in the same tone with hers madam knows better than she says they were all begun and finished by a young bramin who daily came to comfort her while my master was in the field tis easy to guess whence proceeded the indiscreet voice which pronounced this answer poor ifec being put out of countenance grew pale trembled fainted madam is subject to the vapors said mangogul with an air of tranquillity let her be carried into an appartment of the seraglio and be taken care of then immediately addressing phenice madam said he was not your husband a pacha yes sir answered phenice in a trembling voice and how have you lost him sir he died in his bed quite exhausted with the fatigues of the last campaign—with the fatigues of the last campaign replied phenices toy go madam your husband brought a firm and vigorous state of health from the camp and he would still enjoy it had not two or three scoundrel players—you understand me take care of yourself write says the sultan that phenice demands a pension for the good services which she has rendered to the state and her husband a third was interrogated on her husbands age and name who was said to have died in the army of the smallpox of the small pox said the toy a fine story indeed say madam of two good strokes of a scymeter which he received from the sangiac cavaglio because he took it ill that his eldest son was said to be as like the sangiac as one egg is to another and madam knows as well as i added the toy that a likeness was never better grounded the fourth was going to speak without being interrogated by mangogul when her toy was heard to cry out from the lower regions that these ten years part which the war had lasted she had made pretty good use of her time that two pages and a huge scoundrel of a footman had supplied her husbands place and that without doubt she designed the pension which she was solliciting for keeping an actor of the comic opera a fifth stept forward with intrepidity and with an air of confidence demanded the reward of her late husbands services who was an aga of the janissaries and lost his life under the walls of matatras the sultan turnd his ring on her but to no purpose her toy was mute i must own says the african author who had seen her that she was so ugly that the bystanders would be astonished if her toy had any thing to say mangogul was got to the sixth and here are the express words of her toy truly it well becomes madam meaning her whose toy was obstinately silent to sollicite pensions while she lives upon the poule keeps a breland table which brings her in three thousand sequins a year makes private suppers at the expence of the gamesters and received six hundred sequins from osman to draw me to one of these suppers where the treacherous osman—— due regard shall be paid to your petitions ladies said the sultan for the present ye may withdraw then directing his words to his counsellors he askd them if it did not seem ridiculous to them to grant pensions to a herd of little bastards of bramins and others and to women whose employment it was to dishonor brave men who had enterd into his service in quest of glory at the expence of their lives the seneschal stood up answered declaimed resumed and gave his opinion obscurely as usual while he was yet speaking ifec recovered from her fit quite enraged at her adventure and as she expected no pension for herself and would run distracted if any other obtaind one which would have happened in all likelihood she went directly into the antichamber and whispered to two or three of her female friends that they were summoned thither purely to hear their toys chatter that she herself heard one deliver horrid things in the audience chamber that she would not name it for the world but that they must be fools to expose themselves to the same danger this advice passed from hand to hand and dispersed the crowd of widows when the gentleman usher opened the door to let in a second parcel not one was there well seneschal will you believe me another time said mangogul informed of the desertion to the good man clapping him on the shoulder i promised to rid you of these female weepers and i have done it yet they were very assiduous in making court to you notwithstanding your fourscore and fifteen years of age but whatever pretensions you may possibly have for i am not ignorant of the facility you had to form pretensions on these ladies i fancy you are obliged to me for their retreat they gave you more embarras than pleasure the african author informs us that the remembrance of this trial is kept up in congo and for that reason it is that the government is so sparing of granting pensions but this was not the only good effect of cucufas ring as we shall see in the following chapter  chap xxv twelfth trial of the ring a law case rapes were severely punished in congo and there happened a most notorious one in mangoguls reign this prince at his accession to the crown had sworn like all his predecessors never to grant a pardon for that crime but be laws ever so severe they seldom curb those whom a considerable advantage urges to infringe them the criminal was condemned to lose that part of him by which he had sinned a cruel operation of which he generally died as the person who performed it used less precaution than b——ll kerfael a young man of a good family had now languished six months in a dungeon waiting for the day of execution fatme a young pretty woman was his lucretia and accuser every body knew that they had been very well together fatmes indulgent husband took no exceptions against it therefore it would be ungenteel in the public to intermeddle in their affairs after an undisturbed commerce of two years whether thro inconstancy or disgust kerfael took to a dancer at the opera of banza and grew cold towards fatme yet without coming to an open rupture he resolved to make a decent retreat which obliged him to continue his visits in the house fatme enraged for being thus forsaken meditated revenge and made use of this remnant of his assiduities to destroy her unfaithful lover one day that the convenient husband had left them tête à tête and that kerfael having ungirt his scymeter was endeavouring to allay fatmes suspicions by protestations which cost nothing to lovers but never surprize the credulity of a jealous woman she assumed an affrighted air and having tore her dress at five or six pulls shriekd out horridly and calld to her husband and domestics for help who ran immediately and became witnesses to the injury which fatme said she received from kerfael and shewing the scymeter added this the infamous villain lifted at my head ten times to make me submit to his will the young man struck dumb at the blackness of the accusation had not power either to answer or make his escape he was seizd draggd to prison and deliverd up to justice and the prosecution of the cadilesker the laws ordained that fatme should be visited accordingly she was and the report of the matrons proved very unfavourable to the accused they had an original standard by which they could determine the condition of a violated woman and every circumstance concurred against kerfael the judges examined him fatme was confronted with him and the evidence was heard in vain did he plead innocence deny the fact and demonstrate by the commerce which he held with his accuser above two years that she was not a woman to be ravished the circumstance of the scymeter the tête à tête solitude kerfaels confusion at the sight of the husband and domestics taken all together formed in the opinion of the judges violent presumptions fatme on her side far from owning that she had granted him favors would not even allow that she gave him the least glimmering of hopes and maintaind that her obstinate adherence to her duty from which she had never flinchd was without doubt what urged kerfael to acquire by force what he despaird obtaining by craft the verbal process drawn up by the commissaries was another terrible piece nothing more was requisite than to run it over and compare it with the articles of the criminal code to read unhappy kerfaels condemnation therein he lost all expectations of life either by his defence or the credit of his family the magistrates had fixed the definitive sentence to the thirteenth of the month of rebeg and this was even published by sound of trumpet according to custom this affair became the topic of conversations and people were divided upon it for a good while some old hags who had always been very safe from any apprehensions of a rape ran about crying that kerfaels attack was enormous that unless a severe example were made of him innocence would be no longer in security and that an honest woman would be exposed to insults even at the horns of the altar then they cited instances of little impertinent puppies having attackd the virtue of several respectable ladies and the circumstances left no room to doubt but that those respectable ladies mentioned by them were themselves and all these speeches were made to bramins less innocent than kerfael and by devotes as chaste as fatme by way of edifying conversations the petitsmaitres on the contrary and even some petitesmaitresses asserted that a rape was a chimæra that a woman never surrendered but by capitulation and that if a fort was defended tho ever so little it was absolutely impossible to take it by storm examples were alledged in support of this reasoning the women knew some the petitsmaitres invented others and there was no end of quoting instances of women who had not been ravished poor kerfael said they what the devil had he in his head to take to little bimbreloqua which was the dancers name why did he not stick to fatme they were extremely well together and the husband left them at full liberty what a blessing——those witches the matrons put on their spectacles to no purpose for they saw nothing and indeed who is the person that can see clear in that place and besides the senators are going to deprive him of his joy for having burst an open door the poor lad will die of it no doubt after that pray consider what will not dissatisfied women be authorized to do——if this execution takes place interrupted another i will make myself a free mason mirzoza naturally compassionate remonstrated to mangogul who was joking her on kerfaels case that if the laws spoke against kerfael good sense deposed against fatme moreover added she it has never been heard that in a wise government the letter of the law should be so closely adhered to that the simple allegation of a female accuser should be sufficient to endanger the life of a subject the reality of a rape cannot be too clearly proved and you will allow sir that this fact is as much at least within the province of your ring as of your senators it would be very singular that the matrons should be more knowing on this head than the toys themselves hitherto your highnesss ring has done little more than satisfy your curiosity might not the genius from whom you had it have intended some more important end if you employ it for the discovery of truth and the happiness of your subjects can you think the genius will be offended try you are in possession of an infallible method of drawing from fatme a confession of her crime or a proof of her innocence you are in the right replied mangogul and you shall be satisfied the sultan departed immediately and indeed there was no time to lose for it was the night of the twelfth of the moon rebeg and the senate was to pronounce sentence on the thirteenth fatme was just got into bed the curtains were not quite closed a night taper threw a dull light on her countenance the sultan thought her beautiful notwithstanding the violent commotions which disfigured her compassion and hatred grief and revenge audaciousness and shame were painted in her eyes according as they succeeded each other in her heart she uttered deep sighs shed tears wiped them off shed fresh ones remained some moments with her head drooping and eyes dejected then suddenly raised them and darted furious looks towards the heavens what was mangogul doing all this time he was talking to himself and saying these are the symptoms of despair her former tenderness for kerfael has revived in all its violence she has lost sight of the offence he committed and has nothing in view but the punishment reserved for her lover as soon as he had finished these words he turned the fatal ring on fatme and her toy cried out with vehemence twelve hours more and we shall be revenged the treacherous ingrateful man shall perish and his blood shall be shed fatme affrighted at the extraordinary motion which she felt within her and shockd at the buzzing voice of her toy clapt both hands on it and put herself upon duty to stop its mouth but the powerful ring continued to act and the ungovernable toy breaking thro every obstacle added yes we shall be revenged o thou who hast betrayd me wretched kerfael dye and thou whom he has preferred to me o bimbreloqua despair——twelve hours more alas how tedious will this time appear to me hasten sweet moments when i shall see the treacherous the ingrateful kerfael under the executioners knife his blood trickling down——ah wretch what have i said can i without horror see the dearest object of my love perish can i see the fatal weapon lifted up——ah far from me this cruel thought—he hates me tis true he has quitted me for bimbreloqua but perhaps some time or other——why do i say perhaps love will certainly recall him under my yoke that little bimbreloqua is a fancy that will fly off he must sooner or later be sensible of the injustice of his preference and the ridiculousness of his new choice comfort thyself fatme thou shalt see thy kerfael again yes thou shalt see him again arise quickly run fly to remove the dreadful danger which threatens him dost thou not tremble to come too late—but whither shall i run mean wretch that i am does not kerfaels disdain foretel me that he has abandoned me for ever bimbreloqua enjoys him and tis for her that i was going to save him ah let him rather dye a thousand deaths if he lives no more for me why should i be concerned for his death—yes i am now convinced that my wrath is just the ingrateful kerfael has deserved all my hatred i no longer have any remorse i had done every thing to keep him i will do every thing to destroy him yet one day later and my revenge was disappointed but his evil genius delivered him up to me the very moment that he thought to escape me he is fallen into the snare which i laid for him i have him fast the appointment to which i contrived to bring thee was the last which thou intendedst for me but thou wilt not so soon forget it—with what address did you bring him to your beck fatme how well concerted was your disorder your shrieks your grief your tears your confusion every thing even to your silence has ruind kerfael nothing can snatch him from his impending fate kerfael is dead—you weep wretched woman he loved another of what consequence is his life to you mangogul filled with horror at this discourse turned off his ring and while fatme was recruiting her spirits he flew back to the sultana well prince said she what have you heard is kerfael still guilty and the chast fatme—i beseech you to excuse me answered the sultan from repeating the abominations which i come from hearing how an exasperated woman is to be dreaded who could believe that a body formed by the graces sometimes enclosed a heart molded by the furies but the sun shall not set tomorrow on my dominions before they be purged of a monster more dangerous than those which are produced in my deserts the sultan immediately sent for the seneschal and commanded him to seize fatme to remove kerfael into one of the appartments of the seraglio and to inform the senate that he reserved to himself the cognizance of his affair his orders were executed that very night the next morning at dawn of day the sultan attended by the seneschal and an effendi went to mirzozas appartment and had fatme brought thither this unfortunate woman threw herself at mangoguls feet confessed her crime with all its circumstances and conjured mirzoza to intercede for her mean while kerfael was conducted in he expected nothing but death however he made his appearance with that composed assurance which innocence alone can give some illnatured wags said that he would be in greater consternation if what he was threatend to lose was worth preserving the women were upon the tenters to know the issue he prostrated himself respectuously before his highness mangogul made him a signal to arise and giving him his hand you are innocent said he be free render thanks to brama for your preservation in order to make amends for the misery you have suffered i grant you a pension of two thousand sequins on my exchequer and the first commandery that shall fall in the order of the crocodile the more favors were bestowed on kerfael the more fatme dreaded punishment the great seneschal gave his opinion for death grounded upon the law si foemina ff de vi c calumniatrix the sultan was inclined for perpetual imprisonment mirzoza finding too much rigor in one of these judgments and too much indulgence in the other condemned fatmes toy to the padlock the florentine machine was publickly clapt on upon the same scaffold that had been erected for kerfaels execution thence she was conducted to a house of correction together with the matrons who had given their decisive opinions with so much knowledge  chap xxvi mirzozas metaphysics the souls while mangogul was interrogating the toys of haria the widows and fatme mirzoza had full time to prepare her philosophical lecture one evening that the manimonbanda was performing her devotions that there was neither play nor drawing room at court and that the favorite was almost certain of a visit from the sultan she took two black petticoats put one on in the usual manner and the other over her shoulders passed her hands thro the two slits put on the peruke of mangoguls seneschal and his chaplains square cap and thought herself equipped as a philosopher whereas she had disguised herself into a bat in this masquerade dress she walked up and down her appartments as a professor of the royal college waiting for his scholars she affected even to the gloomy pensive physiognomy of a learned man in meditation mirzoza did not hold this forced gravity long the sultan entered with some of his courtiers and made a low bow to the new philosopher whose gravity disconcerted her audience and was in its turn disconcerted by the loud laughter it occasioned madam said mangogul have you not advantage enough by your wit and figure without taking the robe to your aid without which your words would have all the weight that you could have desired it seems to me sir answered mirzoza that you do not much respect this robe and that a disciple should pay more regard to what constitutes half the merit at least of his master i perceive replied the sultan that you have already acquired the spirit and tone of your new condition i make no doubt at present but your capacity answers to the dignity of your dress and i impatiently expect a proof of it—you shall be satisfied this minute said mirzoza sitting down in the center of a large carpet the sultan and courtiers placed themselves around her and she began have the philosophers who presided over your highnesss education ever entertaind you on the nature of the soul oh very often said mangogul but all their systems had no other end but giving me uncertain notions of it and were it not for an inward sentiment which seems to suggest to me that it is a substance different from matter i should either have denied its existence or confounded it with the body would you undertake to clear up this chaos so far from it replied mirzoza that i am not farther advanced on that head than your pedagogues the only difference between them and me is that i suppose the existence of a substance different from matter and that they hold it demonstrated but this substance if it exists must be lodged somewhere have they not preached many extravagances to you on that article no said mangogul they all pretty generally agreed that it resides in the head and this opinion to me seemed probable tis the head that thinks imagines reflects judges disposes commands and we say every day of a man who does not think that he has no brains or that he wants a head well then replied the sultana the result of your long studies and of all your philosophy is to suppose a fact and to ground it on popular expressions prince what would you say of your first geographer if he presented your highness with a map of your dominions in which he had put the east in the west and the north in the south that is too gross an error answered mangogul for any geographer to have ever committed that may be continued the favorite and in the case before us your philosophers are greater bunglers than the most bungling geographer can be they had not a vast empire to survey the business was not to fix the limits of the four parts of the world all they had to do was to enter into themselves and there mark the true seat of their soul yet they have placed the east in the west and the south in the north they have pronounced that the soul is in the head whereas the greatest part of mankind dye without its ever inhabiting that appartment and its first residence is in the feet in the feet interrupted the sultan that is the most empty notion that i have ever heard yes in the feet replied mirzoza and this opinion which to you seems so silly will upon thoroughly examining it become rational contrary to all those which you allow as true and which upon a thorough examination are found to be false your highness agreed with me just now that the existence of our soul was founded on the interior testimony alone which it bore to itself and i will now demonstrate that all the proofs imaginable of sense concur to fix the soul in the seat which i have assigned it there we expect you said mangogul i desire no favor continued she and i invite ye all to propose your difficulties well then i was saying that the soul takes up its first residence in the feet that there it begins to exist and from the feet it advances into the body to experience i appeal for this fact and perhaps i am going to lay the first foundations of experimental metaphysics we have all experienced in our infancy that the benumbed soul remains whole months in a state of sleepiness at that time the eyes open without seeing the mouth without speaking and the ears without hearing tis elsewhere that the soul endeavours to stretch itself and awake tis in other members that she practises her first functions tis by the feet that a child gives notice of his formation his body head and arms are immoveable in the mothers womb but his feet unfold and extend themselves and give proofs of his existence and perhaps of his exigences when he is on the point of birth what would become of his head body and arms they would never come out of their confinement had they not been assisted by the feet here the feet act the principal part and drive the rest of the body before them such is the order of nature and whenever any other member attempts to lead the van when the head for example takes the place of the feet every thing goes wrong and god knows what is the consequence sometimes both to the mother and the child is the child born tis still in the feet that the chief motions are performed we are obliged to confine them and this is never done without some reluctance on their part the head is a block with which we do what we will but the feet are sensible of shake off the yoke and seem jealous of the liberty of which they are deprived is the child able to stand alone the feet make a thousand efforts to move they put every thing into action they command the other members and the obedient hands lean against the walls and advance forward to prevent or break the falls and facilitate the action of the feet whither do all the thoughts of a child tend what are his pleasures when secure on his legs his feet have acquired the habit of moving to exercise them to go to and fro to run to leap to bounce this turbulence pleases us we take it for a mark of sense and we predict the future stupidity of the child when we see him indolent and sullen have you a mind to vex a child of four years old make him sit down for a quarter of an hour or imprison him between four chairs he will grow peevish and illhumord for tis not his legs alone that you deprive of exercise tis his soul that you hold in captivity the soul remains in the feet to the age of two or three years at four it inhabits the legs it gets up to the knees and thighs at fifteen then we love dancing fencing riding and the other violent bodily exercises this is the predominant passion of all young folks and the madness of some what does not the soul reside in those places where she almost only manifests herself and where she feels the most agreeable sensations but if her residence varies in infancy and youth why should it not vary thro every stage of life mirzoza pronounced this discourse with such rapidity as made her pant selim one of the sultans favorites embraced the moment while she was taking breath and said to her madam i will make use of the liberty you have granted the company of proposing their objections your system is ingenious and you have delivered it with equal grace and clearness but i am not so far seduced by it as to think it stands demonstrated methinks one may say that even in infancy tis the head that commands the feet and from thence the spirits flow which by means of the nerves running into all the members stop or move them at the will of the soul seated on the pineal gland just as we see his highnesss orders issuing from the sublime porte which set all his subjects in action doubtless replied mirzoza but one would tell me a very obscure thing to which i should give no other answer than by an experienced fact in infancy we have no certainty that the head thinks and even you my lord who have so good an one and who in your tender years passed for a prodigy of reason do you remember that you thought at that time but you might well assert that when you gamboled about like a little dæmon so as to drive your governants out of their wits your feet then governed your head that proves nothing said the sultan selim was lively and so are a thousand other children they do not reflect but they think time slips away the remembrance of things wears out and they remember not that they thought but by what part did they think replied mirzoza for that is the point in dispute by the head answered selim what always this head into which one cannot peep replied the sultana pray drop your dark lanthorn in which you suppose a light that is seen by none but by him who carries it hear my experiment and own the truth of my hypothesis it is so constantly true that the soul begins its progress in the body by the feet that there are some of both sexes in whom it never rose higher my lord you have admired ninis nimbleness and saligos feats of activity a thousand times answer me then sincerely do you think that these creatures have their souls any where else but in their legs and have you not remarked that in volucer and zelindor the head is submissive to the feet the eternal temptation of a dancer is to contemplate his legs at every step his attentive eye follows his paces and his head bows respectuously before his feet as do before his highness his invincible pachas i allow the observation said selim but i deny that it is a general one nor do i pretend replied mirzoza that the soul always fixes in the feet she advances she travels she quits a part returns to it and quits it again but i maintain that the other members are subordinate to that which she inhabits all this varies according to the age temper and circumstances and thence arises the difference of tastes the diversity of inclinations and characters do you not admire the fecundity of my principle and is not its certainty evinced by the number of phænomena to which it extends madam answered selim if you applied it to some in particular perhaps it might give us a degree of conviction which we have not yet acquired most willingly replied mirzoza who began to be sensible of the advantages she gaind you shall be satisfied only follow the chain of my notions i do not pretend to make arguments in form i speak from my heart this is the philosophy of our sex and you understand it almost as well as we it is probable enough added she that the soul occupies the feet and legs to the age of eight or ten but about that time or rather later she quits that lodging either of her own free motion or by force by force when a tutor employs certain machines to drive her out of her native place and lead her into the brain where she is metamorphosed generally into memory and seldom or never into judgment this is the fate of schoolboys in like manner if a weak governant labours hard to form a young girl stuffs her mind with knowledge and neglects the heart and morals the soul rapidly flies towards the head stops on the tongue or fixes in the eyes and her scholar is but a tiresome pratler or a coquet thus the voluptuous woman is she whose soul occupies her toy and never strays from it the woman of gallantry she whose soul is sometimes in her toy and sometimes in her eyes the affectionate woman she whose soul is habitually in the heart but sometimes also in her toy the virtuous woman she whose soul is sometimes in her head sometimes in her heart but never any where else if the soul fixes in the heart she forms the characters of sensibility compassion truth generosity if she quits the heart without returning thither and retires to the head then she forms those whom we call hardhearted ungrateful deceitful cruel men the class of those in whom the soul visits the head merely as a countryhouse where its stay is short is very numerous it is composed of petitsmaitres coquets musicians poets romancers courtiers and all those who are called pretty women listen to the reasoning of these entities and you will instantly discern vagabond souls which are influenced by the different climes they inhabit if that be the case said selim nature has formed many useless things and yet our sages hold as a constant maxim that she has produced nothing in vain drop your sages and their lofty expressions answered mirzoza and as to nature let us consider her with the eyes of experience only and we shall learn from her that she has placed the soul in the body of man as in a spacious palace of which she does not always occupy the most beautiful appartment the head and heart are principally destined for her as the center of virtue and the residence of truth but most commonly she stops on the road and prefers a garret a suspicious place a miserable inn where she drops asleep in perpetual drunkenness ah if i were allowed for twentyfour hours only to settle the world according to my fancy i would divert you with a very strange sight in a moment i would deprive each soul of the superfluous parts of its habitation and you would see each individual characterised by the part left him thus dancers would be reduced to two feet or two legs at most singers to a throat most women to a toy heros and prizefighters to an armed hand certain learned men to a skull without brains a female gamester should be stinted to two hands incessantly shuffling the cards a glutton to two jaws always in motion a coquet to two eyes a rake to the sole instrument of his passion the ignorant and lazy to nothing if you leave the women any hands at all interrupted the sultan those men whom you would reduce to the sole instrument of their passions would be pursued this chace would be a pleasant sight and if the sex was as greedy of this game every where else as in congo the species would soon be extinct but said selim to the favorite of what would you compose affectionate and sensible women constant and faithful lovers of a heart answered mirzoza and i well know added she darting a tender glance on mangogul that to which mine would wish to be united the sultan could not stand against this declaration he sprung from his seat to the favorite the courtiers disappeard and the new philosophers chair became the theatre of their pleasures he gave her repeated proofs that he was not less charmed with her sentiments than with her discourse and the philosophic equipage was thrown into disorder mirzoza returnd the black petticoats to her women sent my lord seneschal his enormous peruke and to monsieur labbé his square cap with assurances that he should be on the list at the next nomination what would he not have attained if he had been a genius a seat in the academy was the least reward that he could expect but unluckily he knew but two or three hundred words and had never been able from that stock to compass the composing of two ritournelles  chap xxvii sequel of the preceding conversation mangogul was the only person that had given attention to mirzozas philosophic lecture without interrupting her and as he was pretty much inclined to contradict she was astonishd at it does the sultan allow my system from beginning to end said she within herself no that is not probable has he found it too bad to deign to attack it that may be my notions are not the most just that have been broachd to this day i grant it but neither are they the most false and i am apt to think that worse have been invented in order to clear up this doubt the favorite resolved to ask some questions of mangogul well prince said she what are your thoughts of my system it is admirable answered the sultan i find but one defect in it what defect is that replied the favorite it is said mangogul that it is as false as false can be pursuant to your notions we must all be endowed with souls now observe my souls delight that there is not common sense in this supposition i have a soul there is an animal that acts most part of the time as if he had none and perhaps in reality he has none even while he acts as if he had one but he has a nose made like mine i feel that i have a soul and that i think therefore that animal has a soul and thinks likewise this argument has been made use of above a thousand years and it has been impertinent full as long i own said the favorite that it is not always evident that others think and add replied mangogul that it is evident on an hundred occasions that they do not think but in my opinion says mirzoza it would be going a great length to infer from thence that they never have or ever will think a person is not always a beast for having been so sometimes and your highness—— mirzoza fearing to offend the sultan stopt short continue madam said mangogul i understand you would you not have said has my highness never acted the beast i answer you that i have now and then and that even i excused others for taking me for such for you may easily imagine that they did not fail so to do tho they dared not to speak out——ah prince cried the favorite if men refused a soul to the greatest monarch upon earth to whom could they allow one pray forbear compliments says mangogul i have for a moment laid down the crown and scepter i have ceased to be sultan in order to be a philosopher and i can hear and speak the truth i believe i have given you proofs of the one and you have hinted to me without offending me and quite at your ease that i have been sometimes no better than a beast permit me thoroughly to fulfil the duties of my new character far from agreeing with you continued he that every creature that has legs arms hands eyes and ears as i have possesses a soul like me i declare to you that i am absolutely perswaded that three fourths of the men and all the women are but mere machines there may possibly be as much truth answered the favorite as politeness in what you say oh says the sultan madam seems to be angry and why the devil do you take it into your head to philosophize if you will not allow one to speak the truth is it in the schools that politeness is to be sought for i have left you full elbowroom pray allow me the same if you please well then i was saying that ye are all beasts yes prince and this is what remained to be proved added mirzoza nothing more easy answered the sultan then he set about detailing all the impertinences which had been said over and over with as little wit and delicacy as possible against a sex which possesses both these qualities in a sovereign degree never was mirzozas patience put to a greater trial and you would never be so tired in your whole life as if i related all mangoguls reasonings this prince who did not want good sense was that day absurd beyond all comprehension of which you shall be a judge it is so true by jupiter said he that a woman is but an animal that ill wager if i turn cucufas ring on my mare i shall make her speak like a woman without doubt answered mirzoza there is the strongest argument that has ever been or ever will be made against us then she burst out into a loud fit of laughter mangogul vexed to see no end to her laughter went out in a hurry resolved to try the whimsical experiment which occurd to his imagination   the mare of sultan mangogul  chap xxviii thirteenth trial of the ring the little mare i am not a great portraitmaker i have exempted the reader from that of the favorite sultana but i can never condescend to remit him that of the sultans mare she was of a middling size and had a pretty good gait the chief fault found with her in that regard was that she did not bridle her head sufficiently her colour was white with blue eyes small hoofs clean legs firm hams and light haunches she had been taught to dance for a long time and she made her bows like a master of the ceremonies upon the whole she was a pretty beast enough and remarkably gentle she was easily mounted but one must be an excellent horseman to be able to keep the saddle she had belongd to the senator aaron but on a fine evening the skittish creature took fright threw the judge and ran full speed to the sultans studs carrying with her the saddle bridle furniture housings and caparisons of value which became her so well that it was not thought proper to send them back mangogul went into his stables accompanied by his first secretary ziguezague listen attentively said he and write——that very instant he turnd his ring on the mare which fell to leaping prancing kicking bouncing and neighing under the tail——where are your thoughts said the prince to his secretary write then——sultan replied ziguezague i wait till your highness begins——my mare says mangogul will dictate to you this once write ziguezague whom this order reduced too low in his own opinion assumed the liberty of representing to the sultan that he would always esteem it a high honour to be his secretary but not that of his mare write i tell you said the sultan again prince i cannot replied ziguezague i know not the orthography of this sort of words——write however said the sultan once more——i am excessively mortified to be obliged to disobey your highness added ziguezague but——but you are a scoundrel interrupted mangogul incensed at a refusal so much out of place quit my palace and never appear there more poor ziguezague disappeard having learnd by experience that a man of spirit ought not to enter the palaces of most part of the great without leaving his sentiments at the gate his deputy was called he was a provencal frank honest and thoroughly disinterested he flew whither he thought his duty and fortune called him made a low bow to the sultan a lower still to his mare and wrote every thing that the beast vouchsafed to dictate i must beg leave to refer those who are curious to know her discourse to the archives of congo this prince immediately ordered copies of it to be distributed among all his interpreters and professors of foreign languages both ancient and modern one said that it was a scene of some old greek tragedy which to him appeard very moving another by the strength of his genius discovered that it was an important fragment of egyptian theology a third pretended that it was the exordium of hannibals funeral oration in the punic language and a fourth asserted that the piece was writ in chinese and that it was a very devout prayer to confucius while the litterati were trying the sultans patience with their learned conjectures he recollected gullivers travels and made no doubt but that a person who had lived so long as this englishman in an island where horses have a government laws kings gods priests a religion temples and altars and who seemed so perfectly well instructed in their manners and customs was a thorough master of their language accordingly gulliver read and interpreted the mares discourse off hand notwithstanding the orthographical errors with which it abounded nay it is the only good translation of it in all congo mangogul learned for his own private satisfaction and for the honour of his system that it was an historical abridgment of the amours of an old pacha of three tails with the little mare which had been attackd by an infinite number of jackasses before him a singular anecdote the truth of which however was not unknown either to the sultan or to any other person at court at banza and in the rest of the empire   the dream of sultan mangogul  chap xxix the best perhaps and the least read of this history mangoguls dream or a voyage into the region of hypotheses waa says mangogul yawning and rubbing his eyes my head achs let nobody evermore talk philosophy to me such conversations are unwholsome last night i lay on empty ideas and instead of sleeping like a sultan my brain workd more than those of my ministers do in a year you laugh but to convince you that i do not exaggerate and to take my revenge for the bad night which your reasonings gave me i enjoin you the penance of hearing my dream in its full extent as soon as i began to nod and my imagination to take its flight i saw an odd animal bounce by my side he had the head of an eagle the feet of a griffon the body of a horse and the tail of a lion i seized him notwithstanding his prancing and holding by his mane i nimbly sprung on his back immediately he spread out long wings which issued from his flanks and i felt myself carried in the air with incredible swiftness after driving a vast way i espied in the emptiness of space a building suspended as by enchantment it was a vast one i will not say that it was faulty in its foundation for it had none its columns which were not half a foot in diameter ran up out of sight and supported arches which would not have been visible were it not for the symmetrical lights made in them at the entrance into this edifice it was that my beast first stopd at first i was in a doubt whether i should alight for i apprehended less danger in sitting on my hippogriffon than in walking under this portico however encouraged by the multitude of its inhabitants and by a remarkable security which was predominant in their countenances i alight go forward mix with the crowd and make my observations on those that composed it they were old men either bloated or feeble without embonpoint and strength and almost all deformd the head of one was too little the arms of another too short one was humpbackd another bandyleggd most of them had no feet and walkd on crutches a breath threw them down and they remaind on the ground till some new comer was pleased to lift them up all these defects notwithstanding they pleased at first sight they had in their physiognomy somewhat engaging and confident they were almost naked for all their cloathing consisted of a small rag of stuff which did not cover the hundredth part of their body i continued to pierce the crowd and got to the foot of a rostrum for which a cobweb served as a canopy the boldness of this rostrum was of a piece with that of the building to me it seemed placed on the point of a needle and to support itself there in æquilibrio i trembled a hundred times for the person who was in it he was an old man with a long beard as witherd and naked as any of his disciples he had a cup full of a subtil fluid before him into which he dippd a strawpipe then put it to his mouth and blew bubbles to a crowd of spectators around him who were using their utmost endeavours to drive them up to the clouds where am i said i to myself all in confusion at these childish tricks what means this blower of bubbles and all these decrepit infants employd in making them fly about who will let me into the secret of these things—besides the little scraps of stuff had struck me and i observed that the larger they were the less those that wore them interested themselves in the bubbles this singular remark emboldend me to accost him who was the least undressd of the company i saw one whose shoulders were half covered with pieces so well fitted together that the seams were not to be seen he walkd forward and backward in the crowd with very little concern for what they were doing he had an affable air a smiling mouth a noble gait a mild look and i went directly to him and asked him without ceremony who are you where am i and who are all these folks—he answered i am plato you are in the region of hypotheses and these folks are systematics but by what chance replied i is the divine plato here and what does he do among these madmen—raising recruits said he at a distance from this portico i have a sanctuary whither i conduct those who abandon systems and how do you employ them in knowing man practising virtue and sacrificing to the graces—these are noble employments but what mean these shreds of fluff whereby you look more like beggers than philosophers—oh what a question do you propose to me said he with a sigh and what thoughts do you bring back to my mind this temple was formerly that of philosophy alas how much this place is changed the chair of socrates was here—how said i interrupting him had socrates a straw and did he blow bubbles—no no replied plato it was not by such means that he merited of the gods the name of the wisest of men his constant occupation during life was forming heads and hearts the secret was lost at his death socrates died and the bright days of philosophy were no more these pieces of stuff which those very systematics think it an honour to wear are scraps of his garment scarcely had his eyes been closed when those who aspired to the title of philosophers seized his robe and tore it in pieces i understand said i these pieces served as tickets both to them and their long posterity—who will collect these scraps continued plato and restore us socratess robe while he was uttering these words i saw at a distance a child walking towards us in a slow but sure pace he had a little head slender body weak arms and short legs but all these parts increased in all dimensions according as he came forward in the progress of his successive growth he appeard to me under a hundred different forms i saw him directing a long telescope towards the heavens estimating the fall of bodies by means of a pendulum determining the weight of the air by a tube filld with quicksilver and discomposing light with a prism he was now become an enormous colossus his head touchd the heavens his feet were lost in the abyss and his arms reachd from one to the other pole with his right hand he brandished a torch whose light spread a vast way in the sky enlightened even the bottom of the waters and penetrated into the entrails of the earth i askd plato what that gigantic figure was that was coming towards us it is experience said he scarcely had he made me this short answer when i saw experience draw near and the columns of the portico of hypotheses to shake its arches to sink in and its pavement to crack under our feet let us fly said plato let us fly this edifice has but a moment to stand at these words he departs and i follow him the colossus arrives strikes the portico it tumbles down with a frightful noise and i awake ah prince cried mirzoza tis you that ought to dream i would indeed be very glad that you had had a good night but now that i know your dream i should be very sorry that you had not dreamd it madam said mangogul i could point out nights better spent than that of this dream which gives you so much pleasure and if i had been master of making the journey or not it is very probable that not hoping to find you in the country of hypotheses i should have bent my course elsewhere and then either i should not have the headach which i actually feel or at least i should have reason to make myself easy under it prince replied mirzoza it is to be hoped that it will soon go off and that one or two experiments of your ring will rid you of it i must try said mangogul the conversation lasted some time longer between the sultan and mirzoza so that he did not quit her till eleven when he went upon the expedition related in the following chapter  chap xxx fourteenth trial of the ring the mute toy of all the ladies who shone at the sultans court none had more charms and wit than young egle the wife of his highnesss great cupbearer she was of all mangoguls parties who was much taken with the chearfulness of her conversation and as if there could be neither pleasure nor amusement without egle she was also of all the parties of the grandees of his court balls public diversions drawing rooms feasts private suppers hunting matches play every where egle was invited and every where she appeard it seemd as if the taste of amusements multiplied her according to the will of those who desired her company wherefore it is needless to say that if no woman was as much sought after as egle there was none so diffused she had been always pursued by a crowd of lovers and people were persuaded that she had not treated them all with severity whether it were inadvertence or thorough good nature her common politeness frequently resembled premeditated regard and those who endeavourd to gain her sometimes read affection in her eyes when she never intended more than affability neither caustic nor detracting she never opend her mouth but to say pleasing things which she did with such spirit and vivacity that on several occasions her encomiums raised a suspicion that she had a choice to justify thus it appears that those of whom egle was the ornament and delight were unworthy of her it was natural to think that a woman in whom no fault perhaps was to be found but an excess of goodness ought to have no enemies yet she had some and very bitter ones the devouts of banza found that she had too free an air and somewhat too loose in her carriage saw nothing in her conduct but a rage of worldly pleasures inferred thence that her morals were equivocal at least and charitably insinuated this to all those that would hear them the court ladies did not treat egle with greater tenderness they suspected her intimacies gave her gallants even honored her with some great adventures made her a party concerned in others they knew particulars and quoted witnesses good whispered they she has been surprized tête à tête with melraim in one of the groves of the great park egle does not want wit added they but melraim has too much good sense to be amused with her speeches alone at ten at night in a grove—you are mistaken said a petitmaitre i have walked with her a hundred times in the dusk of the evening and found my account in it but à propos do you know that zulemar is daily at her toilette—doubtless we know it and that she has no toilette but when her husband is in waiting at court——poor celebi continued another indeed his wife advertises him by the aigrette and diamond buckles which she received of the pacha ismael——is that true madam——it is strict truth i have it from her own mouth but in the name of brama let this go no farther egle is my friend and i should be very sorry——alas cried a third sorrowfully the poor little creature ruins herself very chearfully a great pity truly but twenty intrigues at a time that seems rather too much the petitsmaitres were not more sparing of her one related a hunting match in which she and he lost themselves together another out of respect for the sex suppressd the consequences of a very smart conversation he held with her at a masquerade where he met her a third made a panegyric on her wit and charms and ended it by shewing her portrait which he declared he had from the best hands this portrait said a fourth is more like her than that of which she made a present to jenaki these stories at length came to her husbands ears celebi loved his wife but still with such decency that no body had the least suspicion of it he repulsed the first reports but they returnd to the charge from so many quarters that he thought his friends more clearsighted than himself and the more liberty he had granted to egle the more he suspected that she had abused it jealousy took possession of his soul he began by cramping his wife egle bore this change of behaviour with the greater impatience as she was conscious of her innocence her vivacity and the advices of her female friends hurried her into inconsiderate deportment which made all the appearances turn against her and had like to cost her her life the violent celebi for some time rackd his brain with a thousand projects of revenge steel poison the fatal noose c and at length resolved on a slower and more cruel punishment by confining her to his country seat which is death indeed to a court lady in a word orders are given egle is informd of her destiny he is insensible to her tears and deaf to her reasons and she is banishd two hundred miles from banza to an old castle where she is allowed no other company than two maids and four black eunuchs who continually watch her scarcely was she set out when she was innocent the petitsmaitres forgot her adventures the women forgave her her wit and charms and all the world bemoaned her mangogul was apprized from celebis own mouth of his motives for the dreadful resolution he had taken against his wife and seemd to be the only person that approved it the wretched egle had already groaned near six months under her exile when kerfaels adventure happened mirzoza wishd she might prove innocent but durst not indulge those flattering hopes however she one day said to the sultan prince might not your ring which has saved kerfaels life put an end to egles banishment but i forget myself in order to that her toy should be consulted and the poor recluse is dying with grief two hundred miles hence——you interest yourself much answered mangogul in egles fate yes prince said mirzoza especially if she is innocent you shall have tydings of this affair within an hour replied mangogul do you not remember the properties of my ring——at these words he went into the garden turnd his ring and in less than fifteen minutes was in the park of the castle wherein egle dwelt there he espied egle alone and overwhelmd with sorrow her head was leaning on her hand she was tenderly repeating her husbands name and with her tears she was watering the green turf on which she sate mangogul drawing near turnd his ring on her and egles toy said in a mournful strain i love celebi the sultan waited for the sequel but as it came not he had recourse to his ring which he rubbd two or three times against his hat before he levelld it on egle but his labour was vain the toy repeated i love celebi and stopd short there is a very discreet toy said the sultan let us try once more and ply it closer whereupon he gave to his ring all the energy which it was capable of receiving and turnd it nimbly on egle but her toy continued mute it either constantly kept silence or broke it only by repeating these plaintive words i love celebi and have never loved any other man mangogul being thoroughly satisfied returned to mirzoza in fifteen minutes what prince said she returnd already well what have you learnt do you bring fresh matter for our conversations i bring nothing answered the sultan what nothing—nothing at all i never knew a toy so silent i could get nothing from it but these words i love celebi i love celebi and have never loved any other man ah prince replied mirzoza with vivacity what do you tell me what happy news there is one virtuous woman found at last will you suffer her to remain longer miserable no answered mangogul her banishment shall be at an end but have you no apprehensions that it may be at the expence of her virtue egle is chaste but consider my hearts delight what you require of me to recall her to my court in order that she may continue so however you shall be satisfied the sultan sent for celebi immediately and told him that having made a strict inquiry into the reports spread abroad concerning egle he had found them false and calumnious and commanded him to bring her back to court celebi obeyd and presented his wife to mangogul she was going to throw herself at his highnesss feet but the sultan stopping her said madam thank mirzoza her friendship for you determined me to clear up the truth of the facts imputed to you continue to embellish my court but remember that a pretty woman sometimes does herself as much mischief by acts of imprudence as by adventures the very next day egle waited on the manimonbanda who received her with a smile the petitsmaitres redoubled their insipidities towards her and the women all ran to embrace and give her joy and began again to tear her in pieces end of the first volume    chap xxxi was mangogul in the right from the time that mangogul had received the fatal present of cucufa the ridicules and vices of the sex were become the eternal subject of his jokes he was never done with them and his favorites patience was frequently quite tired out now two cruel effects of this teizing on her as well as on many others was to put her into a bad humor and to sour her temper at those times woe to him that came near her she made no distinction of persons and the sultan himself was not spared prince said she to him in one of these peevish fits tho you are so knowing in many things perhaps you do not know the news of the day——what is it said mangogul——it is that every morning you get by heart three pages of brantome or of ouville people do not determine which of these two profound writers you prefer——they are mistaken madam answered mangogul tis crebillon that——o pray dont excuse yourself from that sort of reading interrupted the favorite the new calumnies that are invented on us are so insipid that it is better to revive the old truly there are very good things in this same brantome if to these little stories you add three or four chapters of bayle you alone will in a thrice have as much wit as the marquiss d—— and the chevalier de mouhi that would spread a surprising variety on your conversation when you have equipped the ladies from head to foot you might then fall on the pagodas and from the pagodas you might return on the women in truth all that you want to make you quite diverting is a small collection of impieties you are in the right madam answered mangogul and i will take care to lay in a good stock he who is afraid of being duped in this world and the next cannot be too much upon his guard against the power of the pagodas the probity of men and virtue of women then in your opinion this virtue is a very ambiguous thing replied mirzoza more so than you imagine answered mangogul prince returned mirzoza you have a hundred times talkd to me of your ministers as the honestest men in congo i have so often patiently heard the praises of your seneschal of the governors of your provinces of your secretaries of your treasurer in a word of all your officers that i am able to repeat them by memory word for word it is strange that the object of your tenderness should be the only person excepted from the good opinion which you have conceived of those who have the honor of being near your person and who told you that it is so replied the sultan be perswaded madam that the discourses true or false which i make on women do by no means concern you unless you think proper to represent the sex in general—— i should not advise madam to that added selim who was present at this conversation she would gain nothing by it but defects i do not answered mirzoza relish compliments which are addressed to me at the expence of my sex when any one takes it into his head to praise me i could wish that nobody suffered by it most of the fine speeches which are offered to us are like the sumptuous entertainments which your highness receives from your pachas they are always at the expence of the public let us pass that by said mangogul but sincerely are you not convinced that the virtue of the women of congo is but a mere chimæra pray observe my souls delight what the present fashionable education is what examples mothers set to their daughters and how the head of a pretty woman is filled with the notion that to confine herself to domestic affairs to manage her family and keep to her husband is to lead a dismal life to be eat up with vapors and to bury herself alive and at the same time we men are so forward and a young unexperienced girl is so raptured with being attackd i have said that virtuous women were rare excessively rare and far from changing my sentiment i might add freely that tis surprizing they are not more so ask selim what he thinks of the matter prince answered mirzoza selim has too great obligations to our sex to tear them in pieces without mercy madam said selim his highness who could not possibly meet with cruel women ought naturally to think of the sex as he does and you who have the good nature to judge of others by yourself can hardly have any other sentiments than those which you defend i will own however that i am apt to believe there are women of sense to whom the benefits of virtue are known by experience and whom a serious reflection has convinced of the ill consequences of an irregular life women happily born well educated who have learnd to feel their duty who love it and will never swerve from it and not to lose ourselves in speculative reasoning added the favorite is not egle with all her sprightliness and charms a model of virtue prince you cannot doubt it and all banza knows it from your mouth now if there be one virtuous woman there may be a thousand oh as to the possibility said mangogul i dispute it not but if you allow it possible replied mirzoza who has revealed to you that they do not actually exist nothing but their toys answered the sultan and yet i grant that this evidence does not come up to the strength of your argument may i be transformd into a mole if you have not borrowed it from some bramin order the manimonbandas chaplain to be called and he will tell you that you have proved the existence of virtuous women much as he demonstrates that of brama in braminology a propos have you not taken a course in that sublime school before you entered the seraglio no illnatured jokes replied mirzoza i do not draw my conclusion from possibility i ground it on a fact on an experiment yes continued mangogul on a lame fact on a single experiment while to your certain knowledge i have a multitude of trials for my opinion but i will not sour your temper by farther contradictions it is a favor said mirzoza that after two hours teizing you cease to persecute me if i have committed the fault answered mangogul i will endeavour to make amends for it madam i give up all my past advantages and if in the trials which i shall hereafter make i light on a single woman really and constantly virtuous——what will you do interrupted mirzoza smartly i will declare to the world if you require it that i am charmed with your reasoning on the possibility of virtuous women i will support the reputation of your logic with all my might and will give you my castle of amara with all the saxon porcelaines which adorn it even without excepting the little sapajou or redfaced monkey in enamel and the other valuable nicknacks which i had out of the cabinet of madame de verue prince says mirzoza i will be content with the porcelaines of the castle and the little monkey a bargain replies the sultan selim shall be our judge i only desire a little respite before i examine egles toy the court air and her husbands jealousy must be allowed time to operate mirzoza granted a month to mangogul which was double the time he required and they parted equally filled with hope the city of banza also would have been full of wagers on either side if the sultans promise had been divulged but selim kept the secret and mangogul clandestinely prepared for winning or losing as he was quitting the favorites appartment he heard her call out to him from her closet prince and the little monkey and the little monkey answered mangogul and went out he was going directly to the private lodge of a senator whither we will attend him  chap xxxii the fifteenth trial of the ring alphana the sultan was not ignorant that the young lords of the court had private lodges but he was lately informed that those retreats were likewise used by some senators he was much surprized at this what do they do there said he to himself for in this volume he will keep up the custom of monology which he contracted in the first i should think that a man whom i have entrusted with the tranquillity fortune liberty and lives of my people ought not to have a private lodge but perhaps a senators private lodge is quite different from that of a petitmaitre can a magistrate before whom the interests of the greatest of my subjects are discussed who holds the fatal urn out of which he is to draw the widows lot can he i say forget the dignity of his state and the importance of his duty and while cochin fatigues his lungs in vain by carrying the cries of the orphan to his ear can he be studying subjects of gallantry which are to be ornaments over the door of a place of secret debauchery that cannot be——however let us see he said and departed for alcanto where the senator hippomanes has his private lodge he enters walks round the appartments and examines the furniture every thing has a gay appearance the private lodge of agefilas the nicest and most voluptuous of his courtiers is not more elegant he was on the point of resolving to leave it without knowing what to think for besides all the rich beds the lookingglass alcoves the soft sofas the cabinet of exquisite liquors and every thing else were silent witnesses of what he desired to know when he espied a corpulent figure stretched on a couch and sunk in a deep sleep he turnd his ring on her and from her toy he obtained the following anecdotes alphana is the daughter of a senator if her mothers life had been shorter than it was i should not have been here the immense wealth of the family was squandered by the old fool and she left little or nothing to her four children three boys and a girl whose toy i am alas to my great misfortune and to be sure for my sins how many indignities have i suffered how many more still remain to be borne the world said that the cloister agreed very well with the fortune and figure of my mistress but i found it did not suit with me i preferred the military art to the monastic state and i made my first campaigns under the emir azalaph i perfected myself under the great nangazaki but the ingratitude of the service disgusted me and made me quit the sword for the gown thus i am upon the point of belonging to a little scoundrel of a senator quite bloated with his talents his wit his figure his equipage and his birth i am now two hours in waiting for him to be sure he will come because his gentleman has apprized me that when he comes it is his madness to let people wait a long time alphanas toy was thus far advanced when hippomanes arrived at the bustle of his train and the caresses he bestowed on his favorite greyhound alphana awoke oh are you there my queen says the little president tis very difficult to come at you how do you like my little lodge it is as good as some others is it not alphana putting on a bashful shy distressed air as if we had never seen a private lodge before says her toy and as if i had no share in her adventures cried out in a mournful manner my lord president i take an unaccountable step for you the passion that drags me to you must surely be very violent since it shuts my eyes to the dangers which i incur for what would the world say if there was any suspicion of my being here you are right answered hippomanes your proceeding is liable to misinterpretations but you may rely on my discretion but replied alphana i rely also on your conduct oh as to that says hippomanes i shall be very modest and how is it possible not to be as devote as an angel in a private lodge in truth you have a charming neck—— ha done says alphana you break your word already not at all replies the president but you have not answered my question what do you think of this furniture and then turning to his greyhound come hither folly give me thy paw my child folly is a good girl——will madam be pleased to take a turn in the garden let us walk on my terrass it is a charming one i am overlooked by some of my neighbours but possibly they will not know you— my lord president i am not curious says alphana with an air of dudgeon i think we are better here just as you please answers hippomanes if you are tired there is a bed if you have the least inclination i advise you to try it young asteria and little phenice who are great judges assure me that it is a good one while hippomanes was talking thus impertinently to alphana he pulld off her gown by the sleeves unlaced her stays untied her petticoats and disengaged her two clumsy feet from two little slippers when alphana was almost naked then did she perceive that hippomanes was undressing her—what are you doing cryed she quite surprized president you dont consider i shall be angry in earnest ah my queen answered hippomanes to be angry with a man who loves you as i do would be such an oddity as you are not capable of may i presume to entreat you to walk to this bed to this bed replied alphana ah my lord president you abuse my tenderness i to go into a bed i into a bed no no my queen answered hippomanes that is not the thing who desires you to go to it but you must if you please suffer yourself to be conducted to it for you may easily conclude from your size that i cannot be in the humor of carrying you to it—nevertheless he grasped her about the waist and making some efforts oh how weighty she is says he but my child if you do not lend a helping hand we shall never reach it alphana was sensible that he spoke truth lent her assistance compassed getting on her legs advanced towards that bed at which she had been so scared partly on her own feet and partly on the shoulders of hippomanes to whom she pantingly said surely i must have been a great fool to come hither i confided in your good conduct and your extravagance is quite unreasonable—not at all answered the president not at all you see that what i do is decent very decent tis probable that they said many other genteel things of this sort but as the sultan did not think proper to spend more time in attending their conversation those things are lost to posterity what a pity  chap xxxiii sixteenth trial of the ring the petitsmaitres twice a week the favorite kept a drawing room the preceding evening she named the women whom she would willingly see and the sultan gave the list of the men the company always came richly dressd the conversation was either general or particular when the amorous history of the court faild of furnishing real diverting adventures stories were invented and necessity sometimes compelled them to run into bad tales which were called a continuation of the arabian nights entertainments the men had the privilege of saying all the extravagant things that came into their heads and the women that of knotting while they gave ear to them at these meetings the sultan and his favorite put themselves on a level with their subjects their presence gave no sort of check to whatever could amuse and people seldom found the time tedious mangogul had learned early in his life that pleasures are not to be found above the foot of the throne and no man descended from it with better grace or knew how to put off majesty more à propos while he was surveying the private lodge of the senator hippomanes mirzoza waited for him in the rosecolourd salon with the youthful zaide the chearful leocris the lively serica amina and benzaira the wives of two emirs orphisa the prude and vetula the great seneschals lady temporal mother of all the bramins it was not long before he appeared he enterd attended by count hannetillon and the chevalier fadaes alciphenor an old rake and his disciple young marmolin followed him and two minutes after arrived the pacha grifgrif the aga fortimbek and the selictar velvetpaw these were the most absolute petitsmaitres of the court mangogul calld them together designedly having heard a thousand stories of their gallant exploits he resolved to be informed in such a manner as might banish all future doubt well gentlemen says he to them ye whom nothing escapes that passes in the empire of gallantry what news from thence how far are the speaking toys got sir replied alciphenor the racket they make encreases daily and if it continues we shall soon not be able to hear ourselves but nothing is so diverting as the indiscretion of zobeidas toy it has given her husband a catalogue of her adventures and a prodigious one says marmolin it mentions five agas twenty captains almost an entire company of janissaries twelve bramins and they say that i am named too but that is a mere joke the best past of the affair is added grifgrif that the affrighted husband ran away with his fingers in his ears this is quite horrible said mirzoza yes madam interrupted fortimbek horrible frightful execrable more than all that if you please replied the favorite to dishonor a woman upon hearsay madam it is literally true marmolin has not added one word to the story says velvetpaw it is fact says grifgrif good says hannetillon there is an epigram already handed about concerning it and an epigram is not made for nothing but why should marmolin be safe from the prattle of the toys cynaras toy has insisted on speaking in its turn and to blend me with people who do not stake their all but how to help that the right thing is not to be disturbed at it says velvetpaw you are right answered hannetillon and instantly fell to singing mon bonheur fut si grand que jai peine à le croire my fortune was so great that i can scarce believe it  count says mangogul to hannetillon then you have been particularly acquainted with cynara sir answered velvetpaw who doubts it he has walkd with her for more moons than one they have been songd and all this would have lasted to this day if he had not at length discovered that she was not handsome and that she had a large mouth allowed replied hannetillon but that imperfection was ballanced by an uncommon agreeableness how long since this adventure askd the prude orphisa madam replied hannetillon its epoch is not present to my memory i must have recourse to the chronological tables of my good fortune there may be seen the day and minute but tis a large volume with which my servants amuse themselves in the antichamber hold says alciphenor i recollect that it was precisely a year after grifgrif fell out with madam la seneschale she has the memory of an angel and can tell you exactly—that nothing is more false than your date answered the seneschals lady gravely tis well known that blockheads were never of my taste yet madam replied alciphenor you will never persuade us that marmolin was excessively wise when he was conducted into your appartment by the back stairs whenever his highness summoned the seneschal to council there can be no greater extravagance in my opinion added velvetpaw than to enter into a womans chamber by stealth for nothing at all for people thought nothing more of his visits than what was really fact and madam was already in full enjoyment of that reputation of virtue which she has so well supported since that time but that is an age ago says fadaes it was pretty much about that same time that zulica made a slip from the selictar who was her humble servant to take possession of grifgrif whom she dropd six months after she is now got as far as fortimbek i am not sorry for my friends little stroke of good luck i see her i admire her but entirely without any pretensions yet zulica says the favorite is very amiable she has wit taste and something i know not how engaging in her countenance which i should prefer to charms i grant that madam answerd fadaes but she is maigre has no neck and her thigh is so skinny that it raises ones pity you are well acquainted with it to be sure added the sultana oh madam replied hannetillon you may guess that i have visited zulica but seldom and yet i know as much of that affair as fadaes i can easily believe you says the favorite but à propos might one ask grifgrif says the selictar if he has been long in possession of zirphila there is what you may call a pretty woman she has an admirable shape and who doubts it added marmolin how happy is the selictar continued fadaes i give you fadaes interrupted the selictar for the best provided gallant of the court to my knowledge he has the visirs wife the two prettiest actresses of the opera and an adorable grisette whom he keeps in his private lodge and i replied fadaes would give up the visirs wife the two actresses and the grisette for one glance from a certain woman with whom the selictar is very well and who has not the least suspicion that the world knows it and then stepping up to leocris says your blushes are ravishing—— hannetillon was a long time wavering says marmolin between melissa and fatima two charming women one day he was for melissa the fair the next for fatima the nutbrown the poor man continues fadaes was strangely embarassed why did he not take them both so he did says alciphenor our petitsmaitres were as you see in a right cue not to stop here when zobeida cynara zulica melissa fatima and zirphila sent in their names this illtimed circumstance disconcerted them for a moment but they soon recoverd from their ruffle and fell on other women whom their detraction had hitherto spared only because they had not time to tear them to pieces mirzoza quite out of patience at their discourses said gentlemen considering the merit and probity in particular which must needs be allowed ye it cannot be doubted but that you have enjoyed all the good fortunes of which you boast i must own nevertheless that i would be very glad to hear the toys of these ladies on this head and that i would most heartily thank brama if he would deign to render justice to truth by their mouths that is to say replies hannetillon that madam would desire to hear the same things twice over well to oblige her well repeat them but mangogul set about applying his ring in order of seniority he began by madame la seneschale whose toy coughd three times and with a trembling and broken voice said to the great seneschal i am indebted for the first fruits of my pleasures but i had not been his property above six months when a young bramin gave my mistress to understand that a woman can do no injury to her husband while she thinks on him i relished the moral and thenceforward thought i might with a safe conscience admit a senator then a privy counsellor then a pontif then one or two masters of requests then a musician——and marmolin says fadaes——marmolin replies the toy i know him not unless it be that young coxcomb whom my lady ordered to be kickd out of her house for some insolence the particulars of which i have forgot—— cynaras toy took up the discourse and said do you interrogate me concerning alciphenor fadaes and grifgrif i have indeed been pretty well served but this is the first time that i ever heard these folks named however i shall get some account of them from amalek the emir telenor the financier or the visir abdiram who know the whole world and are my good friends cynaras toy is discreet says hannetillon it mentions not zarafis ahiram the old trebister and the young mahmoud who is not made to be forgotten nor does it accuse the least bramin tho it has been running thro the monasteries these twelve years i have received some visits in my life says melissas toy but not one from grifgrif or fortimbek and much less still from hannetillon my little heart of a toy replied grifgrif you are mistaken you may disclaim fortimbek and me but as to hannetillon he is better with you than you allow he has told me a word or two on the subject and he is a spark of the greatest veracity in congo a better man than any of those whom you have known and is still capable of establishing the reputation of a toy the reputation of an impostor can no more escape him than his friend fadaes says fatimas toy with a sob what have i done to these monsters to dishonour me the son of the abyssinian emperor came to erguebzeds court i pleased him he pursued me but he would have faild of success and i should have continued faithful to my husband whom i loved had not the traitor velvetpaw and his base accomplice fadaes corrupted my women and introduced the young prince into my bath the toys of zirphila and zulica who had the same cause to defend spoke both at the same time but with such rapidity that it was extremely difficult to render each of them its due—favors cried one——to velvetpaw says the other——something may be said for zinzim——cerbelon——bemengel——agarias——the french slave riqueli——the young ethiopian thezaca——but as for the insipid velvetpaw——the insolent fadaes——i swear by brama——i call the great pagoda and the genius cucufa to witness——i know them not——i never had the least dealings with them—— zirphila and zulica would have run on god knows how far if mangogul had not turnd off his ring but as this magic ring ceased acting on them their toys closed their lips and a profound silence succeeded the noise they made then the sultan rose up and darting furious looks on our young blockheads said you have taken the liberty to defame women whom you never had the honour of coming near and who hardly know your names who has made ye insolent enough to lie in my presence tremble wretches at these words he grasped his cymeter but the screams of the affrighted ladies stopd his hand i was going says mangogul to give ye the death which you have merited but the ladies whom you have injured have a right to determine your fate it shall depend on them either to crush ye or to let ye live speak ladies what are your commands that they live says mirzoza and hold their tongues if possible live replies the sultan these ladies permit it but if ever you forget on what condition i swear by my fathers soul—— mangogul did not complete his oath being interrupted by one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber who informd him that the comedians were ready this prince had imposed it on himself as a law never to retard the public diversions let them begin says he and immediately gave his hand to the favorite whom he accompanied to her box  chap xxxiv seventeenth trial of the ring the comedy had the taste of good declamation been known in congo there were some comedians who might well be spared of thirty persons which composed the band there was but one great actor and two tolerable actresses the genius of authors was obliged to comply with the mediocrity of the greatest number and there was no room to hope that a play would be performed with any tolerable success without taking care to model the characters on the defects of the comedians this is what was meant in my time by the custom of the stage formerly the actors were made for the pieces but now the pieces were made for the actors if you offerd a new play to be sure it underwent an examination to know whether the subject was engaging the intrigue well connected the characters supported and the diction pure and flowing but if there were no parts for roscius and amiana it was refused the kislar agasi superintendant of the sultans pleasures had packed a company of players together as he could find them and this was the first representation of a new tragedy at the seraglio it was composed by a modern author who had gaind such reputation that tho his piece had been but a string of impertinences it would assuredly have met with a favorable reception but he did not debase his character his work was well written his scenes conducted with art his incidents managed with dexterity the interest went on increasing and the passions in being developed the acts naturally linkd together and full constantly held the audience in suspence with regard to the sequel and satisfied with what was past and they were got to the fourth act of this masterpiece to a very moving scene which was a preparation to another still more interesting when mangogul in order to save himself from the ridicule of listening to the tender parts pulld out his glass and acting the inattentive surveyed the several boxes in the front box he observed a woman in great emotion but of an illtimed sort as having no relation to the piece his ring was instantly levelled at her and in the midst of most pathetic commendations a toy panting for breath was heard addressing the player in these terms ah——ah——pray stop orgogli——you melt me excessively——ah——ah——theres no bearing it—— the audience listened and lookd towards the place whence the voice proceeded and the word ran thro the pit that it was a toy that made the speech which toy says one and what has it said and without waiting for an answer there was a general clap and cry encore encore the author who was behind the scenes fearing that this unlucky accident might interrupt the representation of his piece foamed with rage and gave the whole race of toys to belzebub the noise was great and lasting and had it not been for the respect due to the sultan the play would have stopd short at this incident but mangogul made a sign for silence the actors resumed their parts and went thro the play the sultan curious to know the consequences of so public a declaration caused the toy that made it to be observed word was soon brought him that the player was to go from the stage to eriphilas house he prevented him thanks to the power of his ring and was in this ladys appartment when orgogli sent in his name eriphila was under arms that is in an amorous deshabillé and wantonly stretchd on a couch the comedian entered with a solemn haughty insipid air of a conqueror with the left hand he waved a plain hat with a white feather in it and caressed his nostrils and upper lip with the tops of the fingers of his right hand a very theatrical gesture which was admired by connoisseurs his bow was cavalier and his compliment familiar oh my queen cried he in an affected tone stooping to eriphila what a trim you are in but do you know that in that careless garb you are adorable—— the tone of this scoundrel shockd mangogul the prince was young and might possibly be ignorant of certain customs——then you like me my dear answered eriphila to ravishment i tell you—that gives me great joy i wish you would repeat that passage which raised such emotions in me a while ago that passage——there——yes——it is that same——how seducing a rogue he is——but go on that moves me strangely in pronouncing these words eriphila darted such glances on her hero as bespoke every thing and stretchd out her hand to him which the impertinent orgogli kissed by way of acquittance prouder of his talent than of his conquest he declaimed with emphasis and the lady was so enrapturd that one minute she conjurd him to continue and the next to stop mangogul judging by her looks that her toy would willingly play its part in this rehearsal chose rather to guess at the rest of the scene than to be present at it he disappeard and returnd to the favorite who expected him on the recital which the sultan made her of this adventure——prince what do you say cried she then the women are fallen into the lowest degree of meanness a comedian the slave of the public a buffoon well if those folks had nothing against them but their state of life but most of them have neither morals nor sentiments and even among them that orgogli is but a machine he has never thought and if he had not learnd some parts in plays perhaps he would never have spoken—— delight of my heart replied mangogul you run into lamentations without considering the matter sufficiently then have you forgot harias pack by jove a comedian i think is as good as a pugdog you say right prince resumed the favorite i am a fool for interesting myself for creatures that do not deserve it let palabria idolize her boobies let salica have her vapors treated by farfadi in her own way let haria live and dye among her dogs let eriphila abandon herself to all the buffoons of congo what is all this to me i only risque a castle thereby nay i perceive that i must have no thoughts of it and i have taken my resolution accordingly farewell then the little monkey says mangogul farewell the little monkey replies mirzoza and the good opinion which i had conceived of my sex i believe i shall never resume it prince you will allow me not to suffer a women to enter these doors this fortnight at least but you must have some company added the sultan i shall enjoy your company or please myself in expecting it replied the favourite and if any moments remain on my hands i shall dispose of them in favor of ricaric and selim who are attached to me and whose conversation i love when i happen to be tired of the erudition of my lecturer your courtier will divert me with the adventures of his youth  chap xxxv conversation on literature the favorite loved men of genius without pretending to be a genius herself on her toilette among jewels and other female ornaments the novels and pamphlets of the time were to be met with and she talkd of them wonderfully well from a cavagnol and biribi she passed with ease and propriety to the course of an academician or other learned man and every body confessed that the natural delicacy of her understanding made her discover beauties or defects in those several works which had sometimes escaped their lucubrations mirzoza astonished them by her penetration embarrassed them by her questions but never abused the advantages which her wit and beauty gave her and people were not sorry for being detected in the wrong by her towards the close of an evening which she had passed with mangogul selim came and she sent for ricaric the african author has reserved selims character for another place but he informs us here that ricaric was a member of the academy of congo that his erudition had not hindered him from being a man of wit that he had acquired a profound knowledge of former ages that he had a scrupulous attachment to the ancient rules which he cited eternally that he was a machine by principles and that it was impossible to be a more zealous partisan of the first writers of congo but more especially of one miroufla who about  0 0 years before had composed a sublime poem in the caffrian language on the conquest of a great forest out of which the caffres expelled the monkeys who were in possession of it from time immemorial ricaric had translated it into congese and published a very beautiful edition of it illustrated with notes scholia various readings and all the embellishments of a benedictine edition besides they had of him two bad tragedies writ according to all the rules a panegyric on crocodiles and some operas i bring you madam says ricaric with a low bow a novel which is ascribed to the marchioness tamazi but in which we unluckily discover the hand of mulhazen the answer of our president lambadago to the discourse of the poet tuxigraphus which we received yesterday and the tamerlan of this last this is admirable says mangogul the press goes on incessantly and if the husbands of congo performed their duty as well as the writers in less than ten years i might be enabled to set sixteen hundred thousand men on foot and promise myself the conquest of monoémugi we will read the novel at leisure now let us see the harangue especially that part which relates to me ricaric turnd it over and light on this passage the ancestors of our august emperor have rendered themselves illustrious without doubt but mangogul greater than they has prepared quite different subjects of admiration for future ages what do i say of admiration let us speak more accurately of incredulity if our ancestors had cause to assert that posterity would esteem as fables the wonders of kanaglous reign how much more reason have we to think that our descendants will refuse credit to the prodigies of wisdom and valor of which we are witnesses my poor mr lambadago says the sultan you are but retailer of phrases what i have reason to believe is that your successors will one day eclipse my glory by that of my son as you make my fathers vanish before mine and so on as long as there will be one academician left what think you mr ricaric prince all that i can say answered ricaric is that the passage which i have read to your highness was extremely relished by the public so much the worse replied mangogul then the true taste of eloquence is lost in congo it was not thus that the sublime homilogo praised the great aben prince said ricaric true eloquence is nothing but the art of speaking in a noble and at the same time agreeable and perswasive manner add and sensible continued the sultan and upon this principle judge your friend lambadago with all the respect that i have for modern eloquence he is but a false declaimer but prince answered ricaric without passing the bounds of that which i owe your highness will you permit me—— what i give you full permission to do replied mangogul smartly is to respect good sense beyond my highness and to tell me sincerely if an eloquent man can ever dispense himself from shewing some signs of it no prince answered ricaric and he was going to string up a long beadroll of authorities and cite all the rhetoricians of afric the two arabias and china in order to prove the most incontestable thing in the world when he was interrupted by selim all your authors said the courtier will never prove that lambadago is not a very awkward and indecent haranguer pray mr ricaric excuse these expressions i honour you in a singular manner but indeed laying aside the prejudice of confraternity can you avoid allowing with us that as the sultan now reigning is just amiable beneficent and a great warrior he does not stand in need of the embroidery of your rhetoricians to be as great as his ancestors and that a son who is exalted by depressing his father and grandfather would be very ridiculously vain if he were not sensible that in embellishing him with one hand he is disfigured by the other in order to prove that mangogul is as wellmade a man as any of his predecessors do you think it necessary to knock off the heads of the statues of erguebzed and kanaglou mr ricaric says mirzoza selim is in the right let every one enjoy what belongs to him and let us not make the public suspect that our panegyrics are a sort of robberies committed on the memory of our fathers declare this from me in the next full meeting of the academy people are too long in possession of this custom replied selim to expect any benefit from this advice i believe sir that you are mistaken said ricaric to selim the academy is still the sanctuary of good taste and its best times do not afford us either philosophers or poets whom we cannot match at this day our stage has passed and may still pass for the first stage of africa oh what a work is the tamerlane of tuxigraphus tis the pathetic of eurisope and the loftiness of azopha tis antiquity quite pure i saw said the favorite the first representation of tamerlane and join with you in thinking the work well conducted the dialogue elegant and the propriety of characters well observed what difference madam interrupted ricaric between such an author as tuxigraphus fatted with the perusal of the ancients and most part of our moderns yet these moderns said selim whom you demolish here at your ease are not so contemptible as you pretend what dont you find genius invention fire details characters and fine strokes of wit in them and of what importance are rules to me provided a writer pleases me certainly it is neither the observations of the wise almudir and the learned abaldok nor the art of poetry of the deepread facardin which i have never perused that makes me admire the pieces of aboulcazem muhardar albaboukre and many other sarracens is there any other rule but the imitation of nature and have we not as good eyes as those who studied her nature answered ricaric presents us with different faces every instant they are all true but all are not equally beautiful it is in these works on which you seem not to set any great value that we should learn to choose they are collections of their own experiments and also of those which had been made before them whatever strength of understanding a person may have things must be observed successively and one man cannot hope to see in the short course of his life all that had been discovered to his time otherwise we may assert that any one science might owe its birth progress and utmost perfection to one head which is contrary to experience mr ricaric replied selim the only consequence that i can draw from your argument is that as the moderns are in possession of treasures amassed up to their times they must be richer than the ancients or if this comparison displeases you that as they are raised on the shoulders of those giants they ought to see farther than them and in fact what is their natural philosophy their astronomy their navigation their mechanics their calculations in comparison of ours and why may not our eloquence and poesy have the superiority likewise selim said the sultana ricaric will at some proper time give you the reasons of this difference he will tell you why our tragedy is inferior to that of the ancients for my part i willingly undertake to shew you that it is so i will not accuse you continued she of not having read the ancients your mind is too well adorned to be ignorant of their stage now abstracting from certain notions relative to their customs manners and religion which shock you purely because circumstances are changed you will allow that their subjects are noble wellchosen and interesting that the action naturally develops itself that their dialogue is simple and very near nature that the unravelling of their plot is not strained that the interest is not divided nor the action overloaded with episodes transport yourself in idea to the isle of alindala examine every thing that passes there attend to all that is said from the moment that young ibrahim and the crafty forfanti landed thereon approach the cave of the wretched polipsile lose not a word of her complaints and then tell me if any one circumstance draws you out of the illusion name me a modern piece that can bear the same examination and pretend to the same degree of perfection and i grant you the victory by brama cried the sultan yawning madam has made an academical dissertation i do not understand the rules continued the favorite and much less the learned words in which they are expressed but i know that nothing but the true can please and touch i also know that the perfection of a dramatic piece consists in the exact imitation of an action so that the spectator continually deceived imagines he is present at the very action now pray is there any thing like this in the tragedies which you extol to us do you admire the manner in which they are conducted it is generally so complicated that it must be a miracle that so many things should happen in so little time the ruin or preservation of an empire the marriage of a princess the loss of a prince all this is done with the turn of a hand is the subject a conspiracy it is sketchd out in the first act it is connected and strengthened in the second all the measures are taken the obstacles removed the conspirators are quite ready for action in the third immediately there shall be a revolt an engagement perhaps a pitchd battle and you will call this conduct interest fire verisimilitude i can never excuse it in you especially who are not ignorant what it sometimes costs to put an end to a pitiful intrigue and how much time the smallest political affair absorbs in taking measures in previous meetings and in deliberations i grant madam answered selim that our pieces are a little overcharged but it is a necessary evil without the assistance of episodes the audience would be chilld that is to say that in order to give spirit to the representation of a fact it must be made such as it neither is nor ought to be this is ridiculous in the highest degree unless it be still more absurd to make the violins play up rigadoons and countrydances while the audience are in deep concern for a prince who is on the point of losing his mistress his throne and his life madam you are are in the right said mangogul the music should be mournful on those occasions and i go to order you some of that kind mangogul rose up went out and the conversation was continued between selim ricaric and the favorite at least madam replied selim you will not deny that if the episodes draw us out of the illusion the dialogue leads us back into it i see none who understand it like our tragic writers then nobody understands it resumed mirzoza the emphasis wit and affected decorations which predominate in it are a thousand leagues distant from nature in vain does the author endeavour to conceal himself my eyes are penetrating and i discover him incessantly behind the persons of the drama cinna sertorius maximus and æmilius are corneilles speaking trumpets in almost every page this is not the way that people converse in our ancient sarracen authors ricaric will if you desire it translate you some scenes out of them and then you will hear pure nature speaking by their mouths i could willingly say to the moderns gentlemen instead of dealing out wit to your personages on every occasion put them into such circumstances as must inspire them with some after what madam has declared on the management and the dialogue of our dramas there is no great probability says selim that she will shew indulgence to the plots no certainly replied the favorite there are a hundred bad for one good this is not brought on properly that is quite miraculous is an author encumbered with a personage which he has dragd from scene to scene thro five acts he dispatches him with a stab of a ponyard every body falls to crying and i burst into laughter besides did mortals ever speak as we declaim do kings and princes walk otherwise than a wellbred man have they ever gesticulated like persons possessed or raging mad do princesses speak in a shrill squeaking tone it is generally supposed that we have carried tragedy to a high degree of perfection and i on the contrary think it is next to demonstration that of all the kinds of literary works to which the africans have applied themselves in these latter ages this is the most imperfect the favorite was advanced thus far in her sally against our theatrical pieces when mangogul returned madam said he you will oblige me in continuing you see i have a secret to abridge a poetical subject when i find it tedious i suppose continued the favorite a person just arrived from angola who had never heard a play mentioned but otherwise does not want good sense and breeding has some acquaintance with the courts of princes the intrigues of courtiers the jealousies of ministers and the double dealings of women to whom i say in confidence my friend there are terrible commotions actually in the seraglio the prince dissatisfied with his son in whom he suspects a passion for the manimonbanda is a man capable of taking the most cruel vengeance of them both this adventure will in all probability be attended with dismal consequences if you choose it i will make you an eyewitness of all that passes he accepts my offer and i carry him into a box screend by a blind from whence he sees the stage which he takes for the sultans palace do you believe notwithstanding the serious air i put on that this persons illusion can last a moment will you not rather agree with me that the stiffaffected carriage of the actors the oddity of their dress the extravagance of their gestures the emphasis of a singular language in rhyme and cadence and a thousand other shocking dissonances must make him laugh in my face before the first scene is over and tell me either that i make game of him or that the prince and all his court are mad i own said selim that this supposition strikes me but may i not observe to you that people go to the playhouse fully perswaded that they are to see the imitation of an event and not the event itself and ought that perswasion replied mirzoza to hinder the players from representing the event in the most natural manner all this means madam interrupted mangogul that you put yourself at the head of the censors and if your opinion be received continued selim the empire is threatened with the decay of good taste barbarism will revive and we are in danger of relapsing into the ignorance of the ages of mamurrha and orondado my lord pray have no such apprehensions i hate peevish humors and will not add to their number besides i have the glory of his highness too much at heart to think of ever attempting to tarnish the splendor of his reign but if credit were given to us is it not true mr ricaric that literature would shine with greater lustre how said mangogul have you not a memorial on this subject to present to my seneschal no sir answered ricaric but after having thanked your highness in behalf of the literati for the new inspector which you have given them i would most humbly remonstrate to your seneschal that the choice of learned men appointed to revise manuscripts is an affair of great nicety that this trust is committed to persons who seem to me very much inferior to their employ and from thence results a crowd of evil effects such as curtailing good works cramping the best geniuss who not being at liberty to write in their own way either write not at all or send their productions with considerable sums to foreigners giving a bad opinion of those topicks which are prohibited to be discussed and a thousand other inconveniencies which it would be too tedious to mention to your highness i would advise him to retrench the pensions of certain literary leaches who are always craving unmercifully i mean glossators antiquaries commentators and others of this stamp who would be very useful if they did their business well but who are got into the wretched custom of passing over obscure places and of dwelling upon passages that admit of no difficulty i would have him be very attentive to suppress almost all posthumous works and not to suffer the memory of a great author to be tarnished by the covetousness of a bookseller who collects and publishes a long time after a mans death such works as he had condemned to oblivion in his lifetime and i continued the favorite would point out to him a small number of men of distinguished merit such as mr ricaric on whom he may bestow your benefactions is it not somewhat surprising that the poor man has no provision made for him while the precious chiromancer of the manimonbanda receives a thousand sequins a year from your treasury well madam answered mangogul i assign mr ricaric the like sum on my coffers in consideration of the wonderful things you tell me of him mr ricaric said the favorite i also must do something for you in your favor i sacrifice the small resentment of my selflove and in consideration of the recompence which mangogul has granted to your merit i forget the injury he has done me pray madam may i ask you what that injury is replied mangogul you may sir and i will tell you you yourself make us embark in a conversation on the belleslettres you begin by a piece of modern eloquence which is not extraordinary and when to oblige you we prepare to pursue the disagreeable argument which you have started you are seized with uneasiness and yawning you teize yourself in your seat you change your posture a hundred times without finding one easy one tired in fine of keeping your countenance tho a sad one you come to a sudden resolution you get up and disappear and then whither do you go perhaps to give ear to a toy i own the fact madam but i see nothing in it that should give offence if a man happens to be disgusted at fine things and amuse himself with hearing bad so much the worse for him this unjust preference takes nothing from the merit of what he has quitted he only declares himself a bad judge to this i could add madam that while you were labouring hard at selims conversion i was working with no better success to procure you a castle in fine if i must be culpable since you have pronouncd me so i can assure you that you have had your revenge at the very time pray how that said the favorite thus it is answered the sultan in order to refresh myself from the fatigue of the academical sitting which i had undergone i went to examine some toys——well prince——well i never heard such insipid creatures as the two which i light upon——this gives me the highest joy replied the favorite——they both fell to talking an unintelligible language i have perfectly well retained every thing they said but let me die if i understand a word of it  chap xxxvi eighteenth and nineteenth trials of the ring the flatted spheroïd and girgiro the entangled catch who can that is singular continued the favorite till this moment i always imagined that the chief fault found with toys was their speaking too plainly oh madam replied mangogul these two are not of that tribe understand them who can you know that little crumpling of woman whose head is sunk into her shoulders whose arms are hardly to be seen and whose legs are so short and her belly so lank that one might mistake her for a hedgehog for a clumsy illdevelopd embryo who bears the the nickname of the flatted spheroïd who has filled her head with a notion that brama called her to the study of geometry because he has given her the figure of a bowl and who consequently might have chosen the profession of artillery for considering her make she must have issued out of natures bosom as a bullet out of the mouth of a cannon willing to receive informations from her toy i examined it but the vorticose creature spoke in terms of such sublime geometry that i did not understand one word nor perhaps did it understand its own language it was nothing but right lines concave surfaces given quantities longitude latitude profundity solids living forces dead forces cone cylinder conic sections curves elastic curves curve reentring into itself with its point conjugated—— i pray your highness to excuse me from the rest cried the favorite mournfully you have a cruel memory enough to put one to death it has raised a swimming in my head which i dare say i shall not get rid of these eight days but was the other so diverting you shall be the judge replied mangogul by bramas great toe i have performed a prodigy i have retaind its motly gibberish word for word tho it be so thoroughly void of sense and perspicuity that if you give me a subtile and critical explanation of it madam you will make me an acceptable present how have you said prince cried mirzoza let me die if you have not stolen that phrase from somebody i cant tell how it has happened replied mangogul for these two toys are the only persons to whom i have given audience this day the last on whom i turned my ring after a moments silence said as if addressing an audience gentlemen i shall take the liberty to avoid seeking to the contempt of my own reason a model of thinking and expressing myself but yet if i advance any thing new it shall not be affectation but the subject shall have furnished me with it if i repeat what has been already said it will be my own thought as well as it has been that of others let not irony come to turn this preamble into ridicule and accuse me of either not having read or of having read to no purpose a toy like me is not made for reading or profiting by its reading or foreseeing an objection or answering it i shall not debar myself of reflections and ornaments proportioned to my subject the rather because in this regard it is extremely modest and will not admit of any great quantity or brilliancy but i will avoid sinking into those little minute details which fall to the share of the barren orator it would be cause of great grief to me to be suspected of this defect after having informed ye gentlemen of what you are to expect from my discoveries and elocution some few strokes of the pencil will be sufficient to sketch you out my character you know gentlemen as well as i that there are two sorts of toys proud toys and modest toys the former are haughty and always expect the place of honour the latter affect to be courteous and present themselves with an air of submission these two intentions appear manifestly in the execution of their projects and determine both sorts to act according to the genius that guides them i imagined thro attachment to the prejudices of my first education that i should open to myself a safer easier and more agreeable career if i preferrd the part of humility to that of pride and i offered myself with infantile bashfulness and winning supplications to all whom i had the good fortune to meet but oh how unhappy are the times after ten times more buts and ifs and ands than were sufficient to make the most unemployed toy lose all patience my services were accepted alas this job was of short duration my first possessor giving himself up to the flattering glory of a new conquest discarded me and i found myself all at once out of employment my treasure was gone and i did not flatter myself that fortune would make me amends for it in effect the vacant place was occupied but not filled by a sexagenarian to whom good will was less wanting than the means he laboured with all his might to make me forget my past state he had for me all that behavior which is esteemed polite and engaging in the career that i pursued but his efforts did not conquer my regret if industry which is said never to fall short made him find in the treasures of the natural faculty some abatement to my grief this compensation to me appeared insufficient in spite of my imagination which was daily on the rack to find new resemblances and even to suppose imaginary ones but to no purpose such is the advantage of primacy that it seizes the idea and forms a barrier against every thing that would afterwards present itself under other forms and such is shall i say it to our shame the ungrateful nature of toys that they never take the goodwill for the deed this remark seems to me so natural that without being indebted to any body for it i cannot think that i am the only one who has made it but if any person before me has been struck with it at least gentlemen i am the first who undertake by demonstrating it to set its full value in a proper light i am far from laying the least blame to the charge of those who have raised their voice hitherto for having let this stroke escape them my selflove being abundantly satisfied to be able after so great a number of orators to present my observation as something new— ah prince cried mirzoza smartly i fancy i hear the chiromancer of the manimonbanda apply to him and you will have the subtile and critical explanation of which you would in vain expect the agreeable present from any other person the african author says that mangogul smiled and continued but i do not intend says he to relate the rest of his discourse if this beginning has not given as much amusement as the first pages of la fée taupe the sequel would be more tiresome than the last pages of the fée moustache  chap xxxvii mirzozas dream by the time that mangogul had finished the academical discourse of girgiro the entangled night came on and the company went to bed that night the favorite might well flatter herself with sleeping soundly but the evenings conversation ran in her head while asleep and its ideas mixing with others produced an odd dream which she did not fail relating to the sultan in these words i was in my first sleep when i imagined that i was transported into an immense gallery quite full of books i shall say nothing of their contents they were to me at that time what they are to many others who are not asleep i did not so much as look at one titlepage a more striking sight attracted my whole attention from space to space between the presses that containd the books there were pedestals on which were placed most beautiful bustos of marble and bronze the injury of time had spared them and some little defects excepted they were entire and perfect that nobleness and elegance which characterized the works of the ancients were stamped on them most of them had long beards large foreheads like yours and engaging countenances i was anxious to learn their names and know their merit when a woman came thro the casement of a window and accosted me her shape was genteel her gait majestic and her carriage noble sweetness and loftiness were blended in her looks and her voice had some inexpressible charm that delighted a helmet a coat of mail and a flowing petticoat made up all her attire i know your anxiety said she to me and am going to satisfy your curiosity the men whose bustos have struck you were my favorites they consecrated their studies to the perfection of the elegant arts whereof the invention is due to me they lived in the most polite countries of the world and their writings which were the delight of their contemporaries are the admiration of the present age draw near and you will see carved on the several pedestals in basso relievo some remarkable subjects which will at least point out to you the character of their writings the first busto which i examined was that of a majestic old man who seemd to have been blind in all probability he had sung of battles for such were the subjects on the sides of his pedestal the front was all taken up with a single figure which was that of a young hero his hand grasped the handle of his cymeter and a womans arm appeard holding him back by the hair of the head who seemd to moderate his wrath opposite to this bust was placed that of a young man he was the picture of modesty his looks were turned on the old man with uncommon attention he had also sung of wars and combats but these were not the only subjects that employed him for of the basso relievos which surrounded him the principal one represented on one side husbandmen stooping on their ploughs and tilling the ground on the other shepheards stretched on the grass and played on their flutes amidst their herds and dogs the busto placed below the old man on the same side had a wild look his eye seemd to pursue some object that was flying from him and under him were represented a lyre carelessly thrown aside scattered laurels broken chariots and fiery horses running away in a vast plain fronting this i saw a busto which made so deep an impression on me that i fancy i see him still he had a fine air an aquiline pointed nose a steady look and an arch smile the basso relievos which adorned his pedestal were so full of matter that it would be an endless task to undertake the description of them after examining some others i began to ask some questions of my guide who is that said i who bears truth on his lips and probity on his countenance he was replied she the friend and victim to both he spent his life in improving his fellow citizens in knowledge and virtue and these ingrateful citizens put him to death and this busto placed below him which that which appears supported by the graces carved on the sides of his pedestal the same—he is the disciple and inheriter of the sense and principles of the unfortunate virtuous man above mentioned and this lusty jolly fellow crowned with vine branches and myrtle who is he—a lovely philosopher who made it his sole business to sing and taste pleasure he died in the arms of voluptuousness and this other blind man—he is said she——but i waited not for her answer i imagined i was got among my acquaintance and hurried to a busto placed opposite to him this was posed on a trophy of different attributes of arts and sciences cupids sported among them on one of the sides of the pedestal on another was a group of the genii of politics history and philosophy on the third on one hand appeard two armies drawn up in battlearray astonishment and horror dwelt on every countenance blended with marks of admiration and pity these passions were probably excited by an object which was there expressd it was a young man expiring and by his side an aged warrior who pointed his sword to his own breast these figures were exquisitely beautiful and nothing could be more artfully touchd than the despair of the one and the mortal languor spread throughout the limbs of the other i drew nearer and under it i read this inscription in gold letters alas this was his son on the other hand was carved a furious sultan plunging a ponyard into the breast of a young person in sight of a multitude of people some turnd their heads aside others melted in tears and round this relievo were these words engraved is it you nerestan as i was passing to other bustos a sudden noise made me look back it was made by a band of men cloathd in long black gowns some carried censers which exhaled a gross vapor others had garlands of flowers in their hands gatherd without choice and disposed without taste they marchd up to the bustos and offered incense to them singing hymns in two unknown languages the smoak of their incense stuck to the bustos and the crowns of flowers put on them made a most ridiculous sight but the antiques soon resumed their beauty and i saw the crowns wither and fall shriveled on the ground there arose a quarrel amongst this set of barbarians because some of them had not bent the knee low enough in the opinion of others and they were on the point of coming to blows when my guide dispersed them with one look and reestablished tranquillity in her habitation scarcely were they eclipsed when i saw a long train of pigmies entering by an opposite door these little men were not two cubits high but in recompense they had very sharp teeth and very long nails they divided into several bands and fell on the bustos some endeavourd to scratch the basso relievos and the floor was strewed with the broken pieces of their nails others with greater insolence mounted on one anothers shoulders to the highth of the heads and gave them raps with their fists but what diverted me much was that these raps instead of reaching the nose of the bust rebounded on that of the pigmy in consequence of which upon a close inspection i found most of them to be flatnosed you see says my guide the impudence and chastisements of these myrmidons this war has lasted a long while and always to their disadvantage i use them with less severity than the black gowns the incense of the latter might possibly disfigure the bustos but the efforts of the former generally end in augmenting their beauty but as you have not above an hour or two to remain here i advise you to pass to other objects a great curtain opened that instant and i saw a work shop occupied by a different sort of pigmies these had neither teeth nor nails but in return they were armed with razors and scissers in their hands they held heads which seemed animated and they were very busy with these heads in cutting off the hair of one pulling off the nose and ears of another putting out the right eye of this the left of that and in dissecting almost all of them after this fine operation they viewed them attentively and smiled as if they thought them the prettiest heads in the world in vain did the heads send forth loud cries they scarcely deignd to make them any answer i heard one begging back its nose and remonstrating that it could not possibly appear in public without that piece my friend head replied the pigmy you are a fool that nose which you regret disfigured you it was long long—you never would have made your fortune with it but since it has been curtaild and pared you are charming and you will have many a spark after you while the fate of those heads moved my compassion at a distance i saw other more charitable pigmies who were crawling on the ground with spectacles on they were picking up noses and ears and fitting them to some old heads from which time had disengaged them there were some of them but those were few in number who succeeded the rest fixed the nose where the ear should be and the ear where the nose and this rendered the heads more disfigured than before being very desirous to know what all those things meant i askd my guide and she had just opend her lips in order to give me an answer when i awoke in a fright that was cruel says mangogul this female would have revealed a number of mysteries to you but in her stead i am of opinion that we ought to address ourselves to my juggler bloculocus who replied the favorite that silly fellow to whom you have granted the sole privilege of shewing the magic lanthorn in your court the same answered the sultan he will interpret your dream or no body can let bloculocus be called says mangogul  chap xxxviii twentyfirst and twentysecond trials of the ring fricamona and callipiga the african author does not inform us what became of mangogul while he waited for bloculocus tis very probable that he went out catechized some toys and that satisfied with the intelligence he received from them he returned to the favorite sending forth shouts of joy which begin this chapter victory victory cried he you triumph madam the castle the porcelains and the little sapajou are yours tis egle without doubt replied the favorite no madam no tis not egle interrupted the sultan but another female prince says the favorite envy me no longer the comfort of knowing this phoenix——well tis who would have thought it it is says the favorite——fricamona replies mangogul——fricamona says mirzoza i see no impossibility in that this woman has spent the greatest part of her youth in a convent and since she left it she has led the most edifying and most retired life imaginable no man has set his foot within her doors and she has in some measure made herself the abbess of a troop of young devotees whom she trains up to a state of perfection and of whom her house does not grow thin there was nothing there to answer your purpose added the favorite smiling and nodding her head madam you are in the right says mangogul i have interrogated her toy but no answer i doubled the virtue of my ring by rubbing it once and again nothing came of it to be sure said i to myself this toy must be deaf and i was preparing to leave fricamona on the couch where i found her when she began to speak by the mouth i mean dear acaris cried she how happy am i in those moments which i snatch from every thing that employs me to deliver myself up to thee after those which i pass in thy arms these are the sweetest of my life——nothing disturbs me around me all is silence my curtains not quite closed let in but just as much day as is necessary for moving me to tenderness and gazing on thee i command my imagination it calls thee forth and immediately i see thee dear acaris how beautiful thou appearst to me——yes those are thy eyes thy smile thy mouth hide not that growing bosom from me——let me kiss it——i have not sufficiently gazed on it—let me kiss it again ah let me die on it——what fury seizes me——acaris dear acaris where art thou——come then dear acaris ah dear and tender friend i swear to thee that unknown sentiments have taken possession of my soul it is filled with them it is astonished at them it is not able to contain them——flow delightful tears flow and ease the ardor which devours me——no dear acaris no that alizali whom thou preferst to me will not love thee as i do—but i hear a noise—ah tis acaris without doubt——come dear female friend come—— fricamona was not deceived continued mangogul for it was acaris herself i left them to entertain each other and firmly perswaded that fricamonas toy would persevere in its discretion i hurried to let you know that i have lost my wager but replied the sultana i am quite in the dark with regard to this fricamona either she must be mad or she is cruelly afflicted with vapors no prince no i have more conscience than you may imagine i have nothing to object to this experiment but yet i perceive somewhat in it that hinders me from reaping any advantage by it and i am resolved to reap none if ever i accept your castle and porcelaines it must be upon a better title madam answered mangogul i do not comprehend you you are inconceivably difficult sure you have not well examined the little sapajou prince i have thoroughly viewed it replied mirzoza i know it is a charming thing but i suspect that this fricamona is not the person i seek if you desire that i should enjoy it one day or other apply elsewhere faith madam says mangogul after mature consideration i see none but mirolos mistress that can make you win the wager ah prince you dream answered the favorite i am not acquainted with your mirolo but whosoever he be since he has a mistress he does not keep her for nothing very true says mangogul and yet i would lay another wager that callipigas toy knows nothing at all pray be consistent with yourself continued the favorite of two things one must happen either that callipigas toy——but i was embarking in a ridiculous argument—prince do whatever you think proper consult callipigas toy if it keep silence so much the worse for mirolo and the better for me mangogul departed and found himself in an instant close to the jonquil sopha embroidered with silver on which callipiga was reposing scarcely had he turned his ring on her but he heard an obscure voice which mutterd out the following discourse what do you ask me i do not comprehend your questions i am not as much as thought of and yet i fancy i am as good as another mirolo it is true often passes by my door but—— there is a considerable deficiency in this place the republic of letters would certainty have great obligations to the person who would restore the discourse of callipigas toy of which we have only the two last lines remaining we invite the learned to study them and consider whether this deficiency be not a voluntary omission of the author dissatisfied with what he had said and who yet found nothing better to say ——it is said that my rival has altars beyond the alps alas were it not for mirolo the whole universe would erect some to me mangogul returned immediately to the seraglio and repeated to the favorite the complaint of callipigas toy word for word for he had a wonderful memory every circumstance of this story madam said he concurs to make you win i give up the whole wager and you will thank callipiga when you shall think proper sir answered mirzoza seriously tis to the most confirmed virtue that i am resolved to be obliged for the wager and not—— but madam replied the sultan i know of none better confirmed than that which has seen the enemy so near and for my part prince replied the favorite i understand my own meaning well and here come selim and bloculocus who shall be our judges selim and bloculocus entered mangogul stated the case to them and they both gave judgment in mirzozas favor  chap xxxix dreams my lord said the favorite to bloculocus you must render me another piece of service last night a crowd of extravagant fancies disturbed my head it was a dream of a very odd kind and i have been assured that you are the most able person of congo in decyphering dreams then give me quickly the interpretation of this and withal she related her own madam answered bloculocus i am but a middling oneirocritic——pray spare these terms of art cried the favorite drop your learning and talk reason to me madam you shall be obeyed i have some singular notions relating to dreams and to this alone perhaps i am indebted for the honour of conversing with you and for the epithet of saturnine i will explain them to you with all the perspicuity i am capable of you are not ignorant madam continued he of what the bulk of philosophers with the rest of mankind deliver on that subject they say that the objects which most sensibly struck us the preceding day employ our soul in the night the traces which they imprinted on the fibres of our brain subsist the animal spirits accustomed to flow to certain places pursue a course which is become familiar to them and thence arise these involuntary images which afflict or rejoice us in this system i should think that a happy lover ought always to be well served by his dreams nevertheless it frequently happens that a person who is not cruel to him while he is awake in his sleep treats him like a slave or that instead of enjoying a charming woman he finds a little deformed monster in his arms that is exactly my adventure of last night interrupted mangogul for i seldom pass a night without dreaming it is a family disease and we dream from father to son since the sultan togrul who dreamd in     0000000  and began the custom now madam last night you appeared to me says he to mirzoza twas your skin your arms your breast your neck your shoulders this firm flesh this easy shape this incomparable embonpoint in a word it was yourself excepting this circumstance that instead of that charming face that adorable head which i expected to find i found myself nose to nose with the snout of a dutch pug i screamd out dreadfully my chamberlain kotluk ran to me and askd me what was the matter mirzoza answered i half asleep has just now undergone the most hideous metamorphosis she is become a dutch dog kotluk did not think proper to awake me he withdrew and i fell asleep again but i can assure you that i knew you wonderfully well your body with a dogs head will bloculocus give me the explanation of this phænomenon i do not despair of doing it answered bloculocus provided your highness will agree with me in one very plain principle which is that all beings have many conformities one with another by qualities which are common to them and that it is a certain combination of qualities which characterizes and distinguishes them that is evident replies mirzoza ipsiphila has feet hands and a mouth like a woman of sense and pharasmena adds mangogul wears her sword like a man of courage if a person is not sufficiently acquainted with the qualities the combination of which characterizes this or that species or if he passes a hasty judgment that this combination does or does not belong to this or that individual he runs the risque of mistaking copper for gold a paste for a brillant a calculator for a geometrician a retailer of phrases for a wit crito for an honest man and phedima for a pretty woman added the sultana well madam replies bloculocus do you know what might be said of those who pass these judgments that they dream wide awake says mirzoza very well madam continued bloculocus and nothing is more philosophical or more exact in a thousand circumstances than this familiar expression i believe you dream for nothing is more common than men who fancy that they reason and in reality only dream with their eyes open tis of those interrupted the favorite one may literally say that their whole life is but a dream i cannot too much admire madam replied bloculocus the ease with which you comprehend such abstruse notions our dreams are but precipitate judgments which succeed each other with incredible rapidity and by bringing objects together whose sole connexion is by very distant qualities compose one whimsical image if i understand you right said mirzoza as i think i do a dream is a piece of patchwork the patches of which are more in number more regularly fitted according as the dreamer has a more lively turn of thought a more rapid imagination and a more faithful memory might not madness also consist in this and when an inhabitant of the petites maisons cries out that he sees lightning hears the rattling of thunder and that gulphs gape under his feet or when ariadne at her glass smiles at herself finds her eyes sparkling her complexion charming her teeth white and her mouth little might not one justly say that these two disordered brains deceived by very distant affinities look on imaginary objects as present and real you have hit it off madam yes a due examination of mad folks will convince any body that their condition is but a continual dream i have says selim addressing himself to bloculocus some facts by me to which your notions are very applicable which makes me resolve to adopt them once i dreamd that i heard some brayings and that i saw two parallel rows of singular animals coming out of the great mosque they walkd gravely on their hinder feet the hoods in which their snouts were muffled up had two holes in each thro which issued two long moveable hairy ears and very long sleeves envelopped their fore feet i rackd my brain at the time to find some meaning in this vision but i now recollect that i had been at montmartre  the preceding evening   a hill near paris famous for asses another time while we were in the field commanded by the great sultan erguebzed in person and i harassed by a forced march was taking a nap in my tent i thought i had the conclusion of an important affair to sollicite in the divan i went to appear before the council of regency but you may judge how much i had reason to be surprized i found the hall full of racks troughs mangers and coops for fowls in the great seneschals easy chair i saw but an ox chewing the cud in the seraskiers place a barbary sheep on the testesdars bench an eagle with a hooked bill and long talons instead of the kiaja and kadilesker two large owls cloathed in fur and for visirs geese with peacocks tails i presented my petition and instantly heard a horrible racket which awaked me is that a dream of very difficult interpretation said mangogul you had at that time some affair in the divan and before you went thither you took a walk to the menagerie but signor bloculocus you tell me nothing concerning my dogs head prince answerd bloculocus tis a hundred to one that madam wore or you had observed some other lady wear a sable tippet and that the first dutch dog which you saw struck your imagination there you have ten times more connections than is requisite to employ your mind during your sleep the resemblance of colour made you substitute hair for a tippet and in an instant you planted an ugly dogs head in the place of a very beautiful womans head your notions to me appear just replied mangogul why do you not publish them they may contribute to the progress of divination by dreams an important science which was much cultivated two thousand years ago and has since been too much neglected another advantage of your system is that it would not fail throwing light on several works both ancient and modern which are but a string of dreams such as platos treatise of ideas the fragments of hermes trismegistus the literary paradoxes of father harduin the newton the optic of colours and the universal mathematicks of a certain bramin for example would you not inform us mr conjurer what orcotomus had seen in the daytime when he dreamd his hypothesis what father c—— had dreamt when he set about constructing his organ of colours and what was cleobuluss dream when he composed his tragedy with a little meditation sir answered bloculocus i might compass all that but i reserve these nice phænomena for the time when i shall put out my translation of philoxenus for which i beseech your highness to grant me the privilege with all my heart says mangogul but who is this same philoxenus——prince replies bloculocus he is a greek author who was very knowing in the subject of dreams——then you understand greek——who i sir not a syllable——have you not told me that you are translating philoxenus and that he wrote in greek yes sir but in order to translate a language it is not necessary to understand it because translations are made for those only who understand it not that is wonderful says the sultan signor bloculocus well then translate greek without understanding it i give you my word that i will keep the secret and it shall not make me honour you one jot the less  chap xl twentythird trial of the ring fannia there still remaind a good part of the day when this conversation was closed which determined mangogul to make one trial of his ring before he retired to his appartment tho it were purely to fall asleep on more chearful ideas than those which had hitherto employd him he went directly to fannias house but found her not he returnd thither after supper she was still absent wherefore he put off his experiment to the next morning mangogul says the african author whose journal we translate was at fannias house by half an hour after nine this morning she was but just put to bed the sultan drew near her pillow viewd her for some time and could not conceive how with so few charms she had run through so many adventures fannia is fair even to insipidity tall ungainly with an indecent gait no features few agrémens and an air of intrepidity intolerable any where but at court as for wit she is allowed to have just as much as gallantry can communicate and a woman must be born very weak if she has not acquired a stock of jargon after a score of intrigues for fannia was advanced thus far at this time she was possessed by a man suited to her character he gave himself little or no concern about her infidelities tho indeed he was not as well informed as the public how far she carried them he had taken fannia by caprice and kept her by habit like a piece of furniture they had spent the night at the ball went to bed at nine and fell asleep without ceremony alonzos indifference would not have suited fannia were it not for her easy humour thus our couple were sleeping soundly back to back when the sultan turnd his ring on fannias toy it instantly began to speak its mistress to snoar and alonzo to awake after yawning several times this is not alonzo whats oclock who wants me your business said the toy i think i have not been long in bed let me take another nap the toy was preparing to compose itself to rest accordingly but that was not the sultans intention what persecution resumed the toy once more who wants me and for what tis a misfortune to be born of illustrious ancestors how unhappy is the condition of a titled toy if any thing could console me for the fatigues of my state it would be the goodness of the nobleman whose property i am oh he is certainly the best man in the world in that regard he has never given us the least uneasiness and in return we have made great use of the liberty he granted us what would have become of me great brama if i had fallen to the share of one of those insipid wretches who are always upon the watch what a fine life we should have led here the toy added some words which mangogul understood not and then with surprising rapidity fell to sketching out a crowd of heroic comic burlesque and tragicomic adventures and it was almost out of breath when it continued in these terms you see i have some memory but i am like all others i have retained but the smallest part of what i have been intrusted with be satisfied therefore with what i have related to you i can recollect no more at present tis pretty well said mangogul within himself but still he urged afresh lud how teizing you are resumed the toy as if one had nothing better to do than to prate come then since it must be so let us prate on perhaps when i have told all i shall be permitted to do something else my mistress fannia continued the toy thro an inconceivable spirit of retirement quitted the court to shut her self up in her house at banza it was then the beginning of autumn and every body was out of town and if you ask me what she did there faith i cant tell but fannia never did but one thing and if she had been employd that way i should have known it probably she was out of work true i now recollect we spent a day and a half in perfect idleness which threw us into a cruel fit of the vapors i was heartsick of this sort of life when amisadar was so good to relieve us from it—ah you are there my poor amisadar indeed you give me great pleasure you come to me very opportunely——and who knew that you were at banza replied amisadar—no body truly and neither you nor any one else will ever imagine what brought me hither dont you guess at the cause——no really i cannot comprehend it—not at all—no not at all—well then know my dear that i resolved to be converted—you to be converted——yes i——look on me a little but you are as charming as ever and i see nothing in that countenance that bespeaks conversion this is all pleasantry——no faith i am serious i am determined to renounce the world i am tired of it——this is a whim that will soon fly off let me die if ever you run into devotion——i will i tell you there is no sincerity in man——pray has mazul faild you——i have not seen him this age——then it must be zumpholo——less still i have ceased seeing him i cant tell how without thinking about it——ah i have it tis young imola—good who can fix such fribbles—what is it then——i cant tell i am angry with the whole earth——ah madam you are in the wrong for this earth at which you are angry might furnish you wherewithal to repair your losses——then amisadar you sincerely believe that there are still some good souls who have escaped from the corruption of the age and are capable of love——how love is it possible that you give into those pitiful notions you expect to be loved you——and why not——but reflect madam that a man who loves pretends to be loved and alone too you have too much good sense to enslave your self to the jealousies and caprices of a tender and faithful lover nothing so fatiguing as these folks to see but them to love but them to dream of none but them to have no wit humour or charms but for them all this most certainly does not suit you it would be pleasant to see you stive yourself up in what is called the noble passion and give your self all the awkward airs of a little female cit well amisadar you seem to be in the right i verily think it would ill become us to run into fawning love let us change then since it must be so besides i do not see that those loving women whom they set us as models are happier than others——who told you so madam——no body but it is easily foreseen——trust not to such foresight a loving woman constitutes her own and her lovers happiness but this part is not suited to all women——faith my dear it is suited to none for all who attempt it are sufferers what advantage is there in fixing to one——a thousand a woman who fixes her affections will preserve her reputation will be sovereignly esteemed by the man she loves and you cannot imagine how much love owes to esteem——i do not comprehend your meaning you make a jumble of reputation love esteem and i cant tell what besides would you be understood that inconstancy must dishonour a woman how i take a man and find he does not answer my expectations i take another and am still disappointed i change him for a third who does not turn out a jot better and because i have had the misfortune to make a score of wrong choices instead of pitying me you would——i would madam advise a woman who has been deceived in her first choice not to make a second for fear of being deceived again and running from one error into another——good god what strange morality i fancy my dear that you preached me a quite different sort just now might one be informed what sort of woman would hit your taste——most willingly madam but tis late and the discourse would run into too great a length——so much the better i am alone and you will be company for me thus the affair is settled is it not seat yourself on this couch and go on i shall hear you more at ease amisadar obeyd and sate down by fannia that mantelet of yours madam says he leaning towards her and uncovering her bosom wraps you up strangely—you say right——why then do you hide such beautiful things added he kissing them——come ha done do you know that you are mad you are become intolerably impudent mr moralist resume the conversation which you began well then said amisadar i would be glad to find in my mistress a good figure good sense good sentiments and decency above all i would have her approve my attendance not deceive me by looks make me thoroughly sensible once at least that i am agreeable to her and even inform me how i may become still more so not conceal from me the progress i make in her heart give ear to none but me have no eyes but for me neither think nor even dream but of me love but me busy herself about nothing but me do nothing but what may tend to convince me of all this and at length yielding herself up to my transports let me plainly perceive that i owe every thing to my love and to hers oh what a triumph madam and how happy is the man who possesses such a woman——alas my poor amisadar you are certainly out of your senses you have drawn the portrait of woman who does not exist——pardon me madam there are some in being i own that they are rare but yet i have had the good fortune to light of one alas if death had not snatchd her from me for tis death alone that ever robs one of such women perhaps i should be in her arms at present——but how then did you behave with her—i loved to distraction and missd no opportunity of giving her proofs of my passion i had the sweet satisfaction of seeing that they were well received i was scrupulously faithful to her and she to me the only disputes between us were whose love was strongest and in these little debates it was that we laid our hearts open we were never so fond as after this scrutiny of our souls our caresses always became more tender and vigorous after our explanations oh what love and truth were then in our looks i read in her eyes and she in mine that we burned with equal and mutual ardor——and whither did all this lead ye——to pleasures unknown to all mortals less amorous and sincere than us——you enjoyed——yes i enjoyed but a good on which i set an infinite value if esteem does not intoxicate at least it hightens the intoxication considerably we unbosomd ourselves without reserve and you cant imagine how much it strengthened our passion the more i examined the more perfections i discovered and the greater were my transports i spent half my time at her feet and i regretted the loss of the rest i made her happiness and she filled up the measure of mine i always saw her with pleasure and always quitted her with pain thus we lived together and now madam you may judge if loving women are so much to be pitied——no they are not if what you tell me be true but i can scarcely believe it there is no such love as you describe nay i imagine that such a passion as you have felt must make a man purchase the pleasures it affords at the expence of great uneasinesses——i had some madam but i was fond of them i felt some twitches of jealousy the least alteration which i remarked in her countenance spread the alarm all over my soul——what extravagance upon mature consideration i conclude that it is better to love in the present fashionable way to take a lover at ones ease keep to him while he amuses quit him when he becomes tiresome or that our fancy speaks for another inconstancy affords a variety of pleasures unknown to you languishing folks——i grant that that method may be proper enough for little kept mistresses and common women but does not suit with a man of tenderness and delicacy at most it may amuse him when his heart is disengaged and he is willing to make comparisons in a word a woman of gallantry is by no means of my taste——you are in the right my dear amisadar you have a ravishing way of thinking but do you love any thing at present——nothing madam but yourself and i dare not tell you so neither——ah my dear dare on you may continue replied fannia gazing on him stedfastly amisadar understood this reply thoroughly well moved forward on the couch fell to playing with a ribbon which hung down on fannias breast and he was not interrupted his hand meeting with no obstacle slipt down lower she continued to fire him with glances which he did not misinterpret for my part says the toy i found he was a sensible man he took a kiss on that neck on which he had bestowed so many encomiums he was desired to stop but in such a tone as plainly shewed that she would take it ill if he obeyed and accordingly he did not he kissed her hands returned to her neck passed to her mouth nothing resisted him insensibly fannias leg was on amisadars thighs he put his hand on it it was soft and amisadar did not fail to remark it his elogy was heard with an air of distraction by favor of this inattention amisadars hand advanced and with rapidity reached her knees the absence of mind still continued and amisadar was preparing for the charge when fannia came to herself she accused the little philosopher of want of respect but he became so absent in his turn that he did not hear one word or at least made no other answer to the reproaches she threw on him but by compleating his happiness what a charming man he appeard to me of the multitude of those who preceded and followed him not one was ever so much to my taste i cannot mention him without panting pray suffer me to recover breath i think i have spoken a pretty sufficient time considering it is my first speech alonzo did not lose one single word of fannias toy and he was no less impatient than mangogul to hear the remaining part of the adventure but neither of them had time to be out of patience when the taletelling toy resumed in these words all that i can comprehend after serious consideration is that in some few days amisadar went to the country that he was asked the reason of his stay in town and that he related his adventure with my mistress for somebody of amisadars and her acquaintance passing by our door enquired either by chance or design if madam was at home sent in his name and went up——ah madam who could imagine you were in banza and how long are you here——an age my dear this fortnight that i have renounced society may i presume to ask madam upon what account——alas because i was tired of it women are become such strange libertines that there is no bearing them one must either do as they do or pass for a silly creature and sincerely i think both extremes should be avoided——indeed madam you are become quite edifying pray is it the conversation of the bramin brelibibi that has wrought your conversion——no tis a squall of philosophy tis a quint of devotion it seized me suddenly and it is not poor amisadars fault that i am not at present practising the highest austerity——then madam has seen him lately——yes once or twice——and you have seen no body else——no truly he is the only thinking reasoning active being that has entered my doors during the eternity of my retreat——that is singular——and what singularity is there in it——nothing but an adventure which he had the other day with a lady of banza alone like you devout like you retired from the world like you but i must tell you the story perhaps it will amuse you——without doubt replied fannia and immediately amisadars friend set about relating his adventure word for word as i have done says the toy and when he was advanced as far as i am now——well madam said he what do you think is not amisadar a lucky man——but answered fannia amisadar is a lier perhaps do you imagine that there are women so daring as to abandon themselves without shame——but consider madam replied maruspha that amisadar has named no body and it is very improbable that he has imposed——i begin to see thro the affair says fannia amisadar has wit and is a handsome man he has to be sure infused some notions of sensual pleasure sure into this poor recluse which have mastered her yes this must be it this sort of folks are dangerous to hear and amisadar is matchless in that way——how madam interrupted marsupha is amisadar the only man that has the art of perswading and will you not do justice to others who deserve as much as he a share in your esteem—pray whom do you mean——myself madam who think you a charming woman and——i fancy you joke look at me then marsupha i have neither paint nor patches my nightcap does not become me i make a frightful figure——you are mistaken madam that undress sets you off surprisingly it gives you so winning and kind an air—— to these gallantries marsupha added others i insensibly joined in the conversation and when marsupha had finished with me he resumed with my mistress seriously amisadar has attempted your conversion he has an admirable hand at conversions could you give me a sample of his morals i would lay a wager they are much the same with mine——we have thoroughly handled some points of gallantry we have analysed the difference between an affectionate woman and a woman of gallantry he is for the affectionate women——and you too without doubt——not at all my dear i took great pains to demonstrate to him that we were all alike and that we acted upon the same principles but he is not of this opinion he establishes an infinity of distinctions which i think exist nowhere but in his imagination he has formed to himself i cant tell what ideal creature a chimæra of a woman a nonentity in a coif——madam answered marsupha i know amisadar he is a lad of good sense and has been very conversant with the sex if he has told you that there were such——oh whether there are such or not interrupted fannia i could never conform to their customs——i believe it said marsupha and accordingly you have chosen another sort of conduct more suitable to your birth and merit those silly creatures are to be abandoned to philosophers they would never be lookd on at court—— here fannias toy stopt short one of the principal perfections of these orators was to break off their discourse à propos they talkd as if they had never done any thing else whence some authors have inferrd that they were pure machines in this place the african author specifies all the metaphysical arguments of the cartesians against the soul of brutes which he applies with all possible sagacity to the prating of toys in a word his opinion is that toys speak as birds sing that is to say so perfectly without having been taught that to be sure they are prompted by some superior intelligence but you ask me how he disposes of his prince he sends him to dine with the favorite at least tis there we shall find him in the following chapter  chap xli the history of selims travels mangogul whose thoughts ran solely on diversifying his pleasures and multiplying the trials of his ring after having interrogated the most interesting toys of the court had the curiosity to hear some of the city toys but as he had no advantageous opinion of what his should learn from them he would willingly consult them at his ease and save himself the trouble of going to find them out how to bring them to him was what embarassed him you are in great pain for a trifle says mirzoza sir you have only to give a ball and i promise you this very night a greater number of those speechmakers than you will covet to hear my hearts joy you say right replied mangogul and your contrivance is the better still because we shall certainly have none but those whom we have occasion for in a moment an order was dispatchd to the kislaragasi and the master of the revels to prepare the ball and to distribute no more than four thousand tickets they were probably better judges in that country than elsewhere of the room that six thousand persons would take up to amuse themselves till the hour of the ball selim mangogul and the favorite set about telling news does madam know says selim to the favorite that poor codindo is dead this is the first word i heard of it but what did he the of says the favorite alas madam answered selim he fell a victim to attraction he filled his head with this system in his youth and it turnd his brain in his old days how so says the favorite he had found continued selim by the methods of halley and circino two celebrated astronomers of monoémugi that a certain comet which made so much noise towards the end of kanaglous reign was to return the day before yesterday and fearing lest it might double its steps and he should not have the happiness of being the first to see it he resolved to spend the night in his observatory and yesterday morning at nine oclock he had still his eye clung to the telescope his son apprehending the consequences of so long a sitting went to him at eight pulld him by the sleeve and called him several times father father not a word of answer father father repeated the young codindo it is just going to appear replied codindo it will appear zounds i shall see it but you do not consider dear father that there is a dismal fog——i must see it i will see it i tell thee the young man convinced by these answers that the fog had got into his fathers head called out for help the family ran to him and sent for farfadi and i was with him for he is my physician when codindos servant came——quick quick sir make haste old codindo my master——well what is the matter champagne what has befallen your master——sir he is run mad——thy master is run mad——oh yes sir he cries out that he must see beasts that he will see beasts that they will come the apothecary is with him already and they wait for you come quickly——maniacal says farfadi putting on his gown and hunting for his squarecap maniacal a terrible maniacal fit then turning to the servant he askd does not thy master see butterflies does he not pick the ends of his coverlid——oh no sir replied champagne the poor man is on the top of his observatory where his wife daughters and son have much ado to hold him come quickly you will find your squarecap tomorrow codindos disease seemed to me to be of an odd kind i took farfadi in my coach and we drove to the observatory at the bottom of the stairs we heard codindo crying out in a furious tone i must see the comet i will see it withdraw ye rascals and jades in all probability his family finding that they could not prevail on him to go down to his bedchamber had ordered his bed up to him for we found him lying in bed at the top of his observatory an apothecary of the neighbourhood and the bramin of the parish had been called before we arrived the latter was trumpeting into his ear brother dear brother your salvation is at stake you cannot with a safe conscience expect a comet at this hour of the day you damn yourself——that is my business said codindo what answer will you give to brama before whom you are going to appear replied the bramin——mr rector says codindo without stirring his eye from the telescope my answer shall be that it is your trade to exhort me for my money and the apothecarys there to extol his warm water to me that the physician does his duty of feeling my pulse and learning nothing from it and i my own of waiting for the comet——in vain did they teize him they drew nothing more from him he continued to observe with heroic courage and he died on the leads his left hand on his eye of that side his right laid on the tube of the telescope and his right eye applied close to the eyeglass between his son who cried that he made a false calculation his apothecary who proposed him a clyster his physician who with a toss of his head pronounced that there was nothing more to be done and his priest who said to him brother make an act of contrition and recommend yourself to brama—— that is says mangogul what they call dying in the bed of honour let us leave poor codindo added the favorite to rest in peace and pass to some more agreeable subject then addressing herself to selim my lord says she as you are so gallant at this time of life have so much wit talents and so good a mien and lived in a court devoted to pleasures it is no wonder if the toys have formerly celebrated your fame but yet i suspect that they have not told all they knew of you i do not require this supplement you may have good reasons for refusing it but after all the adventures with which this gentry have honoured you you ought to know womankind and this is one of those things of no consequence which you may safely own this compliment madam replied selim would have flattered my selflove at the age of twenty but i have gained some experience and one of my first reflections is that the more one practises this business the less knowledge he obtains i to know women that i have studied them much may be allowed well what do you think of them said the favorite madam answered selim whatsoever their toys might have published concerning them i esteem the whole sex as most respectable indeed my friend says the sultan you deserve to be a toy you would have no occasion for a muzzle selim added the sultana abandon the satyrical strain and speak the truth madam replied the courtier i may possibly mix some disagreeable strokes with my narrative do not impose the task on me of offending a sex which has always used me well enough and which i revere by——what always veneration i know nothing so caustic as those sweettongued folks when they set on intermitted mirzoza and imagining that it was through regard for her that selim excused himself let not my presence restrain you added she we are contriving to amuse ourselves and i promise upon my honour to apply to myself all the obliging things you shall say of my sex and to leave the rest to other women well you have studied women much pray give us an account of the course of your studies it must have been very brilliant if i may judge of it by what is known of the success and it is reasonable to presume that this will not be contradicted by what is unknown the old courtier complied with her desire and began thus the toys i own have talked a good deal of me but they have not told all those who were capable of completing my history either are no more or are not in our climate and those who have begun it have but lightly touched the subject i have hitherto inviolably kept the secret which i had promised them although i was better made to speak than they but since they have broke silence i think they have dispensed me from the obligation of keeping it born with a fiery constitution i loved almost as soon as i knew what a beautiful woman was i had governants which i detested but in return i was much pleased with my mothers waitingwomen they were for the most part young and pretty they conversed dressed and undressed before me without ceremony they have even enticed me to take liberties with them and my temper naturally inclining to gallantry turned every thing to advantage with these elements of instruction at five or six years of age i was put under the care of men and god knows how forward i was in improving them when the ancient authors were put into my hands and my tutors explained certain passages of which possibly they themselves did not penetrate into the sense my fathers pages taught me some pretty college tricks and the perusal of aloysia which they lent me gave me a vehement desire of becoming perfect i was then fourteen years of age i cast my eyes around seeking among the women who frequented the house one to whom i might make my addresses but they all appeared equally proper to ease me of my irksome load of innocence a commenced acquaintance and still more the courage i felt to attack a person of my own age and which failed me with regard to others determined my choice in favor of one of my cousins emilia was young and so was i i thought her pretty and she liked me she was not difficult and i was enterprizing i had a mind to learn and she was not less curious to know we frequently asked one another very frank and strong questions and one day she deceived the vigilance of her governants and we instructed each other ah how great a master is nature it soon set us in the high road of pleasure and we abandoned ourselves to its impulse without the least thought of the consequences and this was not the way to prevent them emilia had indispositions which she took the less pains to hide as she did not suspect the cause her mother examined her extorted a confession of our commerce and my father was informed of it he made me some reprimands blended with an air of satisfaction and it was immediately resolved that i should travel i set out with a governor who was charged to watch my conduct attentively but not to put me under any restraint and five months after the gazette informed me that emilia died of the small pox and a letter from my father that her tenderness for me had cost her her life the first fruit of my love serves with distinction in the sultans army i have always supported him by my credit and to this day he knows me solely as his protector we were at tunis when i received the news of his birth and his mothers death her fate touched me to the quick and i believe i should have been inconsolable had i not embarked in an intrigue with a seacaptains wife who did not afford me time to run into despair the tunetine was intrepid and i was foolhardy for with the assistance of a ropeladder which she threw to me i passed every night from my lodging on her terrass and thence into a closet where she put the finishing hand to my instructions emilia having only made a beginning her husband returnd from a cruize just at the time that my governor who had received his instructions urged me to cross over into europe i embarked on board a vessel bound for lisbon but not without several times taking leave of elvira from whom i received this diamond the vessel in which we sailed was laden with merchandise but the most valuable commodity on board to my taste was the captains wife she was not quite twenty and her husband was as jealous of her as a tyger and not quite without cause we all soon understood one another donna velina perceived that i had a liking for her i that i was not indifferent to her and her husband that he incommoded us the sailor resolved not to lose sight of us till we were landed at lisbon i read in the eyes of his dear wife how much she fretted at her husbands assiduity mine testified the same things to her and the husband understood us wonderfully well we spent two whole days in an inconceivable thirst of pleasure which would certainly have killd us had not heaven assisted us but it always assists souls in pain just upon our passing the streights of gibraltar a furious tempest arose i would not fail madam to raise the winds about your ears and make thunder rattle over your head to set the heavens on fire with lightning raise the billows up to the clouds and describe the most horrid tempest which you have ever met with in any romance were i not giving you a history i shall only tell you that the captain was compelled by the sailors cries to quit his room and expose himself to one danger for fear of another he went up on deck together with my governor and i threw myself without hesitation into the arms of my fair portuguese quite forgetting that there was any such thing in nature as a sea storms or tempests that we were on board a tottering vessel and abandoning myself without reserve to the perfidious element our course was rapid and you may well judge madam by the weather at that time that i saw a great deal of land in a few hours we put in at cadiz where i left a promise with the signora to meet her at lisbon if my mentor agreed to it whose design was to go directly to madrid the spanish women are more closely confined and more amorous than ours love is managed in that country by a sort of ambassadresses who have orders to catechize strangers to make proposals to them to conduct them forward and backward and the ladies undertake the task of making them happy i was not obliged to go through this ceremony thanks to the conjuncture a great revolution had lately placed a prince of the blood royal of france on the throne of this kingdom his arrival and coronation occasioned festivals at the court where i then appeared i was accosted at a masquerade and a meeting was proposed me for the next day i accepted the challenge and went into a little house where i found only one man maskd his nose wrappd in his cloak who delivered me a letter in which donna oropeza put off the party to the next day at the same hour i returned and was introduced into an appartment sumptuously furnishd and well illuminated with wax tapers my goddess did not make me wait long she enterd just at my heels and rushd into my arms without speaking a word or taking off her mask was she ugly was she handsome was what i knew not i only perceived on the couch to which she drew me that she was young wellmade and loved pleasure when she found herself satisfied with my panegyricks she unmaskd and shewed me the original of this picture which you see in my snuffbox selim opend and at the same time presented the favorite with a gold box of exquisite work and richly adornd with jewels the present is gallant says mangogul what i esteem most in it added the favorite is the portrait what eyes what a mouth what a neck but is not all this hightened so little madam replied selim that oropeza would probably have fixed me at madrid if her husband informed of our commerce had not disturbed it by his threats i loved oropeza but i loved life better still besides my governor was not of opinion that i should expose myself to be poniarded by the husband for the sake of enjoying his wife some few months more wherefore i wrote to the fair spanish donna a very moving farewel letter which i stole out of some romance of that country and set out for france the monarch who then reigned in france was the king of spains grandfather and his court was justly esteemed the most magnificent most polite and most gallant in europe i appeared there as a phænomenon a young lord of congo says a beautiful marquise that must be surely very diverting those men are better then ours i think congo is not far from morocco suppers were given to which i was invited let my discourse have ever so little sense in it it was found fine admirable people retracted who had at first done me the honour to suspect that i had not common sense he is a charming man says another court lady briskly it would be murther to suffer so pretty a figure to return into a wretched country where the women are narrowly watched by men who are no longer so is it true sir tis said that they have nothing that is very unseemly in a man——but adds another we must keep this great boy here for he is well born tho he were only made a knight of malta i engage if you will to procure him an employment and the dutchess victoria my old friend will speak to the king in his favor if it be requisite i soon had indubitable proofs of their goodwill and i put the marquise into a condition of pronouncing on the merit of the inhabitants of morocco and congo i found that the employment which the dutchess and her friend had promised me was difficult to execute and therefore gave it up it was in this recess that i learned to form those noble passions of twentyfour hours i circulated during six months in a vortex where the beginning of an adventure did not wait for the end of another because enjoyment was the only thing intended or if that was slow in coming or as soon as it was obtained we ran upon the scent of new pleasures what do you tell me selim interrupted the favorite decency is then unknown in those countries pardon me madam replied the old courtier they have scarcely any other word in their mouths but the french women are no more slaves to the thing than their neighbors what neighbors says mirzoza the english women replied selim who are cold and scornful in appearance but passionate voluptuous vindictive less witty and more rational than the french women these love the jargon of sentiment those prefer the expression of pleasure but at london as at paris people love separate rejoin to separate again from the daughter of a lord bishop these are a sort of bramins who do not keep celibacy i passed to a baronets wife while he was warmly supporting the interest of the nation in the house of commons against the attempts of the court his wife and i had quite different debates in his house but the session was closed and madam was obliged to attend her knight to his manor i then light upon a colonels wife whose regiment was quartered along the seacoast i afterwards belongd to the lady mayoress ah what a woman i should never have seen congo again if the prudence of my governor who saw me wasting away had not redeemed me from this gally he counterfeited letters from my family which recalled me with all possible expedition and we embarked for holland our design was to travel through germany into italy where we expected frequent opportunities of vessels to carry us to afric we saw holland only in riding post and did not tarry much longer in germany all the women of rank there resemble important citadels which must be besieged in form they are to be reduced but the approaches require so many measures there are so many ifs and buts when the articles of capitulation are to be settled that those conquests soon tired me i shall never forget the expression of a german lady of the first quality on the subject of granting me what she had not refused to several others alas cried she mournfully what would my father the great alkizi say if he knew that i abandon myself to such a low creature as a congese he shall say nothing madam replied i so much grandeur affrights me and i withdraw it was wisely done of me for if my mediocrity had compromised with her highness i might have repented it brama who protects the wholesome climes which we inhabit inspired me without doubt in this critical moment the italian ladies whom we frequented afterwards are not mounted on so high a pin it was with them that i learned the modes of pleasure there is indeed much caprice and whim in those refinements but you will pardon me ladies if i say that sometimes there is no pleasing you without them from venice and rome i brought some merry receipts before my time unknown in our barbarous country but i restore all the glory of them to the italian women who communicated them to me i spent about four years in europe and returned through egypt into this empire modelled as you see and stockd with the rare secrets of italy which i soon divulged here says the african author selim perceiving that the common place language which he held to the favorite on his adventures in europe and on the characters of the women of the countries through which he passed had plunged mangogul into a deep sleep was afraid of awaking him and therefore drew near to the favorite and continued in a lower voice madam said he were i not apprehensive that i have tired you by a narrative which has perhaps been already too long i would relate you the adventure by which i commenced my operations on my arrival at paris i cannot think how it has escaped me tell it my good friend answered the favorite i will double my attention and make amends as much as i am able for the sultans inattention who sleeps at madrid continued selim we had taken recommendations for some lords of the court of france and at our setting foot in paris we found ourselves loaded with protestations of friendship it was then the pleasant season of the year and in the evenings my governor and i went to walk in the gardens of the palais royal one day we were joined there by some petitsmaitres who shewed us the most celebrated beauties and gave us their history true or false not forgetting themselves on every occasion as you may well imagine the garden was already stockd by a great number of women but there arrived a considerable reinforcement about eight oclock by the quantity of their jewels the magnificence of their dress and the crowd of their attendants i took them for dutchesses at least i spoke my thoughts to one of the young lords of the company whose answer was that he found i was a connoisseur and if i was inclined i should have the pleasure of supping that very night with some of the most lovely of them i accepted his offer and in an instant he slipt a word into the ears of two or three of his friends who dispersed themselves into different parts of the walks and in less than a quarter of an hour returned to give us an account of their negotiation gentlemen said they to us you are expected this night to supper at the dutchess asterias those who were not of the party congratulated us on our good fortune and after some turns in the gardens they left us and we went into our coach in order to reap the benefit of it we alight at a little door at the foot of a very narrow pair of stairs where we climbed up to a second floor and i found the appartments more spacious and better furnished than they would appear to me at present i was presented to the mistress of the house to whom i made one of the most profound reverences which i accompanied with so respectuous a compliment that she was almost unhinged supper was served up and i was seated next to a little charming person who fell to acting the dutchess to admiration truly i cant tell how i dared to fall in love with her but so it was then you have loved once in your life interrupted the favorite oh yes madam replied selim as people love at eighteen years of age with extreme impatience to conclude an affair just broachd i had not a wink of sleep all that night and at dawn of day i set about composing a most gallant letter to my belle i sent it received an answer and obtained a meeting neither the style of the answer nor the yielding temper of the lady did undeceive me and i flew to the place of assignation strongly perswaded that i was going to enjoy the wife or daughter of a prime minister my goddess was waiting for me on a grand couch i threw myself at her feet took her hand kissed it with uncommon eagerness and felicitated myself on the favor which she condescended to grant me is it true said i that you permit selim to love you and to tell you so and that he may without offending you flatter himself with the sweetest hope on ending these words i snatchd a kiss from her neck and as she was recumbent i was preparing to support the attack with vigor when she stopd me and said hold my friend you are a pretty lad you have wit at will you talk like an angel but i must have four louis dors what do you say interrupted i——i tell you replied she there is nothing to be done if you have not brought four louis——how miss said i quite amazed is that your full value it was well worth my while to be sure to come from congo for such a trifle and in a moment i put myself in order hurried down stairs and left her i began madam as you see to mistake actresses for princesses i am quite astonished at it replied mirzoza surely the difference is very great i doubt not said selim but they were guilty of a hundred impertinences but what then a young man and a stranger too is not so nice an observer and i had heard so many bad stories in congo on the liberties taken by the european women—— here mangogul awakd and yawning and rubbing his eyes said by the l—d he is still at paris might one ask you good mr storyteller when you expect to be returnd to banza and how long i am doomed to sleep for tis proper you should know my friend that it is not possible to broach an account of travels without throwing me into yawnings it is a bad habit which i contracted in reading tavernier and other travellers prince answered selim it is above an hour since i am come back to banza i congratulate you thereupon replied the sultan and then turning to the sultana madam said he the hour appointed for the masquerade is come we will set out if the fatigue of the journey permits you prince answered mirzoza i am ready mangogul and selim slipt on their dominos and the favorite took hers likewise the sultan handed her to the ballroom where they separated in order to mix in the crowd selim followed them and so did i says the african author tho i had a stronger inclination to take a nap than to see the dancing  chap xlii twentyfourth and twentyfifth trial of the ring masquerade and sequel of the masquerade the most extravagant toys of banza did not fail flocking whither pleasure called them some came in citycoaches some in public vehicles and some few on foot i should never finish says the african author whose trainbearer i have the honour to be if i enterd into a detail of the tricks which mangogul playd on them he gave more exercise to his ring that night alone than it ever had had since the genius presented him with it he turnd it sometimes on one sometimes on another and frequently on twenty together and then it was that the noise they made was ravishing one cried out with a squeaking voice violins pray give us le carillon de dunkerque another in a hoarse voice i will have the sautriots and i the tricotets said a third and a multitude at once calld for old countrydances such as la bourée les quatre faces la calotine la chaine le pistolet la mariée le pistolet le pistolet le pistolet all these cries were interlarded with a million of extravagances on one side was heard plague take the noodle let him be sent to school on another must i return then without my earnest here who pays my coach there he has slipt away from me but ill hunt him till i find him and again till tomorrow but twenty louiss at least or theres nothing to be done and every where in short speeches which expressed desires or exploits in the crowd a citizens daughter young and pretty singled out mangogul pursued him and provoked him so that he turned his ring on her then was her toy heard to cry out why do you fly me stop charming mask be not insensible to the ardor of a toy which burns for you the sultan shockd at this rash declaration was determined to punish the forward creature he disappeard and sought among his guards some one who was pretty much of his make gave him his mask and domino and abandoned him to the pursuits of the little female cit who being still deceived by appearances continued to say a thousand ridiculous things to him whom she took for mangogul the sham sultan was no fool he was one of those who could talk by signs he made one which drew the belle into a lonesome place where for above an hour she imagined herself the favorite sultana and god knows what mighty projects were working in her brain but the enchantment lasted not long after she had surfeited the pretended sultan with caresses she prayd him to unmask which he did and shewed a physiognomy armed with a large pair of whiskers which did not belong to mangogul oh fy cried the little wench fie—fell mine little shoul answered the swiss fat you ail me tought mee done you kood services enof dat you no be angry at nowing mee but his goddess without answering him slipt nimbly thro his hands and was lost in the crowd but even such of the toys as did not aspire to so great honours did not fail of lighting on pleasure and they all took the road back to banza thoroughly satisfied with their journey as the company was withdrawing mangogul overheard two of his principal officers at high words she is my mistress says one i have kept her these twelve months and you are the first who has taken it into his head to tread on my heels why do you make me uneasy nasses my friend apply elsewhere you will find a hundred lovely women who will think themselves too happy to possess you i love amina replied nasses i see none but her who takes my fancy she has given me hopes and you will give me leave to pursue them hopes replied alibeg——yes hopes——zounds that is not——i tell you sir that it is and i expect satisfaction this moment for the lye you give me down they went immediately into the court yard their scymeters were already drawn and they were on the point of ending their dispute in a tragical manner when the sultan stopd them and forbid them to fight before they had consulted their helena they obeyed and went to aminas house and mangogul close after them the ball has quite spent me said she my eyes are dropping out of my head you are very cruel folks to come the moment i was ready to get into bed but both of ye look very oddly may i be informed what brings ye hither——a trifle replied alibeg this gentleman boasts and even loftily added he shewing his friend that you give him hopes madam how stands this matter—amina was opening her mouth but the sultan turning his ring that very instant she closed it and her toy answered for her——in my opinion nasses is mistaken no it is not he that madam chooses has he not a lusty footman who is a better man oh how foolish these men are in imagining that dignities honours titles names words void of meaning impose on toys every one has his own philosophy and ours consists in distinguishing personal merit true merit from that which is but imaginary with monsieur de clavilles leave he knows less of that subject than we which i will prove you are both acquainted continued the toy with the marchioness bibicosa you know her amours with cleandor as also her disgrace and the high devotion she professes at this day amina is a good friend she has constantly kept up her former intimacy with bibicosa and has not ceased frequenting her house where all sorts of bramins are met with on a certain day one of these pressed my mistress to speak to bibicosa in his favor pray what would you have me ask of her replied amina she is a drowned woman who can do nothing for herself to be sure she will be much obliged to you for treating her still as a person of consequence believe me my friend prince cleandor and mangogul will never do any thing for her and you may freeze in the antichambers——but madam replied the bramin the affair is but a trifle which entirely depends on the marchioness and this it is she has built a little chapel in her house doubtless for the sala which supposes an iman and tis this place which i ask——what say you says amina an iman you dont consider the marchioness wants only a marabou whom she will call from time to time when it rains or when she chooses to have the sala before she goes to bed but an iman lodged cloathed dieted in her house with a salary does not suit bibicosa i know her affairs the poor woman has not six thousand zecchins a year and you expert her to give two thousand of it to an iman surely this is a strange fancy——by brama replied the holy man i am sorry for it for if i had once got to be her iman i should soon become more necessary to her and when one is got thus far it rains gold and pensions howsoever i may appear to you i am of monomotapa and do my duty extremely well——upon second thoughts answered amina with panting interruptions your affair is not perhaps impossible pity it is that the merit you speak of is not known——one runs no risque in doing good offices to persons of my country replied the monomotapan pray behold——he forthwith gave amina a complete proof of such surprising merit that from that moment you lost in her eyes half the value she put on you well long live the monomotapans alibeg and nasses made long faces and lookd on each other without uttering a word but when they had recovered from their astonishment they mutually embraced and casting disdainful looks on amina they ran prostrate themselves at the sultans feet and thank him for having undeceived them with regard to this woman and preserved their lives and reciprocal friendship they arrived just as mangogul returnd to the favorite was relating aminas history to her it made mirzoza laugh but did not augment her esteem for the court ladies and the bramins  chap xliii selim at banza from the masquerade mangogul went immediately to take rest but the favorite finding that she had no inclination to sleep sent for selim and pressed him to continue the history of his amours selim obeyed and resumed the discourse in these terms madam galantry did not fill up all my time i snatched some moments from pleasure which i bestowed on serious occupations and the intrigues in which i was embarked did not prevent my learning fortification riding fencing music and dancing observing the customs and arts of the europeans and studying their politicks and military art on my return to congo i was presented to the emperor grandfather to the sultan who granted me an honourable post in his troops and i soon was made one of all the parties of the prince erguebzed and consequently concerned in the adventures of pretty women i was acquainted with some of all nations ages and conditions and found very few cruel whether it was that my rank dazzled them that my prattle pleased them or my person struck them at that time i had two qualities with which a rapid progress is made in loveaffairs assurance and presumption at first i dealt among the women of quality i took them in the evening in the circle or at play at the manimonbandas i passed the night with them and we hardly knew each other in the morning one of the occupations of these ladies is to procure lovers nay to decoy them away from their best female friends and the other to get rid of them thro apprehensions of ever being unprovided while they are enjoying the sweets of one intrigue they squint at two or three others they possess a number of little arts to attract the man they have in view and a thousand tricks in reserve to disengage themselves from their present spark this has always been and always will be i shall name no body but i knew every woman of erguebzeds court who had any reputation for youth and beauty and all these engagements were formed broken off resumed forgot in less than six months disgusted with that world i passed into its antipodes i visited the citizens wives whom i found dissembling vain of their beauty perched on the pinacle of honour and almost constantly beset with savage brutal husbands or certain splawfooted cousins who acted the passionate lovers with their female cousins from morning till night and were very disagreeable to me it was impossible to be alone with these women one moment those animals broke in upon us perpetually disconcerted a rendezvous and thrust themselves into all our conversations these obstacles notwithstanding i brought five or six of these prattling creatures to my intended point before i finished with any one of them what diverted me much in their commerce was that they piqued themselves on delicacy of sentiments and i must value myself on the same and they talkd on that subject eno to make one die with laughing besides they required assiduity of attendance and in their dialect i was continually deficient in this point they preached such correct love that there was a necessity of renouncing it but the worst of all was that they had your name eternally in their mouths and that sometimes one was obliged to appear in public with them and incur all the ridicule of a city adventure wherefore on a fine summers day i bid adieu to their shops and the whole rue st denis for ever people had then the madness of keeping private lodges i hired one in the eastern suburb and there successively had some of those girls who are seen and not seen to whom one speaks and says not a word and whom we discard when tired of them i frequently mustered a set of friends and opera actresses together and gave little suppers which prince erguebzed now and then honoured with his presence ah madam i had delicious wines exquisite cordials and the best cook in congo but nothing gave me so great amusement as an enterprize which i executed in a province remote from the capital where my regiment was in quarters i set out from banza to review it and as that was my only business i should have been quickly back were it not for the extravagant project to which i devoted myself at baruthi there was a monastery of very beautiful nuns i was young and beardless and i contrived how to get admission under the disguise of a widow who sought an asylum against the dangers of the age i ordered womens cloaths to be made for me then dressed myself and went to offer myself at the grate of those recluses i met with a very tender reception they comforted me for the loss of my husband the price of my board was agreed on and in i went the appartment appointed me had a communication with the dormitory of the novices they were very numerous most of them young and of a surprising bloom i was extremely polite to them and soon became their bosom friend in less than eight days i was let into all the interests of the little republic informed of the several characters and instructed in their secret history i received confidences of all colours and found that detraction and calumny are not better managed by us profane mortals i observed their rules with severity catchd the wheedling air and smooth canting tone and they whispered to each other that the community would be happy if i took the habit no sooner had i thought my reputation established in the house but i fixed upon a young virgin who had just taken the first veil she was an adorable nutbrown girl she called me her mamma and i called her my little angel she gave me innocent kisses and i returned very tender ones youth is curious zirziphila put me daily on the subject of matrimony and the pleasure of husbands and desired me to inform her i artfully whetted her curiosity and from question to question i led her to the practice of the lessons which i gave her she was not the only novice that i instructed and some young nuns came likewise to be edified in my cell i managed the hours and meetings so dexterously that no one interfered with another in fine madam what shall i tell you the pious widow made a numerous progeny but when the scandal which caused many a secret sigh broke out and a council of discreet matrons met and sent for the physician of the convent i meditated my retreat wherefore in the dead of the night when the whole house was asleep i scaled the garden wall and disappeared i went to the waters of piombino whither the physician had sent half the convent and there in the habit of a cavalier i finished the work which i had begun under that of a widow this madam is a fact which the whole empire remembers and of which you alone know the author the rest of my youth added selim was spent in the like amusements always women and of all sorts seldom any mystery a number of oaths and no sincerity but at this rate says the favorite you have never been in love psha replied selim i thought much of love at that time i aimd at pleasure only and at those women who were most likely to afford it me——but interrupted the favorite is there any pleasure without loving what can it be when the heart says nothing alas madam rejoined selim is it the heart that speaks at the age of eighteen or twenty but in fine what is the result of all these experiments what have you pronounced on women that most women have no character at all says selim that they are most powerfully influenced by three things interest pleasure and vanity that perhaps there is not one of them who is not governed by one of these passions and that those who join all the three together are monsters as for pleasure that i can allow them said mangogul who had just then joined the company though little dependance can be had on this sort of women yet they are to be excused when the constitution is wound up to a certain pitch it is an unruly horse which carries his rider over hedges and ditches and most women are mounted astride on that beast tis probably for that reason says selim that the dutchess menega calls the chevalier kaidar her master of the horse but is it possible says the sultana to selim that you have not had the least adventure in which the heart was concerned will your sincerity tend only to dishonour a sex which constituted your pleasures if you were their darling what in so great a number of women not one that desired and even deserved to be beloved that is not to be conceived ah madam replied selim i feel by the readiness with which i obey you that years have not weakened the empire of a lovely woman over my heart yes madam i have loved like other folks you desire to know all i am going to tell all and you will judge if i have performed a lovers part in all the forms are there any travels in this part of your history says the sultan no prince replied selim so much the better says mangogul for i find no propensity to sleep for my part rejoined the favorite selim will allow me to take a little rest let him go to bed likewise says the sultan and while ye both are reposing i will interrogate cypria but prince answered mirzoza your highness does not reflect that that toy will lead you into a string of voyages without end the african author informs us in this place that the sultan struck with mirzozas observation took care to provide a most powerful antihypnotic he adds that mangoguls physician being his intimate friend had given him the prescription and that he had put it in to the preface of his book but of that preface there remains no more than the three last lines which are as follow take of—— of—— of—— of mariamne and the paysan par four pages of the egaremens du coeur one sheet of the confessions twenty five lines and a half   chap xliv twentysixth trial of the ring the rambling toy while the favorite and selim were reposing after the fatigues of the preceding day mangogul was viewing with astonishment the magnificent appartments of cypria this woman had by means of her toy made a fortune equal to that of a general farmer of the revenue after having been through a long row of chambers each surpassing the other in richness and elegance of furniture he came to the great salon where in the midst of a numerous circle he distinguished the mistress of the house by the enormous quantity of jewels which disfigured her and her husband by the goodmanship painted on his countenance two abbés a wit and three academicians of banza were posted at the sides of cyprias easy chair and towards the end of the salon fluttered about two petitsmaitres and a young magistrate full of airs blowing on his ruffles incessantly adjusting his peruke visiting his mouth and complimenting himself in the glass that his paint held on so well except these three butterflies all the company was in profound veneration for the honorable mummy who was seated in an indecent posture yawned spoke while she yawned judged of every thing judged ill of every thing and was never contradicted how said mangogul within himself who had not talked alone of a long time and was chagrined at it how came she to have it in her power to dishonor a man of a good family with so wrong a turn of mind and such a figure as she makes cypria would fain pass for fair tho her skin tawney striped with red had a good resemblance with a variegated tulip with large eyes she was shortsighted she was of a squat shape crowded features with a long slender nose a flat mouth hollow cheeks and a narrow forehead no neck a dry hand and skinny arm with those charms it was that she inchanted her husband the sultan turnd his ring on her and instantly she began to open the company were deceived thinking that cypria spoke from her mouth and that she was going to pass judgment whereas her toy began in these words the history of my travels i was born in morocco in the year   0000000   and i danced on the stage of the opera when mehemet tripathoud who kept me was named ambassador extraordinary from our potent emperor to the monarch france i followed him in this ambassy the charms of the french women soon robbed me of my lover and i speedily made reprisals the courtiers greedy of novelty would needs try maroquine for thus they nicknamed my mistress she treated them with great humanity and her affability in six months brought her in twenty thousand crowns in jewels as much more in cash and a neat well furnished house but the french are fickle and i soon ceased to be in fashion i did not mispend my time in galloping about the provinces great talents require vast theatres i suffered tripathoud to return without me and i devoted myself to the metropolis of another kingdom un my lord tres opulent qui voyageoit en france mentraina a londres oui

her history in a strain half congese and half spanish in all probability it was not a sufficient master of the latter language to employ it alone a language is not learnt says the african author who would sooner hang himself than miss a common observation without talking it much and cyprias toy had little or no time to talk at madrid i fled from italy said the toy notwithstanding some secret desires that called me back influxo malo del clima y tuve luego la resolucion de ir me a una tierra donde pudiesse gozar mis fueros sin partir los con un usurpador i travelled into old castille where i was brought back to my simple functions but this did not gratify my revenge le impuse la tarea de batter el compas en los bayles che celebrava de dia y de noche and he performed so well that we were reconciled we appeard at the court of madrid as good friends al entrar de la ciudad i linkd con un pape venerable por sus canas happily for me for he had compassion for my youth and gave me a secret the fruit of sixty years experience para guardar me del mal de que merecieron los franceses ser padrinos por haver sido sus primeros pregones with this receipt and a relish for cleanliness which i vainly endeavoured to introduce in spain i preserved myself from all accidents at madrid where my vanity alone was mortified my mistress you know has a very little foot esta prenda es el incentivo mas poderoso de una imaginacion castellana a little foot serves for a pasport at madrid to a girl que tiene la mas dilatada fima entre las piernas i resolved to quit a country where i owed the greatest part of my triumphs to a foreign merit y me arrime a un definidor muy virtuoso que passava a las indias under the wings of his reverence i saw the land of promise that country where the happy mortal without scandal carries gold in his purse a ponyard under his girdle and his mistress behind him how delightful a life is spent there what nights gods what nights hay de mi al recordarme de tantos gustos me méo——algo mas——ya ya—pierdo il sentido——me muero—— after spending a year at madrid and in america i embarked for constantinople there i could not relish the customs of a people by whom toys are lockd up and i soon quitted a country in which my liberty was in danger however i practised sufficiently with the mussulmans to perceive that they are much improved by their commerce with the europeans and i found in them the levity of the french the ardor of the english the strength of the germans the longanimity of the spaniards together with strong tinctures of the italian refinements in a word a single aga is worth a cardinal four dukes a lord three grandees of spain and two german princes from constantinople i came as you know gentlemen to the court of the great erguebzed where i formed the most amiable of our nobility and when at length i became good for nought i threw myself on that odd figure there says the toy singling out cyprias husband by a certain familiar gesture gods what a fall the african author closes this chapter with an advertisement to the ladies who might be tempted to order a translation of those parts of the the narrative where cyprias toy expressed itself in foreign languages i should be wanting says he to the duty of an historian by suppressing them and to the respect which i bear the sex by preserving them in my work without acquainting virtuous ladies that cyprias toy had excessively spoild its speech in travelling and that its narratives are infinitely more free than any of the clandestine lectures which it ever made  chap xlv cydalisa mangogul returned to the favorite where selim was come before him well prince said mirzoza has the account of cyprias travels done you any good neither good nor harm answered the sultan i understood it not why so replied the favorite because says the sultan her toy speaks like a polyglot all languages but mine it is an impertinent storyteller but would make a excellent interpreter what replied mirzoza did you gather nothing at all from her narrative but one thing madam answered mangogul and that is that travelling is more pernicious if possible to the modesty of the women than to the religion of the men and that there is very little merit in knowing many languages for one may be master of greek latin italian french spanish and the language of congo and yet have no more sense than a toy is this your opinion madam and what is selims now let him begin his story but above all no more travels they fatigue me to death selim promised the sultan that the scene should be confined to one place and spoke thus i was about thirty years of age when i lost my father i married to keep up my family and i lived with my wife as becomes a husband regards attentions politeness decent behavior without much familiarity the prince erguebzed came to the throne i had been in his good graces long before his reign he continued me in them to his death and i endeavourd to do justice to this mark of distinction by my zeal and fidelity the place of inspector general of his armies became vacant i obtained it and this post obliged me to take frequent journies to the frontiers frequent journies cried the sultan a single one is sufficient to make me sleep till to morrow think of that prince continued selim it was in one of these tours that i became acquainted with the wife of a colonel of the spahis whose name was ostaluk a man of bravery and a good officer but by no means an agreeable husband jealous as a tyger and his person was a sufficient warrant to justify that madness for he was horribly ugly he had lately espoused cydalisa young lively handsome one of those uncommon women for whom at the first interview one feels somewhat more than politeness from whom one parts with regret and who return a hundred times to your thoughts till you see them again cydalisa had a just way of thinking expressed herself with grace her conversation was engaging and if a person was never tired of seeing her he was still less so of hearing her with these qualities she had a right to make strong impressions on every heart and i felt their effects i esteemed her much from esteem i soon ran into tenderness and all my proceedings immediately assumed the true colour of a strong passion the ease with which i obtained my former triumphs had somewhat spoiled me when i attacked cydalisa i imagined she would not hold out long and that being very much honoured by the pursuit of mr inspector general she would only make a decent defence judge then at the surprise i was thrown into by the answer which she made to my declaration my lord said she altho i had the presumption to believe that you are touched with some charms which i am thought to have yet i should be a fool to listen seriously to those same discourses with which you have deceived thousands before you addressed them to me without esteem what is love a trifle and you do not know me sufficiently to esteem me whatever judgment and penetration a person may have he cannot in two days time enter deep enough into the character of a woman to say that she deserves to be adored mr inspector general seeks an amusement he is in the right and so is cydalisa too in amusing no body in vain did i swear to the sincerity of my passion that my happiness was in her hands and that her indifference would poison the rest of my life jargon said she pure jargon either think no more of me or do not believe me stupid enough to be catchd by those trite protestations what you have just said to me every body says without thinking of it and every body hears without believing it if i had had but a bare liking to cydalisa her severity would have mortified me but as i loved her it afflicted me i set out for the court her image followed me thither and absence far from weakening the passion which i had conceived for her did but augment it cydalisa had so far taken possession of me that i thought a hundred times to make a sacrifice to her of the employments and rank which bound me to the court but the uncertainty of success always withheld me in the impossibility of flying to the place where i left her i formed a project to bring her where i was i took advantage of the confidence with which erguebzed honoured me by extolling the merit and valor of ostaluk he was named lieutenant of the spahis of his guard an office which fixed him near the prince and ostaluk appeared at court and with him cydalisa who instantly became the beauty of the day you did well says the sultan to keep your employments and call your cydalisa to court for i swear to you by brama that i should have suffered you to set out alone for the province she was in she was ogled surveyed beset but all in vain continued selim i enjoyed the sole privilege of seeing her every day the more i visited her the more graces and good qualities i perceived in her and the more desperately i became enamoured i fancied that possibly the remembrance of my numerous adventures might injure me in her mind in order to efface it and convince her of the sincerity of my love i banished myself from company and i saw no women but those which chance threw in my way at her house it seemed to me as if this conduct had some effect on her and that she relaxed somewhat of her former severity i doubled my diligence i asked for love and she granted me esteem cydalisa began to treat me with distinction i had some share in her confidence she often consulted me on her family affairs but was quite silent on those of her heart if i expressed myself in tender sentiments she answered me in maxims which made me mad this painful state had lasted a long time when i took up the resolution to get out of it and to know positively once for all what i might depend on how did you set about it said mirzoza madam you will soon be informed answered mangogul and selim continued i have told you madam that i saw cydalisa every day i began by seeing her less frequently i went on by slackening my visits more and more till infine i scarce saw her at all whenever i happened to converse with her tête à tête i spoke as little of love as if i had never felt the least spark of it this change astonished her she suspected me of some secret engagement and one day as i was making her a narrative of the galantries of the court selim said she to me with an air of confusion you tell me nothing concerning yourself you relate the good fortune of others charmingly but you are very discreet with regard to your own madam answered i tis probably because i have none or that i think it is proper to conceal it to be true interrupted she tis of vast consequence to conceal those things to day which all the world will know to morrow be that as it will madam replied i yet at least nobody shall have them from me indeed said she you are quite marvellous with your reserves but pray who does not know that you have designs upon the fair misis the little zibelina and the nutbrown sephera and on whom you please besides madam added i coldly truly replied she i can easily believe that these are not all these two months past that the sight of you is a favour you have not been idle and business goes on fast with those ladies i to remain idle answered i i should never forgive myself my heart is made to love and somewhat to be beloved too and i will go so far as to own that it is but ask me no farther questions on this head perhaps i have already said too much selim replied she seriously i have no secret for you and you shall have none for me if you please how far are you advanced——almost to the end of the novel——and with whom said she earnestly——you know marteza—yes sure she is a very amiable woman well then after having in vain tried all means to please you i turned to that side i was wished for above half a year two interviews levelld the outworks a third will compleat my happiness and this very night marteza expects me to supper her conversation is amusing light and a little caustic but that excepted she is the best creature in the world a person transacts his little affairs better with those giggling women than with those lofty dames who——but my lord interrupted cydalisa with a downcast look in complimenting you on your choice may one observe to you that marteza is not new and that before you she has reckoned lovers——what is that to me madam replied i if marteza loves me sincerely i look on myself as her first but the hour of my appointment draws near permit me——one word more my lord is it really true that marteza loves you——i believe it——and you love her added cydalisa——madam answered i tis you that have thrown me into the arms of marteza i need say no more to you——i was departing but cydalisa pulld me by my doliman and turned back in a hurry——does madam want to speak with me has she any commands for me——no sir how are you there still i thought you were a good way off by this time——madam i will double my pace——selim——cydalisa——then you are going——yes madam——ah selim to whom do you sacrifice me was not cydalisas esteem of greater value than the favors of a marteza——without doubt madam replied i if i had nothing more than esteem for you but i loved you——it is not so cried she with transport if you had loved me you would have distinguished my real sentiments you would have been prepossessed with them you would have flattered yourself that your perseverance would in time get the better of my pride but you grew tired you have abandoned me and perhaps in the very moment——at this word cydalisa stopt short a sigh slipt from her and her eyes were wet—speak madam said i make an end if my tenderness lasted still notwithstanding your rigorous treatment could you——i can do nothing you do no longer love me and marteza waits for you——if marteza was indifferent to me if cydalisa was dearer to me than ever what would you do—it would be folly to explain myself on suppositions——cydalisa i beseech you to answer me as if i had supposed nothing if cydalisa was constantly the most lovely of her sex in my eyes and if i never had the least design on marteza once again what would you do——what i have always done ingrateful man answered at length cydalisa i would love you—and selim adores you said i falling on my knees and kissing her hands which i waterd with my tears cydalisa was struck dumb this unexpected change threw her into the utmost confusion i took advantage of her disorder and our reconciliation was sealed by certain marks of tenderness which she had not power to refuse and what did the good natured ostaluk say to this interrupted mangogul doubtless he allowed his dear half to be generous to a man to whom he was indebted for his lieutenancy of the spahis prince replied selim ostaluk shewed great gratitude whilst i was not listened to but no sooner was i made happy but he became troublesome illhumourd insupportable to me and brutal to his wife not content with disturbing us in person he caused us to be watched we were betrayed and ostaluk convinced of his pretended dishonour had the impudence to challenge me to a duel we fought in the great park of the seraglio i gave him two wounds and obliged him to own himself indebted to me for his life while he was under cure of his wounds i never quitted his wife but the first use that he made of his recovery was to part us and illuse cydalisa she sent me a pathetic account of her unhappy situation i proposed carrying her off to which she consented and our jealous pate returning from the chase wherein he attended the sultan was vastly surprized to find himself a widower ostaluk instead of giving vent to his passion in useless complaints against the author of the rape instantly meditated revenge i had cydalisa in a country house two leagues from banza and every other night i stole out of town and went to cisara mean while ostaluk set a price on the head of his false one bribed my servants and was let into my park that evening i was enjoying the refreshing breeze there with cydalisa we were got to the remoter end of a dark walk and i was on the point of lavishing the most tender caresses on her when an invisible hand pierced her breast with a ponyard before my eyes it was the hand of cruel ostaluk the same fate hung over my head but i prevented ostaluk i drew my dagger and cydalisa was revenged i ran to the dear woman her heart still panted i hastened to carry her to the house but before i reached it she expired her mouth closely pressing on mine when i perceived cydalisas limbs to grow stiff in my arms i cryed out with vehemence my people ran to me and forced me away from this place of horror i returned to banza and shut myself up in my palace excessively grieved at cydalisas death and loading myself with the most cruel reproaches i loved cydalisa sincerely and was passionately beloved by her and i was at full leisure to consider the greatness of the loss which i had sustained and to mourn for her but at length said the favorite you comforted your self alas madam replied selim i thought i never should but this one thing i have learnt by it that there is no grief eternal well said mirzoza let me hear no more of the men there they are all that is to say signor selim that this poor cydalisa whose history has moved us to compassion and whom you have so much regretted was a great fool to rely on your oath and that while brama perhaps chastises her severely for her credulity you pass your time pleasantly enough in the arms of another pray madam replied the sultan calm your self selim loves again cydalisa will be revenged sir answered selim your highness may possibly be misinformed ought i not to have learnt once for my whole life by my adventure with cydalisa that true love was too prejudicial to happiness—without doubt interrupted mirzoza and yet i would lay a wager notwithstanding your philosophical reflections that you actually love another more ardently than— more ardently replied selim i dare not assert these five years past i am attached but attached from my heart to a charming woman it was not without difficulty that i made her listen to me for she had always been of a virtue—virtue cried the sultan courage my friend i am charmed when one talks to me of the virtue of a court lady selim said the favorite continue your story and always believe as a good mussulman in the fidelity of your mistress added the sultan ah prince replied selim with vivacity fulvia is faithful to me faithful or not answered mangogul what is that to your happiness you believe it and that is sufficient oh then tis fulvia that you are now in love with said the favorite yes madam answered selim so much the worse my friend added mangogul i have not a grain of faith in her she is perpetually beset by bramins and these bramins are terrible fellows besides i find she has little chinese eyes with a turnd up nose and an air thoroughly inclining to the side of pleasure between us is this true prince answered selim i believe she has no aversion to it well replied the sultan every thing gives way to that charm which you ought to know better than i or you are not—you are mistaken replied the favorite a man may have all the sense in the world and not know that i wager—always wagers interrupted mangogul i am out of all patience those women are incorrigible pray madam win your castle and lay wagers afterward madam says selim to the favorite might not fulvia be of use to you in some station or other as how askd mirzoza i have observed answered the courtier that the toys have seldom or never spoke but in presence of his highness and i have fancied that the genius cucufa who has done so many surprising things in favour of kanaglou the sultans grandfather might have endowed his grandson with the gift of making them speak but fulvias toy has not as yet opened its mouth as far as i could ever learn might it not be possible to interrogate it in order to procure you the castle and to convince me of the fidelity of my mistress doubtless replied the sultan what is your opinion madam oh i shall not meddle in so ticklish an affair selim is too much my friend to expose him for the sake of a castle to the risque of being made unhappy the rest of his days but you do not consider replied the sultan fulvia is virtuous selim would run his hand into the fire to prove it he has said it and he is not a man to flinch from his word no prince answered selim and if your highness will give me a meeting at fulvias house i will certainly be there before you be cautious of what you propose replied the favorite selim my poor selim you go very fast and how worthy soever you are of being beloved—fear not madam since the dye is cast i will hear fulvia the worst that can befal me is to lose a faithless woman and to die of regret added the sultana for having lost her what a romance says mangogul you believe then that selim is become very weak he has lost the lovely cydalisa and yet there he is full of life and you pretend that if he happened to find fulvia unfaithful to him it would kill him ill insure him to you as immortal if he is never demolished but by that stroke selim to morrow at fulvias do you hear you will have notice of the hour selim bowd mangogul quitted the company the favorite continued to remonstrate to the old courtier that he playd a high game selim thankd her for her tokens of good will and each retired in expectation of the great event  chap xlvi twentyseventh trial of the ring fulvia the african author who had promised to bring selims character into some part of his book has thought fit to place it here and i have too much esteem for the works of antiquity to assert that it would come in better some where else there are says he some men whose merit gives them access every where who by their graceful person and free easy wit are in their youth the darlings of many women and whose gray hairs are respected because having known how to reconcile their duties with their pleasures they have rendered their middle stage of life illustrious by services done for the state in a word men who at all times are the delight of society such was selim though he had reached sixty years and that he had entered the list of pleasure early a strong constitution and some management had preserved him from the infirmities of age a noble air an easy carriage insinuating language a great knowledge of the world founded on long experience the habit of dealing with the sex made him to be regarded at court as a man whom every body would chuse to resemble but who would be unsuccessfully copied for want of being endowed by nature with the talents and genius which had distinguished him now i desire to know continues the african author if this man had reason to make himself uneasy on the score of a mistress and to spend the night like a mad man for the fact is that a thousand reflexions rolled in his head and the more he loved fulvia the more he feared to find her unfaithful into what labyrinth have i thrust my self said he to himself and to what purpose what advantage will accrue to me in case the favorite should win a castle and what will be my fate if she loses it but why should she lose it am i not certain of fulvias love ah i am in the sole and entire possession of her and if her toy speak it will be of me alone—but if the treacherous—no no i should have had some previous notion of it i should have observed some unevenness in her temper some time or other these five years past she would have betrayed herself—yet the trial is dangerous——but it is now no longer time to recoil i have lifted the vessel to my mouth i must finish tho i were to spill the liquor——perhaps also the oracle will be in my favour—alas what can i expect from it why must others have failed in their attacks on that virtue over which i have triumphed——ah dear fulvia i wrong thee by my suspicions and i forget what it cost me to conquer thee a ray of hope enlightens me and i flatter myself that thy toy will obstinately keep silence—— selim was in this agitation of mind when he received a card from the sultan which contained these words this night precisely at half an hour after eleven you will be where you know selim took his pen and answered with a trembling hand prince i will obey selim passed the rest of the day as he had done the preceding night fluctuating between hope and fear nothing is truer than that lovers have an instinct if their mistress be unfaithful they are seized with an horror much like to that which animals feel at the approach of bad weather the suspicious lover is a cat whose ear itches in cloudy weather animals and lovers have this property also in common that domestic animals lose this instinct and that it grows dull in lovers when they are converted into husbands the hours seemed very tedious to selim he lookd a hundred times on his watch infine the fatal moment came and the courtier went to visit his mistress it was late but as he had admission at all hours fulvias appartment was opened for him——i had given you over said she and i went to bed with a swimming in my head which i owe to the impatience you have thrown me into——madam answered selim business and respect have detained me with the sultan and since i parted from you i have not been master of myself one moment and for my part replied fulvia i have been in a dreadful humour how two whole days without seeing you—you know answered selim what my rank obliges me to and let the favour of the great appear ever so fixed——how interrupted fulvia has the sultan shewn you any coldness has he forgot your services selim you are pensive you do not answer me——alas if you love me of what avail is the princes good or bad reception to your happiness it is not in his eyes it is in mine tis in my arms that you are to seek it selim listened attentively to this discourse examined the countenance of his mistress and in its motions sought that character of truth in which a person is not deceived and which is impossible to counterfeit well when i say impossible i mean to us men for fulvia was so perfectly composed that selim began to blame himself for having suspected her when mangogul entered the room fulvia was silent in an instant selim trembled and the toy said in vain does my lady make pilgrimages to all the pagodas of congo she will have no children for reasons well known to me who am her toy—— at this declaration a deadly paleness seized selim he attempted to rise but his trembling knees failed him and he fell back into his seat the invisible sultan stepd up to him and whispered in his ear have you enough alas prince replied the melancholic selim why did i not follow the advice of mirzoza and the misgivings of my own heart my happiness is eclipsed i am a lost man i die if her toy does not speak if it does i am a dead man let it speak out however i expect frightful intelligences but i fear them less than i hate the state of perplexity in which i am—— in the mean time fulvias first motion was to put her hand on her toy and to shut its mouth what it had hitherto said might bear a favorable interpretation but she dreaded the sequel as she began to take courage on account of its remaining silent the sultan urged by selim turned his ring fulvia was obliged to spread her fingers and the toy went on i will never hold i am too much harassed the too assiduous visits of so many holy men will always obstruct my intentions and madam will not have any children if i had been regaled by none but selim i might possibly prove fruitful but i lead the life of a gallyslave this day fatigued by one to morrow by another and always at the oar the last man which fulvia sees is always the person whom she believes destined by heaven to perpetuate her race none can be safe from this fancy o how tiresome is the condition of the toy of a titled lady who has no heirs these ten years past i am exposed to people who were not made even to lift their eyes up to me here mangogul was of opinion that selim had heard enough to cure him of his perplexity wherefore he exempted him from the remaining part turned off his ring and went away abandoning fulvia to the reproaches of her lover at first the miserable selim was petrified but his fury giving him strength and speech he darted a scornful look on his unfaithful mistress and said ingrateful perfidious woman if i loved you still i would take revenge but as you are unworthy of my affection so you are likewise of my wrath a man like me selim to be mixed with a pack of scoundrels—— truly interrupted fulvia smartly in the strain of an unmasked courtisan it much becomes you to give yourself airs for a trifle instead of thanking me for concealing matters from you which would have made you mad at the time of their transacting you take fire you fly into a rage as if you had been injured and pray sir what reason can you have for preferring yourself to rickel to seton to mollio to tachmas to the most amiable cavaliers of the court from whom their mistresses wont be at the pains even of cloaking the slips they make consider selim that you are exhausted infirm and long incapable of engrossing a pretty woman who is not a fool acknowledge then that your presumption is illtimed and your rage impertinent infine you may if you are dissatisfied leave the field open to others who will make better use of it so i do and most heartily replied selim with excessive indignation and went away fully resolved never more to see that woman he went home and shut himself up for some days less grieved for his loss than for his long error not his heart but his vanity suffered he dreaded the reproches of the favorite and the jokes of the sultan and he shund the one and the other he was upon the point of resolving to renounce the court to go into retirement and turn philosopher for the remaining part of a life of which he had thrown away a great part in quality of a courtier when mirzoza who guessd his thoughts undertook to comfort him sent for him to the seraglio and made him this speech well my poor selim then you abandon me tis not fulvia it is me that you punish for her infidelity we are all concerned for your adventure we agree that it is vexatious but if you set any value on the sultans protection and my esteem you will continue to enliven our company and you will forget that fulvia who never was worthy of a man like you madam answered selim age admonishes me that it is high time for me to retire i have sufficiently seen the world and four days ago i would have boasted that i knew it but fulvias stroak confounds me women are indefinable and i should hate them all if you had not been included in the sex of which you have all the charms may brama grant that you never imbibe their perverseness farewell madam i am going to give myself up to useful reflections in solitude the remembrance of the favours with which you and the sultan have honoured me will follow me thither and if my heart forms any vows henceforth they will be for your happiness and his glory selim replied the favorite your chagrine is your adviser you are afraid of mockery which you will less avoid by withdrawing from court than by remaining at it have as much philosophy as you will this is not the time to put it in practice your retreat will be attributed to peevishness and melancholy you are not framed to confine yourself in a desert and the sultan—— mangoguls arrival interrupted the favorite she informed him of selims design then he is turnd fool says the prince is it possible that the base usage of that little fulvia has turnd his head and then addressing himself to selim——that shall not be my friend you shall stay continues he i want your counsel and madam your company the welfare of my empire and mirzozas satisfaction require it and it shall be selim moved with the sentiments of mangogul and the favorite bowed respectuously staid at court was loved cherished sought for and distinguished by his favour with the sultan and mirzoza   during the reign of mangoguls grandfather kanaglou the women start walking on their hands and tumbling fulfilling the prediction of a fairy  chap xlvii prodigious events of the reign of kanaglou mangoguls grandfather the favorite was very young born towards the end of erguebzeds reign she had scarce any idea at all of the court of kanaglou a word accidentally dropt had given her a curiosity to know the prodigies which the genius cucufa had wrought in favour of that good prince and none could more faithfully inform her than selim he had been an eyewitness and even a sharer in them and was throughly versed in the history of his time one day that he was alone with her mirzoza put him on that topic and asked him if the reign of kanaglou which made so great noise had seen greater wonders than those which then engrossed the attention of congo i have no interest madam answered selim in preferring times past to those of the reigning prince great things are come to pass under him but they are perhaps no more than specimens of those which will continue to render mangogul illustrious and my time is too far advanced to flatter my self with seeing them you are mistaken replied mirzoza you have acquired and will keep the epithet of eternal but tell me what you have seen madam continued selim kanaglous reign was long and our poets have named it the golden age this title suits it upon several accounts it has been signalized by successes and victories but the advantages were blended with crosses which prove that this gold was sometimes mixed with bad alloy the court which sets the example to the rest of the empire was very gallant the sultan had mistresses the nobility piqued themselves on imitating him and the lower people insensibly assumed the same air the magnificence in dress furniture and equipages was excessive delicacy in feasting was reduced to an art people gamd high ran in debt paid no body and spent while they had either money or credit there were very good laws enacted against luxury but not put in execution towns were taken provinces conquered palaces begun and the empire drained of men and money the people sung victory and were starving at the same time the great had stately castles and delightful gardens and their lands lay uncultivated a hundred ships of war had rendered us masters of the sea and the terror of our neighbours but a good calculator made an exact estimate what it cost the government to keep these hulks in good order and notwithstanding the remonstrances of the rest of the ministry they were ordered to be turned into a bonfire the royal treasury was a great empty coffer which this wretched oeconomy did not fill gold and silver became so scarce that the mints were on a summers morning converted into papermills to compleat our happiness kanaglou suffered himself to be persuaded by a set of fanatics that it was of the utmost importance that all his subjects should resemble him and that they should have blue eyes snub noses and red whiskers as well as he and he expelled from congo above two millions of people who were not blessed with these regimentals or who refused to counterfeit them such madam was this golden age such those good old times which you daily hear regretted but let those dotards prate on and do you believe that we have our turennes and our colberts that all things considered the present is better than the time past and that if the people are happier under mangogul than they were under kanaglou his highnesss reign is more illustrious than that of his grandfather because the happiness of the subject is the exact measure of the greatness of the prince but let us return to the particulars of kanaglous reign i will begin by the origin of the pantins selim i will excuse you i know that story by heart says the favorite proceed to other matters madam answered selim might one ask from whom you have it why says mirzoza it is published true madam replied selim and by people who knew nothing of the matter i am out of humour when i see little obscure private persons who have never been near princes but at a public entry into the metropolis or some such other ceremony pretend to write their history madam continued selim we had spent the night at a masquerade in the great salons in the seraglio when the genius cucufa a vowed protector of the reigning family appeared to us and commanded us to go to bed and sleep twenty four hours on a stretch he was obeyed and at the expiration of this term the seraglio was found to be transformed into a vast and magnificent galery of pantins at one end appeared kanaglou seated on his throne a long packthread almost worn out hung down between his legs an old decrepit fairy was incessantly pulling it and with a turn of her wrist moved an innumerable multitude of subaltern pantins to whom fine imperceptible threads answered which issued from kanaglous fingers and toes she pulled and in an instant the seneschal drew up and sealed ruinous edicts or pronounced a panegyric on the fairy which was prompted by his secretary the minister of war sent card matches to the army the superintendant of the finances built houses and suffered the soldiery to starve and so of the other pantins when any of the pantins happened to execute their movements aukwardly by not lifting up their arms sufficiently or not bowing their knee in a proper manner the fairy cut their threads with a jerk of her left hand and they became paralytic i shall never forget two most valiant emirs whom she found deficient in their duty and who were ever after deprived of the use of their arms the threads which issued from every part of kanaglous body were extended to immense distances and from the palace of congo put whole armies of pantins into motion or winter quarters even to the remotest parts of monoémugi with one pull of the packthread a town was besieged the trenches were opened they battered in breach and the enemy was preparing to capitulate but upon a second pull the besiegers fire slackened the attacks were not carried on with the same vigour troops came to the relief of the place dissentions were kindled among the generals we were attacked surprized beaten and routed these bad tidings never gave any concern to kanaglou he seldom heard them till they were forgot by his subjects and the fairy would not suffer him to be informed of them but by pantins who had each a thread fastned to the tip of their tongue and who said no more than what she thought proper on pain of being struck dumb another time we young fools were all charmed with an adventure which gave bitter scandal to the godly the women all at once became tumblers and fell to walking with their heads down their legs up in air and their hands in their slippers this threw all our former knowledge into confusion and we were obliged to commence a course of studies on these new physiognomies many were slighted who ceased to be thought lovely as soon as they shewed themselves and others who were never so much as talked of gained vastly by making themselves known their petticoats and gowns falling over their eyes put them in danger either of losing their way or stumbling wherefore the former were shortened and the latter cut open before such is the origin of short petticoats and open gowns when the women returned to the use of their feet they retained this part of their dress as it was and if we thoroughly consider the petticoats of our fine ladies we shall easily perceive that they were not made to be worn as they are worn at this day any mode that has but one drift will soon pass away in order to make it lasting it ought to answer two ends at least in those same days a secret was discovered for plumping the breasts downward and it is used at this day for plumping them upward the devout women surprized to find their heads down and their heels up in the air at first covered themselves with their hands but this attention made them lose their poise and stumble in their walks by the advice of the bramins they afterwards tied their petticoats about their legs with little black ribbons the gay part of the sex found this expedient ridiculous and publickly declared that it incommoded their respiration and threw them into the vapours this prodigy was attended with happy consequences it occasioned a number of marriages or somewhat like them and a crowd of conversions all those who had disagreeable buttocks ran headlong into the religious party and took little black ribbons four missions of bramins would not have made so many proselytes we had scarcely got rid of this trial when we underwent another less universal indeed but not less instructive the young girls one and all from thirteen to eighteen nineteen twenty years of age and upwards rose on a fine summers morning the middle finger caught guess where madam says selim to the favorite it was not in their mouth nor in their ear nor infine à la turque their disease was easily guessd and the remedy quickly applied from that time may our custom be dated of marrying children who are fit for nothing but dressing their dolls another blessing kanaglous court swarmed with petitsmaitres and i had the honour to be of the number one day as i was entertaining them with the young french nobility i perceived our shoulders working upwards till they became higher than our heads but that was not all in an instant we all fell to whirling about on one heel and what rarity was there in that said the favorite nothing madam replied selim but that the first metamorphosis is the origin of the round shoulders so much in vogue in your infancy and the second that of the scoffers whose reign is not yet over then as now a discourse was begun to some one person which by a sudden twirl on the heel was continued to a second and finished to a third to whom it became half unintelligible half impertinent another time we all found our selves short sighted and were forced to have recourse to bion the rogue made us pay ten sequins for glasses which we continued to use even after recovering our sight thence come madam the opera spy glasses i could never learn what the fine ladies did to the genius cucufa about this time but he took severe vengeance of them at the end of a certain year whereof they had spent the nights in balls banquets and gaming and the days in dressing or between the arms of their lovers they were all astonished to find themselves horridly ugly one was as black as a mole another bronzed over a third pale and lean a fourth of a sickly yellow and full of wrinkles there was a necessity to palliate this fatal enchantment and our chemists found out the white the red pomatums waters venuss handkerchiefs virgins milk patches and a thousand other cosmetics which they employed to avoid appearing ugly and becoming frightful cucufa still held them under this curse when erguebzed who loved beautiful women became their intercessor the genius did all that he could but the charm was so powerful that he was not able to dissolve it thoroughly and the court ladies remained such as you see them at this day was the fate of the other charms the same says mirzoza no madam answered selim they lasted some longer some shorter the round shoulders sunk by degrees and people stood upright and for fear of being thought humpbackd they turned up their noses to the wind and danced as they walked the whirlgig motion continued and they whirl about to this day broach a serious or sensible conversation in presence of a young lord of the bel air and zeste you shall see him wheel away from you in an instant and go mutter out a parody to some body who asks him the news of the war or of his health or to whisper in his ear that he supped last night with miss rabon and that she is an adorable girl that there is a new romance coming abroad that he has read some pages of it and that it is fine very fine and then another twirl or two towards a lady whom he asks if she has seen the new opera and answers her that miss dangeville has performed to a miracle mirzoza found these ridicules very diverting and asked selim if he had been a sharer in them how madam replied the old courtier was it possible not to have them without passing for a man come from the other world i put on the round shoulders i stood erect i danced in walking i cockd the spyglass i whirled about i hissed like the rest and the utmost efforts of my judgment went no farther than to be one of the first in taking up these several biasses and none of the last in shaking them off selim was got thus far when mangogul appeared the african author does not inform us what was become of him or what were his occupations during this preceding chapter probably the princes of congo may be allowed to perform indifferent actions to say miserable things sometimes and to resemble the rest of mankind who spend a great part of their lives in doing nothing or such things at least as are not worthy of being known  chap xlviii twentyeighth trial of the ring olympia rejoice madam says mangogul coming in to the favorites appartment i bring you an agreeable piece of news the toys are a parcel of little fools who know not what they say cucufas ring can indeed make them speak but not extort the truth from them and how has your highness caught them in a lye says the favorite you shall hear answered the sultan selim promised you an account of all his adventures and you make no doubt but that he has kept his word well then i am just come from consulting a toy who accuses him of a naughty trick which he has not confessed to you and which most certainly he has not playd as it is quite contrary to his character to tyrannize over a pretty woman to lay her under contribution on pain of military execution can you discover selim in this proceeding pray why not sir replied the favorite there is no malice of this sort of which selim has not been capable and if he has concealed the adventure which you have discovered possibly it is that he is reconciled to this toy that they are well together and that he thought he might keep that peccadillo from me without swerving from his promise the perpetual falsity of your conjectures replied mangogul ought to cure you of the disease of ever making any there is nothing of what you imagine in the affair it is one of the first flights of selims youthful days it regards one of those women who are gained in a minute but are never kept long madam says selim to the favorite in vain do i examine my self i can recal nothing more to my memory and at present i find my conscience quite clear olympia says mangogul—ah prince interrupted selim i know the thing but this little story is so old that it is no wonder that it has escaped me olympia continued mangogul wife of the chief cashier of hasna had coiffed herself with a young officer captain in selims regiment her lover came to her one morning in deep concern to inform her that orders were issued for all the officers to set out and join their respective corps my grandfather kanaglou had resolved that year to open the campaign early and an admirable project which he had formed miscarried purely through the making these orders too publick the politicians murmured the women exclaimed each party had their reasons i have told you those of olympia this woman took the party of seeing selim and if possible to prevent the departure of gabalis for that was her lovers name selim already passed for a dangerous man olympia thought it was proper to have an escort and two of her female friends as handsome as her self offered to accompany her selim was at home when they came he received olympia who appeared alone with that easy politeness which you know he is master of and asked what had procured him this agreeable visit sir says olympia i interest my self for gabalis he has some important affairs on his hands which make his presence necessary at banza and i come to you to beg six months leave of absence for him six months leave madam you do not consider replied selim the sultans orders are precise i am heartily concerned that i cannot make a merit towards you of a favour which would infallibly ruin me new instances on olympias side on selims new refusals—the grand vizir has promised me that i should be comprehended in the next promotion can you desire me madam to drown my self in order to oblige you no sir you may oblige me without drowning your self—madam it is impossible but if you go to the visir—alas sir to whom do you send me that man never did any thing for the ladies—i rack my brain to no purpose for i should be highly rejoiced in being able to render you service and i can see but one way and which is that asked olympia with eagerness—your intention answered selim would be to make gabalis happy for six months but madam could you not dispose of one quarter of an hour of those pleasures which you design for him olympia understood him wonderfully well blushed stammered and concluded by exclaiming at the severity of the condition let us say no more of the affair replied the colonel with a cold air gabalis shall join his regiment the princes service must be done i might venture to take somewhat on my self but you are inflexible at least madam if gabalis departs it is you that send him away i cryd olympia sharply ah sir make out his warrant quickly and let him remain here the essential preliminaries of the treaty were ratified on a sopha and the lady thought she had made sure of gabalis when the traitor who stands before you took it into his head to ask her who those two ladies were who came with her and whom she left in the next appartment they are two of my intimate friends replied olympia and of gabalis too added selim beyond all doubt this supposed i do not believe they will refuse to execute each a third part of the articles of the treaty yes this to me seems just and to you madam i commit the care of disposing them to it indeed sir says olympia you are a strange man i protest these ladies have no pretentions to gabalis but in order to extricate them and my self from this embarras if you think me responsible i will endeavour to discharge the bill of exchange which you draw on them selim accepted the offer olympia did honour to her word and there madam is what selim ought to have informed you of i excuse him says the favorite olympia was not so good an acquaintance that i should condemn him for having forgot her i cannot imagine whither you go to hunt out that sort of women indeed prince your conduct is that of a man who has no desire to lose a castle madam to me it seems as if you had entirely changed your notions within these few days answered mangogul do me the favour to recollect the first trial of my ring which i proposed to you and you will see it was not my fault that i have not lost it ere now yes replied the sultana i know you have sworn to me that i should be excepted out of the number of speaking toys and that since that time you have applied to such women only as have forfeited their character to an amina a zobeida a thelis a zulica whose reputations were already pretty well settled i grant says mangogul that it would be ridiculous indeed to rely on those toys but for want of others i was necessitated to confine myself to them i have already told you and i now repeat it good company with respect to toys is scarcer than you think and if you will not resolve to gain yourself—— i interrupted mirzoza smartly i shall never have a castle while i live if i must use those means for obtaining one a speaking toy fy that is so indecent——prince in one word you know my reasons and with great seriousness i now reiterate my menaces but either do not complain of my trials or at least hint at some persons to whom you think we may have recourse for i am quite uneasy that the affair is not terminated libertin toys and what next libertin toys and always libertin toys i have great confidence says mirzoza in egles toy and i wait with impatience for the end of the fortnight which you demanded of me madam replied mangogul that term expired yesterday and while selim was telling you stories of the old court i learnt from egles toy that thanks to the ill humor of celebi and the constant attendance of almanzor its mistress can do you no service ah prince cryd the favourite what have you said tis fact replied the sultan i will regale you with that story some other time but in the mean while seek another string to your bow egle the virtuous egle has at length given herself the lye says the favorite in a surprize indeed i cannot recover myself i see you are quite unhinged replies mangogul and know not whither to turn yourself not so says the favorite but i own to you that i depended much on egle pray think no more about it added mangogul only tell us if she was the only virtuous woman that you know no prince there are a hundred others and amiable women too whom i will name to you replied mirzoza i will answer as much as for myself for——for—— mirzoza stopd short without having pronounced any one name selim could not refrain from smiling and the sultan from bursting out into laughter at the favorites embarrassment who knew so many virtuous women and could not recollect any one mirzoza piqued at this turned to selim and said pray selim help me out you who are so great a connoisseur prince continued she directing her discourse to the sultan apply to——whom shall i name prithee selim assist me to mirzoza says selim you make your court to me very ill replied the favorite i am not afraid of the trial but i abhor it name some one else quickly if you would have me pardon you one may try says selim if zaide has found the reality of the ideal lover which she formed to herself and to whom she was formerly wont to compare all those who made love to her zaide replys mangogul i must own that she is a very proper subject to make me lose she is added the favorite perhaps the only woman whose reputation has been spared by the prude arsinoe and the coxcomb janeki this is strong says mangogul but the trial of my ring is a better argument let us go directly to her toy that oracle is surer much than calchas  how adds the favorite smiling you retain your racine like a player   sultan mangogul and the favourite  chap xlix twentyninth trial of the ring zuleiman and zaide mangogul without answering the favorites joke departed instantly and went to zaides house he found her retired in a closet at a small table on which he observed some letters a portrait and some trifles scatterd here and there which came from a cherished lover as it was easy to presume by the fondness she expressed for them she was writing tears ran down her cheeks and wetted the paper every now and then she kissd the portrait with transport opened the letters wrote some words returned to the portrait snatched up the above mentioned trifles and pressed them to her breast the sultans astonishment was incredible he had never seen any tender woman but the favorite and zaide he thought himself beloved by mirzoza but did not zaide love zuleiman better still and were not this pair the only true lovers of congo the tears which zaide shed in writing were not tears of sorrow twas love that made them flow and in that moment a delicious sentiment which arose from a certainty of possessing the heart of zuleiman was the only one that affected her dear zuleiman cryd she how i love thee how dear thou art to me how agreeably thou employest me in those instants when zaide has not the happiness of seeing thee she writes to thee how much she is thine separated from zuleiman his love is the only conversation which gives her pleasure zaide was thus far advanced in her amorous meditation when mangogul pointed his ring at her immediately he heard her toy send forth a sigh and repeat the first words of her mistresss monology dear zuleiman how i love thee how dear thou art to me how agreeably thou employest me zaides heart and toy were too well agreed to vary in their discourse zaide was surprized at first but she was so sure that her toy would say nothing but what zuleiman might hear with pleasure that she wishd him present mangogul repeated his trial and zaides toy repeated with a soft tender voice zuleiman dear zuleiman how i love thee how dear thou art to me zuleiman says the sultan is the happiest mortal of my empire let us abandon this place where the image of a happiness greater than mine is presented to my sight and afflicts me accordingly he withdrew and went to his favorite with an air of inquietude and pensiveness prince says she what ails you you say nothing to me of zaide——zaide is an adorable woman madam replied mangogul she loves beyond any thing that ever loved—so much the worse for her says mirzoza what do you say replied the sultan——i say answers the favorite that kermades is one of the most disagreeable persons of congo that interest and the authority of the parents made that match and that there never was a couple worse sorted than kermades and zaide but madam replies mangogul it is not her husband that she loves——who then says mirzoza——tis zuleiman replies mangogul——adieu then to the porcelains and the little sapajou added the sultana——ah says mangogul whispering to himself this zaide has struck me she pursues me she occupies my thoughts i must absolutely see her again mirzoza interrupted him by some questions which he answered in monosyllables he refused a game of piquet which she proposed complaind of a headach which he counterfeited retired to his appartment went to bed without supping which he had never done before and had no sleep the charms and tenderness of zaide the qualities and happiness of zuleiman tormented him the whole night one may easily imagine that he had no business so much in his head this day as to return to zaide he walkd out of his palace even without enquiring after mirzoza the first time that ever he faild in this point he found zaide in the same closet as the preceding day and zuleiman with her who held his mistresses hands between his own and had his eyes fixed on her zaide on her knees and inclining forward darted glances animated with the most ardent passion on zuleiman they continued some time in this attitude but both in the same instant yielding to the violence of their desires they rushd into each others arms and embraced with eagerness the profound silence which had hitherto reigned about them was disturbed by their sighs the sound of their mutual kisses and some inarticulated words which slipd from them——you love me——i adore you——will you love me constantly——alas the last sigh of my life shall be for zaide—— mangogul overwhelmd with sorrow threw himself into an easy chair and covered his eyes with his hand he dreaded seeing things which are easily imagined and yet did not happen after a silence of some moments ah dear and tender lover says zaide why have i not always found you such as you are at present i should not love you the less nor should i have any reproach to throw on myself——but you weep dear zuleiman come dear and tender lover come and let me wipe off your tears zuleiman you cast down your eyes what ails you pray look on me——come dear friend come that i may comfort thee cling thy lips on my mouth breathe thy soul into me receive mine suspend——ah no——no——zaide finished her discourse with a deep sigh and was silent the african author informs us that this scene touched mangogul most sensibly that he built some hopes on the impotence of zuleiman and that some secret proposals were made on his behalf to zaide who rejected them and never made any merit of it with her lover  chap l platonic love but is this zaide an unique mirzoza is no ways inferior to her in charms and i have a thousand proofs of her affection i desire to be loved i am and who has told me that zuleiman is more so than i i was a fool to envy anothers happiness no there is no man under the heavens happier than mangogul thus began the remonstrances which the sultan made to himself the author has surpressed the rest and contents himself with apprizing us that the prince paid more regard to them than to those which his ministers presented him with and that zaide never after returned on his mind one of those evenings that he was entirely satisfied with his mistress or with himself he proposed sending for selim to walk in the groves of the seraglio these were verdant closets where many things may be said and done without witnesses in their way thither mangogul turnd the conversation on the reasons people have for loving mirzoza mounted on grand principles and filld with ideas of virtue which certainly did not suit with her rank person or age maintaind that people very frequently loved for the sake of loving and that connections begun by a likeness of characters supported by esteem and cemented by mutual confidence were very lasting and constant without any pretensions to favors on the mans side or on the womans any temptation to grant them thus it is madam replied the sultan that you have been spoild by romances in them you have seen heros respectuous and princesses virtuous even to folly without reflecting that those beings never existed but in the brains of authors if you ask selim who thoroughly well knows the catechism of cythera what is love i would lay a wager that he would answer you that love is nothing else but—— would you lay a wager interrupted the sultana that delicacy of sentiments is but a chimæra and that without hopes of enjoyment there would not be a grain of love in the world if so you must certainly entertain a very bad opinion of the human heart so i do replied mangogul our virtues are not more disinterested than our vices the brave pursues glory by exposing himself to dangers the coward loves tranquility and life and the lover desires enjoyment selim declaring himself of the sultans party added that if two things happened love would be banished from society never more to make its appearance again and which are those two things says the favorite they are replied mangogul if you and i madam and all the race of mankind chanced to lose what tanzai and neadarne found in a dream what you believe interrupted mirzoza that without those pitiful things there would be neither esteem nor confidence between two persons of different sexes a woman adornd with talents wit and beauty would not touch a man blessd with an amiable person a fine genius and excellent character would not be heeded no madam replies mangogul for pray tell me what he would say a number of pretty things which i think would always afford much pleasure to hear answers the favorite observe madam says selim that those things are said every day without love no no madam i have complete proofs that without a well organised body there is no love agenor the handsomest young man of congo and the most refined wit of the court would if i had been a woman in vain shew me his genteel leg turn his large blue eyes on me squander on me the most artful praise and set himself off with every other advantage of which he is master i would say but one word and if he did not give an express answer to this word i might have all possible esteem for him but i should not love him that is positive added the sultan and you yourself will allow the justness and utility of this mysterious word when one loves you ought indeed for your instruction to cause the conversation of a wit of banza with a schoolmaster to be related to you you could comprehend in an instant how the wit who sustained your thesis confessed in the end that he was in the wrong and that his antagonist reasoned like a toy but selim of whom i had it will you tell the story the favorite imagined that a story which mangogul would not relate to her must be very mortifying and therefore she went into one of the arbors without asking it of selim and happy it was for him for with all his wit he would have ill satisfied the favorites curiosity or much allarmd her modesty but in order to amuse her and make her forget the story of the schoolmaster he related the following madam says the courtier in a vast country near the sources of the nile lived a young man beautiful as adonis before he was eighteen years of age all the maidens contended for his heart and there were few women who would not accept of him for their lover born with an amorous heart he loved as soon as he was in a condition to love on a certain day while he was in the temple assisting at the public worship of the great pagoda and was according to the usual ceremony preparing to make the seventeen genuflexions prescribed by the law the beauty with which he was captivated chanced to pass by and darted a glance on him accompanyd with a smile which threw him into such distraction that he lost his poize fell on his nose scandalized the congregation by his fall forgot the number of genuflexions and performed but sixteen the great pagoda irritated at the offence and scandal punished him cruelly hilas for that was his name the poor hilas felt himself instantly inflamed with the most violent desires and smacksmooth as the palm of his hand deprived of the means of gratifying them equally surprized and grieved at so great a loss he consulted the pagoda thou shalt never be restored to thy pristine state answered she sneezing but between the arms of a woman who shall not love thee the less for knowing thy misfortune presumption is generally the companion of youth and beauty hilas fancied that his wit and the comeliness of his person would soon gain him a heart of nice sentiments who content with what he had remaining would love him for himself and soon restore to him what he had lost he first addrest himself to the lady who had been the innocent cause of his misfortune she was young brisk voluptuous and a coquet hilas adored her and obtained a meeting where by a train of allurements he was drawn into the road leading to a place which it was impossible for him to reach in vain did he torment himself and in the arms of his mistress seek the accomplishment of the oracle nothing appeared when the lady was tired of waiting she set herself to rights in a moment and quitted him the worst of the affair was that the foolish girl told it in confidence to one of her female friends who out of her great discretion related it but to three or four of hers who did the same to as many others so that hilas two days before the darling of all the sex was despised pointed at and looked on as a monster the wretched hilas cried down in his native country resolved to travel and seek a remedy for his disease in remote climes he set out alone and arrived incognito at the court of the abyssinian emperor the young stranger was singled out by the ladies and the contest was who should have him but hilas prudently avoided all engagements in which he had apprehensions of not finding his account proportionable to his certainty that the women who pursued him would not find theirs in him but observe and admire the penetration of the sex a man so young so comely and so modest said they is quite a prodigy and the union of these qualities in him had almost made them suspect his real defect so as for fear of allowing him what an accomplished man should have to refuse him the very thing which he wanted after having for some time studied the chart of the country hilas linked an acquaintance with a young woman who by some unknown caprice had passed from refined gallantry to the highest devotion he gradually insinuated himself into her confidence espoused her notions copied her practices handed her in and out of the temples and conversed with her so frequently on the vanity of worldly pleasures that he insensibly revived her taste as well as remembrance of them they had now for above a month frequented the mosques assisted at sermons and visited the sick together when he prepared himself for a thorough cure but all in vain his devote friend tho intimately acquainted with all the transactions of heaven knew as well as others how a man should be made on earth and the poor lad lost in a moment all the fruits of his good works if any thing consoled him it was that his secret was inviolably kept one word would have rendered his disease incurable but this word was not uttered and hilas linked in with some other pious women whom he took one after another for the specific ordained by the oracle and who did not break his enchantment because they loved him only for what he was not the habit they had acquired of spiritualizing all objects was of no service to him they required sense but it was of that sort which springs from pleasure hilas complained that they did not love him but their answer was pray sir are you ignorant that people should know each other before they love nay you must acknowledge that disgraced as you are you are not lovely even when you are known alas said he retiring this pure love so much talked of is no where to be found this delicacy of sentiments upon which both sexes value themselves is a mere chimæra the oracle has deceived me and my disease is for life in his way he met some of those women who allow no other commerce with man but that of the heart and who hate a forward spark like a toad they so seriously recommended to him to let nothing gross and terrestrial enter into his views that he conceived great hopes of his cure he complied heartily and was quite astonished after the amorous conversations which they held with him that he still remained as he was i must certainly be cured said he to himself but perhaps otherwise than by words and he sought an occasion of placing himself according to the intentions of the oracle thus it soon offered a young female platonic who was excessively fond of walking led him into a lonesome wood and when they had penetrated far from the reach of any impertinent eye the fair one was seized with a fainting fit hilas threw himself on her and neglected nothing in his power to relieve her but all his endeavours were fruitless of which she soon became as sensible as himself ah sir cried she disengaging herself from his arms what sort of man are you i shall be very cautious of ever venturing thus into lonesome places where i have been taken so ill and may dye a hundred times for want of help others knew his condition pitied him protested to him that the tenderness they had conceived for him should not change and never saw him more the miserable hilas with his graceful figure and the most refined sentiments gave great dissatisfaction to many ladies then he was a fool interrupted the sultan why did he not address some of the vestals of which our monasteries are full they would be charmed with him and he would infallibly receive his cure through a grate prince replied selim chronicles assure us that he tried that method and found by experience that the sex of all conditions do not care to love to their certain loss if that be the case said the sultan i take his distemper to be incurable so did he himself as well as your highness continued selim and tired out with unsuccessful trials he plunged himself into solitude on the word of an infinite number of women who had expresly declared to him that he was useless in society he had already been several days rambling in a desert when he heard some sighs issuing from a lonely place he listened the sighs began again he drew near and saw a young maiden fair as the morn her head leaning on her hand her eyes bathed in tears and the rest of her body in a pensive and mournful posture what seek you here madam said he to her and are these deserts made for you yes replied she in a melancholy strain i can at least afflict myself here quite at my ease and what is the cause of your affliction—alas—speak madam what is the cause——nothing——how nothing——no nothing at all i say is the cause of my grief two years ago i had the misfortune to offend a pagoda who deprived me of my all and it was so small a matter that in so doing she gave no great proof of her power since that time all the men shun me and will shun me said the pagoda until i meet with one who knowing my misfortune will cleave to me and love me in the state in which i am what do i hear cried hilas this wretch whom you behold at your feet has nothing and that is his distemper likewise some time since he had the misfortune to offend a pagoda who deprived him of all that he had and without vanity it was somewhat from that time all the women shun him and will shun him said the pagoda until he meets with one who knowing his misfortune will cleave to him and love him in the state in which he is is this possible says the young maiden——is what you have told me true says hilas——see answered the maiden see answered hilas they both convinced each other beyond all doubt that they were two objects of the celestial wrath their common misfortune united them iphis this was the young maidens name was made for hilas hilas was made for her they loved each other in a platonic manner as you may easily imagine for they could not well love otherwise but in an instant the inchantment was broken they uttered cries of joy on the event and platonic love vanished during several months that they continued together in the desert they had full time to be persuaded of their change when they quitted it iphis was perfectly cured but as to hilas the author says that he was threatned with a relapse  chap li thirtieth and last trial of the ring mirzoza while mangogul was entertaining himself with the favorite and selim news was brought him of the death of sulamek sulameks rise began by being appointed the sultans dancingmaster and that even contrary to the intentions of erguebzed but some intriguing ladies whom he had taught certain dangerous steps pushed him with all their might and so bestirred themselves that he was preferred to marcel and others whose deputy he was not worthy of being he possessed the spirit of trifling the court jargon the gift of telling diverting stories and of amusing children but he knew nothing of the high dance when the post of grand vizir became vacant by dint of cringing he supplanted the great seneschal who was an indefatigable dancer but stiffnecked and bowed with a bad grace his ministry was not signalized by any events glorious to the nation his enemies and who is there without them true merit has many accused him of playing ill on the violin and of having no knowledge of choregraphy of having suffered himself to be duped by the pantomimes of prester john and to be affrighted by a bear from monoémugi who danced one day before him of having given millions to the emperor of tombur to keep him from dancing at a time when he had the gout and spent yearly five hundred thousand zecchins in resin and more in persecuting all the fidlers who played any other minuets but his own in a word of having slept fifteen years of a stretch at the sound of a cymbal of a clumsy native of guinea who accompanied his instrument with some congo songs true it is that he had introduced the fashion of dutch lime trees c mangogul had an excellent heart he regretted sulamek and ordered him a magnificent burial with a funeral oration which the orator brrrouboubou was ordered to make on the day appointed for the ceremony the chief bramins the whole divan in a body and the sultanas led by their eunuchs went to the great mosque brrrouboubou proved for two hours together with surprizing rapidity that sulamek had risen to his high station by superior talents made prefaces on prefaces did not forget either mangogul or his exploits during the administration of sulamek and he had almost spent himself in exclamations when mirzoza to whom a lye gave the vapors fell into a fit of the lethargy her officers and women ran to her assistance she was put into her palanquine and instantly carried to the seraglio mangogul being informed of the danger she was in ran to her and the whole pharmacopoeia was rummaged the garus general la mottes drops the english drops were all tried but to no purpose the distressed sultan one moment weeping over mirzoza the next swearing at orcotomus at length was deprived of all hopes except some glimmerings which might remain in his ring if i have lost you delight of my soul cried he your toy as well as your mouth must keep eternal silence in an instant he commanded every body to withdraw he was obeyed and being alone with the favorite he turned his ring on her but mirzozas toy which was tired at the sermon as it happens to others every day and besides had probably a touch of the lethargy at first only mutterd some confused and ill articulated words the sultan repeated the experiment and the toy then very distinctly said separated from you mangogul what would become of me—faithful even to the grave i would have sought you and if love and constancy have any recompence among the dead dear prince i would have found you—alas without you the delightful palace where brama dwells and which he has promised to his true believers would prove a disagreeable residence to me mangogul transported with joy did not perceive that the favorite was recovering from her lethargy and that if he did not turn off his ring she would hear the last words of her toy which happened accordingly ah prince said she what is become of your oaths you have then cleared up your unjust suspicions nothing has withheld you neither the condition i was in the injury you were doing me nor the word you had given me madam replied the sultan impute not to a shameful curiosity an impatience which the despair for having lost you has alone suggested to me it was not an usual trial of my ring that i made on you but i believed that i might without breach of promise make use of a resource which restores you to my vows and secures my heart to you for ever prince says the favorite i believe you but pray restore the ring to the genius and let not his fatal present disturb your heart or empire for the future mangogul immediately made a prayer and cucufa appeared almighty genius said mangogul take back your ring and continue me your protection prince answered the genius divide your days between love and glory mirzoza will certainly afford you the first of these blessings and i promise you the second at these words the hooded spectre closed the tails of his owls and went off as he came in a whirling motion the end
