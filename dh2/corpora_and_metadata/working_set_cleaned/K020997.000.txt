william hayley esquire  the third edition corrected and enlarged  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxxxi  epistle the first argument of the first epistle introduction  the flourishing state of art in this country  disadvantages attending the modern painter of portraits  short encomium on this branch of art with the account of its origin in the story of the maid of corinth  superiority of historical painting  some account of the greeks who excelled in it  its destruction and revival in italy  short account of the most eminent italian and spanish painters  those of flanders and france  the corruption of art among the latter  to mr george romney epistle i blessed be the hour when favoring gales restore the traveled artist to his native shore his mind enlightened and his fancy fraught with finest forms by ancient genius wrought whose magic beauty charmed with spell sublime the scythe of ruin from the hand of time and moved the mighty leveller to spare models of grace so exquisitely fair while you whom painting thus inspired to roam bring these rich stores of ripened judgment home while now attending my accomplished friend science and taste his softened colors blend let the fond muse though with a transient view the progress of her sister art pursue eager in tracing from remotest time the steps of painting through each favored clime to praise her dearest sons whose daring aim gained their bright stations on the heights of fame and mark the paths by which her partial hand conducts her romney to this radiant band painting sweet nymph now leaves in lifeless trance exhausted italy and tinsel france and sees in britain with exulting eyes her votries prosper and her glories rise yet though my friend thy art is thus carest and with the homage of the public blessed and flourishes with growing beauty fair the child of majestys adoptive care the youthful artist still is doomed to feel obstructions chilling hand that damps his zeal the imperious voice of vanity and pride bids him from fancys region turn aside and quit the magic of her scene to trace the vacant lines of some unmeaning face even in this work his wishes still are crossed and all the efforts of his art are lost for when the canvas with the mirrors truth reflects the perfect form of age or youth the fond affections of the partial mind the eye of judgment with delusion blind each mother bids him brighter tints employ and give new spirit to her booby boy nor can the painter with his utmost art express the image in the lovers heart unconscious of the change the seasons bring autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring and vain selflove in every age the same will fondly urge some visionary claim the luckless painter destined to submit mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit and doomed to groundless censure bears alone the grievous load of errors not his own nor is it pride or follys vain command that only fetters his creative hand at fashions nod he copies as they pass each quaint reflection from her crowded glass the formal coat with intersecting line mars the free graces of his fair design the towering cap he marks with like distress and all the motley mass of female dress the hoop extended with enormous size the corks that like a promontory rise the stays of deadly steel in whose embrace the tyrant fashion tortures injured grace but art despairing over shapes like these to cast an air of elegance and ease invokes kind fancys aid  she comes to spread her magic spells  the gothic forms are fled and see to crown the painters just desire her free positions and her light attire the ambitious artist wishes to pursue this brilliant plan with more extensive view and with adopted character to give a lasting charm to make the portrait live all points of art by one nice effort gain delight the learned and content the vain make history to life new value lend ver    see note i  and in the comprehensive picture blend the ancient hero with the living friend most fair device but ah what foes to sense what broods of motley monsters rise from hence the strange pretensions of each age and sex these plans of fancy and of taste perplex for male and female to themselves unknown demand a character unlike their own till often the painter to this quaint distress prefers the awkward shapes of common dress sweet girls of mild and pensive softness choose the sportive emblems of the comic muse and sprightly damsels are inclined to borrow the garb of penitence and tears of sorrow while awkward pride though safe from wars alarms round his plump body buckles ancient arms and from an honest justice of the peace starts up at once a demigod of greece too firm of heart by ridicule to fail the finished hero crowns his country hall ordained to fill if fire his glory spare the lumbergarret of his wiser heir not less absurd to flatter neros eyes ver  00 see note ii  arose the portrait of colossal size twice fifty feet the enormous sheet

ancient days and from the force of bright example bold rival their worth and be what they behold blessed be the pencil whose consoling power scothing soft friendship in her pensive hour dispels the

forbidden fire concealed the simple picture from her sire his kindred fancy still to nature just copied her line and formed the mimic bust thus from thy power inspiring love we trace the modeled image and the pencild face we pity genius when by interest led his toils but reach the semblance of a head yet are those censures too severe and vain that scorn the portrait as the painters bane though up

this kind  note ii verse  00 not less absurd to flatter neros eyes pliny furnishes us with this singular anecdote as an instance of the extravagant abuse of portraitpainting in his days which as he informs us had arrived to a degree of madness nero had ordered himself to be painted under the figure of a colossus upon cloth or canvass a hundred and twenty feet in height the same author informs us that this preposterous picture when it was finished met with its fate from lightning which consumed it and involved likewise the most beautiful part of the gardens where it was placed in the

the same writer who lived in the second century of the christian era informs us that this monument of ancient art was extant at corinth in his time though pliny seems to intimate that it did not survive the taking of that city by mummius  in the poesies de fontenelle there is an epistle from the maid of corinth whom the author calls dibutadis to her imaginary lover polemon she describes her

confused and imperfect idea of the painters performance how much the art is indebted to this ancient master what grace and softness he gave to the human countenance what embellishments he added to the

born deaf and dumb from whence he derives his common title el mudo he rose to great reputation as a painter and was warmly patronized by his sovereign as appears from the following incident  in painting the martyrdom of a saint he had introduced the figure of his personal enemy who happened to be the kings secretary in the character of the executioner the secretary complained to his master and petitioned that his features might be effaced but his majesty defended the painter and ordered the figure to remain  in praising this singular genius i have ventured to borrow something like a conceit from the famous spanish poet lope de vega who has celebrated his talents in the following verses  del mudo pintor famosissimo no quiso el cielo que hablasse porque con mi entendimiento diesse mayor sentimiento a las cosas que pintasse y tanta vida les di con el pincel singular que como no pude hablar hize que hablassen por mi the poet also honored this favorite artist who died in      with

painting our charles the first during his visit at madrid perhaps he contributed not a little to form the taste and passion for art by which that prince was so eminently distinguished the spanish painter rose to great honors in his own country and had like rubens the singular fortune to unite the character of an ambassador with that of an artist being sent on an extraordinary commission in      to pope innocent x  one of his most striking historical pictures was the expulsion of the moors from spain a noble national subject which he painted for philip the third in competition with three artists of reputation and obtained the preference  but he is particularly celebrated for the spirit and energy of his portraits concerning which there are two singular anecdotes related by his spanish biographer and the following may possibly amuse the reader  in      he executed a portrait of don adrian pulido pareja commander in chief of an armament appointed to new spain and pleased himself so well in the execution that he affixed his name to the picture a circumstance not usual with him he had painted with pencils of uncommon length for the sake of working at a greater distance and with peculiar force so that the picture says my spanish author when near is not to be distinguished and at a distance is a miracle as velasguez after this portrait was finished was at work in the palace the king as usual went privately to his apartment to see him paint when observing the figure of pareja and taking it for the real person he exclaimed with surprise what are you still here have you not your dispatches and why are you not gone but soon perceiving his mistake he turned to velasquez who modestly doubted the reality of the deception and said i protest to you it deceived me for this

too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the dutch pencil as a contemptible performance while those who are satisfied with minute and faithful delineations of nature find absolute perfection

and ample frtune which he so justly acquired present to the mind an animating idea of what may be expected from a happy cultivation of talents in a course of constant and spirited application though he visited the court of charles the first in the public character of an ambassador it does not appear how long he resided here  mr walpole conjectures about a year  his pictures in the ceiling at whitehall were not painted in england which perhaps is the reason he has been at the pains of finishing them so neatly that they will bear the nearest inspection for he must have well known how greatly the reputation of any work depends on its first happy impression on the public and concluded his pictures would be viewed by the king and court instantly on their arrival and that the critics

brought into question  germany made a strong but unsuccessful effort to rob holland of the glory which she derives from the first invention of printing and painting in oil it has been said was known in italy before the time of john van eyck or john of bruges as he is commonly called to whom that discovery is generally ascribed about the year    0  but vasari in his life of antonello da messina relates very particularly the circumstances of van eycks invention and the subsequent introduction of the secret into italy a most learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has supposed that van eyck might possibly learn the secret of using oil in england and take the honor of the invention to himself as we were then a country little known to the world of arts nor at leisure from the confusion of the times to claim the discovery of such a secret  walpoles anecdotes of painting vol i p     the conjecture is not without some little foundation  but the conjectural claims which either italy or england can produce to this excellent invention are by no means sufficiently strong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious fleming  since the preceding part of this note was written the reputation both of van eyck and his encomiast vasari has been very forcibly attacked in an essay on oilpainting by mr raspe an essay which discovers such a zealous attachment to the arts and such an active pursuit of knowledge as do great credit to its ingenious author but though i have perused it with the attention it deserves it does not lead me to retract what i had said because after all his researches on this subject it appears that although oilpainting was not absolutely the invention of van eyck it was yet indebted to him for those improvements which made it of real value to his profession  the ingenious fleming seems therefore to be still entitled to those honors that have been lavished on his name as improvement in such cases is often more useful and more meritorious than invention itself which is frequently the effect of chance while the former arises from welldirected study  note xxxiv verse     where sumptuous leo courted every muse the name of

few characters who have possessed a large portion of pleasant vivacity and satirical humor with a sublime imagination his talents as a painter are universally celebrated but his social virtues though perhaps not inferior are far from being so generally known in the raccolta di lettere sulla pittura there are many of his letters to his intimate friend ricciardi an italian poet and professor of moral philosophy at pisa which perfectly display the warmth of his friendship and the generosity of his heart  they contain also some amusing anecdotes relating to his profession and the great delight which he took in discovering historical subjects of a peculiar cast untouched by other painters and appearing to an ignorant eye almost beyond the limits of his art he seems to describe himself with justice as well as energy in the following words of a letter to ricciardi tutto bile tutto spirito tutto suoco  though he must have been wonderfully pleasant as a companion and valuable as a friend yet he laments that his satires had made him many enemies and heartily wishes he had never produced them in that which relates to painting he exposes indeed the vices of his brethren with great freedom and severity  it is remarkable that his poetry abounds more with learned allusions than with high flights of imagination yet in the satire i have mentioned there is much whimsical fancy an ape is introduced applying to a painter and begging to learn his profession as nature he says has given him a genius for the mimetic arts  the painter complies  but his disciple after an apprenticeship of ten years bids his master adieu with many humorous execrations against the art of painting  other parts of the poem contain many sensible and serious remarks on the abuses of the pencil and as the

procuress of pleasure  hurds note on the following line of horace suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella  to this let me add one observation for the honor of our english artists  the prostitution of

mine drudges on petty draughts nor dares design a more exalted work and more divine but the drudgery of the poet arose from the most cruel necessity that of the painter from avarice the bane of excellence in every profession  if sir godfrey had any talents for history which is surely very doubtful we have as mr walpole well observes no reason to regret that he was confined to portraits as his pencil has faithfully transmitted to us so many ornaments of an illustrious age  though i have partly subscribed to the general idea that william in whose reign this painter principally flourished contributed nothing to the advancement of arts yet i must observe that his employing kneller to paint the beauties at hampton court his rewarding him with knighthood and the additional present of a gold medal and chain weighing l 00 may justify those lines of pope which describe the hero william as an encourager of painting  note xliv verse    while partial taste from modest riley turned john

princely plan about twenty years ago the present duke of richmond opened in his house at whitehall a gallery for artists completely filled with a small but wellchosen collection of casts from the antique and engaged two eminent artists to superintend and direct the students  this noble encouragement of art though superseded by a royal establishment is still entitled to remembrance and honor it not only served as a prelude to more extensive institutions but contributed much toward forming some capital artists of the present time the name of mortimer is alone sufficient to reflect a considerable luster on this early school  note xlvii verse     teach but thy transient tints no more to fly although the superior excellencies of this admirable artist make us peculiarly regret the want of durability in his exquisite productions yet he is far from being the only artist whose pictures soon discover an appearance of precipitate decay fugitive coloring seems indeed to be the chief defect among our present painters in oil and it must be the most ardent wish of every lover of art that so great an evil may be effectually remedied as the royal academy is a society of enlightened artists established for the improvement of every branch of painting it may be hoped that they will pay attention to this mechanical point as well as to the nobler acquirements of art and employ some person who has patience and abilities for such an office to discover by a course of experiments to what cause this important evil is owing if it be found to arise from the adulteration of colors oils and varnishes might it not be eligible for the academy to follow the example of another profession who where health and life are concerned obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader by opening a shop at the expense of the society to prepare and fell the various ingredients free from those adulterations which private interest might otherwise produce  but there may be no just ground of complaint against the integrity of the colourman and this failure may perhaps arise from the artists mixing his colors and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other that is instead of painting with oil properly thickened with color using oil only fully stained with it to which a proper consistence or body as the painters call it is given by strong gum varnishes in short using more vehicle than color by which although most brilliant and transparent effects may be produced yet the particles of color are too much attenuated and divided from each other and consequently less able to withstand the destructive action of light if the deficiency complained of originates from this source the academy by a careful course of experiments may be able clearly to ascertain what preparations of the more delicate colors are most durable what oils and varnishes will best preserve the original brilliancy of the paint what are the best proportions for this purpose in which they can be used and how far glazing that almost irresistible temptation to oilpainters may or may not be depended on all these points are at present so far from being known with certainty that perhaps there are not two painters who think perfectly alike on any one of them the author hopes that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his presuming to offer a hint on this delicate subject with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted the ideas which he has thus ventured to address to them arise only from the most ardent wish that future ages may have a just and adequate sense of the flourishing state of painting in england in the reign of george the third and that our present excellent artists may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the esteem of posterity  a very liberal critic vide the gentlemans magazine for november      page      in his flattering remarks on the poem seems in speaking of this note to mistake a little the meaning of its author who alluded only to that defect in coloring where the finer tints are so managed for the sake of an immediate and shortlived brilliancy that they sink very soon into no color at all he did not mean to touch on those changes in painting where the colors all grow darker the lights become brown and the shadows one mass of black this is likewise a great evil and calls aloud for redress perhaps the critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cause of this defect viz the indiscriminate blending of the colors and the not using pure simple uncompounded tints  note xlviii verse     the leading principles of liberal art i embrace with pleasure the opportunity of paying this tribute to the great artist here mentioned who is not only at the head of his own profession but may justly be ranked among the first writers of the age his discourses not merely calculated for the improvement of the young artists to whom they are addressed contain all the principles of true and universal taste embellished with great brilliancy of imagination and with equal force of expression  note xlix verse     thy ugolino etc as the subject of this admirable picture is taken from a poet so little known to the english reader as dante it may not perhaps be impertinent to say that in richardsons discourse on the science of a connoisseur there is a translation of the story in english blank verse a young and noble author now living has obliged the world with a translation of it in rhyme  as to the picture no artist could express more happily the wild and sublime spirit of the poet from whom he drew we may justly apply to him the compliment which a lively italian addressed to a great man of his own country but of far inferior expression  fabro gentil ben sai ch ancor tragico caso e caro oggetto e che spesso l horror va col diletto marino note l verse     now art exults with annual triumphs gay while we are delighted with the increasing splendour of these annual entertainments it is but just to remember that we are indebted to the society of arts and sciences for our first public exhibition of paintings the different societies of artists soon followed so excellent an example and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highest honor on this happy institution our exhibitions at once afford both the best nursery for the protection of infant genius and the noblest field for the display of accomplished merit nor do they only administer to the benefit of the artist and the pleasure of the public they have still a more exalted tendency and when national subjects are painted with dignity and force our exhibitions may justly be regarded as schools of public virtue perhaps the young soldier can never be more warmly animated to the service of his country than by gazing with the delighted public on a sublime picture of the expiring hero who died with glory in her defense but not to dwell on their power of inspiring martial enthusiasm our exhibitions may be said to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of those who fill the different departments of more tranquil life in support of this sentiment i beg leave to transcribe the following judicious remark from an author who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and spirited essays they whose natural feelings have been properly improved by culture nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world know from experience how the heart is mollified the manners polished and the temper sweetened by a welldirected study of the arts of imitation the same sensibility of artificial excellence extends itself to the perception of natural and moral beauty and the student returns from the artists gallery

filled up the measure of his superior guilt by the horrid assassination of his son philip on his marriage with mary assumed the title of king of england and to him titian addressed the letter which

passage of a letter which he addressed to one of philips attendants mando ora la poesia di venere e adone nella quale v s vedra quanto spirito e amore so mettere nell opere di sua maesta  raccolta tom

heneage quoted in collinss memoirs of the sidnies the tide of national admiration flowed very strong in favor of sidney when mr walpole in speaking of lord brook appeared to check the current but the merits of sidney are sufficient to bear down all opposition  instead of joining the elegant author i have mentioned in considering sir philip sidney as an astonishing object of temporary admiration i am surprised that so judicious an author should ever question so fair a title to universal regard the learning and munificence the courage and courtesy of sidney endeared him to every rank and he justly challenges the lasting affection of his country from the closing scene of his life in which heroism and humanity are so beautifully blended i never can think this accomplished character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance in which however there are many touches of exquisite beauty and spirit to amuse a most amiable sister whom he tenderly loved or by his having

corpse to be removed and buried in the chancel of the church at chelsea as sir thomas more in his lifetime had appointed his head having remained about fourteen days upon london bridge and being to be cast into the thames to make room for others she bought it for this she was summoned before the council as the same author relates and behaved with the greatest firmness justifying her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety she was however imprisoned but soon released and dying nine years after her father at the age of thirtysix was buried at st dunstans in canterbury the head of her father which she had preserved with religious veneration in a box of lead was at her particular request committed with her to the grave it was seen standing on her coffin in the year      when the vault of the roper her husbands family was opened  see ballards memoirs of learned ladies p     the character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by addison and walpole  she married at the age of twenty william roper esquire of kent to the infinite satisfaction of her father for she seems to have been the dearest object of his parental affection which is very strongly marked in his letters addressed to her she was indeed most eminently distinguished by her learning in an age when the graces of the mind were regarded as an essential article in female education but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a still sperior luster on this accomplished woman  there is more than one passage in her life which would furnish an admirable subject for the pencil her interview with her
