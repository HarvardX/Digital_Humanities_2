of that set up at our very door france has never been hitherto seen or even imagined in europe what our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations it is a serious thing to have a connection with a people who live only under positive arbitrary and changeable institutions and those not perfected nor supplied nor explained by any common acknowledged rule of moral science i remember that in one of my last conversations with the late lord camden we were struck much in the same manner with the abolition in france of the law as a science of methodized and artificial equity france since her revolution is under the sway of a sect whose leaders have deliberately at one stroke demolished the whole body of that jurisprudence which france had pretty nearly in common with other civilized countries in that jurisprudence were contained the elements and principles of the law of nations the great ligament of mankind with the law they have of course destroyed all seminaries in which jurisprudence was taught as well as all the corporations established for its conservation i have not heard of any country whether in europe or asia or even in africa on this side of mount atlas which is wholly without some such colleges and such corporations except france no man in a public or private concern can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed nor is there to be found a professor in any university or a practitioner in any court who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in france in any case whatever they have not only annulled all their old treaties but they have renounced the law of nations from whence treaties have their force with a fixed design they have outlawed themselves and to their power outlawed all other nations instead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great and politic communion with the christian world they have constructed their republic on three bases all fundamentally opposite to those on which the communities of europe are built its foundation is laid in regicide in jacobinism and in atheism and it has joined to those principles a body of systematic manners which secures their operation  regicide peace  law of change we must all obey the great law of change it is the most powerful law of nature and the means perhaps of its conservation all we can do and that human wisdom can do is to provide that the change shall proceed by insensible degrees this has all the benefits which may be in change without any of the inconveniences of mutation every thing is provided for as it arrives this mode will on the one hand prevent the unfixing old interests at once a thing which is apt to breed a black and sullen discontent in those who are at once dispossessed of all their influence and consideration this gradual course on the other side will prevent men long under depression from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power which they always abuse with a licentious insolence but wishing as i do the change to be gradual and cautious i would in my first steps lean rather to the side of enlargement than restriction  letter to sir h langrishe m p  laws bad bad laws are the worst sort of tyranny in such a country as this they are of all bad things the worst worse by far than any where else and they derive a particular malignity even from the wisdom and soundness of the rest of our institutions for very obvious reasons you cannot trust the crown with a dispensing power over any of your laws  speech previous to the election at bristol  lawgiver character of a true lawgiver but it seems as if it were the prevalent opinion in paris that an unfeeling heart and an undoubting confidence are the sole qualifications for a perfect legislator far different are my ideas of that high office the true lawgiver ought to have an heart full of sensibility he ought to love and respect his kind and to fear himself it may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ultimate object with an intuitive glance but his movements toward it ought to be deliberate political arrangement as it is a work for social ends is to be only wrought by social means there mind must conspire with mind time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at our patience will atchieve more than our force if i might venture to appeal to what is so much out of fashion in paris i mean to experience i should tell you that in my course i have known and according to my measure have cooperated with great men and i have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were much inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the business by a slow but wellsustained progress the effect of each step is watched the good or ill success of the first gives light to us in the second and so from light to light we are conducted with safety through the whole series we see that the parts of the system do not clash the evils latent in the most promising contrivances are provided for as they arise one advantage is as little as possible sacrificed to another we compensate we reconcile we balance we are enabled to unite into a consistent whole the various anomalies and contending principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men from hence arises not an excellence in simplicity but one far superior an excellence in composition where the great interests of mankind are concerned through a long succession of generation that succession ought to be admitted into some share in the councils which are so deeply to affect them if justice requires this the work itself requires the aid of more minds than one age can furnish it is from this view of things that the best legislators have been often satisfied with the establishment of some sure solid and ruling principle in government a power like that which some of the philosophers have called a plastic nature and having fixed the principle they have lest it afterward to its own operation  reflections on the revolution in france  legislator and popular governments no legislator at any period of the world has willingly plad the seat of active power in the hands of the multitude because there it admits of no control no regulation no steady direction whatsoever the people are the natural control on authority but to exercise and to control together is contradictory and impossible  as the exorbitant exercise of power cannot under popular sway be effectually restrained the other great object of political arrangement the means of abating an excessive desire of it is in such a state still worse provided for the democratic commonwealth is the foodful nurse of ambition under the other forms it meets with many restraints whenever in states which have had a democratic basis the legislators have endeavored to put restraints upon ambition their methods were as violent as in the end they were ineffectual as violent indeed as any the most jealous despotism could invent the ostracism could not very long save itself and much less the state which it was meant to guard from the attempts of ambition one of the natural inbred incurable distempers of a powerful democracy  appeal from the new to the old whigs  legislators french whilst they french legislators are possessed by these notions theoretical it is vain to talk to them of the practice of their ancestors the fundamental laws of their country the fixed form of a constitution whose merits are confirmed by the solid test of long experience and an increasing public strength and national prosperity they despise experience as the wisdom of unlettered men and as for the rest they have wrought under ground a mine that will blow up at one grand explosion all examples of antiquity all precedents charters and acts of parliament they have the rights of men against these there can be no prescription against these no agreement is binding these admit no temperament and no compromise any thing withheld from their full demand is so much of fraud and injustice against these their rights of men let no government look for security in the length of its continuance or in the justice and lenity of its administration the objections of these speculatists if its forms do not quadrate with their theories are as valid against such an old and beneficent government as against the most violent tyranny or the greenest usurpation they are always at issue with governments not on a question of abuse but a question of competency and a question of title i have nothing to say to the clumsy subtilty of their political metaphysics let them be their amusement in the schools  illa se jaclet in auld  aeolus et clauso ventorum carcere regnet  but let them not break prison to burst like a levanter to sweep the earth with their hurricane and to break up the fountains of the great deep to overwhelm us  reflections on the revolution in france  liberty see freedom liberty if i understand it at all is a general principle and the clear right of all the subjects within the realm or of none partial freedom seem to me a most invidious mode of slavery but unfortunately it is the kind of slavery the most easily admitted in times of civil discord  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  liberty genuine love of liberty it is but too true that the love and even the very idea of genuine liberty is extremely rare it is but too true that there are many whose whole scheme of freedom is made up of pride perverseness and insolence they feel themselves in a state of thraldom they imagine that their souls are cooped and cabined in unless they have some man or some body of men dependent on their mercy this desire of having some one below them descends to those who are the very lowest of all and a protestant cobbler debased by his poverty but exalted by his share of the ruling church feels a pride in knowing it is by his generosity alone that the peer whose footmans instep he measures is able to keep his chaplain from a jail this disposition is the true source of the passion which many men in very humble life have taken to the american war our subjects in america our colonies our dependants this lust of party power is the liberty they hunger and thirst for and this siren song of ambition has charmed ears that one would have thought were never organized to that sort of music  ibid  liberty the true danger is when liberty is nibbled away for expedients and by parts  ibid  liberty without wisdom and virtue the greatest of evils the effects of the incapacity shown by the popular leaders in all the great members of the commonwealth are to be covered with the  allatoning name of liberty in some people i see great liberty indeed in many if not in the most an oppressive degrading servitude but what is liberty without wisdom and without virtue it is the greatest of all possible evils for it is folly vice and madness without tuition or restraint those who know what virtuous liberty is cannot bear to see it disgraced by incapable heads on account of their having highsounding words in their mouths grand swelling sentiments of liberty i am sure i do not despise they warm the heart they enlarge and liberalize our minds they animate our courage in a time of conflict  reflections on the french revolution  liberty and peace liberty is a good to be improved and not an evil to be lessened it is not only a private blessing of the first order but the vital spring and energy of the state itself which has just so much life and vigor as there is liberty in it but whether liberty be advantageous or not for i know it is a fashion to decry the very principle none will dispute that peace is a blessing and peace must in the course of human affairs be frequently bought by some indulgence and toleration at least to liberty  speech on conciliation with america  liberty and servitude a brave people will certainly prefer liberty accompanied with a virtuous poverty to a depraved and wealthy servitude but before the price of comfort and opulence is paid one ought to be pretty sure it is real liberty which is purchased and that she is to be purchased at no other price i shall always however consider that liberty is very equivocal in her appearance which has not wisdom and justice for her companions and does not lead prosperity and plenty in her train  reflections on the revolution in france  life taking in the whole view of life it is more safe to live under the jurisdiction of severe but steady reason than under the empire of indulgent but capricious passion  appeal from the new to the old whigs  learning see nobility and priesthood we are but too apt to consider things in the state in which we find them without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have been produced and possibly may be upheld nothing is more certain than that our manners our civilization and all the good things which are connected with manners and with civilization have in this european world of ours depended for ages upon two principles and were indeed the result of both combined i mean the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion the nobility and the clergy the one by profession the other by patronage kept learning in existence even in the midst of arms and confusions and whilst governments were rather in their causes than formed learning paid back what it received to nobility and to priesthood and paid it with usury by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing their minds happy if they had all continued to know their indissoluble union and their proper place happy if learning not debauched by ambition had been satisfied to continue the instructor and not aspired to be the master along with its natural protectors and guardians learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude  reflections on the revolution in france  love the physical cause of love when we have before us such objects as excite love and complacency the body is affected so far as i could observe much in the following manner the head reclines something on one side the eyelids are more closed than usual and the eyes roll gently with an inclination to the object the mouth is a little opened and the breath drawn slowly with now and then a low sigh the whole body is composed and the hands fall idly to the sides all this is accompanied with an inward sense of melting and languor these appearances are always proportioned to the degree of beauty in the object and of sensibility in the observer and this gradation from the highest pitch of beauty and sensibility even to the lowest of mediocrity and indifference and their correspondent effects ought to be kept in view else this description will seem exaggerated which it certainly is not but from this description it is almost impossible not to conclude that beauty acts by relaxing the solids of the whole system there are all the appearances of such a relaxation and a relaxation somewhat below the natural tone seems to me to be the cause of all positive pleasure who is a stranger to that manner of expression so common in all times and in all countries of being softened relaxed enervated dissolved melted away by pleasure the universal voice of mankind faithful to their feelings concurs in affirming this uniform and general effect and although some odd and particular instance may perhaps be found wherein there appears a considerable degree of positive pleasure without all the characters of relaxation we must not therefore reject the conclusion we had drawn from a concurrence of many experiments but we must still retain it subjoining the exceptions which may occur according to the judicious rule laid down by sir isaac newton in the third book of his optics our position will i conceive appear confirmed beyond any reasonable doubt if we can show that such things as we have already observed to be the genuine constituents of beauty have each of them separately taken a natural tendency to relax the fibers and if it must be allowed us that the appearance of the human body when all these constituents are united together before the sensory fur there favors this opinion we may venture i believe to conclude that the passion called love is produced by this relaxation by the same method of reasoning which we have used in the enquiry into the causes of the sublime we may likewise conclude that as a beautiful object presented to the sense by causing a relaxation in the body produces the passion of love in the mind so if by any means the passion should first have its origin in the mind a relaxation of the outward organs will as certainly ensue in a degree proportioned to the cause  sublime and beautiful  love not arising from lust i likewise distinguish love by which i mean that satisfaction which arises to the mind upon contemplating any thing beautiful of whatsoever nature it may be from desire or lust which is an energy of the mind that hurries us on to the possession of certain objects that do not affect us as they are beautiful but by means altogether different we shall have a strong desire for a woman of no remarkable beauty whilst the greatest beauty in men or in other animals though it causes love yet excites nothing at all of desire which shows that beauty and the passion caused by beauty which i call love is different from desire though desire may sometimes operate along with it but it is to this latter that we must attribute those violent and tempestuous passions and the consequent emotions of the body which attend what is called love in some of its ordinary acceptations and not to the effects of beauty merely as it is such  ibid  love and admiration there is a wide difference between admiration and love the sublime which is the cause of the former always dwells on great objects and terrible the latter on small ones and pleasing we submit to what we admire but we love what submits to us in one case we are forced in the other we are flattered into compliance  ibid  lover forsaken if you listen to the complaints of a forsaken lover you observe that he insists largely on the pleasures which he enjoyed or hoped to enjoy and on the perfection of the object of his desires it is the loss which is always uppermost in his mind the violent effects produced by love which has sometimes been even wrought up to madness is no objection to the rule which we seek to establish when men have suffered their imaginations to be long affected with any idea it so wholly engrosses them as to shut out by degrees almost every other and to break down every partition of the mind which would confine it any idea is sufficient for the purpose as is evident from the infinite variety of causes which give rise to madness but this at most can only prove that the passion of love is capable of producing very extraordinary effects not that its extraordinary emotions have any connection with positive pain  ibid  language effects of outrageous language see america this outrageous language relative to america which has been encouraged and kept alive by every art has already done incredible mischief for a long time even amidst the desolations of war and the insults of hostile laws daily accumulated on one another the american leaders seem to have had the greatest difficulty in bringing up their people to a declaration of total independence but the court gazette accomplished what the abettors of independence had attempted in vain when that disingenuous compilation and strange medley of railing and flattery was adduced as a proof of the united sentiments of the people of great britain there was a great change throughout all america the tide of popular affection which had still set toward the parent country began immediately to turn and to slow with great rapidity in a contrary course far from concealing these wild declarations of enmity the author of the celebrated pamphlet which prepared the minds of the people for independence insists largely on the multitude and the spirit of these addresses and he draws an argument from them which if the fact were as he supposes must be irresistible for i never knew a writer on the theory of government so partial to authority as not to allow that the hostile mind of the rulers to their people did fully justify a change of government nor can any reason whatever be given why one people should voluntarily yield any degree of preeminence to another but on a supposition of great affection and benevolence toward them unfortunately your ruler trusting to other things took no notice of this great principle of connection from the beginning of this affair they have done all they could to alienate your minds from your own kindred and if they could excite hatred enough in one of the parties toward the other they seemed to be of opinion that they had gone half the way toward reconciling the quarrel  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  loyalty true can it be true loyalty to any government or true patriotism toward any country to degrade their solemn councils into servile drawingrooms to flatter their pride and passions rather than to enlighten their reason and to prevent them from being cautioned against violence lest others should be encouraged to resistance by such acquiescence great kings and mighty nations have been undone and if any are at this day in a perilous situation from rejecting truth and listening to flattery it would rather become them to reform the errors under which they suffer than to reproach those who forewarned them of their danger  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  levellers those who attempt to level never equalize in all societies consisting of various descriptions of citizens some description must be uppermost the levellers therefore only change and pervert the natural order of things they load the edifice of society by setting up in the air what the solidity of the structure requires to be on the ground the associations of tailors and carpenters of which the republic of paris for instance is composed cannot be equal to the situation into which by the worst of usurpations an usurpation on the prerogatives of nature you attempt to force them  reflections on the revolution in france  landed property laudable course of its surplus why should the expenditure of a great landed property which is a dispersion of the surplus product of the soil appear intolerable to you or to me when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast libraries which are the history of the force and weakness of the human mind through great collections of ancient records medals and coins which attest and explain laws and customs through paintings and statues that by imitating nature seem to extend the limits of creation through grand monuments of the dead which continue the regards and connexions of life beyond the grave through collections of the specimens of nature which become a representative assembly of all the classes and families of the world that by disposition facilitate and by exciting curiosity open the avenues to science if by great permanent establishments all these objects of expense are better secured from the inconstant sport of personal caprice and personal extravagance are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed in scattered individuals does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter who toil in order to partake the sweat of the peasant flow as pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the majestic edifices of religion as in the painted booths and sordid sties of vice and luxury  reflections on the revolution in france  landed property always dissolving into individuality the very nature of a country life the very nature of landed property in all the occupations and all the pleasures they afford render combination and arrangement the sole way of procuring and exerting influence in a manner impossible amongst country people combine them by all the art you can and all the industry they are always dissolving into individuality any thing in the nature of incorporation is almost impracticable amongst them hope fear alarm jealousy the ephemerous tale that does its business and dies in a day all these things which are the reins and spurs by which leaders check or urge the minds of followers are not easily employed or hardly at all amongst scattered people they assemble they arm they act with the utmost difficulty and at the greatest charge their efforts if ever they can be commenced cannot be sustained they cannot proceed systematically if the country gentlemen attempt an influence through the mere income of their property what is it to that of those who have ten times their income to sell and who can ruin their property by bringing their plunder to meet it at market if the landed man wishes to mortgage he falls the value of his land and raises the value of assignats he augments the power of his enemy by the very means he must take to contend with him the country gentleman therefore the officer by sea and land the man of liberal views and habits attached to no profession will be as completely excluded from the government of his country as if he were legislatively proscribed it is obvious that in the towns all the things which conspire against the country gentleman combine in favor of the money manager and director in towns combination is natural the habits of burghers their occupations their diversion their business their idleness continually bring them into mutual contact their virtues and their vices are sociable they are always in garrison and they come embodied and half disciplined into the hands of those who mean to form them for civil or for military action  ibid  ministers favorites effects of the court system favouritism on our foreign affairs on the policy of our government with regard to our dependencies and on the anterior economy of the commonwealth with some observations on the grand principle which first recommended this system at court see kings men cabinet double policy a plan of favouritism for our executory government is essentially at variance with the plan of our legislature one great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours composed of monarchy and of controuls on the part of the higher people and the lower is that the prince shall not be able to violate the laws this is useful indeed and fundamental but this even at first view is no more than a negative advantage an armor merely defensive it is therefore next in order and equal in importance that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the monarch whether for the execution of the  or for the nomination to magistracy and office or for ing the affairs of peace and war or for ordering the revenue should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds and not on the likings or prejudices the intrigues or policies of a court  this i said is equal in importance to the securing a government according to law the laws reach but a very little way  constitute government how you please infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of ministers of state even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them without them your commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper and not a living acting effective constitution it is possible that through negligence or ignorance or design artfully conducted ministers may suffer one part of government to languish another to be perverted from its purposes and every valuable interest of the country to fall into ruin and decay without possibility of fixing any single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded the due arrangement of men in the active part of the state far from being foreign to the purposes of a wise government ought to be among its very first and dearest objects when therefore the abettors of the new system tell us that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power and that therefore we are no ways concerned in it we must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner that of all things we ought to be the most concerned who and what sort of men they are that hold the trust of every thing that is dear to us nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation but what must either render us totally desperate or soothe us into the security of idiots we must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of infancy to think all men virtuous we must be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt men are in public life as in private some good some evil the elevation of the one and the depression of the other are the first objects of all true policy but that form of government which neither in its direct institutions nor in their immediate tendency has contrived to throw its affairs into the most trust worthy hands but has left its whole executory system to be disposed of agreeably to the uncontrouled pleasure of any one man however excellent or virtuous is a plan of polity defective not only in that member but consequentially erroneous in every part of it  in arbitrary governments the constitution of the ministry follows the constitution of the legislature both the law and the magistrate are the creatures of will it must be so nothing indeed will appear more certain on any tolerable consideration of this matter than that every sort of government ought to have its administration correspondent to its legislature if it should be otherwise things must fall into an hideous disorder the people of a free commonwealth who have taken such care that their laws should be the result of general consent cannot be so senseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons on whom they have no dependence and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to those powers upon the use of which the very being of the state depends  the popular election of magistrates and popular disposition of rewards and honors is one of the first advantages of a free state without it or something equivalent to it perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the substance of freedom certainly none of the vivifying energy of good government the frame of our commonwealth did not admit of such an actual election but it provided as well and while the spirit of the constitution is preserved better for all the effects of it than by the method of suffrage in any democratic state whatsoever it had always until of late been held the first duty of parliament to refuse to support government until power was in the hands of persons who were acceptable to the people or while factions predominated in the court in which the nation had no confidence thus all the good effects of popular election were supposed to be secured to us without the mischiefs attending on perpetual intrigue and a distinct canvass for every particular office throughout the body of the people this was the most noble and refined part of our constitution the people by their representatives and grandees were entrusted with a deliberative power in making laws the king with the control of his negative the king was entrusted with the deliberative choice and the election to office the people had the negative in a parliamentary refusal to support formerly this power of control was what kept ministers in awe of parliaments and parliaments in reverence with the people if the use of this power of control on the system and persons of administration is gone every thing is lost parliament and all we may assure ourselves that if parliament will tamely see evil men take possession of all the strong holds of their country and allow them time and means to fortify themselves under a pretense of giving them a fair trial and upon a hope of discovering whether they will not be reformed by power and whether their measures will not be better than their morals such a parliament will give countenance to their measures also whatever that parliament may pretend and whatever those measures may be  every good political institution must have a preventive operation as well as a remedial it ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men from government and not to trust for the safety of the state to subsequent punishment alone punishment which has ever been tardy and uncertain and which when power is suffered in bad hands may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal  before men are put forward into the great trusts of the state they ought by their conduct to have obtained such a degree of estimation in their country as may be some sort of pledge and security to the public that they will not abuse those trusts it is no mean security for a proper use of power that a man has shown by the general tenor of his actions that the affection the good opinion the confidence of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a settled contempt or occasional forfeiture of their esteem  that man who before he comes into power has no friends or who coming into power is obliged to desert his friends or who losing it has no friends to sympathize with him he who has no sway among any part of the landed or commercial interest but whose whole importance has begun with his office and is sure to end with it is a person who ought never to be suffered by a controuling parliament to continue in any of those situations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs because such a man has no connection with the interest of the people  those knots or cabals of men who have got together avowedly without any public principle in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate and are therefore universally odious ought never to be suffered to domineer in the state because they have no connection with the sentiments and opinions of the people  these are considerations which in my opinion enforce the necessity of having some better reason in a free country and a free parliament for supporting the ministers of the crown than that short one that the king has thought proper to appoint them there is something very courtly in this but it is a principle pregnant with all sorts of mischief in a constitution like ours to turn the views of active men from the country to the court whatever be the road to power that is the road which will be trod if the opinion of the country be of no use as a means of power or consideration the qualities which usually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated and whether it will be right in a state so popular in its constitution as ours to leave ambition without popular motives and to trust all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and ministers and public men must be submitted to the judgment and good sense of the people of england  cunning men are here apt to break in and without directly controverting the principle to raise objections from the difficulty under which the sovereign labors to distinguish the genuine voice and sentiments of his people from the clamor of a faction by which it is so easily counterfeited the nation they say is generally divided into parties with views and passions utterly irreconcilable if the king should put his affairs into the hands of any one of them he is sure to disgust the rest if he select particular men from among them all it is an hazard that he disgusts them all those who are left out however divided before will soon run into a body of opposition which being a collection of many discontents into one focus will without doubt be hot and violent enough faction will make its cries resound through the nation as if the whole were in an uproar when by far the majority and much the better part will seem for a while as it were annihilated by the quiet in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the blessings of government besides that the opinion of the mere vulgar is a miserable rule even with regard to themselves on account of their violence and instability so that if you were to gratify them in their humor today that very gratification would be a ground of their dissatisfaction on the next now as all these rules of public opinion are to be collected with great difficulty and to be applied with equal uncertainty as to the effect what better can a king of england do than to employ such men as he finds to have views and inclinations most conformable to his own who are least infected with pride and self will and who are least moved by such popular humors as are perpetually traversing his designs and disturbing his service trusting that when he means no ill to his people he will be supported in his appointments whether he chooses to keep or to change as his private judgment or his pleasure leads him he will find a sure resource in the real weight and influence of the crown when it is not suffered to become an instrument in the hands of a faction  i will not pretend to say that there is nothing at all in this mode of reasoning because i will not assert that there is no difficulty in the art of government undoubtedly the very best administration must encounter a great deal of opposition and the very worst will find more support than it deserves sufficient appearances will never be wanting to those who have a mind to deceive themselves it is a fallacy in constant use with those who would level all things and confound right with wrong to insist upon the inconveniences which are attached to every choice without taking into consideration the different weight and consequence of those inconveniences the question is not concerning absolute discontent or perfect satisfaction in government neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time or upon any system the controversy is about that degree of good humor in the people which may possibly be attained and ought certainly to be looked for while some politicians may be waiting to know whether the sense of every individual be against them accurately distinguishing the vulgar from the better sort drawing lines between the enterprises of a faction and the efforts of a people they may chance to see the government which they are so nicely weighing and dividing and distinguishing tumble to the ground in the midst of their wise deliberation prudent men when so great an object as the security of government or even its peace is at stake will not run the risk of a decision which may be fatal to it they who can read the political sky will see an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon and will run into the first harbor no lines can be laid down for civil or political wisdom they are a matter incapable of exact definition but though no man can draw a stroke between the confines of day and night yet light and darkness are upon the whole tolerably distinguishable nor will it be impossible for a prince to find out such a mode of government and such persons to administer it as will give a great degree of content to his people without any curious and anxious research for that abstract universal perfect harmony which while he is seeking he abandons those means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any research at all  it is not more the duty than it is the interest of a prince to aim at giving tranquillity to his government but those who advise him may have an interest in disorder and confusion if the opinion of the people is against them they will naturally wish that it should have no prevalence here it is that the people must on their part show themselves sensible of their own value their whole importance in the first instance and afterward their whole freedom is at stake their freedom cannot long survive their importance here it is that the natural strength of the kingdom the great peers the leading landed gentlemen the opulent merchants and manufacturers the substantial yeomanry must interpose to rescue their prince themselves and their posterity  ibid  ministers character of the interior ministry see cabinet double the interior ministry are sensible that war is a situation which sets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people and they well know that the beginning of the importance of the people must be the end of theirs for this reason they discover upon all occasions the utmost fear of every thing which by possibility may lead to such an event i do not mean that they manifest any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the safety of the country to the dubious experiment of war such a fear being the tender sensation of virtue excited as it is regulated by reason frequently shows itself in a seasonable boldness which keeps danger at a distance by seeming to despise it their fear betrays to the first glance of the eye its true cause and its real object foreign powers confident in the knowledge of their character have not scrupled to violate the most solemn treaties and in defiance of them to make conquests in the midst of a general peace and in the heart of europe such was the conquest of corsica by the professed enemies of the freedom of mankind in defiance of those who were formerly its professed defenders we have had just claims upon the same powers rights which ought to have been sacred to them as well as to us as they had their origin in our lenity and generosity toward france and spain in the day of their great humiliation such i call the ransom of manilla and the demand on france for the east india prisoners but these powers put a just confidence in their resource of the double cabinet these demands one of them at least are hastening fast toward an acquittal by prescription oblivion begins to spread her cobwebs over all our spirited remonstrances some of the most valuable branches of our trade are also on the point of perishing from the same cause i do not mean those branches which bear without the hand of the vinedresser i mean those which the policy of treaties had formerly secured to us i mean to mark and distinguish the trade of portugal the loss of which and the power of the cabal have one and the same era  if by any chance the ministers who stand before the curtain possess or affect any spirit it makes little or no impression foreign courts and ministers who were among the first to discover and to profit by this invention of the double cabinet attend very little to their remonstrances they know that those shadows of ministers have nothing to do in the ultimate disposal of things jealousies and animosities are sedulously nourished in the outward administration and have been even considered as a causa sine qua non in its constitution thence foreign courts have a certainty that nothing can be done by common counsel in this nation if one of those ministers officially takes up a business with spirit it serves only the better to signalize the meanness of the rest and the discord of them all his colleagues in office are in haste to shake him off and to disclaim the whole of his proceedings of this nature was that astonishing transaction in which lord rochford our ambassador at paris remonstrated against the attempt upon corsica in consequence of a direct authority from lord shelburne this remonstrance the french minister treated with the contempt that was natural as he was assured from the ambassador of his court to ours that these orders of lord shelburne were not supported by the rest of the i had like to have said british administration lord rochford a man of spirit could not endure this situation the consequences were however curious he returns from paris and comes home full of anger lord shelburne who gave the orders is obliged to give up the seals lord rochford who obeyed these orders receives them he goes however into another department of the same office that he might not be obliged officially to acquiesce in one situation under what he had officially remonstrated against in another at paris the duke of choiscul considered this office arrangement as a compliment to him here it was spoke of as an attention to the delicacy of lord rochford but whether the compliment was to one or both to this nation it was the same by this transaction the condition of our court lay exposed in all its nakedness our office correspondence has lost all pretense to authenticity british policy is brought into derision in those nations that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms whilst they looked up with confidence to the equity firmness and candor which shone in all our negotiations i represent this matter exactly in the light in which it has been universally received  such has been the aspect of our foreign politics under the influence of a double cabinet with such an arrangement at court it is impossible it should have been otherwise nor is it possible that this scheme should have a better effect upon the government of our dependencies the first the dearest and most delicate objects of the interior policy of this empire the colonies know that administration is separated from the court divided within itself and detested by the nation the double cabinet has in both the parts of it shown the most malignant dispositions toward them without being able to do them the smallest mischief  they are convinced by sufficient experience that no plan either of lenity or rigor can be pursued with uniformity and perseverance therefore they turn their eyes entirely from great britain where they have neither dependence on friendship nor apprehension from enmity they look to themselves and their own arrangements they grow every day into alienation from this country and whilst they are becoming disconnected with our government we have not the consolation to find that they are even friendly in their new independence nothing can equal the futility the weakness the rashness the timidity the perpetual contradiction in the management of our affairs in that part of the world a volume might be written on this melancholy subject but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflections of the reader himself than not to treat it in the extent it deserves  in what manner our domestic economy is affected by this system it is needless to explain it is the perpetual subject of their own complaints  the court party resolve the whole into faction having said something before upon this subject i shall only observe here that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction they present no very favorable aspect of the confidence of the people in their own government they may be assured that however they amuse themselves with a variety of projects for substituting something else in the place of that great and only foundation of government the confidence of the people every attempt will but make their condition worse when men imagine that their food is only a cover for poison and when they neither love nor trust the hand that serves it it is not the name of the roast beef of old england that will persuade them to sit down to the table that is spread for them when the people conceive that laws and tribunals and even popular assemblies are perverted from the ends of their institution they find in those names of degenerated establishments only new motives to discontent those bodies which when full of life and beauty lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort when dead and putrid become but the more loathsome from remembrance of former endearments a sullen gloom and furious disorder prevail by fits the nation loses its relish for peace and prosperity as it did in that season of fullness which opened our troubles in the time of charles the first a species of men to whom a state of order would become a sentence of obscurity are nourished into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of intestine disturbances and it is no wonder that by a sort of sinister piety they cherish in their turn the disorders which are the parents of all their consequence superficial observers consider such persons as the cause of the public uneasiness when in truth they are nothing more than the effect of it good men look upon this distracted scene with sorrow and indignation their hands are tied behind them they are despoiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the strength of government with the rights of the people they stand in a most distressing alternative but in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary confusion than from established servitude in the mean time the voice of law is not to be heard fierce licentiousness begets violent restraints the military arm is the sole reliance and then call your constitution what you please it is the sword that governs the civil power like every other that calls in the aid of an ally stronger than itself perishes by the assistance it recieves but the contrivers of this scheme of government will not trust solely to the military power because they are cunning men their restless and crooked spirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient unable to rule the multitude they endeavor to raise divisions amongst them one mob is hired to destroy another a procedure which at once encourages the boldness of the populace and justly increases their discontent men become pensioners of state on account of their abilities in the array of riot and the discipline of confusion government is put under the disgraceful necessity of protecting from the severity of the laws that very licentiousness which the laws had been before violated to repress every thing partakes of the original disorder anarchy predominates without freedom and servitude without submission or subordination these are the consequences inevitable to our public peace from the scheme of rendering the executory government at once odious and feeble of freeing administration from the constitutional and salutary control of parliament and inventing for it a new control unknown to the constitution an interior cabinet which brings the whole body of government into confusion and contempt  after having stated as shortly as i am able the effects of this system on our foreign affairs on the policy of our government with regard to our dependencies and on the interior economy of the commonwealth there remains only in this part of my design to say something of the grand principle which first recommended this system at court the pretense was to prevent the king from being enslaved by a faction and made a prisoner in his closet this scheme might have been expected to answer at least its own end and to indemnify the king in his personal capacity for all the confusion into which it has thrown his government but has it in reality answered this purpose i am sure if it had every affectionate subject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evils which attend it  in order to come at the truth in this matter it may not be amiss to consider it somewhat in detail i speak here of the king and not of the crown the interests of which we have already touched independent of that greatness which a king possesses merely by being a representative of the national dignity the things in which he may have an individual interest seem to be these wealth accumulated wealth spent in magnificence pleasure or beneficence personal respect and attention and above all private ease and repose of mind these compose the inventory of prosperous circumstances whether they regard a prince or a subject their enjoyments differing only in the scales upon which they are formed  suppose then we were to ask whether the king has been richer than his predecessors in accumulated wealth since the establishment of the plan of favouritism i believe it will be found that the picture of royal indigence which our court has presented until this year has been truly humiliating nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people and shaken their confidence in parliament if the public treasures had been exhausted in magnificence and splendor this distress would have been accounted for and in some measure justified nothing would be more unworthy of this nation than with a mean and mechanical rule to mete out the splendor of the crown indeed i have found very few persons disposed to so ungenerous a procedure but the generality of people it must be confessed do feel a good deal mortified when they compare the wants of the court with its expenses they do not behold the cause of this distress in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence in all this they see nothing but the operations of parsimony attended with all the consequences of profusion nothing expended nothing saved their wonder is increased by their knowledge that besides the revenue settled on his majestys civil list to the amount of  00000 l a year he has a farther aid from a large pension list near  0000 l a year in ireland from the produce of the duchy of lancaster which we are told has been greatly improved from the revenue of the duchy of cornwall from the american quitrents from the four and a half per cent duty in the leeward islands this last worth to be sure considerably more than  0000 l a year the whole is certainly not much short of a million annually  these are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils we have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his majestys german dominions and the bishopric of osnabrug this is unquestionably true but that which is not within the province of parliament is yet within the sphere of every mans own reflection if a foreign prince resided amongst us the state of his revenues could not fail of becoming the subject of our speculation filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our sovereign it is impossible in considering the miserable circumstances into which he has been brought that this obvious topic should be entirely passed over there is an opinion universal that these revenues produce something not inconsiderable clear of all charges and establishments this produce the people do not believe to be hoarded nor perceive to be spent it is accounted for in the only manner it can by supposing that it is drawn away for the support of that court faction which whilst it distresses the nation impoverishes the prince in every one of his resources i once more caution the reader that i do not urge this consideration concerning the foreign revenue as if i supposed we had a direct right to examine into the expenditure of any part of it but solely for the purpose of showing how little this system of favouritism has been advantageous to the monarch himself which without magnificence has sunk him into a state of unnatural poverty at the same time that he possessed every means of affluence from ample revenues both in this country and in other parts of his dominions  has this system provided better for the treatment becoming his high and sacred character and secured the king from those disgusts attached to the necessity of employing men who are not personally agreeable this is a topic upon which for many reasons i could wish to be silent but the pretense of securing against such causes of uneasiness is the cornerstone of the court party it has however so happened that if i were to fix upon any one point in which this system has been more particularly and shamefully blameable the effects which it has produced would justify me in choosing for that point its tendency to degrade the personal dignity of the sovereign and to expose him to a thousand contradictions and mortifications it is but too evident in what manner these projectors of royal greatness have fulfilled all their magnificent promises without recapitulating all the circumstances of the reign every one of which is more or less a melancholy proof of the truth of what i have advanced let us consider the language of the court but a few years ago concerning most of the persons now in the external administration let me ask whether any enemy to the personal feelings of the sovereign could possibly contrive a keener instrument of mortification and degradation of all dignity than almost every part and member of the present arrangement nor in the whole course of our history has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared affections and dislikes than that which is now adopted in direct opposition to every thing the people approve and desire  an opinion prevails that greatness has been more than once advised to submit to certain condescensions toward individuals which have been denied to the entreaties of a nation for the meanest and most dependent instrument of this system knows that there are hours when its existence may depend upon his adherence to it and he takes his advantage accordingly indeed it is a law of nature that whoever is necessary to what we have made our object is sure in some way or in some time or other to become our master all this however is submitted to in order to avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people for it seems to be laid down as a maxim that a king has some sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects that all who are pleasing to them are to be of course disagreeable to him that as soon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honors none are considered as wellwishers to the crown but those who advise to some unpopular course of action none capable of serving it but those who are obliged to call at every instant upon all its power for the safety of their lives none are supposed to be fit priests in the temple of government but the persons who are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary such is the effect of this refined project such is ever the result of all the contrivances which are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and from the necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident interests these contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous servitude in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended with advantage  if therefore this system has so ill answered its own grand pretense of saving the king from the necessity of employing persons disagreeable to him has it given more peace and tranquillity to his majestys private hours no most certainly the father of his people cannot possibly enjoy repose while his family is in such a state of distraction then what has the crown or the king profitted by all this finewrought scheme is he more rich or more splendid or more powerful or more at his ease by so many labors and contrivances have they not beggared his exchequer tarnished the splendor of his court sunk his dignity galled his feelings discomposed the whole order and happiness of his private life  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  maternal indulgence the authority of a father so useful to our wellbeing and so justly venerable upon all accounts hinders us from having that entire love for him that we have for our mothers where the parental authority is almost melted down into the mothers fondness and indulgence but we generally have a great love for our grandfathers in whom this authority is removed a degree from us and where the weakness of age mellows it into something of a feminine partiality  sublime and beautiful  music the beautiful in music will not bear that loudness and strength of sounds which may be used to raise other passions nor notes which are shrill or harsh or deep it agrees best with such as are clear even smooth and weak the second is that great variety and quick transitions from one measure or tone to another are contrary to the genius of the beautiful in music such i never am merry when i hear sweet music shakespeare transitions often excite mirth or other sudden and tumultuous passions but not that sinking that melting that languor which is the characteristical effect of the beautiful as it regards every sense the passion excited by beauty is in fact nearer to a species of a melancholy than to jollity and mirth i do not here mean to confine music to any one species of notes or tones neither is it an art in which i can say i have any great skill my sole design in this remark is to settle a consistent idea of beauty the infinite variety of the affections of the soul will suggest to a good head and skilful ear a variety of such sounds as are fitted to raise them  ibid  manners manners are of more importance than laws in a great measure the laws depend upon them the law touches us but here and there and now and then manners are what vex or sooth corrupt or purify exalt or debase barbarize or refine us by a constant steady uniform insensible operation like that of the air we breathe in they give their whole form and color to our lives according to their quality they aid morals they supply them or they totally destroy them of this the new french legislators were aware therefore with the same method and under the same authority they settled a system of manners the most licentious prostitute and abandoned and at the same time the most coarse rude savage and serocious nothing in the revolution no not to a phrase or a gesture not to the fashion of a hat or a shoe was left to accident all was the result of design all was matter of institution no mechanical means could be devised in favor of this incredible system of wickedness and vice that has not been employed the noblest passions the love of glory the love of country were debauched into means of it is preservation and it is propagation all sorts of shows and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination and pervert the moral sense have been contrived they have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken women calling at the bar of the assembly for the blood of their own children as being royalists or constitutionals sometimes they have got a body of wretches calling themselves fathers to demand the murder of their sons boasting that rome had but one brutus but that they could show five hundred there were instances in which they inverted and retaliated the impiety and produced sons who called for the execution of their parents the foundation of their republic is founded in moral paradoxes their patriotism is always prodigy all those instances to be found in history whether real or fabulous of a doubtful public spirit at which morality is perplexed reason is staggered and from which a frighted nature recoils are their chosen and almost sole examples for the instruction of their youth  regicide peace  manners modern the royal household has been carried away by the resistless tide of manners but with this very material difference private men have got rid of the establishments along with the reasons of them whereas the royal household has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners without retrenching any thing of the cumbrous charge of a gothic establishment it is shrunk into the polished littleness of modern elegance and personal accommodation it has evaporated from the gross concrete into an essence and rectified spirit of expense where you have tuns of ancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury  oecon reform  marriage other legislators knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations and consequently the first element of all duties have endeavored by every art to make it sacred the christian religion by confining it to the pairs and by rendering that relation indissoluble has by these two things done more toward the peace happiness settlement and civilization of the world than by any other part in this whole scheme of divine wisdom the direct contrary course was taken in the synagogue of antichrist i mean in that forge and manufactory of all evil the sect which predominated in the constituent assembly of      those monsters employed the same or greater industry to desecrate and degrade that state which other legislators have used to render it holy and honorable by a strange uncalled for declaration they pronounced that marriage was no better than a common civil contract it was one of their ordinary tricks to put their sentiments into the mouths of certain personated characters which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a serious assembly one of these was brought out in the figure of a prostitute whom they called by the affected name of a mother without being a wife this creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities which in civilized states are put upon bastards the prostitutes of the assembly gave to this their puppet the sanction of their greater impudence in consequence of the principles laid down and the manners authorized bastards were not long after put on the footing of the issue of lawful unions proceeding in the spirit of the first authors of their constitution they went the full length of the principle and gave a license to divorce at the mere pleasure of either party and at four days notice with them the matrimonial connection was brought into so degrading a state of concubinage that i believe none of the wretches in london who keep warehouses of infamy would give out one of their victims to private custody on so short and insolent a tenure there was indeed a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the same licentious power the reason they assigned was as infamous as the act declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of husbands it is not necessary to observe upon the horrible consequences of taking one half of the species wholly out of the guardianship and protection of the other  regicide peace  monastic institutions there are moments in the fortune of states when particular men are called to make improvements by great mental exertion in those moments even when they seem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country and to be invested with full authority they have not always apt instruments a politician to do great things looks for a power what our workmen call a purchase and if he finds that power in politics as in mechanics he cannot be at a loss to apply it in the monastic institutions in my opinion was found a great power for the mechanism of politic benevolence there were revenues with a public direction there were men wholly set apart and dedicated to public purposes without any other than public ties and public principles men without the possibility of converting the estate of the community into a private fortune men denied to selfinterests whose avarice is for some community men to whom personal poverty is honor and implicit obedience stands in the place of freedom in vain shall a man look to the possibility of making such things when he wants them the winds blow as they list these institutions are the products of enthusiasm they are the instruments of wisdom wisdom cannot create materials they are the gifts of nature or of chance her pride is in the use the perennial existence of bodies corporate and their fortunes are things particularly suited to a man who has long views who meditates designs that require time in fashioning and which propose duration when they are accomplished he is not deserving to rank high or even to be mentioned in the order of great statesmen who having obtained the command and direction of such a power as existed in the wealth the discipline and the habits of such corporations as those which you have rashly destroyed cannot find any way of converting it to the great and lasting benefit of his country on the view of this subject a thousand uses suggest themselves to a contriving mind to destroy any power growing wild from the rank productive force of the human mind is almost tantamount in the moral world to the destruction of the apparently active properties of bodies in the material it would be like the attempt to destroy if it were in our competence to destroy the expansive force of fixed air in nitre or the power of steam or of electricity or of magnetism these energies always existed in nature and they were always discernible they seemed some of them unserviceable some noxious some no better than a sport to children until contemplative ability combining with practic skill tamed their wild nature subdued them to use and rendered them at once the most powerful and the most tractable agents in subservience to the great views and designs of men did fifty thousand persons whose mental and whose bodily labor you might direct and so many hundred thousand a year of a revenue which was neither lazy nor superstitious appear too big for your abilities to wield had you no way of using the men but by converting monks into pensioners had you no way of turning the revenue to account but through the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale if you were thus destitute of mental funds the proceeding is in its natural course your politicians do not understand their trade and therefore they sell their tools  but the institutions favor of superstition in their very principle and they nourish it by a permanent and standing influence this i do not mean to dispute but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from superstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the public advantage you derive benefits from many dispositions and many passions of the human mind which are of as doubtful a color in the moral eye as superstition itself it was your business to correct and mitigate every thing which was noxious in this passion as in all the passions but is superstition the greatest of all possible vices in its possible excess i think it becomes a very great evil it is however a moral subject and of course admits of all degrees and all modifications superstition is the religion of feeble minds and they must be tolerated in an intermixture of it in some trifling or some enthusiastic shape or other else you will deprive weak minds of a resource found necessary to the strongest the body of all true religion consists to be sure in obedience to the will of the sovereign of the world in a confidence in his declarations and an imitation of his perfections the rest is our own it may be prejudicial to the great end it may be auxiliary wise men who as such are not admirers not admirers at least of the manera terrae are not violently attached to these things nor do they violently hate them wisdom is not the most severe corrector of folly they are the rival follies which mutually wage so unrelenting a war and which make so cruel a use of their advantages as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar on the one side or the other in their quarrels prudence would be neuter but if in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce such heats a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and excesses of enthusiasm he would condemn or bear perhaps he would think the superstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which demolishes  that which adorns a country than that which deforms it  that which endows than that which plunders  that which disposes to mistaken beneficence than that which stimulates to real injustice  that which leads a man to refuse to himself lawful pleasures than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence of their selfdenial such i think is very nearly the state of the question

indiscretion always the greatest guilt  ibid  magna charta see petition of rights declaration of rights our oldest reformation is that of magna charta sir edward coke that great oracle of our law and indeed all the great men who follow him to blackstone are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties they endeavor to prove that the ancient charter the magna charta of king john was connected with another positive charter from henry the first and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a reaffirmative of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom in the matter of fact for the quarter part these authors appear to be in the right perhaps not always but if the lawyers mistaste in some particulars it proves my position still the more strongly because it demonstrates the powerful prepossession toward antiquity with which the minds of all our lawyers and legislators and of all the people when they wish to influence have been always filled and the stationary policy of this kingdom in considering their most sacred rights and franchises as an inheritance  ibid  monarchy absolute none of us love absolute and uncontroled monarchy but we could not rejoice at the sufferings of a marcus aurelius or a trajan who were absolute monarchs as we do when nero is condemned by the senate to be punished more majorum nor when that monster was obliged to fly with his wife sporus and to drink puddle were men affected in the same manner as when the venerable galba with all his faults and errors was murdered by a revolted mercenary soldiery with such things before our eyes our feelings contradict our theories and when this is the case the feelings are true and the theory is false what i contend for is that in commending the destruction of an absolute monarchy all the circumstances ought not to be wholly overlooked as considerations fit only for shallow and superficial minds  appeal from the new to the old whigs  morality the lines of morality are

company the principle of buying cheap and selling dear is the first the great foundation of mercantile dealing  a great deal of strictness in driving bargains for whatever we contract is another of the principles of mercantile policy try the company by that test look at the contracts that are made for them is the company so much as a good commissary to their own armies i engage to select for you out of the innumerable mass of their dealings all conducted very nearly alike one contract only the excessive profits on which during a short term would pay the whole of their years dividend i shall undertake to show that upon two others that the inordinate profits given with the losses incurred in order to secure those profits would pay a years dividend more  it is a third property of trading men to see that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the master to their own benefit it was the other day only when their governor and council taxed the companys investment with a sum of fifty thousand pounds as an inducement to persuade only seven members of their board of trade to give their honor that they would abstain from such profits upon that investment as they must have violated their oaths if they had made at all  it is a fourth quality of a merchant to be exact in his accounts what will be thought when you have fully before you the mode of accounting made use of in the treasury of bengal  i hope you will have it soon with regard to one of their agencies when it came to the material part the prime cost of the goods on which a commission of fifteen per cent was allowed to the astonishment of the factory to whom the commodities were sent the accountantgeneral reports that he did not think himself authorized to call for vouchers relative to this and other particulars  because the agent was upon his honor with regard to them a new principle of account upon honor seems to be regularly established in their dealings and their treasury which in reality amounts to an entire annihilation of the principle of all accounts  it is a fifth property of a merchant who does not meditate a fraudulent bankruptcy to calculate his probable profits upon the money he takes up to vest in business did the company when they bought goods on bonds bearing   per cent interest at  0 and even  0 per cent discount even ask themselves a question concerning the possibility of advantage from dealing on these terms  the last quality of a merchant i shall advert to is the taking care to be properly prepared in cash or goods in the ordinary course of sale for the bills which are drawn on them now i ask whether they have ever calculated the clear produce of any given sales to make them tally with the four million of bills which are come and coming upon them so as at the proper periods to enable the one to liquidate the other no they have not they are now obliged to borrow money of their own servants to purchase their investment the servants stipulate five per cent on the capital they advance if their bills should not be paid at the time when they become due and the value of the rupee on which they charge this interest is taken at two shillings and a penny has the company ever troubled themselves to enquire whether their sales can bear the payment of that interest and at that rate of exchange have they once considered the dilemma in which they are placed  the ruin of their credit in the east indies if they refuse the bills  the ruin of their credit and existence in england if they accept them indeed no trace of equitable government is found in their politics not one trace of commercial principle in their mercantile dealing and hence is the deepest and matruest wisdom of parliament demanded and the best resources of this kingdom must be strained to restore them that is to restore the countries destroyed by the misconduct of the company and to restore the company itself ruined by the consequences of their plans for destroying what they were bound to preserve  speech on mr foxs east india bill  middlesex election contest how to be considered we must purposely shut our eyes if we consider this matter the incapacitation of mr wilkes merely as a contest between the house of commons and the electors the true contest is between the electors of the kingdom and the crown the crown acting by an instrumental house of commons it is precisely the same whether the ministers of the crown can disqualify by a dependent house of commons or by a dependent court of star chamber or by a dependent court of kings bench if once members of parliament can be practically convinced that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the people for their political being they will give themselves over without even an appearance of reserve to the influence of the court indeed a parliament unconnected with the people is essential to a ministry unconnected with the people and therefore those who saw through what mighty difficulties the interior ministry waded and the exterior were dragged in this business will conceive of what prodigious importance the new corpse of kings men held this principle of occasional and personal incapacitation to the whole body of their design  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  ministers our natural rulers ministers are not only our natural rulers but our natural

parliament it has its officers of parade and dignity it has its treasury too it is a sort of corporate body and formerly was a body of great importance as much so on the then scale of things and the then order of business as the bank is at this day it was the great center of money transactions and remittances for our own and for other nations until king charles the first among other arbitrary projects dictated by despostic necessity made him withhold the money that lay there for remittance that blow and happily too the mint never recovered now it is no bank no remittanceshop the mint sir

circulation of money is a great convenience but a substitute for it may be found whilst the great objects of production and consumption corn cattle wine and the like exist in a country the means of giving them circulation with more or less convenience cannot be wholly wanting the great confiscation of the church and of the crown lands and of the appenages of the princes for the purchase of all

which as things are now circumstanced rather stands in need of assistance itself from the power which alone substantially exists in france i mean the several districts and municipal republics and the several clubs which direct all their affairs and appoint all their magistrates this is the power now paramount to every thing even to the assembly itself called national and that to which tribunals priesthood laws finances and both descriptions of military power are wholly subservient so far as the military power of either description yields obedience to any name of authority  memomorial on the affairs of france in       marseilles marseilles the hottest focus of sedition in france  ibid  municipalities in my opinion there never was seen so strong a government internally as that of the french municipalities if ever any rebellion can arise against the present system it must begin where the revolution which gave birth to it did at the capital paris is the only place in which there is the least freedom of intercourse but even there so many servants as any man has so many spies and irreconcilable domestic enemies  ibid  mediterranean the great object for which we preserved minorca whilst we could keep it and for which we still retain gibraltar both at a great expense was and is to prevent the predominance of france over the mediterranean  ibid  marine french the french marine resembles not a little the old armaments of the flibustriers which about a century back in conjunction with pirates of our nation brought such calamities upon the spanish colonies they differ only in this that the present piratical force is out of all measure and comparison greater one hundred and fifty ships of the line and frigates being ready built most of them in a manner new and all applicable in different ways to that service privateers and moorish corsairs possess not the best seamanship and very little discipline and indeed can make no figure in regular service but in desperate adventures and animated with a lust of plunder they are truly formidable  ibid  newspapers see revolution french the progress of the french revolution indebted to newspapers what direction the french spirit of proselytism is likely to take and in what order it is likely to prevail in the several parts of europe it is not easy to determine the seeds are sown almost every where chiefly by newspaper circulations infinitely more efficacious and extensive than ever they were and they are a more important instrument than generally is imagined they are a part of the reading of all they are the whole of the reading of the far greater number there are thirty of them in paris alone the language diffuses them more widely than the english though the english too are much read the writers of these papers indeed for the greater part are either unknown or in contempt but they are like a battery in which the stroke of any one ball produces no great effect but the amount of continual repetition is decisive let us only suffer any person to tell us his story morning and evening but for one twelve months and he will become our master  ibid  neutrality in parties a crime against the state some legislators went so far as to make neutrality in party a crime against the state i do not know whether this might not have been rather to overstrain the principle certain it is the best patriots in the greatest commonwealths have always commended and promoted such connexions idem sentire de republica was with them a principal ground of friendship and attachment nor do i know any other capable of forming firmer dearer more pleasing more honorable and more virtuous habitudes the romans carried this principle a great way even the holding of offices together the disposition of which arose from chance not selection gave rise to a relation which continued for life it was called necessitudo sortis and it was looked upon with a sacred reverence breaches of any of these kinds of civil relation were considered as acts of the most distinguished turpitude the whole people was distributed into political societies in which they acted in support of such interests in the state as they severally affected for it was then thought no crime to endeavor by every honest means to advance to superiority and power those of your own sentiments and opinions this wise people was far from imagining that those connexions had no tie and obliged to no duty but that men might quit them without shame upon every call of interest they believed private honor to be the great foundation of public trust that friendship was no mean step toward patriotism that he who in the common intercourse of life showed he regarded somebody besides himself when he came to act in a public situation might probably consult some other interest than his own never may we become plus sages que les sages as the french comedian has happily expressed it wiser than all the wise and good men who have lived before us it was their wish to see public and private virtues not dissolute and jarring and mutually destructive but harmoniously combined growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation reciprocally supporting and supported  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  nobilitysee king venice etc all this violent cry against the nobility i take to be a mere work of art to be honored and even privileged by the laws opinions and inveterate usages of our country growing out of the prejudice of ages has nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man even to be too tenacious of those privileges is not absolutely a crime the strong struggle in every individual to preserve possession of what he has found to belong to him and to distinguish him is one of the securities against injustice and despotism implanted in our nature it operates as an instinct to secure property and to preserve communities in a settled state what is there to shock in this nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order it is the corinthian capital of polished society omnes boni nobilitati semper favemus was the saying of a wise and good man it is indeed one sign of a liberal and benevolent mind to incline to it with some sort of partial propensity he feels no ennobling principle in his own heart who wishes to level all the artificial institutions which have been adopted for giving a body to opinion and permanence to fugitive esteem it is a sour malignant envious disposition without taste for the reality or for any image or representation of virtue that sees with joy the unmerited fall of what had long flourished in splendor and in honor i do not like to see any thing destroyed any void produced in society any ruin on the face of the land it was therefore with no disappointment or dissatisfaction that my enquiries and observation did not present to me any incorrigible vices in the noblesse of france or any abuse which could not be removed by a reform very short of abolition your noblesse did not deserve punishment but to degrade is to punish  reflections on the revolution in france  netherlands the emperors own politics with regard to the netherlands seem to me to be exactly calculated to answer the purpose of the french revolutionists he endeavors to crush the aristocratic party and to nourish one in avowed connection with the most furious democratists in france  these provinces in which the french game is so well played they consider as part of the old french empire certainly they were amongst the oldest parts of it these they think very well situated as their party is well disposed to a reunion as to the greater nations they do not aim at making a direct conquest of them but by disturbing them through a propagation of their principles they hope to weaken as they will weaken them and to keep them in perpetual alarm and agitation and thus render all their efforts against them utterly impracticable whilst they extend the dominion of their sovereign anarchy on all sides  memorial on the affairs of france in       national ties the operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to have recourse to the true ones in the intercourse between nations we are apt to rely too much on the instrumental part we lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts we do not act much more wisely when we trust to the interest of men as guarantees of their engagements the interests frequently tear to pieces the engagements and the passions trample upon both entirely to trust to either is to disregard our own safety or not to know mankind men are not tied to one another by papers and seals they are led to associate by resemblances by conformities by sympathies it is with nations as with individuals nothing is so strong a tie of amity between nation and nation as correspondence in laws customs manners and habits of life they have more than the force of treaties in themselves they are obligations written in the heart they approximate men to men without their knowledge and sometimes against their intentions the secret unseen but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse holds them together even when their perverse and litigious nature sets them to equivocate scuffle and sight about the terms of their written obligations  as to war if it be the means of wrong and violence it is the sole means of justice amongst nations nothing can banish it from the world they who say otherwise intending to impose upon us do not impose upon themselves but it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to mitigate those evils which we cannot remove the conformity and analogy of which i speak incapable like every thing else of preserving perfect trust and tranquillity among men has a

there have been periods of time in which communities apparently in peace with each other have been more perfectly separated than in later times many nations in europe have been in the course of long and bloody wars the cause must be sought in the similitude in europe of religion laws and manners at bottom these are all the same the writers on public law have often called this aggregate of nations a commonwealth they had reason it is virtually one great state having the same basis of general law with some diversity of provincial customs and local establishments the nations of europe have had

the affairs of france in       economy it is not a predilection to mean sordid homebred cares that will avert the consequences of a false estimation of our interest or prevent the shameful dilapidation into which a great empire must fall by mean reparations upon mighty ruins i confess i feel a degree of disgust almost leading to despair at the manner in which we are acting in the great exigencies of our country there is now a bill in this house appointing a rigid inquisition into the minutest detail of our offices at home the collection of sixteen millions annually a collection on which the public greatness safety and credit have their reliance the whole order of criminal jurisprudence which holds together society itself have at no time obliged us to call forth such powers no nor any thing like them there is not a principle of the law and constitution of this country that is not subverted to favor the execution of that project appendix no    and for what is all this

oppression and oppressed what i have always thought of the matter is this  that the most poor illiterate and uninformed creatures upon earth are judges of a practical oppression it is a matter of feeling and as such persons generally have felt most of it and are not of an overlively sensibility they are the best judges of it but for the real cause or the appropriate remedy they ought never to be called into council about the one or the other they ought to be totally shut out because their reason is weak because when once roused their passions are ungoverned because they want information because the smallness of the property which individually they possess renders them less attentive to the consequence of the measures they adopt in affairs of moment  letter to sir h langrishe m p  oppression effects of man irritated by oppression and elevated by a triumph over it are apt to abandon themselves to violent and extreme courses  ibid  opinion but say some you force opinion you can never extirpate opinion without extirpating a whole nation nay by pursuing it you only increase its partisans opinions are things out of human jurisdiction i have formerly heard this from the mouths of great men with more surprise than satisfaction they alleged as a proof of their doctrine the wars of charles the fifth and some of his successors against the reformation  it is so common though so unreasonable it is hardly worth remarking that no persons pursue more fiercely with criminal process and with every kind of coercion the publication of opinions contrary to their own than those do who claim in this respect the most unbounded latitude to themselves if it were not for this inconsistency then war against opinions might be justified as all others more or less according to the reason of the case for the case judged on by moral prudence and not by any universal abstract principle of right is to guide government in this delicate point  as to the mere matter of extirpation of all kinds of opinions whether right or wrong without the extirpation of a people it is a thing so very common that would be clouded and obscured rather than illustrated by examples every revolution in the predominant opinion made by the force of domestic legal government by the force of any usurpation by the force of any conquest is a proof to the contrary  and there is no nation which has not experienced those changes instances enough may be furnished of people who have enthusiastically and with force propagated those opinions which some time before they resisted with their blood rarely have ever great changes in opinion taken place without the application of force more or less like every thing else in human life and human affairs it is not universally true that a persecution of opinions lessens or increases the number of their votaries in finding where it may or may not have gathered these effects the sagacity of government shines or is disgraced as well as in the time the manner the choice of the opinions on which it ought to use or forbear the sword of domestic or of foreign justice but it is a false maxim that opinions ought to be indifferent to us either as men or as a state opinion is the rudder of human action and as the opinion is wise or foolish vicious or moral the cause of action is noxious or salutary it has even been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal philosophy to regulate opinion it is the great object of political philosophy to promote that which is found and to extirpate what is mischievous and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community and mischievous neighbors out of it opinions are of infinite consequence they make the manners  in fact they make the laws they make the legislator they are therefore of all things those to which provident government ought to look most to in their beginnings after a time they may look to them in vain when therefore i am told that a war is a war of opinions i am told that it is the most important of all wars  here i must not be told that this would lead to eternal war and persecution it would certainly if we argued like metaphysicians run mad who do not correct prudence the queen of virtues to be any virtue at all  and would either throw the bridle on the neck of headlong nature or tie it up for ever to the post no sophistry  no chicane

in general to be necessary when we know the full extent of any danger when we can accustom our eyes to it a great deal of the apprehension vanishes every one will be sensible of this who considers how greatly night adds to our dread in all cases of danger and how much the notions of ghosts and goblins of which none can form clear ideas affect minds which give credit to the popular tales concerning such sorts of beings those despotic governments which are founded on the passions of men and principally upon the passion of fear keep their chief as much as may be from the public eye the policy has been the same in many cases of religion almost all the heathen temples were dark even in the barbarous temples of the americans at this day they keep their idol in a dark part of the hut which is consecrated to his worship for this purpose too the druids performed all their ceremonies in the bosom of the darkest woods and in the shade of the oldest and most spreading oak no person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening or of setting terrible things if i may use the expression in their strongest light by the force of a judicious obscurity than milton his description of death in the second book is admirably studied it is astonishing with what a gloomy pomp with what a significant and expressive uncertainty of strokes and coloring he has finished the portrait of the king of terrors the other shape if shape it might be called that shape had none distinguishable in member joint or limb or substance might be called that shadow seemed for each seemed either black he stood as night fierce as ten furies terrible as hell and shook a deadly dart what seemed his head the likeness of a kingly crown had on in this description all is dark uncertain confused terrible and sublime to the last degree  sublime and beautiful  proportion and beauty let us see whether proportion can in any sense be considered as the cause of beauty as has been so generally and by some so confidently affirmed if proportion be one of the constituents of beauty it must derive that power either from some natural properties inherent in certain measures which operate mechanically from the operation of custom or from the fitness which some measures have to answer some particular ends of convenience our business therefore is to enquire whether the parts of those objects which are found beautiful in the vegetable or animal kingdoms are constantly so formed according to such certain measures as may serve to satisfy us that their beauty results from those measures on the principle of a natural mechanical cause or from custom or in fine from their fitness for any determinate purposes i intend to examine this point under each of these heads in their order but before i proceed further i hope it will not be thought amiss if i lay down the rules which governed me in this enquiry and which have missed me in it if i have gone astray   if two bodies produce the same or a similar effect on the mind and on examination they are found to agree in some of their properties and to differ in others the common effect is to be attributed to the properties in which they agree and not to those in which they differ   not to account for the effect of a natural object from the effect of an artificial object   not to account for the effect of any natural object from a conclusion of our reason concerning its uses if a natural cause may be assigned   not to admit any determinate quantity or any relation of quantity as the cause of a certain effect if the effect is produced by different or opposite measures and relations or if these measures and relations may exist and yet the effect may not be produced these are the rules which i have chiefly followed whilst i examined into the power of proportion considered as a natural cause and these if he thinks them just i request the reader to carry with him throughout the following discussion whilst we enquire in the first place in what things we find this quality of beauty next to see whether in these we can find any assignable proportions in such a manner as ought to convince us that our idea of beauty results from them we shall consider this pleasing power as it appears in vegetables in the inferior animals and in man turning our eyes to the vegetable creation we find nothing there so beautiful as flowers but flowers are almost of every sort of shape and of every sort of disposition they are turned and fashioned into an infinite variety of forms and from these forms botanists have given them their names which are almost as various what proportion do we discover between the stalks and the leaves of flowers or between the leaves and the pistils how does the slender stalk of the rose agree with the bulky head under which it bends but the rose is a beautiful flower and can we undertake to say that it does not owe a great deal of its beauty even to that disproportion the rose is a large flower yet it grows upon a small shrub the flower of the apple is very small and grows upon a large tree yet the rose and the apple blossom are both beautiful and the plants that bear them are most engagingly attired notwithstanding this disproportion what by general consent is allowed to be a more beautiful object than an orange tree flourishing at once with its leaves its blossoms and its fruit but it is in vain that we search here for any proporion between the height the breadth or any thing else concerning the dimensions of the whole or concerning the relation of the particular part to each other i grant that we may observe in many floers ething of a regular figure and of a methodical dispositon of the leaves the rose has such a figure and such a disposition of its petals but in an oblique view when this figure is in a good measure lost and the order of the leaves confounded it yet retains its beauty the rose is even more beautiful before it is full blown and the bud before this exact figure s ford and this is not the ony instan wherein method and exactness the soul of proportion are found rather prejudicial than serviceable to the cause of beauty  sublime and beautiful  parliament see vote qualities favorable and unfavourable to obtain a seat in parliament in popular elections a strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless power a spirit of independnce ed to some degree of enthusiasm an  character to discover and a bold one to  every corruption and every error of government the are the qualities which recommend a  a seat in the house of commons in open and  popular elections an indolent and subve disposition a disposition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power and to live in a mutual intercourse of favors with them an inclination rather to countenance a strong use of authority than to bear any sort of licentiousness on the part of the people these are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament  the instinct which carries the people toward the choice of the former is justified by reason because a man of such a character even in its exorbitancies does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust the end of which is a control on power the latter character even when it is not in its extreme will execute this trust but very imperfectly and if deviating to the least excess will certainly frustrate instead of forwarding the purposes of a control on government but when the house of commons was to be new modelled this principle was not only to be changed but reversed whilst any errors committed in support of power were left to the law with every advantage of favorable construction of mitigation and finally of pardon all excesses on the side of liberty or in pursuit of popular favor or in defense of popular rights and privileges were not only to be punished by the rigor of the known law but by a discretionary proceeding which brought on the loss of the popular object itself popularity was to be rendered if not directly penal at least highly dangerous the favor of the people might lead even to a disqualification of representing them their odium might become strained through the medium of two or three constructions the means of sitting as the trustee of all that was dear to them this is punishing the offense in the offending part until this time the opinion of the people through the power of an assembly still in some sort popular led to the greatest honors and emoluments in the gift of the crown now the principle is reversed and the favor of the court is the only sure way of obtaining and holding those honors which ought to be in the disposal of the people  it signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away example the only argument of effect in civil life demonstrates the truth of my proposition nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious tendency of this example until i see some man for his indiscretion in the support of power for his violent and intemperate servility rendered incapable of sitting in parliament for as it now stands the fault of overstraining popular qualities and irregularly if you please asserting popular privileges has led to disqualification the opposite fault never has produced the slightest punishment resistance to power has shut the door of the house of commons to one man obsequiousness and servility to none  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  parliament and prerogative see ministers favorite revolution i would not increase an evil because i was not able to remove it and because it was not in my power to keep the house of commons religiously true to its first principles i would not argue for carrying it to a total oblivion of them this has been the great scheme of power in our time they who will not conform their conduct to the public good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown have adopted a new plan they have totally abandoned the shattered and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgement in the strong hold of parliament itself if they have any evil design to which there is no ordinary legal power commensurate they bring it into parliament in parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end in parliament the power of obtaining their object is absolute and the safety in the proceeding perfect no rules to confine no afterreckonings to terrify parliament cannot with any great propriety punish others for things in which they themselves have been accomplices thus the control of parliament upon the executory power is lost because parliament is made to partake in every considerable act of government impeachment that great guardian of the purity of the constitution is in danger of being lost even to the idea of it  by this plan several important ends are answered to the cabal if the authority of parliament supports itself the credit of every act of government which they contrive is saved but if the act be so very odious that the whole strength of parliament is insufficient to recommend it then parliament is itself discredited and this discredit increases more and more that indifference to the constitution which it is the constant aim of its enemies by their abuse of parliamentary powers to render general among the people whenever parliament is persuaded to assume the offices of executive government it will lose all the confidence love and veneration which it has ever enjoyed whilst it was supposed the corrective and control of the acting powers of the state  ibid  parliament septennial i know that since the revolution along with many dangerous many useful powers of government have been weakened it is absolutely necessary to have frequent recourse to the legislature parliaments must therefore sit every year and for great part of the year the dreadful disorders of frequent elections have also necessitated a septennial instead of a triennial duration these circumstances i mean the constant habit of authority and the unfrequency of elections have tended very much to draw the house of commons toward the character of a standing senate it is a disorder which has arisen from the cure of greater disorders it has arisen from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a monarchical government with external strength and with internal tranquillity  ibid  parliament and people all the people have a deep interest in the dignity of parliament  letter to sir h langrishe m p  parliament triennial and place bill a triennial parliament or a place bill not competent to effect the ends proposed by them the first ideas which generally suggest themselves for the cure of parliamentary disorders are to shorten the duration of parliaments and to disqualify all or a great number of placemen from a seat in the house of commons whatever efficacy there may be in those remedies i am sure in the present state of things it is impossible to apply them a restoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indispensable to every other reformation what alterations ought afterward to be made in the constitution is a matter of deep and difficult research  if i wrote merely to please the popular palate it would indeed be as little troublesome to me as to another to extol these remedies so famous in speculation but to which their greatest admirers have never attempted seriously to resort in practice  i confess that i have no sort of reliance upon either a triennial parliament or a place bill with regard to the former perhaps it might rather serve to counteract than to promote the ends that are proposed by it to say nothing of the horrible disorders among the people attending frequent elections i should be fearful of committing every three years the independent gentlemen of the country into a contest with the treasury it is easy to see which of the contending parties would be ruined first whoever has taken a ul view of public proceedings so as to endeavor to ground his speculations on his experience must have observed how prodigiously greater the power of ministry is in the first and last session of a parliament than it is in the intermediate period when members sit a little firm on their seats the persons of the greatest parliamentary experience with whom i have conversed did constantly in canvassing the sat of questions allow something to the court side upon account of the elections depending or imminent the evil complained of if it exists in the present state of things would hardly be removed by a triennial parliament for unless the influence of government in elections can be entirely taken away the more frequently they return the more they will harrass private independence the more generally men will be compelled to sly to the settled systematic interest of government and to the resources of a boundless civil list certainly something may be done and ought to be done toward lessening that influence in elections and this will be necessary upon a plan either of longer or shorter duration of parliament but nothing can so perfectly remove the evil as not to render such contentions too frequently repeated utterly ruinous first to independence of fortune and then to independence of spirit  as i am only giving an opinion on this point and not at all debating it in adverse line i hope i may be excused in another observation with great truth i may aver that i never remember to have talked on this subject with any man much conversant with public business who considered short parliaments as a real improvement of the constitution gentlemen warm in a popular cause are ready enough to attribute all the declarations of such persons to corrupt motives but the habit of affairs if on one hand it tends to corrupt the mind furnishes it on the other with the means of better information the authority of such persons will always have some weight it may stand upon a par with the speculations of those who are less practiced in business and who with perhaps purer intentions have not so effectual means of judging it is besides an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine that every statesman is of course corrupt and that his opinion upon every constitutional point is solely formed upon some sinister interest  the next favorite remedy is a placebill the same principle guides in both i mean the opinion which is entertained by many of the infallibility of laws and regulations in the cure of public distempers without being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident i will only say that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious and mature reflection it is not easy to foresee what the effect would be of disconnecting with parliament the greatest part of those who hold civil employments and of such mighty and important bodies as the military and naval establishments it were better perhaps that they should have a corrupt interest in the forms of the constitution than that they should have none at all this is a question altogether different from the disqualification of a particular description of revenue officers from seats in parliament or perhaps of all the lower sorts of them from votes in elections in the former case only the few are affected in the latter only the inconsiderable but a great official a great professional a great military and naval interest all necessarily comprehending many people of the first weight ability wealth and spirit has been gradually formed in the kingdom these new interests must be let into a share of representation else possibly they may be inclined to destroy those institutions of which they are not permitted to partake this is not a thing to be trifled with nor is it every wellmeaning man that is fit to put his hands to it  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  parliament character of parliament at the commencement of the french revolution upon a view indeed of the composition of all parties he mr burke finds great satisfaction it is that in leaving the service of his country he leaves parliament without all comparison richer in abilities than he found it very solid and very brilliant talents distinguish the ministerial benches the opposite rows are a sort of seminary of genius and have brought forth such and so great talents as never before amongst us at least have appeared together if their owners are disposed to serve their country he trusts they are they are in a condition to render it services of the highest importance if through mistake or passion they are led to contribute to its ruin we shall at least have a consolation denied to the ruined country that adjoins us  we shall not be destroyed by men of mean or secondary capacities  appeal from the new to the old wigs  parliament members of to be a good member of parliament is let me tell you no easy task especially at this time when there is so strong a disposition to run into the perilous extremes of servile compliance or wild popularity to unite circumspection with vigor is absolutely necessary but it is extremely difficult we are now members for a rich commercial city bristol this city however is but a part of a rich commercial nation the interests of which are various multiform and intricate we are members for that great nation which however is itself but part of a great empire extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthest limits of the east and of the west all these widespread interests must be considered must be compared must be reconciled if possible we are members for a free country and surely we all know that the machine of a free constitution is no simple thing but as intricate and as delicate as it is valuable we are members in a great and ancient monarchy and we must preserve religiously the true legal rights of the sovereign which form the keystone that binds together the noble and wellconstructed arch of our empire and our constitution a constitution made up of balanced powers must ever be a critical thing as such i mean to touch that part of it which comes within my reach  speech at the close of the poll at bristol  polity of the several countries of europe the whole of the polity and economy of every country in europe have been derived from the same sources they were drawn from the old germanic or gothic custumary from the feudal institutions which must be considered as an emanation from those customs and the whole has been improved and digested into system and discipline by the roman law from hence arose the several orders with or without a monarch which are called states in every country the strong traces of which where monarchy predominated were never wholly extinguished or merged in despotism in the few places where monarchy was cast off the spirit of european monarchy was still left those countries still contiued countries of states that is of classes orders and distinctions such as had before subsisted or nearly so indeed the force and form of the institution called states continued in greater perfection in those republican countries than under monarchies from all those sources arose a system of manners and of education which was nearly similar in all countries and which softened blended and harmonized the colors of the whole there was little difference in the form of their universities for the education of their youth whether with regard to faculties to sciences or to that erudition which is used to impart with liberal morals a kind of elegance to the mind from this resemblance in the modes of intercourse and in the whole form and fashion of life no citizen of europe could be altogether an exile in any part of it there nothing more than a pleasing variety to recreate and instruct the mind to enrich the imagination and

the doors of deserted guard rooms appal the imagination and conjure up the grim specter of departed tyrants  the saxon the norman and the dane the stern edwards and fierce henrys  who stalk from desolation to desolation through the dreary vacuity and melancholy succession of chill and comfortless chambers when this tumult subsides a dead and still more frightful silence would reign in this desert if every now and then the tacking of hammers did not announce that those constant attendants upon all courts in all ages jobs were still alive for whose sake alone it is that any trace of ancient grandeur is suffered to remain these palaces are a true emblem of some governments the inhabitants are decayed but the governors and magistrates still flourish they put me in mind of old sarum

rewards of public service what infinite mischief he may do his country through all generations such saving to the public may prove the worst mode of robbing it the crown which has in its hands the trust of the daily pay for national service ought to have in its hands also the means for the repose of public labor and the fixed settlement of acknowledged merit there is a time when the weatherbeaten vessels of the state ought to come into harbor they must at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals from the perfidy of political friends and the inconstancy of the people many of the persons who in all times have filled the great offices of state have been younger brothers who had originally little if any fortune these offices do not furnish the means of amassing wealth there ought to be some power in the crown of granting pensions out of the reach of its own caprices an intail of dependence is a bad reward of merit  i would therefore leave to the crown the possibility of conferring some favors which whilst they are received as a reward do not operate as corruption when men receive obligations from the crown through the pious hands of fathers or of connexions as venerable as the paternal the dependences which arise from thence are the obligations of gratitude and not the fetters of servility such ties originate in virtue and they promote it they continue men in those habitudes of friendship those political connexions and those political principles in which they began life they are antidotes against a corrupt levity instead of causes of it what an unseemly spectacle would it afford what a disgrace would it be to the commonwealth that suffered such things to see the hopeful son of a meritorious minister begging his bread at the door of that treasury from whence his father dispensed the economy of an empire and promoted the happiness and glory of his country why should he be obliged to prostrate his honor and to submit his principles at the levee of some proud favorite shouldered and thrust aside by every impudent pretender on the very spot where a few days before he saw himself adored  obliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his house and to kiss the hands that are red with his fathers blood  no sir these things are unfit  they are intolerable  sir i shall be asked why i do not choose to destroy those offices which are pensions and appoint pensions under the direct title in their stead i allow that in some cases it leads to abuse to have things appointed for one purpose and applied to another i have no great objection to such a change but i do not think it quite prudent for me to propose it if i should take away the present establishment the burden of proof rests upon me that so many pensions and no more and to such an amount each and no more are necessary for the public service this is what i can never prove for it is a thing incapable of definition i do not like to take away an object that i think answers my purpose in hopes of getting it back again in a better shape people will bear an old establishment when its excess is corrected who will revolt at a new one i do not think these officepensions to be more in number than sufficient but on that point the house will exercise its discretion as to abuse i am convinced that very few trusts in the ordinary course of administration have admitted less abuse than this efficient ministers have been their own paymasters it is true but their very partiality has operated as a kind of justice and still it was service that was paid when we look over this exchequer list we find it filled with the descendants of the walpoles of the pelhams of the townshends names to whom this country owes its liberties and to whom his majesty owes his crown it was in one of these lines that the immense and envied employment he now holds came to a certain duke duke of newcastle whose dining room is under the house of commons  who is now probably sitting quietly at a very good dinner directly under us and acting high life below stairs whilst we his masters are filling our mouths with unsubstantial sounds and talking of hungry economy over his head but he is the elder branch of an ancient and decayed house joined to and repaired by the reward of services done by another i respect the original title and the first

 protection the influence of protection destroyed by mr foxs india bill but sir there is one kind of influence far greater than that of the nomination to office this gentlemen in opposition have totally overlooked although it now exists in its full vigor and it will do so upon their scheme in at least as much force as it does now that influence this bill cuts up by the roots i mean the influence of protection i shall explain myself  the office given to a young man going to india is of trifling consequence but he that goes out an insignificant boy in a few years returns a great nabob mr hastings says he has two hundred and fifty of that kind of raw materials who expect to be speedily manufactured into the merchantable quality i mention one of these gentlemen suppose returns hither loaded with odium and with riches when he comes to england he comes as to a prison or as to a sanctuary and either are ready for him according to his demeanor what is the influence in the grant of any place in india to that which is acquired by the protection or compromise with such guilt and with the command of such riches under the dominion of the hopes and fears which power is able to hold out to every man in that condition that mans whole fortune half a million perhaps becomes an instrument of influence without a shilling of charge to the civil list and the inslux of fortunes which stand in need of this protection is continual it works both ways it influences the delinquent and it may corrupt the minister compare the influence acquired by appointing for instance even a governor general and that obtained by protecting him i shall push this no further but i wish gentlemen to roll it a little in their own minds  the bill before you cuts off this source of influence its design and main scope is to regulate the administration of india upon the principles of a court of judicature and to exclude as far as human prudence can exclude all possibility of a corrupt partiality in appointing to office or supporting in office or covering from enquiry and punishment any person who has abused or shall abuse his authority at the board as appointed and regulated by this bill reward and punishment cannot be shifted and reversed by a whisper that commission becomes fatal to cabal to intrigue and to secret representation those instruments of the ruin of india he that cuts off the means of premature fortune and the power of protecting it when acquired strikes a deadly blow at the great fund the bank the capital stock of indian influence which cannot be vested any where or in

the revenue adventures of the bold baron north and the good knight probert upon the mountains of venodotia an attempt was lately made to improve this branch of local influence principality of wales and to transfer it to the fund of general corruption i have on the seat behind me the constitution of mr john probert a knight errant dubbed by the noble lord in the blue ribbon lord north  and sent to search for revenues and adventures upon the mountains of wales the commission is remarkable and the event not less so the commission sets forth that upon a report of the deputy auditor for there is a deputy auditor of the principality of wales it appeared that his majestys land revenues in the said principality are greatly diminished and that upon a report of the surveyor general of his majestys land revenues upon a memorial of the auditor of his majestys revenues within the said principality that his mines and forests have produced very little profit either to the public revenue or to individuals and therefore they appoint mr probert with a pension of three hundred pounds a year from the said principality to try whether he can make any thing more of that very little which is stated to be so greatly diminished  a beggarly account of empty boxes and yet sir you will remark that this diminution from littleness which serves only to prove the infinite divisibility of matter was not for want of the tender and officious care as we see of surveyors general and surveyors particular of auditors and deputyauditors not for want of memorials and remonstrances and reports and commissions and constitutions and inquisitions and pensions  probert thus armed and accoutred and paid proceeded on his adventure but he was no sooner arrived on the confines of wales than all wales was in arms to meet him that nation is brave and full of spirit since the invasion of king edward and the massacre of the bards there never was such a tumult and alarm and uproar through the region of prestaya snowden shook to its base cader edris was loosened from its foundations the fury of litigious was blew her horn on the mountains the rocks poured down their goatherds and the deep caverns vomited out their miners every thing above ground and every thing under ground was in arms in short sir to alight from my welsh pegasus and to come to level ground the preux chevalier probert went to look for revenue like his masters upon other occasions and like his masters he found rebellion but we were grown cautious by experience a civil war of paper might end in a more serious war for now remonstrance met remonstrance and memorial was opposed to memorial the wise britons thought it more reasonable that the poor wasted decrepit revenue of the principality should die a natural than a violent death in truth sir the attempt was no less an affront upon the understanding of that respectable people than it was an attack on their property they chose that their ancient mossgrown castles should moulder into decay under the silent touches of time and the slow formality of an oblivious and drowsy exchequer than that they should be battered down all at once by the lively efforts of a pensioned engineer as it is the fortune of the noble lord to whom the auspices of this campaign belonged frequently to provoke resistance so it is his rule and nature to yield to that resistance in all cases whatsoever he was true to himself on this occasion he submitted with spirit to the spirited remonstrances of the welsh mr probert gave up his adventure and keeps his pension and so ends the famous history of the

depend for its effect on the power of raising sensible images that i am convinced it would lose a very considerable part of its energy if this were the necessary result of all description because that union of affecting words which is the most powerful of all poetical instruments would frequently lose its force along with its propriety and consistency if the sensible images were always excited there is not perhaps in the whole aeneid a more grand and labored passage than the description of vulcans cavern in aetna and the works that are there carried on virgil dwells particularly on the formation of the thunder which he describes unfinished under the hammers of the cyclops but what are the principles of this extraordinary composition tres imbris torti radios tres nubis aquosoe addiderant rutili tres ignis et alitis austri fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumque metumque miscebant operi flammisque sequacibus iras   this seems to me admirably sublime yet if we attend coolly to the kind of sensible images which a combination of ideas of this sort must form the chimeras of madmen cannot appear more wild and absurd than such a picture  three rays of twisted showers three of watery clouds three of fire and three of the winged south wind then mixed they in the work terrific lightnings and sound and fear and anger with pursuing flames this strange composition is formed into a gross body it is hammered by the cyclops it is in part polished and partly continues rough the truth is if poetry gives us a noble assemblage of words corresponding to many noble ideas which are connected by circumstances of time or place or related to each other as cause and effect or associated in any natural way they may be molded together in any form and perfectly answer their end the picturesque connection is not demanded because no real picture is formed nor is the effect of the description at all the less upon this account what is said of helen by priam and the old men of his council is generally thought to give us the highest possible idea of that fatal beauty    they cried no wonder such celestial charms for nine long years have set the world in arms what winning graces what majestic mien she moves a goddess and she looks a queen pope here is not one word said of the particulars of her beauty nothing which can in the least help us to any precise idea of her person but yet we are much more touched by this manner of mentioning her than by those long and labored descriptions of helen whether handed down by tradition or formed by fancy which are to be met with in some authors i am sure it affects me much more than the minute description which spencer has given of belphebe though i own that there are parts in that description as there are in all the descriptions of that excellent writer extremely fine and poetical the terrible picture which lucretius has drawn of religion in order to display the magnanimity of his philosophical hero in opposing

visu mortalibus instans primus graius homo mortales tollere contra est oculos ausus  what idea do you derive from so excellent a picture none at all most certainly neither has the poet said a single word which might in the least serve to mark a single limb or feature of the phantom which he intended to represent in all the horrors imagination can conceive in reality poetry and rhetoric do not succeed in exact description so well as painting does their business is to affect rather by sympathy than imitation to display rather the effect of things on the mind of the speaker or of others than to present a clear idea of the things themselves this is their most extensive province and that in which they succeed the best  sublime and beautiful  poetry not strictly an imitative art hence we may observe that poetry taken in its most general sense cannot with strict propriety be called an art of imitation it is indeed an imitation so far as it describes the manners and passions of men which their words can express where animi motus effert interpret lingua there it is strictly imitation and all merely dramatic poetry is of this sort but descriptive poetry operates chiefly by substitution by the means of sounds which by custom have the effect of realities nothing is an imitation further than as it resembles some other thing and words undoubtedly have no sort of resemblance to the ideas

traces we every where find of his wisdom who made it if a discourse on the use of the parts of the body may be considered as an hymn to the creator the use of the passions which are the organs of the mind cannot be barren of praise to him nor unproductive to ourselves of that noble and uncommon union of science and admiration which a contemplation of the works of infinite wisdom alone can afford to a rational mind whilst referring to him whatever we find of right or good or fair in ourselves discovering his strength and wisdom even in our own weakness and imperfection honoring them where we discover them clearly and adoring their profundity where we are lost in our search we may be inquisitive without impertinence and elevated without pride we may be admitted if i may dare to say so into the counsels of the almighty by a consideration of his works the elevation of the mind ought to be the principal end of all our studies which if they do not in some measure effect they are of very little service to us but besides this great purpose a consideration of the rationale of our passions seems to me very necessary for all who would affect them upon solid and sure principles it is not enough to know them in general to affect them after a delicate manner or to judge properly of any work designed to affect them we should know the exact boundaries of their several jurisdictions we should pursue them through all their variety of operations and pierce into the inmost and what might appear inaccessible parts of our nature quod latet arcana non enarrabile fibra without all this it is possible for a man after a confused manner sometimes to satisfy his own mind of the truth of his work but he can never have a certain determinate rule to go by not can he ever make his propositions sufficiently clear to others poets and orators and painters and those who cultivate other branches of the liberal arts have without this critical knowledge succeeded well in their several provinces and will succeed as among artificers there are many machines made and even invented without any exact knowledge of the principles they are governed by it is i own not uncommon to be wrong in theory and right in practice and we are happy that it is so men often act right from their feelings who afterward reason but ill on them from principle but as it is impossible to avoid an attempt at such reasoning and equally impossible to prevent its having some influence on our practice surely it is worth taking some pains to have it just and founded on the basis of sure experience we might expect that the artists themselves would have been our surest guides but the artists have been too much occupied in the practice the philosophers have done little and what they have done was mostly with a view to their own schemes and systems and as for those called critics they have generally sought the rule of the arts in the wrong place they sought it among poems pictures engravings statues and buildings but art can never give the rules that make an art this is i believe the reason why artists in general and poets principally have been confined in so narrow a circle they have been rather imitators of one another than of nature and this with so faithful an uniformity and to so remote an antiquity that it is hd to say who gave the first model critics follow them and therefore can do little as guides i can judge but poorly of any thing whilst i measure it by no other standard than itself the true standard of the arts is in every mans power and an easy observation of the most common sometimes of the meanest things in nature will give the truest lights where the greatest sagacity and industry that slights such observation must leave us in the dark or what is worse amuse and mislead us by false lights in an enquiry it is almost every thing to be once in a right road i am satisfied i have done but little by these observations considered in themselves and i never should have taken the pains to digest them much less should i have ever ventured to publish them if i was not convinced that nothing tends more to the corruption of science than to suffer it to slagnate

its property but as ability is a vigorous and active principle and as property is sluggish inert and timid it never can be safe from the invasions of ability unless it be out of all proportion predominant in the representation it must be represented too in great masses of accumulation or it is not rightly protected the characteristic essence of property formed out of the combined principles of its acquisition and conservation is to be unequal the great masses therefore which excite envy and tempt rapacity must be put out of the possibility of danger then they form a natural rampart about the lesser properties in all their gradations the same quantity of property which is by the natural course of things divided among many has not the same operation its defensive power is weakened as it is diffused in this diffusion each mans portion is less than what in the eagerness of his desires he may flatter himself to obtain by dissipating the accumulations of others  the plunder of the few would indeed give but a share inconceivably small in the distribution to the many but the many are not capable of making this calculation and those who lead them to rapine never intend this distribution  the power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it and that which tends the most to the perpetuation of society itself it makes our weakness subservient to our virtue it grafts benevolence even upon avarice the possessors of family wealth and of the distinction which attends hereditary possession as most concerned in it are the natural securities for this transmission  with us the house of peers is formed upon this principle it is wholly composed of hereditary property and hereditary distinction

some expense of blood might be seen without much disapprobation no confusion could be seared in such an enterprise because the establishment to be reformed was itself a state of confusion a king without authority nobles without union or subordination a people without arts industry commerce or liberty no order within ence without no effective public force but a foreign force which entered a naked country at will and disposed of every thing at pleasure  here was a state of things which seemed to invite and might perhaps justify bold enterprise and desperate experiment but in what manner was this chaos brought into order the means were as striking to the imagination as satisfactory to the reason and soothing to the moral sentiments in contemplating that change humanity has every thing to rejoice and to glory in nothing to be ashamed of nothing to suffer so far as it has gone it probably is the most pure and defecated public good which has ever been conferred on mankind we have seen anarchy and servitude at once removed a throne strengthened for the protection of the people without trenching on their liberties all foreign cabal banished by changing the crown from elective to hereditary and what was a matter of pleasing wonder we have seen a reigning king from an heroic love to his country exerting himself with all the toil the dexterity the management the intrigue in favor of a family of strangers with which ambitious men labor for the aggrandisement of their own ten millions of men in a way of being freed gradually and therefore safely to themselves and the state

faction cannot pretend that france had stood so much in need of a change as poland they cannot pretend that poland has not obtained a better system of liberty or of government than it enjoyed before they cannot assert that the polish revolution cost more dearly than that of france to the interests and feelings of multitudes of men but the cold and subordinate light in which they look upon the one and the pains they take to preach up the other of these revolutions leave us no choice in fixing on their motives both revolutions profess liberty as their object but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order the other from order to anarchy the first secures its liberty by establishing its throne the other builds its freedom on the subversion of its monarchy in the one their means are unstained by crimes and their settlement favors morality in the other vice and confusion are in the very essence of their pursuit and of their enjoyment the circumstances in which these two

other is always unquiet the new constitution only serves to supply that restless people with new means at least new modes of cherishing their turbulent disposition the bottom of the character is the same  memorial on the affairs of france in       power always accompanied by terror i know some people are of opinion that no awe no degree of terror accompanies the idea of power and have hazarded to affirm that we can contemplate the idea of god himself without any such emotion i purposely avoided when i first considered this subject to introduce the idea of that great and tremendous being as an example in an argument so light as this though it frequently occurred to me not as an objection to but as a strong confirmation of my notions in this matter i hope in what i am going to say i shall avoid presumption where it is almost impossible for any mortal to speak with strict propriety i say then that whilst we consider the godhead merely as he is an object of the understanding which forms a complex idea of power wisdom justice goodness all stretched to a degree far exceeding the bounds of our comprehension whilst we consider the divinity in this refined and abstracted light the imagination and passions are little or nothing affected but because we are bound by the condition of our nature to ascend to these pure and intellectual ideas through the medium of sensible images and to judge of these divine qualities by their evident acts and exertions it becomes extremely hard to disentangle our idea of the cause from the effect by which we are led to know it thus when we contemplate the deity his attributes and their operation coming united on the mind form a sort of sensible image and as such are capable of affecting the imagination now though in a just idea of the deity perhaps none of his attributes are predominant yet to our imagination his power is by far the most striking some reflection some comparing is necessary to satisfy us of his wisdom his justice and his goodness to be struck with his power it is only necessary that we should open our eyes but whilst we contemplate so vast an object under the arm as it were of almighty power and invested upon every side with omnipresence we shrink into the minuteness of our own nature and are in a manner annihilated before him and though a consideration of his other attributes may relieve in some measure our apprehensions yet no conviction of the justice with which it is exercised nor the mercy with which it is tempered can wholly remove the terror that naturally arises from a force which nothing can withstand if we rejoice we rejoice with trembling and even whilst we are receiving benefits we cannot but shudder at a power which can confer benefits of such mighty importance  when the prophet david contemplated the wonders of wisdom and power which are displayed in the economy of man he seems to be struck with a sort of divine horror and cries out fearfully and wonderfully am i made an heathen poet has a sentiment of a similar nature horace looks upon it as the last effort of philosophical fortitude to behold without terror and amazement this immense and glorious fabric of the universe hunc solemn et stellas et decedentia certis tempora momentis sunt qui sormidine nulla imbuti spectant lucretius is a poet not to be suspected of giving way to superstitious terrors yet when he supposes the whole mechanism of nature laid open by the master of his philosophy his transport on this magnificent view which he has represented in the colors of such bold and lively poetry is overcast with a shade of secret dread and horror his tibi me rebus quoedam divina voluptas percipit atque horror quod sic natura tua vi tam manisesla palet ex omni part retecta but the scripture alone can supply ideas answerable to the majesty of this subject in the scripture wherever god is represented as appearing or speaking every thing terrible in nature is called up to heighten the awe and solemnity of the divine presence the psalms and the prophetical books are crowded with instances of this kind the earth shook says the psalmist the heavens also dropped at the presence of the lord and what is remarkable the painting preserves the same character not only when he is supposed descending to take vengeance upon the wicked but even when he exerts the like plenitude of power in acts of beneficence to mankind tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of jacob which turned the rock into standing water the slint unto a fountain of waters it were endless to enumerate all the passages both in the sacred and profane writers which establish the general sentiment of mankind concerning the inseparable union of a sacred and reverential awe with our ideas of the divinity hence the common maxim primos in orb deos fecit timor this maxim may be as i believe it is false with regard to the origin of religion the maker of the maxim saw how inseparable these ideas were without considering that the notion of some great power must be always precedent to our dread of it but this dread must necessarily follow the idea of such a power when it is once excited in the mind it is on this principle that true religion has and must have so large a mixture of salutary fear and that false religions have generally nothing else but fear to support them before the christian religion had as it were humanized the idea of the divinity and brought it somewhat nearer to us there was very little said of the love of god the followers of plato have something of it and only something the other writers of pagan antiquity whether poets or philosophers nothing at all and they who consider with what infinite attention by what a disregard of every perishable object through what long habits of piety and contemplation it is any man is able to attain an entire love and devotion to the deity will easily perceive that it is not the first the most natural and the most striking effect which proceeds from that idea thus we have traced power through its several gradations unto the highest of all where our imagination is finally lost and we find terror quite throughout the progress its inseparable companion and growing along with it as far as we can possibly trace them now as power is undoubtedly a capital source of the sublime this will point out evidently from whence its energy is derived and to what class of ideas we ought to unite it  sublime and beautiful  power and property that power goes with property is not universally true and the idea that the operation of it is certain and invariable may mislead us very fatally  memorial on the affairs of france in       power discretion of if the discretion of power is once let loose upon property we can be at no loss to determine whose power and what discretion it is that will prevail at last  oecon reform  powers conduct of the coalesced powers in the war against france without their principles perhaps without any principles at all they played the game of the jacobins there was a beaten road before them the powers of europe were armed france had always appeared dangerous the war was easily diverted from france as a faction to france as a state the princes were easily taught to slide back into their old habitual course of politics they were easily led to consider the flames that were consuming france not as a warning to protect their own buildings which were without any party wall and linked by a contignation into the edifice of france as an happy occasion for the pillaging the goods and for carrying off the materials of their neighbors house their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes they carried on their new designs without seeming to abandon the principles of their old policy they pretended to seek or they flattered themselves that they sought in the accession of new fortresses and new territories a defensive security but the security wanted was against a kind of power which was not dangerous in its fortresses nor in it is territories but in it is spirit and it is principles they aimed or pretended to aim at desending themselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any defensive plan if armies and fortresses were a defense against jacobinism louis the sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people  this error obliged them even in their offensive operations to adopt a plan of war against the success of which there was something little short of mathematical demonstration they refused to take any step which might strike at the heart of affairs they seemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part they acted through the whole as if they really wished the conservation of the jacobin power as what might be more favorable than the lawful government to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for they always kept on the circumference and the wider and remoter the circle was the more eagerly they chose as their sphere of action the plan they pursued in it is nature demanded great length of time in it is execution they who went the nearest way to work were obliged to cover an incredible extent of country it lest to the enemy every means of destroying this extended line of weakness ill success in any part was sure to defeat the effect of the whole this is true of austria it is still more true of england on this false plan even good fortune by further weakening the victor put him but the further off from his object  as long as there was any appearance of success the spirit of aggrandizement and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy seized upon all the coaleseed powers some sought an accession of territory at the expense of france some at the expense of each other some at the expense of third parties and when the vicissitude of disaster took it is turn they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship  regicide peace  people amongst these nice and therefore dangerous points of casuistry may be reckoned the question so much agitated in the present hour  whether after the people have discharged themselves of their original power by an habitual delegation no occasion can possibly occur which may justify their resumption of it this question in this latitude is very hard to affirm or deny but i am satisfied that no occasion can justify such a resumption which would not equally authorize a dispensation with any other moral duty perhaps with all of them together however if in general it be not easy to determine concerning the lawfulness of such devious proceedings which must be ever on the edge of crimes it is far from difficult to foresee the perilous consequences of the resuscitation of such a power in the people the practical consequences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value political problems do not primarily concern truth or falsehood they relate to good or evil what in the result is likely to produce evil is politically false that which is productive of good politically is true  believing it therefore a question at least arduous in the theory and in the practice very critical it would become us to ascertain as well as we can what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkness and the sleep of ages when the supreme authority of the people is in question before we attempt to extend or to confine it we ought to fix in our minds with some degree of distinctness an idea of what it is we mean when we say the people  in a state of rude nature there is no such thing as a people a number of men in themselves have no collective capacity the idea of a people is the idea of a corporation it is wholly artificial and made like all other legal fictions by common agreement what the particular nature of that agreement was is collected from the form into which the particular society has been cast any other is not their covenant when men therefore break up the original compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a state they are no longer a people they have no longer a corporate existence they have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within nor a claim to be recognized abroad they are a number of vague loose individuals and nothing more with them all is to begin again alas they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form themselves into a mass which has a true politic personality  we hear much from men who have not acquired their hardiness of assertion from the prosundity of their thinking about the omnipotence of a majority in such a dissolution of an ancient society as has taken place in france but amongst men so disbanded there can be no such thing as majority or minority or power in any one person to bind another the power of acting by a majority which the gentlemen theorists seem to assume so readily after they have violated the contract out of which it has arisen if at all it existed must be grounded on two assumptions first that of an incorporation produced by unanimity and secondly an unanimous agreement that the act of a mere majority say of one shall pass with them and with others as the act of the whole  we are so little affected by things which are habitual that we consider this idea of the decision of a majority as if it were a law of our original nature but such constructive whole residing in a part only is one of the most violent fictions of positive law that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artificial incorporation out of civil society nature knows nothing of it nor are men even when arranged according to civil order otherwise than by very long training brought at all to submit to it the mind is brought far more easily to acquiesce in the proceedings of one man or a few who act under a general procuration for the state than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his share in the deliberation for there the beaten party are exasperated and soured by the previous contention and mortified by the conclusive defeat this mode of decision where wills may be so nearly equal where according to circumstances the smaller number may be the stronger force and where apparent reason may be all upon one side and on the other little else than impetuous appetite all this must be the result of a very particular and special convention confirmed afterward by long habits of obedience by a sort of discipline in society and by a strong hand vested with stationary permanent power to enforce this sort of constructive general will what organ it is that shall declare the corporate mind is so much a matter of positive arrangement that several states for the validity of several of their acts have required a proportion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority  these proportions are so entirely governed by convention that in some cases the minority decides the laws in many countries to condemn require more than a mere majority less than an equal number to acquit in our judicial trials we require unanimity either to condemn or to absolve in some incorporations one man speaks for the whole in others a few until the other day in the constitution of poland unanimity was required to give validity to any act of their great national council or diet this approaches much more nearly to rude nature than the institutions of any other country such indeed every commonwealth must be without a positive law to recognize in a certain number the will of the entire body  if men dissolve their ancient incorporation in order to regenerate their community in that state of things each man has a right if he pleases to remain an individual any number of individuals who can agree upon it have an undoubted right to form themselves into a state apart and wholly independent if any of these is forced into the fellowship of another this is conquest and not compact on every principle which supposes society to be in virtue of a free covenant this compulsive incorporation must be null and void  as a people can have no right to a corporate capacity without universal consent

more right to the territory called france than i have i have a right to pitch my tent in any unoccupied place i can find for it and i may apply to my own maintenance any part of their unoccupied soil

heard and ninetynine out of an hundred of themselves certainly never have heard whilst at the very time they tell me that prescription and long possession form no title to property who are they that presume to assert that the land which i purchased of the individual a natural person and not a ftion of state belongs to them who in the very capacity in which they make their claim can exist only a an imaginary being and in virtue of the very prescription which they reject and disown this mode of arguing might be pushed into all the detail so as to leave no sort of doubt that on their principles and on the sort of footing on which they have thought proper to place themselves the crowd of men on the other side of the channel who have the impudence to call themselves a people can never be the

politics new system see religion these principles of internal as well as external division and coalition are but just now extinguished but they who will examine into the true character and genius of some late events must be satisfied that other sources of faction combining parties among the inhabitants of different countries into one connection are opened and that from these sources are likely to arise effects full as important as those which had formerly arisen from the jarring interests of the religious sects the intention of the several actors in the change in france is not a matter of doubt it is very openly professed  in the modern world before this time there has been no instance of this spirit of general political faction separated from religion pervading several countries and forming a principle of union between the partisans in each but the thing is not less in human nature the ancient world has furnished a strong and striking instance of such a ground for faction full as powerful and full as mischievous as our spirit of religious system had ever been exciting in all the states of greece european and asiatic the most violent animosities and the most cruel and bloody persecutions and proscriptions these ancient factions in each commonwealth of greece connected themselves with those of the same description in some other states and secret cabals and public alliances were carried on and made not upon a conformity of general political interests but for the support and aggrandizement of the two leading states which headed the aristocratic and democratic factions for as in later times the king of spain was at the head of a catholic and the king of sweden of a protestant interest france though catholic acting subordinately to the latter in the like manner the lacedaemonians were every where at the head of the aristocratic interests and the athenians of the democratic the two leading powers kept alive a constant cabal and conspiracy in every state and the political dogmas concerning the constitution of a republic were the great instruments by which these leading states chose to aggrandize themselves their choice was not unwise because the interest in opinions merely as opinions and without any experimental reference to their effects when once they take strong hold of the mind become the most operative of all interests and indeed very often supercede every other  i might further exemplify the possibility of a political sentiment running through various states and combining factions in them from the history of the middle ages in the guelfs and ghibellines these were political factions originally in favor of the emperor and the pope with no mixture of religious doginas or if any thing religiously doctrinal they had in them originally it very soon disappeared as their first political objects disappeared also though the spirit remained they became no more than names to distinguish factions but they were not the less powerful in their operation when they had no direct point of doctrine either religious or civil to assert for a long time however those factions gave no small degree of influence to the foreign chiefs in every commonwealth in which they existed i do not mean to pursue further the track of these parties i allude to this part of history only as it furnishes an instance of that species of faction

that sort of interest belongs only to those whose state of weakness or mediocrity is such as to give them greater cause of apprehension from what may destroy them than of hope from any thing by which they may be aggrandized  as long as those two princes are at variance so long the liberties of germany are safe but if ever they should so far understand one another as to be persuaded that they have a more direct and more certainly defined interest in a proportioned mutual aggrandizement than in a reciprocal reduction that is if they come to think that they are more likely to be enriched by a division of spoil than to be rendered secure by keeping to the old policy of preventing others from being spoiled by either of them from that moment the liberties of germany are no more  that a junction of two in such a scheme is neither impossible nor improbable is evident from the partition of poland in      which was effected by such a junction as made the interposition of other nations to prevent it not easy their circumstances at that time hindered any other three states or indeed any two from taking measures in common to prevent it though france was at that time an existing power and had not yet learned to act upon a system of politics of her own invention the geographical position of poland was a great obstacle to any movements of france in opposition to this at that time unparalleled league to my certain knowledge if great britain had at that time been willing to concur in preventing the execution of a project so dangerous in the example even exhausted as france then was by the preceding war and under a lazy and unenterprising prince she would have at every risque taken an active part in this business but a languor with regard to so remote an interest and the principles and passions which were then strongly at work at home were the causes why great britain would not give france any encouragement in such an enterprise at that time however and with regard to that object in my opinion great britain and france had a common interest  but the position of germany is not like that of poland with regard to france either for good or for evil if a conjunction between prussia and the emperor should be formed for the purpose of secularising and rendering hereditary the ecclesiastical electorates and the bishopric of munster for settling two of them on the children of the emperor and uniting cologne and munster to the dominions of the king of prussia on the rhine or if any other project of mutual aggrandizement should be in prospect and that to

lower sort from their occupations and have put them into pay that they may form them into a body of janisaries to overrule and awe property the heads of these wretches they never suffer to cool they supply them with a food for fury varied by the day  besides the sensual state of intoxication from which they are rarely free they have made the priests and people formally abjure the divinity they have estranged them from every civil moral and social or even natural and instinctive sentiment habit and practice and have rendered them systematically savages to make it impossible for them to be the instruments of any sober and virtuous arrangement or to be reconciled to any state of order under any name whatsoever  the other description the oppressed  are people of some property they are the small relics of the persecuted landed interest they are the burghers and the farmers by the very circumstance of their being of some property though numerous in some points of view they cannot be very considerable as a number in cities the nature of their occupations renders them domestic and feeble in the country it confines them to their farm for subsistence the national guards are all changed

scrutinizing inquisition far more rigid than any thing ever known or imagined two persons cannot meet and confer without hazard to their liberty and even to their lives numbers scarcely credible have been executed and their property confiscated at paris and in most other towns the bread they buy is a daily dole  which they cannot obtain without a daily ticket delivered to them by their masters multitudes of all ages and sexes are actually imprisoned i have reason to believe that in france there are not for various state crimes so few as twenty thousand some accounts make them five times as many actually in jail  a large portion of people of property in any state if a father of a family should show any dispositions to resist or to withdraw himself from their power his wife and children are cruelly to answer for it it is by means of these hostages that they keep the troops which they force by masses as they call it into the field  true to their colors  another of their resources is not to be forgotten  they have lately found a way of giving a sort of ubiquity to the supreme sovereign authority which no monarch has been able yet to give to any representation of his  the commissioners of the national convention who are the members of the convention itself and really exercise all its powers make continual circuits through every province and visits to every army there they supersede all the ordinary authorities civil and military and change and alter every thing at their pleasure so that in effect no deliberative capacity exists in any portion of the inhabitants  memorial on the affairs of france in       revolution french oppressive but spirited and daring france differs essentially from all those governments which are formed without system which exist by habit and which are confused with the multitude and with the complexity of their pursuits what now stands as government in france is struck out at a heat the design is wicked immoral impious oppressive but it is spirited and daring it is systematic it is simple in its principle it has unity and consistency in perfection in that country entirely to cut off a branch of commerce to extinguish a manufacture to destroy the circulation of money to violate credit to suspend the course of agriculture even to burn a city or to lay waste a province of their own does not cost them a moments anxiety to them the will the wish the want the liberty the toil the blood of individuals is as nothing individuality is left out of their scheme of government the state is all in all every thing is referred to the production of force afterward every thing is trusted to the use of it it is military in its principle in its maxims in its spirit and in all its movements the state has dominion and conquest for its sole objects dominion over minds by proselytism over bodies by arms  thus constituted with an immense body of natural means which are lessened in their amount only to be increased in their effect france has since the accomplishment of the revolution a complete unity in its direction it has destroyed every resource of the state which depends upon opinion and the good will of individuals the riches of convention disappear the advantages of nature in some considerable measure remain the command over them is complete and absolute we go about asking when assignats will expire and laugh at the last price of them but what signifies the fate of these tickets of despotism the despotism will find despotic means of supply they have found the short cut to the productions of nature while others in pursuit of them are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of artificial society they seize upon the fruit of the labor they seize upon the labourer himself the natural means of france are still great they are very materially lessened i admit but the power over them is increased were france but half what it is in population in compactness in applicability of its force situated as it is and being what it is it would be too strong for most of the states of europe constituted as they are and proceeding as they proceed would it be wise to estimate what the world of europe as well as the world of asia had to dread from jinghiz khan upon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest tartary from whence first issued that scourge of the human race ought we to judge from the excise and stamp duties of the rocks or from the paper circulation of the sands of arabia the power by which mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the world beat one of them totally to the ground broke to pieces the other and in not much longer space of time than i have lived overturned governments laws manners religion and extended an empire from indus to the pyrennees  material resources never have supplied nor ever can supply the want of unity in design and constancy in pursuit but unity in design and perseverance and boldness in pursuit have never wanted resources and never will we have not considered as we ought the dreadful energy of a state in which the property has nothing to do with the government reflect my dear sir reflect again and again on a government in which the property is in subjection and where nothing rules but the minds of desperate men the condition of a commonwealth not governed by its property was a combination of things which the learned and ingenious speculator harrington who has tossed about society into all forms never could imagine to be possible we have seen it the world has felt it and if the world will shut their eyes to this state of things they will feel it more the rulers there have found their resources in crimes the discovery is dreadful the mine exhaustless they have every thing to gain and they have nothing to lose they have a boundless inheritance in hope and there is no medium for them betwixt the highest elevation and death with infamy never can those who from the miserable servitude of the desk have been raised to empire again submit to the bondage of a starving bureau or the profit of copying music or writing plaidoyers by the sheet it has made me often smile in bitterness when i heard talk of an indemnity to such men provided they returned to their allegiance  from all this what is my inference it is that this new system of robbery in france cannot be rendered safe by any art or any means that it must be destroyed or that it will destroy all europe that by some means or other the force opposed to her should be made to bear in a contrary direction some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit she employs  regicide peace  revolution french difference between this revolution and others there have been many internal revolutions in the government of countries both as to persons and forms in which the neighboring states have had little or no concern whatever the government might be with respect to these persons and these forms the stationary interests of the nation concerned have most commonly influenced the new governments in the same manner in which they influenced the old and the revolution turning on matter of local grievance or of local accommodation did not extend beyond its territory  the present revolution in france seems to me to be quite of another character and description and to bear little resemblance or analogy to any of those which have been brought about in europe upon principles merely political it is a revolution of doctrine  theoretic dogma it has a much greater resemblance to those changes which have been made upon religious grounds in which a spirit of proselytism makes an essential part  memorial on the affairs of france in       revolution french france not to be encountered as a state but as a faction my ideas and my principles led me in this contest to encounter france not as a state but as a faction the vast territorial extent of that country its immense population its riches of production its riches of commerce and convention the whole aggregate mass of what in ordinary cases constitutes the force of a state to me were but objects of secondary consideration they might be balanced and they have been often more than balanced great as thse things are they are not what make the faction formidable it is the faction that makes them truly dreadful that faction is the evil spirit that possesses the body of france that informs it as a soul that stamps upon its ambition and upon all its pursuits a characteristic mark which strongly distinguishes them from the same general passions and the same general views in other men and in other communities it is that spirit which inspires into them a new a pernicious a desolating activity constituted as france was ten years ago it was not in that france to shake to shatter and to overwhelm europe in the manner that we behold a sure destruction impends over those infatuated princes who in the conflict with this new and unheard of power proceeds as if they were engaged in a war that bore a resemblance to their former contests or that they can make peace in the spirit of their former arrangements of pacification here the beaten path is the very reverse of the safe road  regicide peace  revolution french the object of the revolution in france had the relation of france to other nations as one of its principal objects the changes made by that revolution were not the better to accommodate her to the old and usual relations but to produce new ones the revolution was made not to make france free but to make her formidable not to make her a neighbor but a mistress not to make her more observant of laws but to put her in a condition to impose them to make france truly formidable it was necessary that france should be new modelled they who have not followed the train of the late proceedings have been led by deceitful representations which deceit made a part in the plan to conceive that this totally new model of a state in which nothing escaped a change was made with a view to its internal relations only  regicide peace  revolution french contrast between the revolution in england in      and that in france      in truth the circumstances of our revolution as it is called and that of france are just the reverse of each other in almost every particular and in the whole spirit of the transaction with us it was the case of a legal monarch attempting arbitrary power  in france it is the case of an arbitrary monarch beginning from whatever cause to legalize his authority the one was to be resisted the other was to be managed and directed but in neither case was the order of the  to be changed lest government might be ruined which ought only to be corrected and legalized with us we got rid of the man and preserved the constituent parts of the state there they get rid of the constituent parts of the state and keep  man what we did was in truth and substance and in a constitutional light a revolution not made but prevented we took solid securities we settled doubtful questions we corrected anomalies in ur law in the stable fundamental parts of our conution we made no revolution no nor any alteration at all we did not impair the monarchy perhaps it might be shown that we strengthened it very considerably the nation kept the same ranks the same orders the same privileges the same franchises the same rules for property the same subordinations the same order in the law in the revenue and in the magistracy the same lords the same commons the same corporations the same electors  the church was not impaired her estates her majesty her splendour her orders and gradations continued the same she was preserved in her full efficiency and cleared only of a certain intolerance which was her weakness and disgrace the church and the state were the same after the revolution that they were before but better secured in every part  was little done because a revolution was not made in the constitution no every thing was done because we commenced with reparation not with ruin accordingly the state flourished instead of lying as dead in a sort of trance or exposed as some others in an epileptic sit to the pity or derision of the world for her wild ridiculous convulsive movements impotent to every purpose but that of dashing out her brains against the pavement great britain rose above the standard even of her former self an era of a more improved domestic prosperity then commenced and still continues not only unimpaired but growing under the wasting hand of time all the energies of the country were awakened england never presented a firmer countenance or a more vigorous arm to all her enemies and to all her rivals europe under her respired and revived every where she appeared as the protector assertor or avenger of liberty a war was made and supported against fortune itself the treaty of ryswick which first limited the power of france was soon after made the grand alliance very shortly followed which shook to the foundations the dreadful power which menaced the independence of mankind the states of europe lay happy under the shade of a great and free monarchy which knew how to be great without endangering its own peace at home or the internal or external peace of any of its neighbors  speech on the army estimates in    0  revolution french partisans of the french system this system the french as it has been first realized dogmatically as well as practically in france makes france the natural head of all factious formed on a similar principle whenever they may prevail as much as athens was the head and settled ally of all democratic factions wherever they existed the other system has no head  this system has very many partisans in every country in europe but particularly in england where they are already formed into a body comprehending most of the dissenters of the three leading denominations to these are readily aggregated all who are dissenters in character temper and disposition though not belonging to any of their congregations  that is all the restless people who resemble them of all ranks and all parties  whigs and even tories  the whole race of half bred speculators  all the atheists deists and socinians  all those who hate the clergy and envy the nobility  a good many among the monied people  the east indians almost to a man who cannot bear to find that their present importance does not bear a proportion to their wealth these latter have united themselves into one great and in my opinion formidable club originally called the bengal club but since opened to persons from the other presidencies for the purpose of consolidating the whole indian interest  which though now quiet may be brought into action with considerable unanimity and force  formerly few except the ambitious great or the desperate and indigent were to be feared as instruments in revolutions what has happened in france teaches us with many other things that there are more causes than have commonly been taken into our consideration by which government may be subverted the monied men merchants principal tradesmen and men of letters hitherto generally thought the peaceable and even timid part of society are the chief actors in the french revolution but the fact is that as money increases and circulates and as the circulation of news in politics and letters becomes more and more diffused the persons who diffuse this money and this intelligence become more and more important this was not long undiscovered views of ambition were in france for the first time presented to these classes of men objects in the state in the army in the system of civil offices of every kind their eyes were dazzled with this new prospect they were as it were electrified and made to lose the natural spirit of their situation a bribe great without example in the history of the world was held out to them  the whole government of a very large kingdom  there are several who are persuaded that the same thing cannot happen in england because here they say the occupations of merchants tradesmen and manufacturers are not held as degrading situations i once thought that the low estimation in which commerce was held in france might be reckoned among the causes of the late revolution and i am still of opinion that the exclusive spirit of the french nobility did irritate the wealthy of other classes but i found long since that persons in trade and business were by no means despised in france in the manner i had been taught to believe as to men of letters they were so far from being despised or neglected that there was no country perhaps in the universe in which they were so highly esteemed courted caressed and even feared tradesmen naturally were not so much sought in society as not furnishing so largely to the fund of conversation as they do to the revenues of the state but the latter description got forward every day m bailly who made himself the popular mayor on the rebellion of the bastile and is a pricipal actor in the revolt before the change possessed a pension or office under the crown of six hundred pound english a year for that country no contemptible provision and this he obtained solely as a man of letters and on no other title as to the monied men  whilst the monarchy continued there is no doubt that merely as such they did not enjoy the privileges of nobility but nobility was of so easy an acquisition that it was the fault or neglect of all of that description who did not obtain its privileges for their lives at least in virtue of office it attached under the royal government to an innumerable multitude of places real and nominal that were vendible and such nobility were as capable of every thing as their degree of influence or interest could make them that is as nobility of no considerable rank or consequence m neckar so far from being a french gentleman was not so much as a frenchman born and yet we all know the rank in which he stood on the day of the meeting of the states  as to the mere matter of estimation of the mercantile or any other class this is regulated by opinion and prejudice in england a security against the envy of men in these classes is not so very complete as we may imagine we must not impose upon ourselves what institutions and manners together had done in france manners alone do here it is the natural operation of things where there exists a crown a court splendid orders of knighthood and an hereditary nobility  where there exists a fixed permanent landed gentry continued in greatness and opulence by the law of primogeniture and by a protection given to family settlements where there exists a standing army and navy  where there exists a church establishment which bestows on learning and parts an interest combined with that of religion and the state  in a country where such things exist wealth new in it is acquisition and precarious in it is duration can never rank first or even near the first though wealth has it is natural weight further than as it is balanced and even preponderated amongst us as amongst other nations by artificial institutions and opinions growing out of them at no period in the history of england have so few peers been taken out of trade or from families newly created by commerce in no period has so small a number of noble families entered into the counting house i can call to mind but one in all england and his is of near fifty years standing be that as it may it appears plain to me from my best observation that envy and ambition may by art management and disposition be as much excited amongst these descriptions of men in england as in any other country and that they are just as capable of acting a part in any great change  memorial on the affairs of france in       revolution policy at the revolution different system pursued for some years past see kings men cabinet double at the revolution the crown deprived for the ends of the revolution itself of many prerogatives was found too weak to struggle against all the difficulties which pressed so new and unsettled a government the court was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of such interest as could support and of such fidelity as would adhere to its establishment such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defense this connection necessary at first continued long after convenient and properly conducted might indeed in all situations be an useful instrument of government at the same time through the intervention of men of popular weight and character the people possessed a security for their just portion of importance in the state but as the title to the crown grew stronger by long possession and by the constant increase of its influence these helps have of late seemed to certain persons no better than encumbrances the powerful managers for government were not sufficiently submissive to the pleasure of the possessors of immediate and personal favor sometimes from a confidence in their own strength natural and acquired sometimes from a fear of offending their friends and weakening that lead in the country which gave them a consideration independent of the court men acted as if the court could receive as well as confer an obligation the influence of government thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties became in many cases an accession rather to the popular than to the royal scale and some part of that influence which would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of mortmain and unalienable domain returned again to the great ocean from whence it arose and circulated among the people this method therefore of governing by men of great natural interest or great acquired consideration was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of absolute monarchy it is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary pleasure and to annihilate all intermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part and total debility on the part of the people  to get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance and to secure to the court the unlimited and uncontrouled use of its own vast influence under the sole direction of its own private favor has for some years past been the great object of policy if this were compassed the influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects which the most sanguine partisans of the court could possibly desire government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the peeple without any attention to the dignity of the greater or to the affections of the lower sorts a new project was therefore devised by a certain set of intriguing men totally different from the system of administration which had prevailed since the accession of the house of brunswick this project i have heard was first conceived by some persons in the court of frederick prince of wales  the earliest attempt in the execution of this design was to set up for minister a person in rank indeed respectable and very ample in fortune but who to the moment of this vast and sudden elevation was little known or considered in the kingdom to him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit submission but whether it was for want of firmness to bear up against the first opposition or that things were not yet fully ripened or that this method was not found the most eligible that idea was soon abandoned the instrumental part of the project was a little altered to accommodate it to the time and to bring things more gradually and more surely to the one great end proposed  the first part of the reformed plan was to draw a line which should separate the court from the ministry hitherto these names had been looked upon as synonymous but for the future court and administration were to be considered as things totally distinct by this operation two systems of administration were to be formed one which should be in the real secret and confidence the other merely ostensible to perform the official and executory duties of government the latter were alone to be responsible whilst the real advisers who enjoyed all the power were effectually removed from all the danger  secondly a party under these leaders was to be formed in favor of the court against the ministry this party was to have a large share in the emoluments of government and to hold it totally separate from and independent of ostensible administration  the third point and that on which the success of the whole scheme ultimately depended was to bring parliament to an acquiescence in this project parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the persons rank influence abilities connexions and character of the ministers of the crown by means of a discipline on which i shall say more hereafter that body was to be habituated to the most opposite interests and the most discordant politics all connexions and dependencies among subjects were to be entirely dissolved as hitherto business had gone through the hands of leaders of whigs or tories men of talents to conciliate the people and engage to their confidence now the method was to be altered and the lead was to be given to men of no sort of consideration or credit in the country this want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated power members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility to pride as well as to duty those high and haughty sentiments which are the great support of independence were to be let down gradually point of honor and precedence were no more to be regarded in parliamentary decorum than in a turkish army it was to be avowed as a constitutional maxim that the king might appoint one of his footmen or one of your footmen for minister and that he ought to be and that he would be as well followed as the first name for rank or wisdom in the nation thus parliament was to look on as if perfectly unconcerned while a cabal of the closet and backstairs was substituted in the place of a national administration  with such a degree of acquiescence any measure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly secure the capital objects and by much the most flattering characteristics of arbitrary power would be obtained every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the personal favor and inclination of the prince this favor would be the sole introduction to power and the only tenure by which it was to be held so that no person looking toward another and all looking toward the court it was impossible but that the motive which solely influenced every mans hopes must come in time to govern every mans conduct till at last the servility became universal in spite of the dead letter of any laws or institutions whatsoever  how it should happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon such a project of government may at first view appear surprising but the fact is that opportunities very inviting to such an attempt have offered and the scheme itself was not desute of some arguments not wholly unplausible to recommend it  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  revolution jacobin in all that we do whether in the struggle or after it it is necessary that we should constantly have in our eye the nature and character of the enemy we have to contend

they then to supply their innumerable defects and to make them terrible even to the firmest minds one thing and one thing only  but that one thing is worth a thousand  they have energy in france all things being put into an universal ferment in the decomposition of society no man comes forward but by his spirit of enterprise and the vigor of his mind if we meet this dreadful and potentous energy restrained by no consideration of god or man that is always vigilant always on the attack that allows itself no repose and suffers none to rest an hour with impunity if we meet this energy with poor common place proceeding with trivial maxims paltry old saws with doubts fears and suspicions with a languid uncertain hesitation with a formal official spirit which is turned aside by every obstacle from it is purpose and which never sees a difficulty but to yield to it or at best to evade it down we go to the bottom of the abyss  and nothing short of omnipotence can save us we must meet a vicious and distempered energy with a manly and rational vigour as virtue is limited in its resources  we are doubly bound to use all that in the circle drawn about us by our morals we are able to command  memorial on the affairs of france in       republic french impracticability of resistance to it it is true amidst all these turbulent means of security to their system very great discontents every where prevail but they only produce misery to those who nurse them at home or exile beggary and in the end confiscation to those who are so impatient as to remove from them each municipal republic has a committee or something in the nature of a committee of research in these petty republics the tyranny is so near it is object that it becomes instantly acquainted with every act of every man it stifles conspiracy in its very first movements their power is absolute and uncontrollable no stand can be made against it these republics are besides so disconnected that very little intelligence of what happens in them is to be obtained beyond their own bounds except by the means of their clubs who keep up a constant correspondence and who give what color they please to such facts as they choose to communicate out of the track of their correspondence they all have some sort of communication just as much or as little as they please with the center by this confinement of all communication to the ruling faction any combination grounded on the abuses and discontents in one scarcely can reach the other there is not one man in any one place to head them the old government had so much abstracted the nobility from the cultivation of provincial interest that no man in france exists whose power credit or consequence extends to two districts or who is capable of uniting them in any design even if any man could assemble ten men together without being sure of a speedy lodging in a prison one must not judge of the state of france by what has been observed elsewhere it does not in the least resemble any other country analogical reasoning from history or from recent experience in other places is wholly delusive  ibid  republics ancient the old republican legislators followed with a solicitous accuracy the moral conditions and properties of men the legislators who framed the ancient republics knew that their business was too arduous to be accomplished with no better apparatus than the metaphysics of an undergraduate and the mathematics and arithmetic of an exciseman they had to do with men and they were obliged to study human nature they had to do with citizens and they were obliged to study the effects of those habits which are communicated by the circumstances of civil life they were sensible that the operation of this second nature on the first produced a new combination and thence arose many diversities amongst men according to their birth their education their professions the periods of their lives their residence in towns or in the country their several ways of acquiring and of fixing property and according to the quality of the property itself all which rendered them as it were so many different species of animals from hence they thought themselves obliged to dispose their citizens into such classes and to place them in such situations in the state as their peculiar habits might qualify them to fill and to allot to them such appropriated privileges as might secure to them what their specific occasions required and which might furnish to each description such force as might protect it in the conflict caused by the diversity of interests that must exist and must contend in all complex society for the legislator would have been ashamed that the coarse husbandman should well know how to assort and to use his sheep horses and oxen and should have enough of common sense not to abstract and equalize them all into animals without providing for each kind an appropriate food care and employment whilst he the oeconomist disposer and shepherd of his own kindred subliming himself into an airy metaphysician was resolved to know nothing of his flocks but as men in general it is for this reason that montesquien observed very justly that in their classification of the citizens the great legislators of antiquity made the greatest display of their powers and even soared above themselves it is here that your modern legislators have gone deep into the negative series and sunk even below their own nothing as the first sort of legislators attended to the different kinds of citizens and combined them into one commonwealth the others the metaphysical and alchemistical legislators french have taken the direct contrary course they have attempted to confound all sorts of citizens as well as they could into one homogeneous mass and then they divided the their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics they reduce men to loose counters merely for the sake of simple telling and not to figures whose power is to arise from their place in the table the elements of their own metaphysics might have taught them better lessons the troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there was something else in the intellectual world besides substance and quantity they might learn from the catechism of metaphysics that there were eight heads more qualitas relatio actio passio ubi quando situs habitus  in every complex deliberation which they have never thought of though these of all the  are the subject on which the skill of man can operate any thing at all  so far from this able disposition of some of the old republican legislators which follows with a solicitous accuracy the moral conditions and propensities of men they have levelled and crushed together all the orders which they found even under the coarse unartificial arrangement of the monarchy in which mode of government the classing of the citizens is not of so much importance as in a republic it is true however that every such classification if properly ordered is good in all forms of government and composes a strong barrier against the excesses of despotism as well as it is the necessary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic for want of something of this kind if the present project of a republic should fail all securities to a moderated freedom fail along with it all the indirect restraints which mitigate despotism are removed insomuch that if monarchy should ever again obtain an entire ascendancy in france under this or under any other dynasty it will probably be if not voluntarily tempered at letting out by the wise and virtuous counsels of the prince the most completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth this is to play a most desperate game  the confusion which attends on all such proceedings they even declare to be one of their objects and they hope to secure their constitution by a terror of a return of those evils which attended their making it by this say they its destruction will become difficult to authority which cannot break it up without the entire disorganization of the whole state they presume that if this authority should ever come to the same degree of power that they have acquired it would make a more moderate and chastised use of it and would piously tremble entirely to disorganize the state in the savage manner that they have done they expect from the virtues of returning despotism the security which is to be enjoyed by the offspring of their popular vices  reflections on the revolution in france  rome and athens analogy between rome has a more venerable aspect than athens and she conducted her affairs so far as related to the ruin and oppression of the greatest part of the world with greater wisdom and more uniformity but the domestic economy of these two states was nearly or altogether the same an internal dissension constantly tore to pieces the bowels of the roman commonwealth you find the same confusion the same factions which subsisted at athens the same tumults the same revolutions and in fine the same slavery if perhaps their former condition did not deserve that name altogether as well all other republics were of the same character florence was a transcript of athens and the modern republics as they approach more or less to the democratic form partake more or less of the nature of those which i have described  vindication of natural society  rome church of if mere dissent from the church of rome be a merit he that dissents the most perfectly is the most meritorious in many points we hold strongly with that church he that dissents throughout with that church rome will dissent with the church of england and then it will be a part of his merit that he dissents with ourselves  a whimsical species of merit for any set of men to establish we quarrel to extremity with those who we know agree with us in many things but we are to be so malicious even in the principle of our friendships that we are to cherish in our bosom those who accord with us in nothing because whilst they despise ourselves they abhor even more than we do those with whom we have some disagreement  letter to sir h langrishe m p  rigor extreme an extreme rigor is sure to arm every thing against it and at length to relax into a supine neglect  oecon reform  reform timely reform recommended see grievances instead of a public officer in an abusive department whose province is an object to be regulated he becomes a criminal who is to be punished i do most seriously put it to administration to consider the wisdom of a timely reform early reformations are amicable arrangements with a friend in power late reformations are terms imposed upon a conquered enemy early reformations are made in cool blood late reformations are made under a state of inflammation in that state of things the people behold in government nothing that is respectable they see the abuse and they will see nothing else  they fall into the temper of a furious populace provoked at the disorder of a house of ill fame they never attempt to correct or regulate they go to work by the shortest way  they abate the nuisance they pull down the house  this is my opinion with regard to the true interest of government but as it is the interest of government that reformation should be early it is the interest of the people that it should be temperate it is their interest because a temperate reform is permanent and because it has a principle of growth whenever we improve it is right to leave room for a further improvement it is right to consider to look about us to examine the effect of what we have done  then we can proceed with confidence because we can proceed with intelligence whereas in hot reformations in what men more zealous than considerate call making clear work the whole is generally so crude so harsh so indigested mixed with so much imprudence and so much injustice so contrary to the whole course of human nature and human institutions that the very people who are most eager for it are among the first to grow disgusted at what they have done then some part of the abdicated grievance is recalled from its exile in order to become a corrective of the correction then the abuse assumes all the credit and popularity of a reform the very idea of purity and disinterestedness in politics falls into disrepute and is considered as a vision of hot and inexperienced men and thus disorders become incurable not by the virulence of their own quality but by the unapt and violent nature of the remedies a great part therefore of my idea of reform is meant to operate gradually some benefits will come at a nearer some at a more remote period we must no more make haste to be rich by parsimony than by intemperate acquisition  oecon reform  reform to innovate is not to reform reform is not a change in the substance or in the primary modification of the object but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance complained of so far as that is removed all is sure it stops there and if it fails the substance which underwent the operation at the very worst is but where it was  all this in effect i think but am not sure i have said elsewhere it cannot at this time be too often repeated line upon line precept upon precept until it comes into the currency of a proverb to innovate is not to reform  the french revolutionists complained of every thing they refused to reform any thing and they left nothing no nothing at all unchanged the consequences are before us  not in remote history not in future prognostication they are about us they are upon us they shake the public security they menace private enjoyment they dwarf the growth of the young they break the quiet of the old if we travel they stop our way they infest us in town they pursue us to the country our business is interrupted our repose is troubled our pleasures are saddened our very

jacobinized    0 her hostility was at a good distance we had a limb cut off but we reserved the body we lost our colonies but we kept our constitution there was indeed much intestine heat there was a dreadful fermentation wild and savage insurrection quitted the woods and prowled about our streets in the name of reform such was the distemper of the public mind that there was no madman in his maddest ideas and maddest projects that might not count upon numbers to support his principles and execute his designs  many of the changes by a great misnomer called parliamentary reforms went not in the intention of all the professors and supporters of them undoubtedly but went in their certain and in my opinion not very remote effect home to the utter destruction of the constitution of this

has his separate exception some pluck out the black hairs some the gray one point must be given up to one another point must be yielded to another nothing is suffered to prevail upon its own principles the whole is so frittered down and disjointed that scarcely a trace of the original scheme remains thus between the resistance of power and the unsystematical process of popularity the undertaker and the undertaking are both exposed and the poor reformer is hissed off the stage both by friends and foes  oecon reform  reformation a spirit of reformation is never more consistent with itself than when it refuses to be rendered the means of destruction  appeal from the new to the old whigs  reformation its effects see revolution french religion politics new system the last revolution of doctrine and theory which has happened in europe is the reformation it is not for my purpose to take any notice here of the merits of that revolution but to state one only of it is effects  that effect was to introduce other interests into all countries than those which arose from their locality and natural circumstances the principle of the reformation was such as by it is essence could not be local or confined to the country in which it had it is origin for instance the doctrine of justification by faith or by works which was the original basis of the reformation could not have one of it is alternatives true as to germany and false as to every other country neither are questions of true and theoretic falsehood governed by circumstances any more than by places on that occasion therefore the spirit of proselytism expanded itself with great elasticity upon all sides and great divisions were every where the result  these divisions however in appearance merely dogmatic soon became mixed with political and their effects were rendered much more intense from this combination europe was for a long time divided into two great factions under the name of catholic and protestant which not only often alienated state from state but also divided almost every state within itself the warm parties in each state were more affectionately attached to those of their own doctrinal interest in some other country than to their fellowcitizens or to their natural government when they or either of them happened to be of a different persuasion these factions whenever they prevailed if they did not absolutely destroy at least weakened and distracted the locality of patriotism the public affections came to have other motives and other ties  although the principles to which it gave rise did not operate with a perfect regularity and constancy they never wholly ceased to operate few wars were made and few treaties were entered into in which they did not come in for some part they gave a color a character and direction to all the politics of europe  memorial on the affairs of france in       reason and authority to reason is not to revolt against authority reason and authority do not move in the same parallel that reason is an amicus curioe who speaks de plano not pro tribunali who makes an useful suggestion to the court without questioning its jurisdiction  whilst he acknowledges its competence he promotes its efficiency  regicide peace  representation virtual see irish catholics virtual representation is that in which there is a communion of interests and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act though the trustees are not actually chosen by them this is virtual representation such a representation i think to be in many cases even better than the actual it possesses most of its advantages and is free from many of its inconveniences it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first line of direction the people may err in their choice but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken but this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence if it has not a substratum in the actual the member must have some relation to the constituent  letter to sir h langrishe m p  representative his duty in my opinion it is our duty when we have the desires of the people before us to pursue them not in the spirit of literal obedience which may militate with their very principle much less to treat them with a peevish and contentious litigation as if we were adverse parties in a suit it would sir be most dishonorable for a faithful representative of the commons to take advantage of any inartificial expression of the peoples wishes in order to frustrate their attainment of what they have an undoubted right to expect we are under infinite obligations to our constituents who have raised us to so distinguished a trust and have imparted such a degree of sanctity to common characters we ought to walk before them with purity plainness and integrity of heart with filial love and not with slavish fear which is always a low and tricking thing  ibid  rest and labor providence has so ordered it that a state of rest and inaction however it may flatter our indolence should be productive of many inconveniences that it should generate such disorders as may force us to have recourse to some labor as a thing absolutely requisite to make us pass our lives with tolerable satisfaction for the nature of rest is to suffer all the parts of our bodies to fall into a relaxation that not only disables the members from performing their functions but takes away the vigorous tone of fiber which is requisite for carrying on the natural and necessary secretions at the same time that in this languid inactive state the nerves are more liable to the most horrid convulsions than when they are sufficiently braced and strengthened melancholy dejection despair and often selfmurder is the consequence of the gloomy view we take of things in this relaxed state of body the best remedy for all these evils is exercise or labor and labor is a surmounting of difficulties an exertion of the contracting power of the muscles and as such resembles pain which consists in tension or contraction in every thing but degree labor is not only requisite to preserve the coarser organs in a state fit for their functions but it is equally necessary to these finer and more delicate organs on which and by which the imagination and perhaps the other mental powers act since it is probable that not only the inferior parts of the soul as the passions are called but the understanding itself makes use of some fine corporeal instruments in it is operation though what they are and where they are may be somewhat hard to settle but that it does make use of such appears from hence that a long exercise of the mental powers induces a remarkable lassitude of the whole body and on the other hand that great bodily labor or pain weakens and sometimes actually destroys the mental faculties now as a due exercise is essential to the coarse muscular parts of the constitution and that without this rousing they would become languid and diseased the very same rule holds with regard to those finer parts we have mentioned to have them in proper order they must be shaken and worked to a proper degree  sublime and beautiful  royalists french see nobility when i speak of royalists i wish to be understood of those who were always such from principle every arm lifted up for royalty from the beginning was the arm of a man so principled i do not think there are ten exceptions  the principled royalists are certainly not of force to effect these objects by themselves if they were the operations of the present great combination would be wholly unnecessary what i contend for is that they should be consulted with treated with and employed and that no foreigners whatsoever are either in interest so engaged or in judgment and local knowledge so competent to answer all these purposes as the natural proprietors of the country  their number for an exiled party is also considerable almost the whole body of the landed proprietors of france ecclesiastical and civil have been steadily devoted to the monarchy this body does not amount to less than seventy thousand  a very great number in the composition of the respectable classes in any society i am sure that if half that number of the same description were taken out of this country it would leave hardly any thing that i should call the people of england on the faith of the emperor and the king of prussia a body of ten thousand nobility on horseback with the kings two brothers at their head served with the king of prussia in the campaign of      and equipped themselves with the last shilling of their ruined fortunes and exhausted credit before the revolution the french noblesse were so reduced in numbers that they did not much exceed twenty thousand at least of full grown men as they have been very cruelly formed into entire corpse of soldiers it is estimated that by the sword and distempers in the field they have not lost less than five thousand men and if this course is pursued it is to be feared that the whole body of the french nobility may be extinguished several hundreds have also perished by famine and various accidents  it is not now the question how that great force came to be rendered useless and totally dissipated i state it now only to remark that a great part of the same force exists and would act if it were enabled i am sure every thing has shown us that in this war with france one frenchman is worth twenty foreigners la vendee is a proof of this  memorial on the affairs

description of both the rich in all societies may be thrown into two classes the first is of those who are powerful as well as rich and conduct the operations of the vast political machine the other is of those who employ their riches wholly in the acquisition of pleasure as to the first sort their continual care and anxiety their toilsome days and sleepless nights are next to proverbial these circumstances are sufficient almost to level their condition to that of the unhappy majority but there are other circumstances which place them in a far lower condition not only their understandings labor continually which is the severest labor but their hearts are torn by the worst most troublesome and insatiable of all passions by avarice by ambition by fear and jealousy no part of the mind has rest power gradually extirpates from the mind every humane and gentle virtue pity benevolence friendship are things almost unknown in high stations veroe amicitioe rarissime inveniuntur in iis qui i honoribus reque publica versantur says cicero and indeed courts are the schools where cruelty pride dissimulation and treachery are studied and taught in the most vicious perfection this is a point so clear and acknowledged that if it did not make a necessary part of my subject i should pass it by entirely and this has hindered me from drawing at full length and in the most striking colors this shocking picture of the degeneracy and wretchedness of human nature in that part which is vulgarly thought its happiest and most amiable state  you know from what originals i could copy such pictures happy are they who know enough of them to know the little value of the possessors of such things and of all that they possess and happy they who have been snatched from that post of danger which they occupy with the remains of their virtue loss of honors wealth titles and even the loss of ones country is nothing in balance with so great an advantage  let us now view the other species of the rich those who devote their time and fortunes to idleness and pleasure how much happier are they the pleasures which are agreeable to nature are within the reach of all and therefore can form no distinction in favor of the rich the pleasures which art forces up are seldom sincere and never satisfying what is worse this constant application to pleasure takes away from the enjoyment or rather turns it into the nature of a very burdensome and laborious business it has consequences much more fatal it produces a weak valetudinary state of body attended by all those horrid disorders and yet more horrid methods of cure which are the result of luxury on one hand and the weak and ridiculous efforts of human art on the other the pleasures of such men are scarcely felt as pleasures at the same time that they bring on pains and diseases which are felt but too severely the mind has its share of the misfortune it grows lazy and enervate unwilling and unable to search for truth and utterly incapable of knowing much less of relishing real happiness the poor by their excessive labor and the rich by their enormous luxury are set upon a level and rendered equally ignorant of any knowledge which might conduce to their happiness a dismal view of the interior of all civil society the lower part broken and ground down by the most cruel oppression and the rich by their artificial method of life bringing worse evils on themselves than their tyranny could possibly inflict on those below them very different is the prospect of the natural state here there are no wants which nature gives and in this state men can be sensible of no other wants which are not to be supplied by a very moderate degree of labor therefore there is no slavery neither is there any luxury because no single man can supply the materials of it life is simple and therefore it is happy  vindication of natural society  religion consolution in religion the english people are satisfied that to the great the consolations of religion are as necessary as its instructions they too are among the unhappy they feel personal pain and domestic sorrow in these they have no privilege but are subject to pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mortality they want this sovereign balm under their gnawing cares and anxieties which being less conversant about the limited wants of animal life range without limit and are diversified by infinite combinations in the wild and unbounded regions of imagination some charitable dole is wanting to these our often very unhappy brethren to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear something to relieve in the killing languor and overlaboured lassitude of those who have nothing to do something to excite an appetite to existence in the plled satiety which attends on all pleasures which may be bought where nature is not left to her own process where even desire is anticipated and therefore fruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight and no interval no obstacle is interposed between the wish and the accomplishment  reflections on the revolution in france  religion see atheism religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm when any thing concerning it becomes an object of much meditation it cannot be indifferent to the mind they who do not love religion hate it the rebels to god perfectly abhor the author of their being they hate him with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul and with all their strength he never presents himself to their thoughts but to menace and alarm them they cannot strike the sun out of heaven but they are able to raise as mouldering smoke that obscures him from their own eyes not being able to revenge

others the most liable to be subverted by military sedition by court conspiracies and sometimes by headlong rebellious people such as the turbinating movement of pugatchef it is not quite so probable that in any of these changes the spirit of system may mingle in the manner it has done in france the muscovites are no great speculators but i should not much rely on their uninquisitive disposition

rights natural and chartered the rights of men that is to say the natural rights of mankind are indeed sacred things and if any public measure is proved mischievously to affct them the objection ought to be fatal to that measure even if no charter at all could be set up against it if these natural rights are further affirmed and declared by express covenants if they are clearly defined and secured against chicane against power and authority by written instruments and positive engagements they are still in a better condition they partake not only of the sanctity of the object so secured but of that solemn public faith itself which secures an object of such importance indeed this formal recognition by the sovereign power of an original right in the subject can never be subverted but by rooting up the holding radical principles of government and even of society itself the charters which we call by distinction great are public instruments of this nature i mean the charters of king john and king henry the third the things secured by these instruments may without any deceitful ambiguity be very fitly called the chartered rights of men  these charters have made the very name of a charter dear to the heart of every englishman but sir there may be and there are charters not only different in nature but formed on principles the very reverse of those of the great charter of this kind is the charter of the east india company magna charta is a charter to restrain power and to destroy monopoly the east india charter is a charter to establish monopoly and to create power political power and commercial monopoly are not the rights of men and the rights to them derived from charters it is fallacious and sophistical to call  the chartered rights of men these chartered rights to speak of such charters and of their effects in terms of the greatest possible moderation do at least suspend the natural rights of mankind at large and in their very frame and constitution are liable to fall into a direct violation of them  speech on mr foxs east india bill  rights of man they the french made and recorded a sort of institute and digest of anarchy called the rights of man in such a pedantic abuse of elementary principles as would have disgraced boys at school but this declaration of rights was worse than trifling and pedantic in them as by their name and authority they systematically destroyed every hold of authority by opinion religious or civil on the minds of the people by this mad declaration they subverted the state and brought on such calamities as no country without a long war has ever been known to suffer  speeeh on the army estimates  rights of man french compared to a portentous comet astronomers have supposed that if a certain comet whose path intersected the ecliptic had met the earth in some i forget what sign it would have whirled us along with it in its eccentric course into god knows what regions of heat and cold had the portentous

of man real far am i from denying in theory full as far is my heart from withholding in practice if i were of power to give or to withhold the real rights of men in denying their false claims of right i do not mean to injure those which are real and are such as their pretended rights would totally destroy if civil society be made for the advantage of man all the advantages for which it is made become his right it is an institution of beneficence and law itself is only beneficence acting by a rule men have a right to live by that rule they have a right to justice as between their fellows whether their fellows are in politic function or in ordinary occupation they have a right to the fruits of their industry and to the means of making their industry fruitful they have a right to the acquisitions of their parents to the nourishment and improvement of their offspring to instruction in life and to consolation in death whatever each man can separately do without trespassing upon

amongst the direct original rights of man in civil society for i have in my contemplation the civil social man and no other it is a thing to be settled by convention  reflections on the revolution in france  rights of man the object of the political dogma which upon the new french system is to unite the factions of different nations turns on this that the majority told by the head of the taxable people in every country is the perpetual natural unceasing indefeasible sovereign that this majority is perfectly master of the form as well as the administration of the state and that the magistrates under whatever names they are called are only functionaries to obey the orders general as laws or particular as decrees which that majority may make that this is the only natural government that all others are tyranny and usurpation  in order to reduce this dogma into practice the republicans in france and their associates in other countries make it always their business and often their public profession to destroy all traces of ancient establishments and to form a new commonwealth in each country upon the basis of the french rights of men on the principle of these rights they mean to institute in every country and as it were the germ of the whole parochial governments for the purpose of what they call equal representation from them is to grow by some media a general council and representative of all the parochial governments in that representative is to be vested the whole national power totally abolishing hereditary name and office levelling all conditions of men except where money must make a difference breaking all connection between territory and dignity and abolishing every species of nobility gentry and church establishments all their priests and all their magistrates being only creatures of election and pensioners at will  knowing how opposite a permanent landed interest is to that scheme they have resolved and it is the great drift of all their regulations to reduce that description of men to a mere peasantry for the sustenance of the towns and to place the true effective government in cities among the tradesmen bankers and voluntary clubs of bold presuming young persons  advocates attorneys notaries managers of newspapers and those cabals of literary men called academies their republic is to have a first functionary as they call him under the name of king or not as they think fit this officer when such an officer is permitted is however neither in fact nor name to be considered as sovereign nor the people as his subjects the very use of these appellations is offensive to their ears  memorial on the affairs of france in       rights of man her france good and ill dispositions are shown by the same means to communicate peaceably the rights of men is the true mode of her showing her friendship to force sovereigns to submit to those rights is her mode of hostility so that either as friend or foe her whole scheme has been and is to throw the empire germany into confusion  ibid  rights of man this doctrine has pervaded germany in short the germanic body is a vast mass of heterogeneous states held together by that heterogeneous body of old principles which formed the public law positive and doctrinal the modern laws and liberties which the new power in france proposes to introduce into germany and to support with all its force of intrigue and of arms is of a very different nature utterly irreconcilable with the first and indeed fundamentally the reverse of it i mean the rights and liberties of the man the droit de l homme that this doctrine has made an amazing progress in germany there cannot be a shadow of doubt they are infected by it along the whole course of the rhine the maese the moselle and in the greater part of suabia and franconia it is particularly prevalent amongst all the lower people churchmen and laity in the dominions of the ecclesiastical electors it is not easy to find or to conceive governments more mild and indulgent than these church sovereignties but good government is as nothing when the rights of man take possession of the mind indeed the loose rein held over the people in these provinces must be considered as one cause of the facility with which they lend themselves to any schemes of innovation by inducing them to think lightly of their governments and to judge of grievances not by feeling but by imagination  ibid  rights of men the rights of men in governments are their advantages and these are often in balances between the differences of good in compromises sometimes between good and evil  reflections on the revolution in france  rights of men the moment you abate any thing from the full rights of men each to govern himself and suffer any artificial positive limitation upon those rights from that moment the whole organization of government becomes a consideration of convenience this it is which makes the constitution of a state and the due distribution of its powers a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill it requires a deep knowledge of human nature and human necessities and of the things which facilitate or obstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions the state is to have recruits to its strength and remedies to its distempers what is the use of discussing a mans abstract right to food or to medicine the question is upon the method of procuring and administering them in that deliberation i shall always advise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician rather than the professor of metaphysics  ibid  rights of men men have no right to what is not reasonable men have no right to what is not reasonable and to what is not for their benefit for though a pleasant writer said liceat perire poetis when one of them in cold blood is said to have leaped into the flames of a volcanic revolution ardentem frigidus aetnam insiluit i consider such a frolic rather as an unjustifiable poetic license than as one of the franchises of parnassus and whether he was poet or divine or politician that chose to exercise this kind of right i think that more wise because more charitable thoughts would urge me rather to save the man than to preserve his brazen slippers as the monuments of his folly  ibid  rights of man the peasants in all probability are the descendants of these ancient proprietors romans or gauls but if they fail in any degree in the titles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and lawyers they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men there they find that men are equal and the earth the kind and equal mother of all ought not to be monopolized to foster the pride and luxury of any men who by nature are no better than themselves and who if they do not labor for their bread are worse they find that by the laws of nature the occupant and subduer of the soil is the true proprietor that there is no prescription against nature and that the agreements where any there are which have been made with their landlords during the time of slavery are only the effect of duresse and force and that when the people reentered into the rights of men those agreements were made as void as every thing else which had been settled under the prevalence of the old feudal and aristocratic tyranny they will tell you that they see no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet if you ground the title to rents on succession and prescription they tell you from the speech of mr camus published by the national assembly for their information that things ill begun cannot avail themselves of prescription that the title of these lords was vicious in its origin and that force is at least as bad as fraud as to the title by succession they will tell you that the succession of those who have cultivated the soil is the true pedigree of property and not rotten parchments and silly substitutions that the lords have enjoyed their usurpation too long and that if they allow to these lay monks any charitable pension they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor who is so generous toward a false claimant to his goods  when the peasants give you back that coin of sophistic reason on which you have set your image and superscription you cry it down as base money and tell them you will pay for the future with french guards and dragoons and hussars you hold up to chastise them the secondhand authority of a king who is only the instrument of destroying without any power of protecting either the people or his own person through him it seems you will make yourselves obeyed they answer you have taught us that there are no gentlemen and which of your principles teach us to bow to kings whom we have not elected we know without your teaching that lands were given for the support of feudal dignities feudal titles and feudal offices when you took down the cause as a grievance why should the more grievous effect remain as there are now no hereditary honors and no distinguished families why are we taxed to maintain what you tell us ought not to exist you have sent down our old aristocratic landlords in no other character and with no other title but that of exactors under your authority have you endeavored to make these your rentgatherers respectable to us no you have sent them to us with their arms reversed their shields broken their impresses defaced and so displumed degraded and metamorphosed such unfeathered twolegged things that we no longer know them they are strangers to us they do not even go by the names of our ancient lords physically they may be the same men though we are not quite sure of that on your new philosophic doctrines of personal identity in all other respects they are totally changed we do not see why we have not as good a right to refuse them their rents as you have to abrogate all their honors titles and distinctions this we have never commissioned you to do and it is one instance among many indeed of your assumption of undelegated power we see the burghers of paris through their clubs their mobs and their national guards directing you at their pleasure and giving that as law to you which under your authority is transmitted as law to us through you these burghers dispose of the lives and fortunes of us all why should not you attend us as much to the desires of the laborious husbandman with regard to our rent by which we are affected in the most serious manner as you do to the demands of these insolent burghers relative to distinctions and titles of honor by which neither they nor we are affected at all but we find you pay more regard to their fancies than to our necessities is it among the rights of man to pay tribute to his equals before this measure of yours we might have thought we were not perfectly equal we might have entertained some old habitual unmeaning prepossession in favor of those landlords but we cannot conceive with what other view than that of destroying all respect to them you could have made the law that degrades them you have forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of respect and now you send troops to sabre and to bayonet us into a submission to fear and force which you did not suffer us to yield to the mild authority of opinion  the ground of some of these arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all rational ears but to the politicians of metaphysics who have opened schools for sophistry and made establishments for anarchy it is solid and conclusive it is obvious that on a mere consideration of the right the leaders in the assembly would not in the least have scrupled to abrogate the rents along with the titles and family ensigns it would be only to follow up the principle of their reasonings and to complete the analogy of their conduct but they had newly possessed themselves of a great body of landed property by confiscation they had this commodity at market and the market would have been wholly destroyed if they were to permit the husbandman to riot in the speculations with which they so freely intoxicated themselves the only security which property enjoys in any one of its descriptions is from the interests of their rapacity with regard to some other they have left nothing but their own arbitrary pleasure to determine what property is to be protected and what subverted  reflections on the revolution in france  rights metaphysic these metaphysic rights entering into common life like rays of light which pierce into a dense medium are by the laws of nature refracted from their straight line indeed in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns the primitive rights of men undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction the nature of man is intricate the objects of society are of the greatest possible complexity and therefore no simple disposition or direction of power can be suitable either to mans nature or to the quality of his affairs when i hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed at and boasted of in any new political constitutions i am at no loss to decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their trade or totally negligent of their duty the simple governments are fundamentally defective to say no worse of them if you were to comtemplate society in but one point of view all these simple modes of polity are infinitely captivating in effect each would answer its single end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain all its complex purposes but it is better that the whole should be imperfectly and anomalously answered than that while some parts are provided for with great exactness others might be totally neglected or perhaps materially injured by the overcare of a favorite member  ibid  rights petition and declaration of in the famous law of the  d of charles i called the petition of rights the parliament says to the king your subjects have inherited this freedom claiming their franchises not on abstract principles as the rights of men but as the rights of englishmen and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers seldom and the other profoundly learned men who drew this petition of right were as well acquainted at least with all the general theories concerning the rights of men as any of the discoursers in our pulpits or on your tribune full as well as dr price or as the abbe sieyes but for reasons worthy of that practical wisdom which superseded their theoretic science they preferred this positive recorded hereditary title to all which can be dear to the man and the citizen to that vague speculative right which exposed their sure inheritance to be scrambled for and torn to pieces by every wild litigious spirit  the same policy pervades all the laws which have since been made for the preservation of our liberties in the  st of william and mary in the famous statute called the declaration of right the two houses utter not a syllable of a right to frame a government for themselves you will see that their whole care was to secure the religion laws and liberties that had been long possessed and had been lately endangered taking   w and m into their most serious consideration the best means for making such an establishment that their religion laws and liberties might not be in danger of being again subverted they auspicate all their proceedings by stating as some of those best means in the first place to do as their ancestors in like cases have usually done for vindicating their ancient rights and liberties to declare  and then they pray the king and queen that it may be declared and enacted that all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and declared are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom  you will observe that from magna charta to the declaration of right it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers and to be transmitted to our posterity  ibid  regicide peace if the general disposition of the people be as i hear it is for an immediate peace with regicide without so much as considering our public and solemn engagements to the parties or any inquiry into the terms it is all over with us it is strange but it may be true that as the danger from advances to jacobinism is increased in my eyes and in yours the fear of it is lessened in theirs it seems they act under the impression of other sort of terrors which frighten them out of their first apprehensions but it is fit they should recollect that they who would make peace without a previous knowledge of the terms make a surrender they are conquered they do not treat they receive the law then the people of england are contented to seek in the kindness of a foreign systematic enemy combined with a dangerous faction at home a security which they cannot find in their own patriotism and their own courage they are willing to trust to the sympathy of regicides the guarantee of the british monarchy they are content to rest their religion on the piety of atheists by establishment they are satisfied to seek in the clemency of practiced murderers the security of their lives they are pleased to confide their property to the safeguard of those who are robbers by inclination interest habit and system if this be our deliberate mind truly we deserve to lose what we cannot long retain the name of a nation  regicide peace  regicide peace with a regicide peace the king cannot long have a minister to serve him nor the minister a king to serve if the great disposer in reward of the royal and private virtues of our sovereign should call him from the calamitous spectacle which will attend a state of amity with regicide his successor will surely see them unless the same providence greatly anticipates the course of nature thinking thus and not as i conceive on light grounds i dare not flatter the reigning sovereign nor any minister he has or can have nor his successor apparent nor any of those who may be called to serve him with what appears to me a false state of their situation we cannot have them and that peace together  ibid  regicide and rebels french see history indemnity and punishment f these princes had shown a tyrannic disposition it would be much to be lamented we have no others to govern france if we sereened the body of murderers from their justice we should only leave the innocent in future to the mercy of men of fierce and sanguinary dispositions of which in spite of all our intermeddling in their constitution we could not prevent the effects but as we have much more reason to fear their seeble lenity than any blameable rigor we ought in my opinion to leave the matter to themselves  if however i were asked to give an advice merely as such  here are my ideas i am not for a total indemnity nor a general punishment and first the body and mass of the people never ought to be treated as criminal they may become an object of more or less constant watchfulness and suspicion as their preservation may best require but they can never become an object of punishment this is one of the few fundamental and unalterable principles of politics  to punish them capitally would be to make massacres massacres only increase the ferocity of men and teach them to regard their own lives and those of others as of little value whereas the great policy of government is to teach the people to think both of great importance in the eyes of god and the state and never to be sacrificed or even hazarded to gratify their passions or for any thing but the duties prescribed by the rules of morality and under the direction of public law and public authority to punish them with lesser penalties would be to debilitate the commonwealth and make the nation miserable which it is the business of government to render happy and flourishing  as to crimes too i would draw a strong line of limitation for no one offense politically an offense of rebellion by council contrivance persuasion or compulsion for none properly a military offense of rebellion or any thing done by open hostility in the field should any man at all be called in question because such seems to be the proper and natural death of civil dissentions the offenses of war are obliterated by peace  another class will of course be included in the indemnity namely all those who by their activity in restoring lawful government shall obliterate their offenses the offense previously known the acceptance of service is a pardon for crimes i fear that this class of men will not be very numerous  so far as to indemnity but where are the objects of justice and of example and of future security to the public peace they are naturally pointed out not by their having outraged political and civil laws nor their having rebelled against the state as a state but by their having rebelled against the law of nature and outraged man as man in this list all the regicides in general all those who laid sacrilegious hands on the king who without any thing in their own rebellious mission to the convention to justify them brought him to his trial and unanimously voted him guilty all those who had a share in the cruel murder of the queen and the detestable proceedings with regard to the young king and the unhappy princesses all those who committed coldblooded murder any where and particularly in their revolutionary tribunals where every idea of natural justice and of their own declared rights of man have been trod under foot with the most insolent mockery all men concerned in the burning and demolition of houses or churches with audacious and marked acts of sacrilege and scorns offered to religion in general all the leaders of jacobin clubs not one of these should escape a punishment suitable to the nature quality and degree of their offense by a steady but a measured justice  in the first place no man ought to be subject to any penalty from the highest to the lowest but by a trial according to the course of law carried on with all that caution and deliberation which has been used in the best times and precedents of the french jurisprudence the criminal law of which country faulty to be sure in some particulars was highly laudable and tender of the lives of men in restoring order and justice every thing like retaliation ought to be religiously avoided and an example ought to be set of a total alienation from the jacobin proceedings in their accursed revolutionary tribunals every thing like lumping men in masses and of forming tables of proscription ought to be avoided  in all these punishments any thing which can be alleged in mitigation of the offense should be fully considered mercy is not a thing opposed to justice it is an essential part of it as necessary in criminal cases as in civil affairs equity is to law it is only for the jacobins never to pardon they have not done it in a single instance a council of mercy ought therefore to be appointed with powers to report on each case to soften the penalty or entirely to remit it according to circumstances  with these precautions the very first foundation of settlement must be to call to a strict account those bloody and merciless offenders without it government cannot stand a year people little consider the utter impossibility of getting those who having emerged from very low some from the lowest classes of society have exercised a power so high and with such unrelenting and bloody a rage quietly to fall back into their old ranks and become humble peaceable laborious and useful members of society it never can be on the other hand is it to be believed that any worthy and virtuous subject restored to the ruins of his house will with patience see the coldblooded murderer of his father mother wife or children or perhaps all of these relations such things have been nose him in his own village and insult him with the riches acquired from the plunder of his goods ready again to head a jacobin faction to attack his life he is unworthy of the name of man who would suffer it it is unworthy of the name of a government which taking justice out of the private hand will not exercise it for the injured by the public arm  i know it sounds plausible and is readily adopted by those who have little sympathy with the sufferings of others who wish to jumble the innocent and guilty into one mass by a general indemnity this cruel indifference dignifies itself with the name of humanity  it is extraordinary that as the wicked arts of this regicide and tyrannous faction increase in number variety and atrocity the desire of punishing them becomes more and more faint and the talk of an indemnity toward them every day stronger and stronger our ideas of justice appear to be fairly conquered and overpowered by guilt when it is grown gigantic it is not the point of view in which we are in the habit of viewing guilt the crimes we every day punish are really below the penalties we inflict the criminals are obscure and feeble this is the view in which we see ordinary crimes and criminals but when guilt is seen though but for a time to be furnished with the arms and to be invested with the robes of power it seems to assume another nature and to get as it were out of our jurisdiction this i fear is the case with many but there is another cause full as powerful toward this security to enormous guilt the desire which possesses people who have once obtained power to enjoy it at their case it is not humanity but laziness and inertness of mind which produces the desire of this kind of indemnities this description of men love general and short methods if they punish they make a promiscuous massacre if they spare they make a general act of oblivion this is a want of disposition to proceed laboriously according to the cases and according to the rules and principles of justice on each case a want of disposition to assort criminals to discriminate the degrees and modes of guilt to separate accomplices from principals leaders from followers seducers from the seduced and then by following the same principles in the same detail to class punishments and to sit them to the nature and kind of the delinquency if that were once attempted we should soon see that the task was neither infinite nor the execution cruel there would be deaths but for the number of criminals and the extent of france not many there would be cases of transportation cases of labor to restore what has been wickedly destroyed cases of imprisonment and cases of mere exile but be this as it may i am sure that if justice is not done there there can be neither peace or justice there nor in any part of europe  history is resorted to for other acts of indemnity in other times the princes are desired to look back to henry the fourth we are desired to look to the restoration of king charles these things in my opinion have no resemblance whatsoever they were cases of a civil war in france more ferocious in england more moderate than common in neither country were the orders of society subverted religion and morality destroyed on principle or property totally annihilated in england the government of cromwell was to be sure somewhat rigid but for a new power no savage tyranny the country was nearly as well in his hands as in those of charles the second and in some points much better the laws in general had their course and were admirably administered the king did not in reality grant an act of indemnity the prevailing power then in a manner the nation in effect granted an indemnity to him the idea of a preceding rebellion was not at all admitted in that convention and that parliament the regicides were a common enemy and as such given up  among the ornaments of their place which eminently distinguish them few people are better acquainted with the history of their own country than the illustrious princes now in exile but i caution them not to be led into error by that which has been supposed to be the guide of life i would give the same caution to all princes not that i derogate from the use of history it is a great improver of the understanding by showing both men and affairs in a great variety of views from this source much political wisdom may be learned that is may be learned as habit not as precept and as an exercise to strengthen the mind as furnishing materials to enlarge and enrich it not as a repertory of cases and precedents for a lawyer if it were a thousand times better would it be that a statesman had never learned to read  vellem nescirent literas this method turns their understanding from the object before them and from the present exigencies of the world to comparisons with former times of which after all we can know very little and very imperfectly and our guides the historians who are to give us their true interpretation are often prejudiced often ignorant often fonder of system than of truth whereas if a man with reasonable good parts and natural sagacity and not in the leadingstrings of any master will look steadily on the business before him without being diverted by retrospect and comparison he may be capable of forming a reasonable good judgment of what is to be done there are some fundamental points in which nature never changes  but they are few and obvious and belong rather to morals than to politics but so far as regards political matter the human mind and human affairs are susceptible of infinite modifications and of combinations wholly new and unlooked for very few for instance could have imagined that property which has been taken for natural dominion should through the whole of a vast kingdom lose all its importance and even its influence this is what history or books of speculation could hardly have taught us how many could have thought that the most complete and formidable revolution in a great empire should be made by men of letters not as subordinate instruments and trumpeters of sedition but as the chief contrivers and managers and in a short time as the open administrators and sovereign rulers who could have imagined that atheism could produce one of the most violently operative principles of fanaticism who could have imagined that in a commonwealth in a manner cradled in war and in an extensive and dreadful war military commanders should be of little or no account that the convention should not contain one military man of name that administrative bodies in a state of the utmost confusion and of but a momentary duration and composed of men with not one imposing part of character should be able to govern the country and its armies with an authority which the most settled senates and the most respected monarchs scarcely ever had in the same degree this for one i confess i did not foresee though all the rest was present to me very early and not out of my apprehension even for several years  i believe very few were able to enter into the effects of mere terror as a principle not only for the support of power in given hands or forms but in those things in which the soundest political speculators were of opinion that the least appearance of force would be totally destructive such is the market whether of money provision or commodities of any kind yet for four years we have seen loans made treasuries supplied and armies levied and maintained more numerous than france ever showed in the field by the effects of fear alone  here is a state of things of which in its totality if history furnishes any examples at all they are very remote and feeble i therefore am not so ready as some are to tax with folly or cowardice those who were not prepared to meet an evil of this nature even now after the events all the causes may be somewhat difficult to ascertain very many are however traceable but these things history and books of speculation as i have already said did not teach men to foresee and of course to resist now that they are no longer a matter of sagacity but of experience of recent experience of our own experience it would be unjustiiable to go back to the records of other times to instruct us to manage what they never enabled us to foresee  memorial on the affairs of france in       regicides insolence of whilst the fortune of the field was wholly with the regicides nothing was thought of but to follow where it led and it led to every thing not so much as a talk of treaty laws were laid down with arrogance the most moderate politician amongst them boissy danglas was chosen as the organ not so much for prescribing limits to their claims as to mark what for the present they are content to leave to others they made not laws not conventions but late possession but physical nature and political convenience the sole foundation of their claims the rhine the mediterranean and the ocean were the bounds which for the time they assigned to the empire of regicide in truth with these limits and their principle they would not have left even the shadow of liberty or safety to any nation this plan of empire was not taken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success you must recollect that it was projected just as the report has stated it from the very first revolt of the faction against their monarchy and it has been uniformly pursued as a standing maxim of national policy from that time to this it is in the season of prosperity that men discover their real tempers principles and designs this report combined with their conduct forms an infallible criterion of the views of this republic  regicide peace  reason it is probable that the standard of both reason and taste is the same in all human creatures on a superficial view we may seem to differ very widely from each other in our reasonings and no less in our pleasures but notwithstanding this difference which i think to be rather apparent than real it is probable that the standard both of reason and taste is the same in all human creatures for if there were not some principles of judgment as well as of sentiment common to all mankind no hold could possibly be taken either on their reason or their passions sufficient to maintain the ordinary correspondence of life it appears indeed to be generally acknowledged that with regard to truth and falsehood there is something fixed we find people in their disputes continually appealing to certain tests and standards which are allowed on all sides and are supposed to be established in our common nature but there is not the same obvious concurrence in any uniform or settled principles which relate to taste it is even commonly supposed that this delicate and aerial faculty which seems too volatile to endure even the chains of a definition cannot be properly tried by any test nor regulated by any standard there is so continual a call for the exercise of the reasoning faculty and it is so much strengthened by perpetual contention that certain maxims of right reason seem to be tacitly settled amongst the most ignorant the learned have improved on this rude science and reduced those maxims into a system if taste has not been so happily cultivated it was not that the subject was barren but that the laborers were few or negligent for to say the truth there are not the same interesting motives to impel us to fix the one which urge us to ascertain the other and after all if men differ in their opinion concerning such matters their difference is not attended with the same important consequences else i make no doubt but that the logic of taste if i may be allowed the expression might very possibly be as well digested and we might come to discuss matters of this nature with as much certainty as those which seem more immediately within the province of mere reason  sublime and beautiful  religion christian the french have brought the church to a state of poverty and persecution etc one would think that after an honest and necessary revolution if they had a mind that theirs should pass for such your masters would have imitated the virtuous policy of those who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character burnet tells us that nothing tended to reconcile the english nation to the government of king william so much as the care he took to fill the vacant bishoprics with men who had attracted the public esteem by their learning eloquence and piety and above all by their known moderation in the state with you in your purifying revolution whom have you chosen to regulate the church mr mirabeau is a fine speaker  and a fine writer  and a fine  a very fine man but really nothing gave more surprise to every body here than to find him the supreme head of your ecclesiastical affairs the rest is of course your assembly addresses a manifesto to france in which they tell the people with an insulting irony that they have brought the church to its primitive condition in one respect their declaration is undoubtedly true for they have brought it to a state of poverty and persecution  what can be hoped for after this have not men if they deserve the name under this new hope and head of the church been made bishops for no other merit than having acted as instruments of atheists for no other merit than having thrown the childrens bread to dogs and in order to gorge the whole gang of usurers pedlars and itinerant jew discounters at the corners of streets starved the poor of their christian flocks and their own brother pastors have not such men been made bishops to administer in temples in which if the patriotic donations have not already stripped them of their vessels the churchwardens ought to take security for the altar plate and not so much as to trust the chalice in their sacrilegious hands so long as jews have assignats on ecclesiastic plunder to exchange for the silver stolen from churches  i am told that the very sons of such jewjobbers have been made bishops persons not to be suspected of any sort of christian superstition fit colleagues to the holy prelate of autun and bred at the feet of that gamaliel we know who it was that drove the money changers out of the temple we see too who it is that brings them in again we have in london very respectable persons of the jewish nation whom we will keep but we have of the same tribe others of a very different description  housebreakers and receivers of stolen goods and forgers of paper currency more than we can conveniently hang these we can spare to france to fill the new episcopal thrones men well versed in swearing and who will scruple no oath which the fertile genius of any of your reformers can devise  in matters so ridiculous it is hard to be grave on a view of their consequences it is almost inhuman to treat them lightly to what a state of savage stupid servile insensibility must your people be reduced who can endure such proceedings in their church their state and their judicature even for a moment but the deluded people of france are like other madmen who to a miracle bear hunger and thirst and cold and confinement and the chains and lash of their keeper whilst all the while they support themselves by the imagination that they are generals of armies prophets kings and emperors as to a change of mind in these men who consider infamy as honor degradation as preferment bondage to low tyrants as liberty and the practical scorn and contumely of their upstart masters as marks of respect and homage i look upon it as absolutely impracticable these madmen to be cured must first like other madmen be subdued the sound part of the community which i believe to be large but by no means the largest part has been taken by surprise and is disjointed terrified and disarmed that sound part of the community must first be put into a better condition before it can do any thing in the way of deliberation or of persuasion this must be an act of power as well as of wisdom of power in the hands of firm determined patriots who can distinguish the misled from traitors who will regulate the state if such should be their fortune with a discriminating manly and provident mercy men who are purged of the surfeit and indigestion of systems if ever they have been admitted into the habits of their minds men who will lay the foundation of a real reform in effacing every vestige of that philosophy which pretends to have made discoveries in the terra australis of morality men who will fix the state upon these bases of morals and politics which are our old and immemorial and i hope will be our eternal possession  this power to such men must come from without it may be given to you in pity for surely no nation ever called so pathetically on the compassion of all its neighbors it may be given by those neighbors on motives of safety to themselves never shall i think any country in europe to be secure whilst there is established in the very center of it a state if so it may be called founded on principles of anarchy and which is in reality a college of armed fanatics for the propagation of the principles of assassination robbery rebellion fraud faction oppression and impiety mahomet hid as for a time he was in the bottom of the sands of arabia had his spirit and character been discovered would have been on object of precaution to provident minds what if he had erected his frantic standard for the destruction of the christian religion in luce asioe in the midst of the then noonday splendour of the then civilized world the princes of europe in the beginning of this century did well not to suffer the monarchy of france to swallow up the others they ought not now in my opinion to suffer all the monarchies and commonwealths to be swallowed up in the gulf of this polluted anarchy they may be tolerably safe at present because the comparative power of france for the present is little but times and occasions make dangers intestine troubles may arise in other countries there is a power always on the watch qualified and disposed to profit of every conjuncture to establish its own principles and modes of mischief wherever it can hope for success what mercy would these usurpers have on other sovereigns and on other nations when they treat their own king with such unparalleled indignities and so cruelly oppress their own countrymen  letter to a member of the national assembly  recess parliamentary in england we cannot work so hard as frenchmen frequent relaxation is necessary to us you are naturally more intense in your application i did not know this part of your national character until i went into france in      at present this your disposition to labor is rather increased than lessened in your assembly you do not allow yourselves a recess even on sundays we have two days in the week besides the festivals and besides five or six months of the summer and autumn this continued unremitted effort of the members of your assembly i take to be one among the causes of the mischief they have done they who always labor can have no true judgment you never give yourselves time to cool you can never survey from its proper point of sight the work you have finished before you decree its final execution you can never plan the future by the past you never go into the country sober and dispassionately to observe the effect of your measures on their objects you cannot feel distinctly how far the people are rendered better and improved or more miserable and depraved by what you have done you cannot see with your own eyes the sufferings and afflictions you cause you know them but at a distance on the statements of those who always flatter the reigning power and who amidst their representations of the grievances inflame your minds against those who are oppressed these are amongst the effects of unremitted labor when men exhaust their attention burn out their candles and are left in the dark malo meorum negligentiam quam istorum obscuram diligentiam  ibid  rulers french your rulers brought forth a set of men steaming from the sweat and drudgery and all black with the smoke and soot of the forge of confiscation and robbery  ardentis massoe fuligine lippos  a set of men brought forth from the trade of hammering arms of proof offensive and defensive in aid of the enterprises and for the subsequent protection of housebreakers murderers traitors and malefactors men who had their minds seasoned with theories perfectly conformable to their practice and who had always laughed at possession and prescription and defied all the fundamental maxims of jurisprudence to the horror and stupefaction of all the honest part of this nation and indeed of all nations who are spectators we have seen on the credit of those very practices and principles and to carry them further into effect these very men placed on the sacred seat of justice in the capital city of your late kingdom we see that in future you are to be destroyed with more form and regularity this is not peace it is only the introduction of a sort of discipline in their hostility their tyranny is complete in their justice and their lanthorn is not half so dreadful as their court  one would think that out of common decency they would have given you men who had not been in the habit of trampling upon law and justice in the assembly natural men or men apparently natural for judges who are to dispose of your lives and fortunes  ibid  revenue french i shall now say something of the ability showed by your legislators with regard to the revenue  in their proceedings relative to this object if possible still fewer traces appear of political judgment or financial resource when the states met it seemed to be the great object to improve the system of revenue to enlarge its connection to cleanse it of oppression and vexation and to establish it on the most solid footing great were the expectations entertained on that head throughout europe it was by this grand arrangement that france was to stand or fall and this became in my opinion very properly the test by which the skill and patriotism of those who ruled in that assembly would be tried the revenue of the state is the state in effect all depends upon it whether for support or for reformation the dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it as all great qualities of the mind which operate in public and are not merely suffering and passive require force for their display i had almost said for their unequivocal existence the revenue which is the spring of all power becomes in its administration the sphere of every active virtue public virtue being of a nature magnificent and splendid instituted for great things and conversant about great concerns requires abundant scope and room and cannot spread and grow under confinement and in circumstances straitened narrow and sordid through the revenue alone the body politic can act in its true genius and character and therefore it will display just as much of its collective virtue and as much of that virtue which may characterise those who move it and are as it were its life and guiding principle as it is possessed of a just revenue for from hence not only magnanimity and liberality and beneficence and fortitude and providence and the tutelary protection of all good arts derive their food and the growth of their organs but continence and selfdenial and labor and vigilance and frugality and whatever else there is in which the mind shows itself above the appetite are no where more in their proper element than in the provision and distribution of the public wealth it is therefore not without reason that the science of speculative and practical finance which must take to its aid so many auxiliary branches of knowledge stands high in the estimation not only of the ordinary sort but of the wisest and best men and as this science has grown with the progress of its object the prosperity and improvement of nations has generally increased with the increase of their revenues and they will both continue to grow and flourish as long as the balance between what is left to strengthen the efforts of individuals and what is collected for the common efforts of the state bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion and are kept in a close correspondence and communication and perhaps it may be owing to the greatness of revenues and to the urgency of state necessities that old abuses in the constitution of finances are discovered and their true nature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly understood insomuch that a smaller revenue might have been more distressing in one period than a far greater is found to be in another the proportionate wealth even remaining the same  reflections on the revolution in france  ruin national the french styled the ablest architects of the french have shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin that have hitherto existed in the world in that very short space of time they have completely pulled down to the ground their monarchy their church their nobility their law their revenue their army their navy their commerce their arts and their manufactures they have done their business for us as rivals in a way in which twenty ramilies or blenheims could never have done it were we absolute conquerors and france to lie prostrate at our feet we should be ashamed to send a commission to settle their affairs which could impose so hard a law upon the french and so destructive of all their consequence as a nation as that they have imposed upon themselves  speech on the army estimates  russel house of mr burke contrasts his own merit with that of the founder of the house of russel the merit of the origin of his graces bedford fortune was in being a favorite and chief adviser to a prince who left no liberty to their native country my endeavor was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in which i was born and for all descriptions and denominations in it  mine was to support with unrelaxing vigilance every right every privilege every franchise in this my adopted my dearer and more comprehensive country and not only to preserve those rights in this chief feat of empire but in every nation in every land in every climate language and religion in the vast domain that still is under the protection and the larger that was once under the protection of the british crown  his founders merits were by arts in which he served his master and made his fortune to bring poverty wretchedness and depopulation on his country mine were under a benevolent prince in promoting the commerce manufactures and agriculture of his kingdom in which his majesty shows an eminent example who even in his amusements is a patriot and in hours of leisure an improver of his native soil  his founders merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a court and the protection of a wolsey to the eminence of a great and potent lord his merit in that eminence was by instigating a tyrant to injustice to provoke a people to rebellion  my merit was to awaken the sober part of the country that they might put themselves on their guard against any one potent lord or any greater number of potent lords or any combination of great leading men of any sort if ever they should attempt to proceed in the same courses but in the reverse order that is by instigating a corrupt populace to rebellion and through that rebellion should introduce a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny which his graces ancestor supported and of which he profited in the manner we behold in the despotism of henry the eighth  the political merit of the first pensioner of his graces house was that of being concerned as a counselor of state in advising and in his person executing the conditions of a dishonorable peace with france the surrendering the fortress of boulogne then our out guard on the continent by that surrender calais the key of france and the bridle in the mouth of that power was not many years afterward finally lost my merit has been in resisting the power and pride of france under any form of it is rule but in opposing it with the greatest zeal and earnestness when that rule appeared in the worst form it could assume the worst indeed which the prime cause and principle of all evil could possibly give it it was my endeavor by every means to excite a spirit in the house where i had the honor of a seat for carrying on with early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war that this or any nation ever carried on in order to save my country from the iron yoke of it is power and from the more dreadful contagion of its principles to preserve while they can be preserved pure and untainted the ancient inbred integrity piety good nature and good humor of the people of england from the dreadful pestilence which beginning in france threatens to lay waste the whole moral and in a great degree the whole physical world having done both in the focus of it is most intense malignity  the labors of his graces founder merited the curses not loud but deep of the commons of england on whom he and his master had effected a complete parliamentary reform in making them in their slavery and humiliation the true and adequate representatives of a debased degraded and undone people my merits were in having had an active though not always an ostentatious share in every one act without exception of undisputed constitutional utility in my time and in having supported on all occasions the authority the efficiency and the privileges of the commons of great britain i ended my services by a recorded and fully reasoned assertion on their own journals of their constitutional rights and a vindication of their constitutional conduct i labored in all things to merit their inward approbation and along with the assistants of the largest the greatest and best of my endeavors i received their free unbiassed public and solemn thanks  thus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants which compose the duke of bedfords fortune as balanced against mine in the name of common sense why should the duke of bedford think that none but of the house of russel are entitled to the favor of the crown why should he imagine that no king of england has been capable of judging of merit but king henry the eighth indeed he will pardon me he is a little mistaken all virtue did not end in the first earl of bedford all discernment did not lose its vision when his creator closed his eyes let him remit his rigor on the disproportion between merit and reward in others and they will make no enquiry into the origin of his fortune they will regard with much more satisfaction as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage whatever in his pedigree has been dulcified by an exposure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations from the hard acidulous metallic tincture of the spring it is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers in that long series have degenerated into honor and virtue let the duke of bedford i am sure he will reject with scorn and horror the counsels of the lecturers those wicked panders to avarice and ambition who would tempt him in the troubles of his country to seek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility and the plunder of another church let him and i trust that yet he will employ all the energy of his youth and all the resources of his wealth to crush rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals and rebellious movements that have no provocation in tyranny  then will be forgot the rebellions which by a doubtful priority in crime his ancestor had provoked and extinguished on such a conduct in the noble duke many of his countrymen

reformation one of the greatest periods of human improvement was a time of trouble and confusion the vast structure of superstition and tyranny which had been for ages in rearing and which was combined with the interest of the great and of the many which was molded into the laws the manners and civil institutions of nations and blended with the frame and policy of states could not be brought to the ground without a fearful struggle nor could it fall without a violent concussion of itself and all about it when this great revolution was attempted in a more regular mode by government it was opposed by plots and seditions of the people when by popular efforts it was repressed as rebellion by the hand of power and bloody executions often bloodily returned marked the whole of its progress through all its stages the affairs of religion which are no longer heard of in the tumult of our present contentions made a principal ingredient in the wars and politics of that time the enthusiasm of religion threw a gloom over the politics and political interests poisoned and perverted the spirit of religion upon all sides the protestant religion in that violent struggle infected as the popish had been before by worldly interests and worldly passions became a persecutor in its turn sometimes of the new sects which carried their own principles further than it was convenient to the original reformers and always of the body from whom they parted and this persecuting spirit arose not only from the bitterness of retaliation but from the merciless policy of fear  it was long before the spirit of true piety and true wisdom involved in the principles of the reformation could be depurated from the dregs and feculence of the contention with which it was carried through however until this be done the reformation is not complete and those who think themselves good protestants from their animosity to others are in that respect no protestants at all it was at first thought necessary perhaps to oppose to popery another popery to get the better of it whatever was the cause laws were made in many countries and in this kingdom in particular against papists which are as bloody as any of those which had been enacted by the popish princes and states and where those laws were not bloody in my opinion they were worse as they were slow cruel outrages on our nature and kept men alive

calico or tobacco or some other such low concern to be taken up for a little temporary interest and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties it is to be looked on with other reverence because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature it is a partnership in all science a partnership in all art a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection as the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living but between those who are living those who are dead and those who are to be born each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primaeval contract of eternal society linking the lower with the higher natures connecting the visible and invisible world according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures each in their appointed place this law is not

reflections on the revolution in france  society origin of laws in civil society and difficulties arising thereon we found or we thought we found an inconvenience in having every man the judge of his own cause therefore judges were set up at first with discretionary powers but it was soon found a miserable slavery to have our lives and properties precarious and hanging upon the arbitrary determination of any one man or set of men we slew to laws as a remedy for this evil by these we persuaded ourselves we might know with some certainty upon what ground we stood but lo differences

far from it you would speak of him as a foreigner an accident to which all are liable you would represent him as a man one partaking with us of the same common nature and subject to the same law there is something so averse from our nature in these artificial political distinctions that we need no other trumpet to kindle us to war and destruction but there is something so benign and healing in the general voice of humanity that maugre all our regulations to prevent it the simple name of man applied properly never fails to work a salutary effect  ibid  society the most obvious division of society into rich and poor state of the latter described see rich the most obvious division of society is into rich and poor and it is no less obvious that the number of the former bear a great disproportion to those of the latter the whole business of the poor is to administer to the idleness folly and luxury of the rich and that of the rich in return is to find the best methods of confirming the slavery and increasing the burdens of the poor in a state of nature it is an invariable law that a mans acquisitions are in proportion to his labors in a state of artificial society it is a law as constant and as invariable that those who labor most enjoy the fewest things and that those who labor not at all have the greatest number of enjoyments a constitution of things this strange and ridiculous beyond expression we scarce believe a thing when we are told it which we actually see before our eyes every day without being in the least surprised i suppose that there are in great britain upwards of an hundred thousand people employed in lead tin iron copper and coal mines these unhappy wretches scarce ever see the light of the sun they are buried in the bowels of the earth there they work at a severe and dismal task without the least prospect of being delivered from it they subsist upon the coarsest and worst sort of fare they have their health miserably impaired and their lives cut short by being perpetually confined in the close vapor of these malignant minerals an hundred thousand more at least are tortured without remission by the suffocating smoke intense fires and constant drudgery necessary in refining and managing the products of those mines if any man informed us that two hundred thousand innocent persons were condemned to so intolerable slavery how should we pity the unhappy sufferers and how great would be our just indignation against those who inflicted so cruel and ignominious a punishment this is an instance i could not wish a stronger of the numberless things which we pass by in their common dress yet which shock us when they are nakedly represented but this number considerable as it is and the slavery with all its baseness and horror which we have at home is nothing to what the rest of the world affords of the same nature millions daily bathed in the poisonous damps and destructive effluvia of lead silver copper and arsenic to say nothing of those other employments those stations of wretchedness and contempt in which civil society has placed the numerous enfans perdus of her army  ibid  society natural and artificial society defined in the state of nature without question mankind was subjected to many and great inconveniences want of union want of mutual assistance want of a common arbitrator to resort to in their differences these were evils which they could not but have felt pretty severely on many occasions the original children of the earth lived with their brethren of the other kinds in much equality their diet must have been confined almost wholly to the vegetable kind and the same tree which in its flourishing state produced them berries in its decay gave them an habitation the mutual desires of the sexes uniting their bodies and affections and the children which were the results of these intercourses introduced first the notion of society and taught its conveniences this society founded in natural appetites and instincts and not in any positive institution i shall call natural society thus far nature went and succeeded but man would go farther the great error of our nature is not to know where to stop not to be satisfied with any reasonable acquirement not to compound with our condition but to lose all we have gained by an insatiable pursuit after more man found a considerable advantage by this union of many persons to form one family he therefore judged that he would find his account proportionably in an union of many families into one body politic and as nature has formed no bond of union to hold them together he supplied this defect by laws  this is political socy and hence the sources of what are usually called states civil socities or governments into some form of which more extended or restrained all mankind have gradually fallen  ibid  society requires that the passions should be subjected society requires not only that the passions of individuals should be subjected but that even in the mass and body as well as in the individuals the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted their will controlled and their passions brought into subjection this can only be done by a power out of themselves and not in the exercise of its function subject to that will and to those passions which it is its office to bridle and subdue in this sense the restraints on men as well as their liberties are to be reckoned among their rights but as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances and admit of infinite modifications they cannot be settled upon any abstract rule and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle  reflections on the revolution in france  society political justly chargeable with much the greatest part of the destruction of the species to give the fairest play to every side of the question i will own that there is a haughtiness and fierceness in human nature which will cause innumerable broils place men in what situation you please but owning this i still insist in charging it to political regulations that these broils are so frequent so cruel and attended with consequences so deplorable in a state of nature it had been impossible to find a number of men sufficient for such slaughters agreed in the same bloody purpose or allowing that they might have come to such an agreement an impossible supposition yet the means that simple nature has supplied them with are by no means adequate to such an end many scratches many bruises undoubtedly would be received upon all hands but only a few a very few deaths society and politics which have given us these destructive views have given us also the means of satisfying them from the earliest dawnings of policy to this day the invention of men has been sharpening and improving the mystery of murder from the first rude essays of clubs and stones to the present perfection of gunnery cannoneering bombarding mining and all these species of artificial learned and refined cruelty in which we are now so expert and which make a principal part of what politicians have taught us to believe is our principal glory  how far mere nature would have carried us we may judge by the example of those animals who still follow her laws and even of those to whom she has given dispositions more fierce and arms more terrible than ever she intended we should use it is an incontestible truth that there is more havoc made in one year by men of men than has been made by all the lions tigers panthers ounces leopards hyenas

societies popular remarks on the constitutional and revolution societies i certainly have the honor to belong to more clubs than one in which the constitution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious revolution are held in high reverence and i reckon myself among the most forward in my zeal for maintaining that constitution and those principles in the utmost purity and vigor it is because i do so that i think it necessary for me that there should be no mistake those who cultivate the memory of our revolution and those who are attached to the constitution of this kingdom will take good care how they are involved with persons who under the pretext of zeal toward the revolution and constitution too frequently wander from their true principles and are ready on every occasion to depart from the firm but cautious and deliberate spirit which produced the one and which presides in the other before i proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter i shall beg leave to give you such information as i have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought proper as bodies to interfere in the concerns of france first assuring you that i am not and that i have never been a member of either of those societies  the first calling itself the constitutional society or society for constitutional information or by some such title is i believe of seven or eight years standing the institution of this society appears to be of a charitable and so far of a laudable nature it was intended for the circulation at the expense of the members of many books which few others would be at the expense of buying and which might lie on the hands of the booksellers to the great loss of an useful body of men whether the books so charitably circulated were ever as charitably read is more than i know possibly several of them have been exported to france and like goods not in request here may with you have found a market i have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are sent from hence what improvements they have had in their passage as it is said some liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea i cannot tell but i never heard a man of common judgment or the least degree of information speak a word in praise of the greater part of the publications circulated by that society nor have their proceedings been accounted except by some of themselves as of any serious consequence  your national assembly seems to entertain much the same opinion that i do of this poor charitable club as a nation you reserved the whole stock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the revolution society when their fellows in the constitutional were in equity entitled to some share since you have selected the revolution society as the great object of your national thanks and praises you will think me excuseable in making its late conduct the subject of my observations the national assembly of france has given importance to these gentlemen by adopting them and they return the favor by acting as a committee in england for extending the principles of the national assembly henceforward we must consider them as a kind of privileged persons as no inconsiderable members in the diplomatic body this is one among the revolutions which have given splendour to obscurity and distinction to undiscerned merit until very lately i do not recollect to have heard of this club i am quite sure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts nor i believe those of any person out of their own set i find upon enquiry that on the anniversary of the revolution in      a club of dissenters but of what denomination i know not have long had the custom of hearing a sermon in one of their churches and that afterward they spent the day cheerfully as other clubs do at the tavern but i never heard that any public measure or political system much less that the merits of the constitution of any foreign nation had been the subject of a formal proceeding at their festivals until to my inexpressible surprise i found them in a sort of public capacity by a congratulatory address giving an authoritative sanction to the proceedings of the national assembly in france  in the ancient principles and conduct of the club so far at least as they were declared i see nothing to which i could take exception i think it very probable that for some purpose new members may have entered among them and that some truly christian politicians who love to dispense benefits but are careful to conceal the hand which distributes the dole may have made them the instruments of their pious designs whatever i may have reason to suspect concerning private management i shall speak of nothing as of a certainty but what is public  for one i should be sorry to be thought directly or indirectly concerned in their proceedings i certainly take my full share along with the rest of the world in my individual and private capacity in speculating on what has been done or is doing on the public stage in any place ancient or modern in the republic of rome or the republic of paris but having no general apostolical mission being a citizen of a particular state and being bound up in a considerable degree by its public will i should think it at least improper and irregular for me to open a formal public correspondence with the actual government of a foreign nation without the express authority of the government under which i live  i should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence under any thing like an equivocal description which to many unacquainted with our usages might make the address in which i joined appear as the act of persons in some sort of corporate capacity acknowledged by the laws of this kingdom and authorized to speak the sense of some part of it on account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general descriptions and of the deceit which may be practiced under them and not from mere formality the house of commons would reject the most sneaking petition for the most trifling object under that mode of signature to which you have thrown open the foldingdoors of your presence chamber and have ushered into your national assembly with as much ceremony and parade and with as great a bustle of applause as if you had been visited by the whole representave majesty of the whole english nation if what this society has thought proper to send forth had been a piece of argument it would have signified little whose argument it was it would be neither the more nor the less convincing on account of the party it came from but this is only a vote and resolution it stands solely on authority and in this case it is the mere authority of individuals few of whom appear their signatures ought in my opinion to have been annexed to their instrument the world would then have the means of knowing how many they are who they are and of what value their opinions may be from their personal abilities from their knowledge their experience or their lead and authority in this state to me who am but a plain man the proceeding looks a little too refined and too ingenious it has too much the air of a political stratagem adopted for the sake of giving under an high sounding name an importance to the public declarations of this club which when the matter came to be closely inspected they did not altogether so well deserve it is a policy that has very much the complexion of a fraud  reflections on the revolution in france  schemes french have nothing in experience to prove their tendency beneficial in obtaining and securing their power the assembly proceeds upon principles the most opposite from those which appear to direct them in the use of it an observation on this difference will let us into the true spirit of their conduct every thing which they have done or continue to do in order to obtain and keep their power is by the most common arts they proceed exactly as their ancestors of ambition have done before them trace them through all their artifices frauds and violences you can find nothing at all that is new they follow precedents and examples with the punctilious exactness of a pleader they never depart an iota from the authentic formulas of tyranny and usurpation but in all the regulations relative to the public good the spirit has been the very reverse of this there they commit the whole to the mercy of untried speculations they abandon the dearest interests of the public to those loose theories to which none of them would choose to trust the slightest of his private concerns they make this difference because in their desire of obtaining and securing power they are thoroughly in earnest there they travel in the beaten road the public interests because about them they have no real solicitude they abandon wholly to chance i say to chance because their schemes have nothing in experience to prove their tendency beneficial  ibid

corruption of the soldiery of louis xvi previous to the revolution the worst effect of all their proceeding was on their military which was rendered an army for every purpose but that of defense if the question was whether soldiers were to forget they were citizens as an abstract proposition i could have no difference about it though as it is usual when abstract principles are to be applied much is to be thought on the manner of uniting the character of citizen and soldier but as applied to the events which had happened in france where the abstract principle it clothed with its circumstances i think that my friend mr fox would agree with me that what was done there furnished no matter of exultation either in the act or the example these soldiers were not citizens but base hireling mutineers and mercenary sordid deserters wholly destitute of any honorable principles their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic spirit from the evils of which a democracy itself was to be resorted to by those who were the least disposed to that form as a sort of refuge it was not an army in corpse and with discipline and embodied under the respectable patriot citizens of the state in resisting tyranny nothing like it it was the case of common soldiers deserting from their officers to join a furious licentious populace it was a desertion to a cause the real object of which was to level all those institutions and to break all those connections natural and civil that regulate and hold together the community by a chain of subordination to raise soldiers against their officers

if men are not shamed out of their present course in commemorating the fact will cheat many out of the principles and deprive them of the benefits of the revolution they commemorate i confess to you sir i never liked this continual talk of resistance and revolution or the practice of making the extreme medicine of the constitution its daily bread it renders the habit of society dangerously valetudinary it is taking periodical doses of mercury sublimate and swallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides to our love of liberty  this distemper of remedy grown habitual relaxes and wears out by a vulgar and prostituted use the spring of that spirit which is to be exerted on great occasions it was in the most patient period of roman servitude that themes of tyrannicide made the

versatility ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice we have consecrated the state that no man should approach to look into its defects or corruptions but with due caution that he should never dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion that he should approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father with pious awe and trembling solicitude by this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of magicians in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations they may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their fathers life  ibid  state reasons of i admit that reason of state will not in many circumstances permit the disclosure of the true ground of a public proceeding in that case silence is manly and it is wise it is fair to call for trust when the principle of reason itself suspends its public use i take the distinction to be this the ground of a particular measure making a part of a plan it is rarely proper to divulge all the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted ought as rarely to be concealed they who have not the whole cause before them call them politicians call them people call them what you will are no judges the difficulties of the case as well as its fair side ought to be presented this ought to be done and it is all that can be done when we have our true situation distinctly presented to us if we resolve

resource of vexatious and impolitic jobbing at home if any thing is rather increased than lessened various well intended but ill understood practices some of them existing in their spirit at least from the time of the old roman empire still prevail and that government is as blindly attached to old abusive customs as others are wildly disposed to all sorts of innovations and experiments these abuses were less felt whilst the pontificate drew riches from abroad which in some measure counterbalanced the evils of their remiss and jobbish government at home but now it can subsist only on the resources of domestic management and abuses in that management of course will be more intimately and more severely felt  in the midst of the apparently torpid languor of the ecclesiastical state those

capable of acting but with more force and steadiness the part of the tribune rienzi the people once inflamed will not be destitute of a leader they have such an one already in the cardinal or

weight with a new pope he will infallibly conjure up a democratic spirit in that country he may indeed be able to effect it without these advantages the next interregnum will probably show more of him there may be others of the same character who have not come to my knowledge this much is certain that the roman people if once the blind reverence they bear to the sanctity of the pope which is their only bridle should relax are naturally turbulent ferocious and headlong whilst the police is defective and the government feeble and resourceless beyond all imagination  memorial on the affairs of

did in silence without notice and without assistance increase to a considerable degree but it seems our nation had more skill and ability in destroying than in settling a colony in the last war we did in my opinion most inhumanly and upon pretenses that in the eye of an honest man are not worth a farthing root out this poor innocent deserving people whom our utter inability to govern or to reconcile gave us no sort of right to extirpate whatever the merits of that extirpation might have been it was on the footsteps of a neglected people it was on the fund of unconstrained poverty it was on the acquisitions of unregulated industry that any thing which deserves the name of a colony in that province has been formed it has been formed by overflowings from the exuberant population of new england and by emigration from other parts of nova scotia of fugitives from the protection of the board of trade  oecon reform  sieyes abbe humourous description of the abbes constitutional warehouse

real king and not an executive officer if he will not trouble himself with contemptible details nor wish to degrade himself by becoming a party in little squabbles i am far from sure that a king of great britain in whatever concerns him as a king or indeed as a rational man who combines his public interest with his personal satisfaction does not possess a more real solid extensive power than the king of france was possessed of before this miserable revolution the direct power of the king of england is considerable his indirect and far more certain power is great indeed he stands in need of nothing toward dignity of nothing toward splendour of nothing toward authority of nothing at all toward consideration abroad when was it that a king of england wanted wherewithal to make him respected courted or perhaps even scared in every state in europe  letter to a member of the national assembly  sovereigns their dispositions but indeed kings are to guard against the sam sort of dispositions in themselves they are very easily alienated from all the higher orders of their subjects whether civil or military laick or ecclesiastical it is with persons of condition that sovereigns chiefly come into contact it is from them that they generally experience opposition to their will it is with their pride and impracticability that princes are most hurt it is with their servility and baseness that they are most commonly disgusted it is from their humors and cabals that they find their affairs most frequently troubled and distracted but of the common people in pure monarchical governments kings know little or nothing and therefore being unacquainted with their faults which are as many as those of the great and much more decisive in their effects when accompanied with power kings generally regard them with tenderness and favor and turn their eyes toward that description of their subjects particularly when hurt by opposition from the higher orders  memorial on the affairs of france in       sovereign jurisdictions see king of great britain with regard to the sovereign jurisdictions i must observe sir that whoever takes a view of this kingdom in a cursory manner will imagine that he beholds a solid compacted uniform system of monarchy in which all inferior jurisdictions are but as rays diverging from one center but on examining it more nearly you find much eccentricity and confusion it is not a monarchy in strictness but as in the saxon times this country was an heptarchy it is now a strange sort of pentarchy it is divided into five several distinct principalities besides the supreme there is indeed this difference from the saxon times that as in the itinerant exhibitions of the stage for want of a complete company they are obliged to throw a variety of parts on their chief performer so our sovereign condescends himself to act not only the principal but all the subordinate parts in the play he condescends to dissipate the royal character and to trifle with those light subordinate lacquered sceptres in those hands that sustain the ball representing the world or which wield the trident that commands the ocean cross a brook and you lose the king of england but you have some comfort in coming again under his majesty though shorn of his beams and no more than prince of wales go to the north and you find him dwindled to a duke of lancaster turn to the west of that north and he pops upon you in the humble character of earl of chester travel a few miles on the earl of chester disappears and the king surprises you again as count palatine of lancaster if you travel beyond mount edgecombe you find him once more in his incognito and he is duke of cornwall so that quite fatigued and satiated with this dull variety you are infinitely refreshed when you return to the sphere of his proper splendour and behold your amiable sovereign in his true simple undisguised native character of majesty  oecon reform  spain present state of that country as to spain it is a nerveless country it does not possess the use it only suffers the abuse of a nobility for some time and even before the settlement of the bourbon dynasty that body has been systematically lowered and rendered incapable by exclusion and for incapacity excluded from affairs in this circle the body is in a manner annihilated  and so little means have they of any weighty exertion either to control or to support the crown that if they at all interfere it is only by abetting desperate and mobbish insurrections like that at madrid which drove squillace from his place florida blanca is a creature of office and has little connection and no sympathy with that body  as to the clergy they are the only thing in spain that looks like an independent order and they are kept in some respect by the inquisition the sole but unhappy resource of public tranquillity and order now remaining in spain as in venice it is become mostly an engine of state which indeed to a degree it has always been in spain it wars no longer with jews and heretics it has no such war to carry on it is great object is to keep atheistic and republican doctrines from making their way in that kingdom no french book upon any subject can enter there which does not contain such matter in spain the clergy are of moment from their influence but at the same time with the envy and jealousy that attend great riches and power though the crown has by management with the pope got a very great share of the ecclesiastical revenues into it is own hands much still remains to them there will always be about that court those who look out to a farther division of the church property as a resource and to be obtained by shorter methods than those of negotiations with the clergy and their chief but at present i think it likely that they will stop lest the business should be taken out of their hands and lest that body in which remains the only life that exists in spain and is not a fever may with their property lose all the influence necessary to preserve the monarchy or being poor and desperate may employ whatever influence remains to them as active agents in it is destruction  the castilians have still remaining a good deal of their old character their gravidad lealdad and il timor de dios but that character neither is or ever was exactly true except of the castilians only the several kingdoms which compose spain have perhaps some features which run through the whole but they are in many particulars as different as nations who go by different names the catalans for instance and the arragonians too in a good measure have the spirit of the miquelets and much more of republicanism than of an attachment to royalty they are more in the way of trade and intercourse with france and upon the least internal movement will disclose and probably let loose a spirit that may throw the whole spanish monarchy into convulsions  it is a melancholy reflection that the spirit of melioration which has been going on in that part of europe more or less during this century and the various schemes very lately on foot for further advancement are all put a stop to at once reformation certainly is nearly connected with innovation  and where that latter comes in for too large a share those who undertake to improve their country may risque their own safety in times where the correction which includes the confession of an abuse is turned to criminate the authority which has long suffered it rather than to honor those who would amend it which is the spirit of this malignant french distemper every step out of the common course becomes critical and renders it a task full of peril for princes of moderate talents to engage in great undertakings at present the only safety of spain is the old national hatred to the french how far that can be depended upon if any great ferments should be excited it is impossible to say  memorial on the affairs of france in       sublime the sublime and beautiful compared on closing this general view of beauty it naturally occurs that we should compare it with the sublime and in this comparison there appears a remarkable contrast for sublime objects are vast in their dimensions beautiful ones comparatively small beauty should be smooth and polished the great rugged and negligent beauty should shun the right line yet deviate from it insensibly the great in many cases loves the right line and when it deviates it often makes a strong deviation beauty should not be obscure the great ought to be dark and gloomy beauty should be light and delicate the great ought to be solid and even massive they are indeed ideas of a very different nature one being founded on pain the other on pleasure and however they may vary afterward from the direct nature of their causes yet these causes keep up an eternal distinction between them a distinction never to be forgotten by any whose business it is to affect the passions in the infinite variety of natural combinations we must expect to find the qualities of things the most remote imaginable from each other united in the same object we must expect also to find combinations of the same kind in the works of art but when we consider the power of an object upon our passions we must know that when any thing is intended to affect the mind by the force of some predominant property the affection produced is like to be the more uniform and perfect if all the other properties or qualities of the object be of the same nature and tending to the same design as the principal if black and white blend soften and unite a thousand ways are there no black and white if the qualities of the sublime and beautiful are sometimes found united does this prove that they are the same does it prove that they are any way allied does it prove even that they are not opposite and contradictory black and white may soften may blend but they are not therefore the same nor when they are so softened and blended with each other or with different colors is the power of black as black or of white as white so strong as when each stands uniform and distinguished  sublime and beautiful  sublime of the passion caused by the sublime the passion caused by the great and sublime in nature when those causes operate most powerfully is astonishment and astonishment is that state of the so  which all its motions are suspended with  of horror in this case the mind is so  with its object that it cannot entertain  by consequence reason on that object w ploys it hence arises the great power of the  that far from being produced by them it  reasonings and hurries us on by an irresistible force astonishment as i have said i the effect of the sublime in its highest degree the inferior effcts are admiration reverence and respect  ibid  sublime source of the sublime whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain and danger that is to say whatever is in any sort terrible or is conversant about terrible objects or operates in a manner analogous to terror is a source of the sublime that is it is productive of the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling  ibid  sublime description we do not any where meet a more sublime description than this justlycelebrated one of milton wherein he gives the portrait of satan with a dignity so suitable to the subject he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower his form had yet not lost all her original brightness nor appeared less thou archangel ruined and the excess of glory obscured as when the sun new risen looks through the horizontal misty air shorn of his beams or from behind the moon in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds on half the nations and with fear of change perplexes monarchs here is a very noble picture and in what does this poetical picture consist in images of a tower an archangel the sun rising through mists or in an eclipse the ruin of monarchs and the revolutions of kingdoms the mind is hurried out of itself by a crowd of great and confused images which affect because they are crowded and confused for separate them and you lose much of the greatness and join them and you infallibly lose the clearness the images raised by poetry are always of this obscure kind though in general the effects of poetry are by no means to be attributed to the images it raises but painting when we have allowed for the pleasure of imitation can only affect simply by the images it presents and even in painting a judicious obscurity in some things contributes to the effect of the picture because the images in painting are exactly similar to those in nature and in nature dark confused uncertain images have a greater power on the fancy to form the grander passions than those have which are more clear and determinate but where and when this observation may be applied to practice and how far it shall be extended will be better deduced from the nature of the subject and from the occasion than from any rules that can be given  i am sensible that this idea has met with opposition and is likely still to be rejected by several but let it be considered that hardly any thing can strike the mind with its greatness which does not make some sort of approach toward infinity which nothing can do whilst we are able to perceive its bounds but to fee an object distinctly and to perceive its bounds is one and the same thing a clear idea is therefore another name for alittle idea there is a passage in the book of job amazingly sublime and this sublimity is principally due to the terrible uncertainty of the thing described in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep salleth upon men fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice  shall mortal man be more just than god we are first prepared with the utmost solemnity for the vision we are first terrified before we are let even into the obscure cause of our emotion but when this grand cause of terror makes its appearance what is it is it not wrapped up in the shades of its own incomprehensible darkness more aweful more striking more terrible than the liveliest description than the clearest painting could possibly represent it when painters have attempted to give us clear representations of these very fanciful and terrible ideas they have i think almost always failed insomuch that i have been at a loss in all the pictures i have seen of hell whether the painter did not intend something ludicrous several painters have handled a subject of this kind with a view of assembling as many horrid phantoms as their imaginations could suggest but all the designs i have chanced to meet of the temptations of st anthony were rather a sort of odd wild grotesques than any thing capable of producing a serious passion in all these subjects poetry is very happy its apparitions its chimeras its harpies its allegorical figures are grand and affecting and though virgils fame and homers discord are obscure they are magnificent figures these figures in painting would be clear enough but i fear they might become ridiculous  sublime and beautiful  supply the sacred and reserved right of the commons  speech on american taxation  switzerland as to switzerland it is a country whose long union rather than its possible division is the matter of wonder here i know they entertain very sanguine hopes the aggregation to france of the democratic swiss republics appears to them to be a work half done by their very form and it might seem to them rather an increase of importance to these little commonwealths than a derogation from their independency or a change in the manner of their government upon any quarrel amongst the cantons nothing is more likely than such an event as to the aristocratic republics the general clamor and hatred which the french excite against the very name and with more facility and success than against monarchs and the utter impossibility of their government making any sort of resistance against an insurrection where they have no troops and the people are all armed and trained render their hopes in that quarter far indeed from unfounded it is certain that the republic of berne thinks itself obliged to a vigilance next to hostile and to imprison or expel all the french whom they find in their territories but indeed those aristocracies which comprehend whatever is considerable wealthy and valuable in switzerland do now so wholly depend upon opinion and the humor of their multitude that the lightest puff of wind is sufficient to blow them down if france under its ancient regimen and upon the ancient principles of policy was the support of the germanic constitution it was much more so of that of switzerland which almost from the very origin of that confederacy rested upon the closeness of its connection with france on which the swiss cantons wholly reposed themselves for the preservation of the parts of their body in their respective rights and permanent forms as well as for the maintenance of all in their general independency  switzerland and germany are the first objects of the new french politicians when i contemplate what they have done at home which is in effect little less than an amazing conquest wrought by a change of opinion in a great part to be sure far from altogether very sudden i cannot help letting my thoughts run along with their designs and without attending to geographical order to consider the other states of europe so far as they may be any way affected by this astonishing revolution if early steps are not taken in some way or other to prevent the spreading of this influence i scarcely think any of them perfectly secure  memorial on the affairs of france in       sect french atheists i must declare that the doctrine and discipline of this sect is one of the most alarming circumstances relating to it and the attempt to compare them with the opinions of school theologicians is a thing in itself highly alarming i know that when men possess the best principles the passions lead them to act in opposition to them but when the moral principles are formed systematically to play into the hand of the passions when that which is to correct vice and to restrain violence is by an infernal doctrine daringly avowed carefully propagated enthusiastically held and practically followed i shall think myself treated like a child when i hear this compared to a controversy in the schools when i see a great country with all its resources possessed by this sect and turned to its purposes i must be worse than a child to conceive it a thing indifferent to me when this great country is so near me and otherwise so situated that except through its territory i can hardly have a communication with any other the state of moral and political opinion and moral and political discipline in that country becomes of still greater importance to me when robbers assassins and rebels are not only debauched but endoctrinated regularly by a course of inverted education into murder insurrection and the violation of all property i hold that this instead of excusing or palliating their offenses inspires a peculiar venom into every evil act they do and that all such universities of crimes and all such proessors of robbery are in a perpetual state of hostility with mankind  regicide peace  summum jus when confidence is once restored the odious and suspicious summum jus will perish of course  speech on american taxation  taste general idea of taste but to cut off all pretense for cavilling i mean by the word taste no more than that faculty or those faculties of the mind which are affected with or which form a judgment of the works of imagination and the elegant arts this is i think the most general idea of that word and what is the least connected with any particular theory and my point in this inquiry is to find whether there are any principles on which the imagination is affected so common to all so grounded and certain as to supply the means of reasoning satisfactorily about them and such principles of taste i fancy there are however paradoxical it may seem to those who on a superficial view imagine that there is so great a diversity of tastes both in kind and degree that nothing can be more determinate  all the natural powers in man which i know that are conversant about external objects are the senses the imagination and the judgment and first with regard to the senses we do and we must suppose that as the conformation of their organs are nearly or altogether the same in all men so the manner of perceiving external objects is in all men the same or with little difference we are satisfied that what appears to be light to one eye appears light to another that what seems sweet to one palate is sweet to another that what is dark and bitter to this man is likewise dark and bitter to that and we conclude in the same manner of great and little hard and soft hot and cold rough and smooth and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies if we suffer ourselves to imagine that their senses present to different men different images of things this skeptical proceeding will make every sort of reasoning on every subject vain and frivolous even that skeptical reasoning itself which had persuaded us to entertain a doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions but as there will be little doubt that bodies present similar images to the whole species it must necessarily be allowed that the pleasures and the pains which every object excites in one man it must raise in all mankind whilst it operates naturally simply and by its proper powers only for if we deny this we must imagine that the same cause operating in the same manner and on subjects of the same kind will produce different effects which would be highly absurd let us first consider this point in the sense of taste and the rather as the faculty in question has taken its name from that sense all men are agreed to call vinegar sour honey sweet and aloes bitter and as they are all agreed in finding these qualities in those objects they do not in the least differ concerning their effects with regard to pleasure and pain they all concur in calling sweetness pleasant and sourness and bitterness unpleasant here there is no diversity in their sentiments and that there is not appears fully from the consent of all men in the metaphors which are taken from the sense of taste a sour temper bitter expressions bitter curses a bitter fate are terms well and strongly understood by all and we are altogether as well understood when we say a sweet disposition a sweet person a sweet condition and the like it is confessed that custom and some other causes have made many deviations from the natural pleasures or pains which belong to these several tastes but then the power of distinguishing between the natural and the acquired relish remains to the very last a man frequently comes to prefer the taste of tobacco to that of sugar and the flavor of vinegar to that of milk but this makes no confusion in tastes whilst he is sensible that the tobacco and vinegar are not sweet and whilst he knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to these alien pleasures even with such a person we may speak and with sufficient precision concerning tastes but should any man be found who declares that to him tobacco has a taste like sugar and that he cannot distinguish between milk and vinegar or that tobacco and vinegar are sweet milk bitter and sugar sour we immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order and that his palate is utterly vitiated we are as far from conferring with such a person upon tastes as from reasoning concerning the relations of quantity with one who should deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole we do not call a man of this kind wrong in his notions but absolutely mad exceptions of this sort in either way do not at all impeach our general rule nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the relations of quantity or the taste of things so that when it is said taste cannot be disputed it can only mean that no one can strictly answer what pleasure or pain some particular man may find from the taste of some particular thing this indeed cannot be disputed but we may dispute and with sufficient clearness too concerning the things which are naturally pleasing or disagree able to the sense but when we talk of any peculiar or acquired relish then we must know the habits the prejudices or the distempers of this particular man and we must draw our conclusion from those  this agreement of mankind is not confined to the taste solely the principle of pleasure derived from sight is the same in all light is more pleasing than darkness summer when the earth is clad in green when the heavens are serene and bright is more agreeable than winter when every thing makes a different appearance i never remember that any thing beautiful whether a man a beast a bird or a plant was ever shown though it were to an hundred people that they did not all immediately agree that it was beautiful though some might have thought that it fell short of their expectation or that other things were still finer  sublime and beautiful  taste progress of taste a man to whom sculpture is new sees a barbers block or some ordinary piece of statuary he is immediately struck and pleased because he sees something like a human figure and entirely taken up with this likeness he does not at all attend to its defects no person i believe at the first time of seeing a piece of imitation ever did some time after we suppose that this novice lights upon a more artificial work of the same nature he now begins to look with contempt on what he admired at first not that he admired it even then for its unlikeness to a man but for that general though inaccurate resemblance which it bore to the human figure what he admired at different times in these so different figures is strictly the same and though his knowledge is improved his taste is not altered hitherto his mistake was from a want of knowledge in art and this arose from his inexperience but he may be still deficient from a want of knowledge in nature for it is possible that the man in question may stop here and that the masterpiece of a great hand may please him no more than the middling performance of a vulgar artist and this not for want of better or higher relish but because all men do not observe with sufficient accuracy on the human figure to enable them to judge properly of an imitation of it and that the critical taste does not depend upon a superior principle in men but upon superior knowledge may appear from several instances the story of the ancient painter and the shoemaker is very well known the shoemaker set the painter right with regard to some mistakes he had made in the shoe of one of his figures and which the painter who had not made such accurate observations on shoes and was content with a general resemblance had never observed but this was no impeachment to the taste of the painter it only showed some want of knowledge in the art of making shoes let us imagine that an anatomist had come into the painters working room his piece is in general well done the figure in question in a good attitude and the parts well adjusted to their various movements yet the anatomist critical in his art may observe the swell of some muscle not quite just in the peculiar action of the figure here the anatomist observes what the painter had not observed and he passes by what the shoemaker had remarked but a want of the last critical knowledge in anatomy no more reflected on the natural good taste of the painter or of any common observer of his piece than the want of an exact knowledge in the formation of a shoe a fine piece of a decollated head of st john the baptist was shown to a turkish emperor he praised many things but he observed one defect he observed that the skin did not shrink from the wounded part of the neck the sultan on this occasion though his observation was very just discovered no more natural taste than the painter who executed this piece or than a thousand european connoisseurs who probably never would have made the same observation his turkish majesty had indeed been well acquainted with that terrible spectacle which the others could only have represented in their imagination on the subject of their dislike there is a difference between all these people arising from the different kinds and degrees of their knowledge but there is something in common to the painter the shoemaker the anatomist and the turkish emperor the pleasure arising from a natural object so far as each perceives it justly imitated the satisfaction in seeing an agreeable figure the sympathy proceeding from a striking and affecting incident so far as taste is natural it is nearly common to all  ibid  taxation an easy business taxing is an easy business any projector can contrive new impositions any bungler can add to the old but is it

only difference between pain and terror is that things which cause pain operate on the mind by the intervention of the body whereas things that cause terror generally affect the bodily organs by the operation of the mind suggesting the danger but both agreeing either primarily or secondarily in producing a tension contraction or violent emotion of the nerves they agree likewise in every thing

distresses the only difference is the pleasure resulting from the effects of imitation for it is never so perfect but we can perceive it is imitation and on that principle are somewhat pleased with it and indeed in some cases we derive as much or more pleasure from that source than from the thing itself but then i imagine we shall be much mistaken if we attribute any considerable part of our satisfaction in tragedy to the consideration that tragedy is a deceit and its representation no realities the nearer it approaches the reality and the further it removes us from all idea of fiction the more perfect is its power but be its power of what kind it will it never approaches to what it represents choose a day on which to represent the most sublime and affecting tragedy we have appoint

minds are erect with expectation let it be reported that a state criminal of high rank is on the point of being executed in the adjoining square in a moment the emptiness of the theater would demonstrate the comparative weakness of the imitative arts and proclaim the triumph of the real sympathy i believe that this notion of our having a simple pain in the reality yet a delight in the representation arises from hence that we do not sufficiently distinguish what we would by no means choose to do from what we should be eager enough to see if it was once done we delight in seeing things which so far from doing our heartiest wishes would be to see redressed this noble capital the pride of england and of europe i believe no man is so strangely wicked as to desire to see destroyed by a conflagration or an earthquake though he should be removed himself to the greatest distance from the danger but suppose such a fatal accident to have happened what numbers from all parts would crowd to behold the ruins and amongst them many who would have been content never to have seen london in its glory nor is it either in real or fictitious distresses our immunity from them which produces our delight in my own mind i can discover nothing like it i apprehend that this mistake is owing to a sort of sophism by which we are frequently imposed upon it arises from our not distinguishing between what is indeed a necessary condition to our doing or suffering any thing in general and what is the cause of some particular act if a man kills me with a sword it is a necessary condition to this that we should have been both of us alive before the fact and yet it would be absurd to say that our being both living creatures was the cause of his crime and of my death so it is certain that it is absolutely necessary my life should be out of any imminent hazard before i can take a delight in the sufferings of others real or imaginary or indeed in any thing else from any cause whatsoever but then it is a sophism to argue from thence that this immunity is the cause of my delight either on these or on any occasions no one can distinguish such a cause of satisfaction in his own mind i believe nay when we do not suffer any very acute pain nor are exposed to any imminent danger of our lives we can feel for others whilst we suffer ourselves and often then most when we are softened by affliction we see with pity even distresses which we would accept in the place of our own  sublime and beautiful  transactions of past ages we are very incorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of past ages where no passions deceive and where the whole train of circumstances from the trifling cause to the tragical event is set in an orderly series before us  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  tyrant and his favorite or tyranny doubled there is hardly any prince without a favorite by whom he is governed in as arbitrary a manner as he governs the wretches subjected to him here the tyranny is doubled there are two courts and two interests both very different from the interests of the people the favorite knows that the regard of a tyrant is as unconstant and capricious as that of a woman and concluding his time to be short he makes haste to fill up the measure of his iniquity in rapine in luxury and in revenge every avenue to the throne is shut up he oppresses and ruins the people whilst he persuades the prince that those murmurs raised by his own oppression are the effects of disaffection to the princes government then is the natural violence of despotism inflamed and aggravated by hatred and revenge to deserve well of the state is a crime against the prince to be popular and to be a traitor are considered as synonymous terms even virtue is dangerous as an aspiring quality that claims an esteem by itself and independent of the countenance of the court what has been said of the chief is true of the inferior officers of this species of government each in his province exercising the same tyranny and grinding the people by an oppression the more severely felt as it is near them and exercised by base and subordinate persons for the gross of the people they are considered as a mere herd of cattle and really in a little time become no better all principle of honest pride all sense of the dignity of their nature is lost in their slavery the day says homer which makes a man a slave takes away half his worth and in fact he loses every impulse to action but that low and base one of fear  in this kind of government human nature is not only abused and insulted but it is actually degraded and sunk into a species of brutality  vindication of natural society  tyrants the punishment of real tyrants is a noble and awful act of justice and it has with truth been said to be consolatory to the human mind  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  tyranny few are the partisans of departed

head of offense against the governor general of that day  speech on mr foxs east india bill  tyranny ancient a great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny is torn to rags the rest is entirely out of fashion  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  toulon i have toulon in my eye it was with infinite sorrow i heard that in taking the king of frances fleet in trust we instantly unrigged and dismasted the ships instead of keeping them in a condition to escape in case of disaster and in order to fulfill our trust that is to hold them for the use of the owner and in the mean time to employ them for our common service these ships are now so circumstanced that if we are forced to evacuate toulon they must fall into the hands of the enemy or be burnt by ourselves i know this is by some considered as a fine thing for us but the athenians ought not to be better than the english or mr pit less virtuous than aristides  are we then so poor in resources that we can do no better with eighteen or twenty ships of the line than to burn them had we sent for french royalist naval officers of which some hundreds are to be had and made them select such seamen as they could trust and filled the rest with our own and mediterranean seamen which are all over italy to be had by thousands and put them under judicious english commanders in chief and with a judicious mixture of our own subordinates the west indies would at this day have been ours it may be said that these french officers would take them for the king of france and that they would not be in our power be it so the islands would not be ours but they would not be jacobinized this is however a thing impossible they must in effect and substance be ours but all is upon that false principle of distrust which not confiding in strength can never have the full use of it they that pay and feed and equip must direct but i must speak plain upon this subject the french islands if they were all our own ought not to be all kept a fair partition only ought to be made of those territories this is a subject of policy very serious which has many relations and aspects just here i only hint at it as answering an objection whilst i state the mischievous consequences which suffer us to be surprised into a virtual breach of faith by confounding our ally with our enemy because they both belong to the same geographical territory  my clear opinion is that toulon ought to be made what we set out with a royal french city by the necessity of the case it must be under the influence civil and military of the allies but the only way of keeping that jealous and discordant mass from tearing its component parts to pieces and hazarding the loss of the whole is to put the place into the nominal government of the regent his officers being approved by us this i say is absolutely necessary for a poise amongst ourselves otherwise is it to be believed that the spaniards who hold that place with us in a sort of partnership contrary to our mutual interest will see us absolute masters of the mediterranean with gibraltar on one side and toulon on the other with a quiet and composed mind whilst we do little less than declare that we are to take the whole west indies into our hands leaving the vast unwieldy and feeble body of the spanish dominions in that part of the world absolutely at our mercy without any power to balance us in the smallest degree  nothing is so fatal to a nation as an extreme of selfpartiality and the total want of consideration of what others will naturally hope or fear spain must think she sees that we are taking advantage of the confusions which reign in france to disable that country and of course every country from affording her protection and in the end to turn the spanish monarchy into a province if she saw things in a proper point of light to be sure she would not consider any other plan of politics as of the least moment in comparison of the extinction of jacobinism but her ministers to say the best of them are vulgar politicians it is no wonder that they should postpone this great point or balance it by considerations of the common politics that is the questions of power between state and state if we manifestly endeavor to destroy the balance especially the maritime and commercial balance both in europe and the west indies the latter their sore and vulnerable part from fear of what france may do for spain hereafter is it to be wondered that spain infinitely weaker than we are weaker indeed than such a mass of empire ever was should feel the same fears from our uncontrouled power that we give way to ourselves from a supposed resurrection of the ancient power of france under a monarchy it signifies nothing whether we are wrong or right in the abstract but in respect to our relation to spain with such principles followed up in practice it is absolutely impossible that any cordial alliance can subsist between the two nations if spain goes naples will speedily follow prussia is quite certain and thinks of nothing but making a market of the present confusions italy is broken and divided switzerland is jacobinized i am afraid completely i have long seen with pain the progress of french principles in that country things cannot go on upon the present bottom the possession of toulon which well managed might be of the greatest advantage will be the greatest misfortune that ever happened to this nation the more we multiply troops there the more we shall multiply causes and means of quarrel amongst ourselves i know but one way of avoiding it which is to give a greater degree of simplicity to our politics our situation does necessarily render them a good deal involved and to this evil instead of increasing it we ought to apply all the remedies in our power  see what is in that place the consequence to say nothing of every other of this complexity toulon has as it were two gates an english and a spanish the english gate is by our policy fast barred against the entrance of any royalists the spaniards open theirs i fear upon no fixed principle and with very little judgment by means however of this foolish mean and jealous policy on our side all the royalists whom the english might select as most practicable and most subservient to honest views are totally excluded of those admitted the spaniards are masters as to the inhabitants they are a nest of jacobins which is delivered into our hands not from principle but from fear the inhabitants of toulon may be described in few words it is differtum naulis cauponibus atque malignis the rest of the seaports are of the same description  another thing which i cannot account for is the sending for the bishop of toulon and afterward forbidding his entrance this is as directly contrary to the declaration as it is to the practice of the allied powers the king of prussia did better when he took verdun he actually reinstated the bishop and his chapter when he thought he should be the master of chalons he called the bishop from flanders to put him into possession the austrians have restored the clergy wherever they obtained possession we have proposed to restore religion as well as monarchy and in toulon we have restored neither the one nor the other it is very likely that the jacobin sansculottes or some of them objected to this measure who rather choose to have the atheistic bussoons of clergy they have got to sport with till they are ready to come forward with the rest of their worthy brethren in paris and other places to declare that they are a set of impostors that they never believed in god and never will preach any sort of religion if we give way to our jacobins in this point it is fully and fairly putting the government civil and ecclesiastical not in the king of france to whom as the protector and governor and in substance the head of the gallican church the nomination to the bishoprics belonged and who made the bishop of toulon it does not leave it with him or even in the hands of the king of england or the king of spain but in the basest jacobins of a low seaport to exercise pro tempore the sovereignty if this point of religion is thus given up the grand instrument for reclaiming france is abandoned  memorial on the affairs of france in       turkey where the finest countries in the most genial climates in the world are wasted by peace more

perishes under the eye of the observer  reflections on the revolution in france  variation why beautiful another principal property of beautiful objects is that the line of their parts is continually varying its direction but it varies it by a very insensible deviation it never varies it so quickly as to surprise or by the sharpness of its angle to cause any twitching or convulsion of the optic nerve nothing long continued in the same manner nothing very suddenly varied can be beautiful because both are opposite to that agreeable relaxation which is the characteristic effect of beauty it is thus in all the senses a motion in a right line is that manner of moving next to a very gentle descent in which we meet the least resistance yet it is not that manner of moving which next to a descent wearies us the least rest certainly tends to relax yet there is a species of motion which relaxes more than rest a gentle oscillatory motion arising and falling rocking sets children to sleep better than absolute rest there is indeed scarce any thing at that age which gives more pleasure than to be gently lifted up and down the manner of playing which their nurses use with children and the weighing and swinging used afterward by themselves as a favorite amusement evince this very sufficiently most people must have observed the sort of sense they have had on being swiftly drawn in an easy coach on a smooth turf with gradual ascents and declivities this will give a better idea of the beautiful and point out its probable cause better than almost any thing else on the contrary when one is hurried over a rough rocky broken road the pain felt by these sudden inequalities shows why similar sights feelings and sounds are so contrary to beauty and with regard to the feeling it is exactly the same in its effect or very nearly the same whether for instance i move my hand along the surface of a body of a certain shape or whether such a body is moved along my hand but to bring this analogy of the senses home to the eye if a body presented to that sense has such a waving surface that the rays of light reflected from it are in a continual insensible deviation from the strongest to the weakest which is always the case in a surface gradually unequal it must be exactly similar in its effect on the eye and touch upon the one of which it operates directly on the other indirectly and this body will be beautiful if the lines which compose its surface are not continued even so varied in a manner that may weary or dissipate the attention the variation itself must be continually varied  sublime and beautiful  victory the season of victory is the time for treating with honor and advantage  letter to the sheriffs of bristol  victors barbarous their policy the policy

on the revolution in france  vote see parliament the taking away of a vote is the taking away the shield which the subject has not only against the oppression of power but that worst of all oppressions the persecution of private society and private manners no candidate for parliamentary influence is obliged to the least attention toward them either in cities or counties  letter on the penal laws against irish catholics  vicinity civil the law of civil vicinity distance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men but it often renders their exercise impracticable the same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious but there are situations where this difficulty does not occur and in which therefore these duties are obligatory and these rights are to be asserted it has ever been the method of public jurists to draw the analogies on which they form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in civil community civil laws are not all of them merely positive those which are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable provision belong to universal equity and are universally applicable almost the whole praetorian law is such there is a law of neighborhood which does not leave a man perfect master on his own ground when a neighbor sees a new erection in the nature of a nuisance set up at his door he has a right to represent it to the judge who on his part has a right to order the work to be staid or if established to be removed on this head the parent law is express and clear and has made many wise provisions which without destroying regulate and restrain the right of ownership by the right of vicinage no innovation is permitted that may redound even secondarily to the prejudice of a neighbor the whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law  de novi operis nunciatione is founded on the principle that no new use should be made of a mans private liberty of operating upon his private property from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended by his neighbor this law of denunciation is prospective it is to anticipate what is called damnum infectum or damnum nondum factum that is a damage justly apprehended but not actually done even before it is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not the judge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point can be determined this prompt interference is grounded on principles favorable to both parties it is preventive of mischief difficult to be repaired and of ill blood difficult to be softened  the rule of law therefore which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of equity and justifies the promptness of the remedy because as it is well observed res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat and periculosa est dilatio this right of denunciation does not hold when things continue however inconveniently to the neighborhood according to the ancient mode for there is a sort of presumption against novelty drawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs and the maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down velustas pro lege semper habetur  such is the law of civil vicinity now where there is no constituted judge as between independent states there is not the vicinage itself is the natural judge it is preventively the assertor of its own rights or remedially their avenger neighbors are presumed to take cognizance of each others acts  vicini vicinorum sacta presumuntur scire this principle which like the rest is as true of nations as of men has bestowed on the grand vicinage of europe a duty to know and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuisance of the importance of that innovation and the mischief of that nuisance they are to be sure bound to judge not litigiously but it is in their competence to judge what in civil society is a ground of action in politic society is a ground of war but the exercise of that competent jurisdiction is a matter of moral prudence as suits in civil society so war in the political is ever a matter of great deliberation it is not this or that particular proceeding picked out here and there as a subject of quarrel that will do there must be an aggregate of mischief  regicide peace  vulgar and mechanical politicians see america all this i know well enough will sound wild and chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and mechanical politicians who have no place among us a sort of people who think that nothing exists but what is gross and material and who therefore far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine but to men truly initiated and rightly taught these ruling and master principles which in the opinion of such men as i have mentioned have no substantial existence are in truth every thing and all in all magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom and a great empire and little minds go ill together if we are conscious of our situation and glow with zeal to fill our place as becomes our station and ourselves we ought to auspicate all our public proceedings on america with the old warning of the church sursum corda we ought to elevate our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order of providence has called us by adverting to the dignity of this high calling our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious empire and have made the most extensive and the only honorable conquests not by destroying but by promoting the wealth the number the happiness of the human race let us get an american revenue as we have got an american empire english privileges

ugliness and as it proceeds from causes opposite to those of positive beauty we cannot consider it until we come to treat of that between beauty and ugliness there is a sort of mediocrity in which the assigned proportions are most commonly found but this has no effect upon the passions  sublime and beautiful  war ground of war with france various persons may concur in the same measure on various grounds they may be various without being contrary to or exclusive of each other i thought the insolent unprovoked aggression of the regicide upon our ally of holland a good ground of war i think his manifest attempt to overturn the balance of europe a good ground of war as a good ground of war i consider his declaration of war on his majesty and his kingdom but though i have taken all these to my aid i consider them as nothing more than as a sort of evidence to indicate the treasonable mind within it was not for their former declaration of war nor for any specific act of hostility that i primarily wished to resist them or to persevere in my resistance it was because the faction in france had assumed a form had adopted a body of principles and maxims and had regularly and systematically acted on them by which she virtually had put herself in a posture which was in itself a declaration of war against mankind  regicide peace  war view of war that touches our own country let the portion of our history from the year      to      be brought before us we shall find that in all that period of twentyfour years there were not above six that could be called an interval of peace and this interval was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for war during that period every one of the propositions of peace came from the enemy the first when they were accepted at the peace of ryswick the second where they were rejected at the congress at gertrudenburgh the last when the war ended by the treaty of utrecht even then a very great part of the nation and that which contained by far the most intelligent statesmen was against the conclusion of the war i do not enter into the merits of that question as between the parties i only state the existence of that opinion as a fact i mention the length of the war as a proof that though the countries which now compose the kingdom for a part of the time were not united and through all the time continued with a raw and ill cemented union and though they were further split into parties as vehement and more equally divided than now they are and that we were possessed of far less abundant resources in all kinds than we now enjoy  i mean to mark that under all these disadvantages the english nation was then a great people that we had then an high mind and a constancy unconquerable that we were then inspired with no flushy passions but such as were durable as well as warm such as corresponded to the great interests we had at stake this force of character was inspired as all such spirit must ever be from above government gave the impulse as well may we fancy that of itself the sea will swell and without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore as that the gross mass of the people will be moved and elevated without the influence of superior authority or superior mind  this impulse ought in my opinion to have been given in this war and it ought to have been continued to it at every instant it is made if ever war was made to touch all the great springs of action in the human breasts it ought not to have been a war of apology the minister had in this conflict wherewithal to glory in success to be consoled in adversity to hold high his principle in all fortunes if it were not given him to support the falling edifice he ought to bury himself under the ruins of the civilized world all the art of greece and all the pride and power of eastern monarchs never heaped upon their ashes so grand a monument  there were days when his great mind was up to the crisis of the world he is called to act in his manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wisdom of such sentiments but the little have triumphed over the great and unnatural not an unusual victory i am sure you cannot forget with how much uneasiness we heard in conversation the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this contest that he was willing to try the war for a year or two and if it did not succeed then to vote for peace as if war was a matter of experiment as if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic as if the dire goddess that presides over it with her murderous spear in her hand and her gorgon at her breast was a coquette to be flirted with we ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity that loves courage but commands counsel war never leaves a nation where it was found the interval between that and peace is indeed a very hideous dream in which the genius and the mortal instruments are seriously at work it is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indecision but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment when so taken up it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid as fully and as extensively considered for peace may be made as unadvisedly as war nothing is so rash as fear and the counsels of pusillanimity very rarely put off whilst they are always sure to aggravate the evils they would fly from  in that great war carried on against louis the xivth for near eighteen years government spared no pains to satisfy the people that though they were to be animated by a desire of glory glory was not their ultimate object but that every thing dear to them in religion in law in liberty every thing which as freemen as englishmen and as citizens of the great commonwealth of christendom they had at heart was then at stake whether they did not exaggerate the danger i will not dispute a danger and no small danger unquestionably there was and that long and arduous war was pursued upon at least as solid and manly grounds as the peace was made which put an end to it a danger to avert a danger  a present inconvenience and suffering to prevent a foreseen future and a worse calamity  these are the motives that belong to an animal who in his constitution is at once adventurous and provident circumspect and daring whom his creator has made as the poet says of large discourse looking before and after but never can a vehement and sustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation it has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts of adversity even where men are willing as sometimes they are to barter their blood for lucre to hazard their safety to gratify their avarice that passion like all the passions must see it is objects distinct and near at hand  the passions are hungry and impatient speculative plunder contingent spoil future long adjourned uncertain booty pillage which must enrich a late posterity and which possibly may not reach to posterity at all these for any length of time will never support a mercenary war the people are in the right the calculation of profit in all such wars is false on balancing the account of such wars ten thousand hogsheads of sugar are purchased at ten thousand times their price the blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man it is well shed for our family for our friends for our god for our country for our kind the rest is vanity the rest is crime  in the war of the grand alliance most of these considerations voluntarily and naturally had their part some were pressed into the service the political interest easily went in the track of the natural sentiment in the reverse course the carriage does not follow freely i am sure the natural feeling as i have just said is a far more predominant ingredient in this war than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom  if the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a just war this which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all heads which ought to wear them and with the crowns to smite off the sacred heads themselves this is a just war  if a war to prevent louis the fourteenth from imposing his religion was just a war to prevent the murderers of louis the sixteenth from imposing their irreligion upon us is just a war to prevent the operation of a system which makes life without dignity and death without hope is a just war  if to preserve political independence and civil freedom to nations was a just ground of war a war to preserve national independence property liberty life and honor from certain universal havoc is a war just necessary manly pious and we are bound to persevere in it by every principle divine and human as long as the system which menaces them all and all equally has an existence in the world  ibid  war the present a religious war we cannot if we would delude ourselves about the true state of this dreadful contest it is a religious war it includes in its object undoubtedly every other interest of society as well as this but this is the principal and leading feature it is through this destruction of religion that our enemies propose the accomplishment of all their other views the french revolution impious at once and fanatical had no other plan for domestic power and foreign empire look at all the proceedings of the national assembly from the first day of declaring itself such in the year      to this very hour and you will find full half of their business to be directly on this subject in fact it is the spirit of the whole the religious system called the constitutional church was on the face of the whole proceeding set up only as a mere temporary amusement to the people and so constantly stated in all their conversations till the time should come when they might with safety cast off the very appearance of all religion whatsoever and persecute christianity throughout europe with fire and sword the constitutional clergy are not the ministers of any religion they are the agents and instruments of this horrible conspiracy against all morals it was from a sense of this that in the english addition to the articles proposed at st domingo tolerating all religions we very wisely refused to suffer that kind of traitors and buffoons  this religious war is not a controversy between sect and sect as formerly but a war against all sects and all religions the question is not whether you are to overturn the catholic to set up the protestant such an idea in the present state of the world is too contemptible our business is to leave to the schools the discussion of the controverted points abating as much as we can the acrimony of disputants on all sides it is for christian statesmen as the world is now circumstanced to secure their common basis and not to risque the subversion of the whole fabric by pursuing these distinctions with an illtimed zeal we have in the present grand alliance all modes of government as well as all modes of religion in government we mean to restore that which notwithstanding our diversity of forms we are all agreed in as fundamental in government the same principle ought to guide us in the religious part conforming the mode not to our particular ideas for in that point we have no ideas in common but to what will best promote the great general ends of the alliance as statesmen we are to see which of those modes best suits with the interests of such a commonwealth as we wish to secure and promote there can be no doubt but that the catholic religion which is fundamentally the religion of france must go with the monarchy of france we know that the monarchy did not survive the hierarchy no not even in appearance for many months in substance not for a single hour as little can it exist in future if that pillar is taken away or even shattered and impaired  memorial on the affairs of france in       wales sketch of welsh history my next example is wales this country was said to be reduced by henry the third it was said more truly to be so by edward the first but though then conquered it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of england its old constitution whatever that might have been was destroyed and no good one was substituted in its place the care of that tract was put into the hands of lords marchers  a form of government of a very singular kind a strange heterogeneous monster something between hostility and government perhaps it has a sort of resemblance according to the modes of those times to that of commander in chief at present to whom all civil power is granted as secondary the manners of the welsh nation followed the genius of the government the people were ferocious restive savage and uncultivated sometimes composed never pacified wales within itself was in perpetual disorder and it kept the frontier of england in perpetual alarm benefits from it to the state there were none wales was only known to england by incursion and invasion  sir during that state of things parliament was not idle they attempted to subdue the fierce spirit of the welsh by all sorts of rigorous laws they prohibited by statute the sending all sorts of arms into wales as you prohibit by proclamation with something more of doubt on the legality the sending arms to america they disarmed the welsh by statute as you attempted but still with more question on the legality to disarm new england by an instruction they made an act to drag offenders from wales into england for trial as you have done but with more hardship with regard to america by another act where one of the parties was an englishman they ordained that his trial should be always by english they made acts to restrain trade as you do and they prevented the welsh from the use of fairs and markets as you do the americans from fisheries and foreign ports in short when the statutebook was not quite so much swelled as it is now you find no less than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the subject of wales  here we rub our hands  a fine body of precedents for the authority of parliament and the use of it  i admit it fully and pray add likewise to these precedents that all the while wales rid this kingdom like an incubus that it was an unprofitable and oppressive burden and that an englishman traveling in that country could not go six yards from the high road without being murdered  the march of the human mind is slow sir it was not until after two hundred years discovered that by an eternal law providence had decreed vexation to violence and poverty to rapine your ancestors did however at length open their eyes to the ill husbandry of injustice they found that the tyranny of a free people could of all tyrannies the least be endured and that laws made against an whole nation were not the most effectual methods for securing its obedience accordingly in the twentyseventh year of henry viii the course was entirely altered with a preamble stating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of england it gave to the welsh all the rights and privileges of english subjects a political order was established the military power gave way to the civil the marches were turned into counties but that a nation should have a right to english liberties and yet no share at all in the fundamental security of these liberties the grant of their own property seemed a thing so incongruous that eight years after that is in the thirtyfifth of that reign a complete and not illproportioned representation by counties and boroughs was bestowed upon wales by act of parliament from that moment as by a charm the tumults subsided obedience was restored peace order and civilization followed in the train of liberty  when the day star of the english constitution had arisen in their hearts all was harmony within and without  simul alba nautis stella refulsit defluit saxis agitatus humor

where  two letters to gentlemen in bristol  wealth of france in      the wealth of a country is another and no contemptible standard by which me may judge whether on the whole a government be protecting or destructive france far exceeds england in the multitude of her people but i apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to ours that it is not so equal in the distribution nor so ready in the circulation i believe the difference in the form of the two governments to be amongst the causes of this advantage on the side of england i speak of england not of the whole british dominions which if compared with those of france will in some degree weaken the comparative rate of wealth upon our side but that wealth which will not endure a comparison with the riches of england may constitute a very respectable degree of opulence mr neckers book published in      contains an accurate and interesting collection of facts relative to public economy and to political arithmetic and his speculations on the subject are in general wise and liberal in that work he gives an idea of the state of france very remote from the portrait of a country whose government was a perfect grievance an absolute evil admitting no cure but through the violent and uncertain remedy of a total revolution he affirms that from the year      to the year      there was coined at the mint of france in the species of gold and silver to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds sterling  it is impossible that mr necker should be mistaken in the amount of the bullion which has been coined in the mint it is a matter of official record the reasonings of this able financier concerning the quantity of gold and silver which remained for circulation when he wrote in      that is about four years before the deposition and imprisonment of the french king are not of equal certainty but they are laid on grounds so apparently solid that it is not easy to refuse a considerable degree of assent to his calculation he calculates the numeraire or what we call specie then actually existing in france at about eightyeight millions of the same english money a great accumulation of wealth for one country large as that country is mr neckar was so far from considering this influx of wealth as likely to cease when he wrote in      that he presumes upon a future annual increase of two per cent

power but by representation it might be supposed that their influence over the passions should be but light yet it is quite otherwise for we find by experience that eloquence and poetry are as capable nay indeed much more capable of making deep and lively impressions than any other arts and even than nature itself in very many cases and this arises chiefly from these three causes first that we take an extraordinary part in the passions of others and that we are easily affected and brought into sympathy by any tokens which are shown of them and there are no tokens which can express all the circumstances of most passions so fully as words so that if a person speaks upon any subject he can not only convey the subject to you but likewise the manner in which he is himself affected by it certain it is that the influence of most things on our passions is not so much from the things themselves as from our opinions concerning them and these again depend very much on the opinions of other men conveyable for the most part by words only secondly there are many things of a very affecting nature which can seldom occur in the reality but the words which represent them often do and thus they have an opportunity of making a deep impression and taking root in the mind whilst the idea of the reality was transient and to some perhaps never really occurred in any shape to whom it is notwithstanding very affecting as war death famine etc besides many ideas have never been at all presented to the senses of any men but by words as god angels devils heaven and hell all of which have however a great influence over the passions thirdly by words we have it in our power to make such combinations as we cannot possibly do otherwise by this power of combining we are able by the addition of wellchosen circumstances to give a new life and force to the simple object in painting we may represent any fine figure we please but we never can give it those enlivening touches which it may receive from words to represent an angel in a picture you can only draw a beautiful young man winged but what painting can furnish out any thing so grand as the addition of one word the angel of the lord it is true i have here no clear idea but these words affect the mind more than the sensible image did which is all i contend for a picture of priam dragged to the altars foot and there murdered if it were well executed would undoubtedly be very moving but there are very aggravating circumstances which it could never represent sanguine foedantem quos ipse sacraverat ignes as a further instance let us consider those lines of milton where he describes the travels of the fallen angels through their dismal habitation  over many a dark and dreary vale they passed and many a region dolorous over many a frozen many a fiery alp rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death a universe of death here is displayed the force of union in rocks caves lakes dens bogs fens and shades which yet would lose the greatest part of the effect if they were not the rocks caves lakes dens bogs fens and shades   of death this idea or this affection caused by a word which nothing but a word could annex to the others raises a very great degree of the sublime and this sublime is raised yet higher by what follows a  universe of death here are again two ideas not presentable but by language and an union of them great and amazing beyond conception if they may properly be called ideas which present no distinct image to the mind  but still it will be difficult to conceive how words can move the passions which belong to real objects without representing these objects clearly this is difficult to us because we do not sufficiently distinguish in our observations upon language between a clear expression and a strong expression these are frequently confounded with each other though they are in reality extremely different the former regards the understanding the latter belongs to the passions the one describes a thing as it is the other describes it as it is felt now as there is a moving tone of voice an impassioned countenance an agitated gesture which affect independently of the things about which they are exerted so there are words and certain dispositions of words which being peculiarly devoted to passionate subjects and always used by those who are under the influence of any passion touch and move us more than those which far more clearly and distinctly express the subject matter we yield to sympathy what we refuse to description the truth is all verbal description merely as naked description though never so exact conveys so poor and insufficient an idea of the thing described that it could scarcely have the smallest effect if the speaker did not call in to his aid those modes of speech that mark a strong and lively feeling in himself then by the contagion of our passions we catch a fire already kindled in another which probably might never have been struck out by the object described words by strongly conveying the passions by those means which we have already mentioned fully compensate for their weakness in other respects it may be observed that very polished languages and such as are praised for their superior clearness and perspicuity are generally deficient in strength the french language has that perfection and that defect whereas the oriental tongues and in general the languages of most unpolished people have a great force and energy of expression and this is but natural uncultivated people are but ordinary observers of things and not critical in distinguishing them but for that reason they admire more and are more affected with what they see and therefore express themselves in a warmer and more passionate manner if the affection be well conveyed it will work its effect without any clear idea often without any idea at all of the thing which has originally given rise to it  it might be expected from the fertility of the subject that i should consider poetry as it regards the sublime and beautiful more at large but it must be observed that in this light it has been often and well handled already it was not my design to enter into the criticism of the sublime and beautiful in any art but to attempt to lay down such principles as may tend to ascertain to distinguish and to form a sort of standard for them which purposes i thought might be best effected by an enquiry into the porperties of such things in nature as raise love and astonishment in us and by showing in what manner they operated to produce these passions words were only so far to be considered as to show upon what principle they were capable of being the representatives of these natural things and by what powers they were able to affect us often as strongly as the things they represent and sometimes much more strongly  sublime and beautiful  whigs new and ancient these new whigs hold that the sovereignty whether exercised by one or many did not only originate from the people a position not denied nor worth denying or assenting to but that in the people the same sovereignty constantly and unalienably resides that the people may lawfully depose kings not only for misconduct but without any misconduct at all that they may set up any new fashion of government for themselves or continue without any government at their pleasure that the people are essentially their own rule and their will the measure of their conduct that the tenure of magistracy is not a proper subject of contract because magistrates have duties but no rights and that if a contract de facto is made with them in one age allowing that it binds at all it only binds those who were immediately concerned in it but does not pass to posterity these doctrines concerning the people a term which they are far from accurately defining but by which from many circumstances it is plain enough they mean their own faction if they should grow by early arming by treachery or violence into the prevailing force tend in my opinion to the utter subversion not only of all government in all modes and to all stable securities to rational freedom but to all the rules and principles of morality itself  i assert that the ancient whigs held doctrines totally different from those i have last mentioned i assert that the foundations laid down by the commons on the trial of doctor sacheverel for justifying the revolution of      are the very same laid down in mr burkes reflections that is to say  a breach of the original contract implied and expressed in the constitution of this country as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in king lords and commons  that the fundamental subversion of this ancient constitution by one of its parts having been attempted and in effect accomplished justified the revolution that it was justified only upon the necessity of the case as the only means left for the recovery of that ancient constitution formed by the original contract of the british state as well as for the future preservation of the same government  these societies of modern whigs push their insolence as far as it can go in order to prepare the minds of the people for treason and rebellion they represent the king as tainted with principles of despotism from the circumstance of his having dominions in germany in direct defiance of the most notorious truth they describe his government there to be a despotism whereas it is a free constitution in which the states of the electorate have their part in the government and this privilege has never been infringed by the king or that i have heard of by any of his predecessors the constitution of the electoral dominions has indeed a double control both from the laws of the empire and from the privileges of the country whatever rights the king enjoys as elector have been always parentally exercised and the calumnies of these scandalous societies have not been authorized by a single complaint of oppression  appeal from the new to the old whigs  whigs character of the whigs in the reign of queen anne in one of the most fortunate periods of our history this country was governed by a connection i mean the great connection of whigs in the reign of queen anne they were complimented upon the principle of this connection by a poet who was in high esteem with them addison who knew their sentiments could not praise them for what they considered as no proper subject of commendation as a poet who knew his business he could not applaud them for a thing which in general estimation was not highly reputable addressing himself to britain thy favorites grow not up by fortunes sport or from the crimes or follies of a court on the firm basis of desert they rise from longtryd faith and friendships holy ties   the whigs of those days believed that the only proper method of rising into power was through hard essays of practiced friendship and experimented fidelity at that time it was not imagined that patriotism was a bloody idol which required the sacrifice of children and parents or dearest connexions in private life and of all the virtues that rise from those relations they were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality to imagine that a spirit of moderation was properly shown in patiently bearing the sufferings of your friends or that disinterestedness was clearly manifested at the expense of other peoples fortune they believed that no men could act with effect who did not act in concert that no men could act in concert who did not act with confidence and that no men could act with confidence who were not bound together by common opinions common affections and common interests  these wise men for such i must call lord sunderland lord godolphin lord summers and lord marlborough were too well principled in these maxims upon which the whole fabric of public strength is built to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childish talker they were not afraid that they should be called an ambitious junto or that their resolution to stand or fall together should by placemen be interpreted into a scuffle for places  ibid  wit and judgment mr lock very justly and finely observes of wit that it is chiefly conversant in tracing resemblances he remarks at the same time that the business of judgment is rather in finding differences it may perhaps appear on this supposition that there is no material distinction between the wit and the judgment as they both seem to result from different operations of the same faculty of comparing but in reality whether they are or are not dependant on the same power of the mind they differ so very materially in many respects that a perfect union of wit and judgment is one of the rarest things in the world when two distinct objects are unlike to each other it is only what we expect things are in their common way and therefore they make no impression on the imagination but when two distinct objects have a resemblance we are struck we attend to them and we are pleased the mind of man has naturally a far greater alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in searching for differences because by making resemblances we produce new images we unite we create we enlarge our stock but in making distinctions we offer no food at all to the imagination the task itself is more severe and irksome and what pleasure we derive from it is something of a negative and indirect nature a piece of news is told me in the morning this merely as a piece of news as a fact added to my stock gives me some pleasure in the evening i find there was nothing in it what do i gain by this but the dissatisfaction to find that i had been imposed upon hence it is that men are much more naturally inclined to belief than to incredulity and it is upon this principle that the most ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in similitudes comparisons metaphors and allegories who have been weak and backward in distinguishing and sorting their ideas and it is for a reason of this kind that homer and the oriental writers though very fond of similitudes and though they often strike out such as are truly admirable they seldom take care to have them exact that is they are taken with the general resemblance they paint it strongly and they take no notice of the difference which may be found between the things compared  sublime and beautiful  will and duty the author of our being has disposed us not according to our will but his own i cannot too often recommend it to the serious consideration of all men who think civil society to be within the province of moral jurisdiction that if we owe to it any duty it is not subject to our will duties are not voluntary duty and will are even contradictory terms now though society might be at first a voluntary act which in many cases it undoubtedly was it continues under a permanent standing covenant coexisting with the society and it attaches upon every individual of that society without any formal act of his own this is warranted by the general practice arising out of the general sense of mankind men without their choice derive benefits from that association without their choice they are subjected to duties in consequence of these benefits and without their choice they enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual look through the whole of life and the whole system of duties much the strongest moral obligations are such as were never the results of our option i allow that if no supreme ruler exists wise to form and potent to enforce the moral law there is no sanction to any contract virtual or even actual against the will of prevalent power on that hypothesis let any set of men be strong enough to set their duties at defiance and they cease to be duties any longer we have but this one appeal against irresistible power  si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi taking it for granted that i do not write to the disciples of the parisian philosophy i may assume that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of existence and that having disposed and marshalled us by a divine tactic not according to our will but according to his he has in and by that disposition virtually subjected us to act the part which belongs to the place assigned us we have obligations to mankind at large which are not in consequence of any special voluntary pact they arise from the relation of man to man and the relation of man to god which relations are not matters of choice on the contrary the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any particular person amongst them depends upon those prior obligations in some cases the subordinate relations are voluntary in others they are necessary but the duties are all compulsive when we marry the choice is voluntary but the duties are not matter of choice they are dictated by the nature of the situation dark and inscrutable are the ways by which we come into the world the instincts which give rise to this mysterious process of nature are not of our making but out of physical causes unknown to us perhaps unknowable arise moral duties which as we are able perfectly to comprehend we are bound indispensably to perform children are not consenting to their relation but their relation without their actual consent binds them to its duties or rather it implies their consent because the presumed consent of every rational creature is in unison with the predisposed order of things men come in that manner into a community with the social state of their parents endowed with all the benefits loaded with all the duties of their situation if the social ties and ligaments spun out of those physical relations which are the elements of the commonwealth in most cases begin and always continue independently of our will so does that relation called our country which comprehends as it has been well said all the charities of all bind us without any stipulation on our part nor are we left without powerful instincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us as it is awful and coercive our country is not a thing of mere physical locality it consists in a great measure in the ancient order into which we are born we may have the same geographical situation but another country as we may have the same country in another soil the place that determines our duty to our country is a social civil relation  appeal from the new to the old whigs  writers writers especially when they act in a body and with one direction have great influence on the public mind  reflections on the revolution in france  writers french these writers like the propagators of all novelties pretended to a great zeal for the poor and the lower orders whilst in their satires they rendered hateful by every exaggeration the faults of courts of nobility and of priesthood they became a sort of demagogues they served as a link to unite in favor of one object obnoxious wealth to restless and desperate poverty  ibid  zeal a zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole  regicide peace  characters antoinette late queen of france it is now      sixteen or seventeen years since i saw the queen of france then the dauphiness at versailles and surely never lighted on this orb which she hardly seemed to touch a more delightful vision i saw her just above the horizon decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in  glittering like the morning star full of life and splendour and joy oh what a revolution and what an heart must i have to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall little did i dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic distant respectful love that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom little did i dream that i should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men in a nation of men of honor and of cavaliers i thought ten thousands swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult  but the age of chivalry is gone  that of sophisters oeconomists and calculators has succeeded and the glory of europe is extinguished for ever never never more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex that proud submission that dignified obedience that subordination of the heart which kept alive even in servitude itself the spirit of an exalted freedom the unbought grace of life the cheap defense of nations the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone

insigne recens alio indictum ore a plan for supporting the freedom of our constitution by court intrigues and for removing its corruptions by indian delinquency to carry that bold paradoxical design into execution sufficient funds and apt instruments became necessary you are perfectly sensible that a parliamentary reform occupies his thoughts day and night as an essential member in this extraordinary project in his anxious researches upon this subject natural instinct as well as sound policy would direct his eyes and settle his choice on paul benfield paul benfield is the grand parliamentary reformer the reformer to whom the whole choir of reformers bow and to whom even the right honorable gentleman himself must yield the palm for what region in the empire what city what borough what county what tribunal in this kingdom is not full of his labors others have been only speculators he is the grand practical reformer and whilst the chancellor of the exchequer pledges in vain the man and the minister to increase the provincial members mr benfield has auspiciously and practically begun it leaving far behind him even lord camelfords generous design of bestowing old sarum on the bank of england mr benfield has thrown in the borough of cricklade to reinforce the county representation not content with this in order to station a steady phalanx for all future reforms this publicspirited usurer amidst his charitable toils for the relief of india did not forget the poor rotten constitution of his native country for her he did not disdain to stoop to the trade of a wholesale upholsterer for this house to furnish it not with the faded tapestry figures of antiquated merit such as decorate and may reproach some other houses but with real solid living patterns of true modern virtue paul benfield made reckoning himself no fewer than eight members in the last parliament what copious streams of pure blood must he not have transfused into the veins of the present  but what is even more striking than the real services of this new imported patriot is his modesty as soon as he had conferred this benefit on the constitution he withdrew himself from our applause he conceived that the duties of a member of parliament which with the elect faithful the true believers the islam of parliamentary reform are of little or no merit perhaps not much better than specious sins might be as well attended to in india as in england and the means of reformation to parliament itself be far better provided mr benfield was therefore no sooner elected than he set off for madras and defrauded the longing eyes of parliament we have never enjoyed in this house the luxury of beholding that minion of the human race and contemplating that visage which has so long reflected the happiness of nations  it was therefore not possible for the minister to consult personally with this great man what then was he do through a sagacity that never failed him in these pursuits he found out in mr benfields representative his exact resemblance a specific attraction by which he gravitates toward all such characters soon brought our minister into a close connection with mr benfields agent and attorney that is with the grand contractor whom i name to honor mr richard atkinson a name that will be well remembered as long as the records of this house as long as the records of the birtish treasury as long as the monumental debt of england shall endure  this gentleman sir acts as attorney for mr paul benfield every one who hears me is well acquainted with the sacred friendship and the steady mutual attachment that subsists between him and the present minister as many members as chose to attend in the first session of this parliament can best tell their own feelings at the scenes which were then acted how much that honorable gentleman was consulted in the original frame and fabric of the bill commonly called mr pitts india bill is matter only of conjecture though by no means difficult to divine but the public was an indignant witness of the ostentation with which that measure was made his own and the authority with which he brought up clause after clause to stuff and fatten the rankness of that corrupt act as fast as the clauses were brought up to the table they were accepted no hesitation no discussion they were received by the new minister not with approbation but with implicit submission the reformation may be estimated by seeing who was the reformer paul benfields associate and agent was held up to the world as legislator of indostan but it was necessary to authenticate the coalition between the men of intrigue in india and the minister of intrigue in england by a studied display of the power of this their connecting link every trust every honor every distinction was to be heaped upon him he was at once made a director of the india company made an alderman of london and to be made if ministry could prevail and i am sorry to say how near how very near they were prevailing representative of the capital of this kingdom but to secure his services against all risque he was brought in for a ministerial borough on his part he was not wanting in zeal for the common cause his advertisements show his motives and the merits upon which he stood for your minister this wornout veteran submitted to enter into the dusty field of the london contest and you all remember that in the same virtuous cause he submitted to keep a sort of public office or counting house where the whole business of the last general election was managed it was openly managed by the direct agent and attorney of benfield it was managed upon indian principles and for an indian interest this was the golden cup of abominations this the chalice of the fornifications of rapine usury and oppression which was held out by the gorgeous eastern harlot which so many of the people so many of the nobles of this land had drained to the very dregs do you think that no reckoning was to follow this lewd debauch that no payment was to be demanded for this riot of public drunkenness and national prostitution here you have it here before you the principal of the grand election manager must be indemnified accordingly the claims of benfield and his crew must be put above all enquiry  for several years benfield appeared as the chief proprietor as well as the chief agent director and controller of this system of debt the worthy chairman of the company has stated the claims of this single gentleman on the nabob of arcot as amounting to five hundred thousand pounds mr smiths protest  possibly at the time of the chairmans state they might have been as high eight hundred thousand had been mentioned some time before madras correspondence on this subject  and according to the practice of shifting the names of creditors in these transactions and reducing or raising the debt itself at pleasure i think it not impossible that at one period the name of benfield might have stood before those frightful figures but my best information goes to fix his share no higher than four hundred thousand pounds by the scheme of the present ministry for adding to the principal twelve per cent from the year      to the year      four hundred thousand pounds that smallest of the sums ever mentioned for mr benfield will form a capital of l   000 at six per cent thus besides the arrears of three years amounting to l 0  00 which as fast as received may be legally lent out at    per cent benfield has received by the ministerial grant before you an annuity of l    0 a year charged on the public revenues  our mirror of ministers of finance did not think this enough for the services of such a friend as benfield he found that lord macartney in order to frighten the court of directors from the project of obliging the nabob to give soucar security for his debt assuring them that if they should take that step benfield appendix no   a would infallibly be the soucar and would thereby become the entire master of the carnatic what lord macartney thought sufficient to deter the very agents and partakers with benfield in his iniquities was the inducement to the two right honorable gentlemen to order this very soucar security to be given and to recall benfield to the city of madras from the sort of decent exile into which he had been relegated by lord macartney you must therefore consider benfield as soucar security for l  0000 a year which at twentyfour per cent supposing him contented with that profit will with the interest of his old debt produce an annual income of l     0 a year  here is a specimen of the new and pure aristocracy created by the right honorable gentleman right honorable william pit  as the support of the crown and constitution against the old corrupt refractory natural interests of this kingdom and this is the grand counterpoise against all odious coalitions of these interests a single benfield outweighs them all a criminal who long since ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal is by his majestys ministers enthroned in the government of a great kingdom and enfeoffed with an estate which in the comparison effaces the splendour of all the nobility of europe  speech on the nabob of arcots debts  burke richard esquire had it pleased god to continue to me the hopes of

can be viewed in science in erudition in genius in taste in honor in generosity in humanity in every liberal sentiment and every liberal accomplishment would not have shown himself inferior to the duke of bedford or to any of those whom he traces in his line his grace very soon would have wanted all plausibility in his attack upon that provision which belonged more to mine than to me he would soon have supplied every deficiency and symmetrized every disproportion it would not have been for that successor to resort to any stagnant wasting reservoir of merit in me or in any ancestry he had in himself a salient living spring of generous and manly action every day he lived he would have repurchased the bounty of the crown and ten times more if ten times more he had received he was made a

thieftaker or spy of police in which character he acted after the manner of persons in that description he had been employed by his master the lieutenant de police for a considerable time in london in the same or some such honorable occupation the revolution which has brought forward all merit of that kind raised him with others of a similar class and disposition to fame and eminence on the

empire of gazettes condorcet was chosen to draw the first declaration presented by the assembly to the king as a threat to the elector of treves and the other princes on the rhine in that piece in which both feuillans and jacobins concurred they declared publicly and most proudly and insolently the principle on which they mean to proceed in their future disputes with any of the sovereigns in europe for they say that it is not with fire and sword they mean to attack their territories but by what will be more dreadful to them the introduction of liberty  the late assembly after the last captivity of the king had actually chosen this condorcet by a majority on the ballot for preceptor to the dauphin who was to be taken out of the hands and direction of his parents and to be delivered over to this fanatic atheist and furious democratic republican his untractability to these leaders and his figure in the club of jacobins which at that time they wished to bring under alone prevented that part of the arrangement and others in the same style from being carried into execution whilst he was candidate for this office he produced his title to it by promulgating the following ideas of

the delusions of the throne respecting his pretended birthright it should teach him not to forget that it is from the people he is to receive the title of king and that the people do not even possess the right of giving up their power to take it from him  they willed that this education should render him worthy by his knowledge and by his virtues both to receive with submission the dangerous burden of a crown and to resign it with pleasure into the hands of his brethren that he should be conscious that the hastening of that moment when he is to be only a common citizen constitutes the duty and the glory of a king of a free people  they willed that the uselessness of a king the necessity of seeking means to establish something in lieu of a power founded on illusions should be one of

into measures that were greatly mischievous to himself and for that reason among others perhaps fatal to his country measures the effects of which i am afraid are for ever incurable he made an administration so checkered and speckled he put together a piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically dovetailed a cabinet so variously inlaid such a piece of diversified mosaic such a tesselated pavement without cement here a bit of black stone and there a bit of white patriots and courtiers kings friends and republicans whigs and tories treacherous friends and open enemies that it was indeed a very curious show but utterly unsafe to touch and unsure to stand on the colleagues whom he had assorted at the same boards stared at each other and were obliged to ask sir your name  sir you have the advantage of me  mr such a one  i beg a thousand pardons   i venture to say it did so happen that persons had a single office divided between them who had never spoke to each other in their lives until they found themselves they knew not how pigging together heads and points in the same trucklebed supposed to allude to the right hon lord north and george cook esquire who were made joint paymasters in the summer of      on the removal of the rockingham administration   sir in consequence of this arrangement having put so much the larger part of his enemies and opposers into power the confusion was such that his own principles could not possibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs if ever he fell into a fit of the gout or if any other cause withdrew him from public cares principles directly the contrary were sure to predominate when he had executed his plan he had not an inch of ground to stand upon when he had accomplished his scheme of administration he was no longer a minister  when his face was hid but for a moment his whole system was on a wide sea without chart or compass the gentlemen his particular friends who with the names of various departments of ministry were admitted to seem as if they acted a part under him with a modesty that becomes all men and with a confidence in him which was justified even in its extravagance by his superior abilities had never in any instance presumed upon any opinion of their own deprived of his guiding influence they were whirled about the sport of every gust and easily driven into any port and as those who joined with them in manning the vessel were the most directly opposite to his opinions measures and character and far the most artful and most powerful of the set they easily prevailed so as to seize upon the vacant unoccupied and derelict minds of his friends and instantly they turned the vessel wholly out of the course of his policy as if it were to insult as well as to betray him even long before the close of the first session of his administration when every thing was publicly transacted and with great parade in his name they made an act declaring it highly just and expedient to raise a revenue in america for even then sir even before this splendid orb was entirely set and while the western horizon was in a blaze with his descending glory on the opposite quarter of the heavens arose another luminary and for his hour became lord of the ascendant  speech on american taxation  charles ii the person given to us by monk charles ii was a man without any sense of his duty as a prince without any regard to the dignity of his crown and without any love to his people dissolute false venal and destitute of any positive good quality whatsoever except a pleasant temper and the manners of a gentleman  letter to a member of the national assembly  cromwell oliver cromwell when he attempted to legalize his power and to settle his conquered country in a state of order did not look for dispensers of justice in the instruments of his usurpation quite the contrary he sought out with great solicitude and selection and even from the party most opposite to his designs men of weight and decorum of character men unstained with the violence of the times and with hands not fouled with confiscation and sacrilege for he chose an hales for his chief justice though he absolutely refused to take his civic oaths or to make any acknowledgment whatsoever of the legality of his government cromwell told this great lawyer that since he did not approve his title all he required of him was to administer in a manner agreeable to his pure sentiments and unspotted character that justice without which human society cannot subsist that it was not his particular government but civil order itself which as a judge he wished him to support cromwell knew how to separate the institutions expedient to his usurpation from the administration of the public justice of his country for cromwell was a man in whom ambition had not wholly suppressed but only suspended the sentiments of religion and the love as far as it could consist with his designs of fair and honorable reputation  ibid  conway general i remember with a melancholy pleasure the situation of the honorable gentleman general conway who made the motion for the repeal of the american stamp act in that crisis when the whole trading interest of this empire crammed into your lobbies with a trembling and anxious expectation waited almost to a winters return of light their sat from your resolutions when at length you had determined in their favor and your doors thrown open showed them the figure of their deliverer in the wellearned triumph of his important victory from the whole of that grave multitude there arose an involuntary burst of gratitude and transport they jumped upon him like children on a long absent father they clung about him as captives about their redeemer all england all america joined to his applause nor did he seem insensible to the best of all earthly rewards the love and admiration of his fellow citizens hope elevated and joy brightened his crest i stood near him and his face to use the expression of the scripture of the first martyr his face was as if it had been the face of an anl i do not know how others feel but if i  stood in that situation i never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profusion could bestow i did hope that that days danger and honor would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever but alas that with other pleasing visions is long since vanished  speech on american taxation  dundas right hon henry he and delicacy are a rare and singular coalition  speech on the nabob of arcots debts  dunning mr the bill for the relief of the roman catholics was seconded by mr dunning recorder of this city bristol i shall say the less of him because his relation to you makes you more particularly acquainted with his merits but i should appear little acquainted with them or little sensible of them if i could utter his name on this occasion without expressing my esteem for his character i am not afraid of offending a most learned body and most jealous of its reputation for that learning when i say he is the first of his profession it is a point settled by those who settle every thing else and i must add what i am enabled to say from my own long and close observation that there is not a man of any profession or in any situation of a more erect and independent spirit of a more proud honor a more manly mind a more firm and determined integrity  speech at bristol previous to the election  fox mr and now having done my duty to the bill let me say a word to the author i should leave him to his own noble sentiments if the unworthy and illiberal language with which he has been treated beyond all example of parliamentary liberty did not make a few words necessary not so much in justice to him as to my own feelings i must say then that it will be a distinction honorable to the age that the rescue of the greatest number of the human race that ever were so grievously oppressed from the greatest tyranny that was ever exercised has fallen to the lot of abilities and dispositions equal to the task that it has fallen to one who has the enlargement to comprehend the spirit to undertake and the eloquence to support so great a measure of hazardous benevolence his spirit is not owing to his ignorance of the state of men and things he well knows what snares are spread about his path from personal animosity from court intrigues and possibly from popular delusion but he has put to hazard his ease his security his interest his power even his darling popularity for the benefit of a people whom he has never seen this is the road that all heroes have trod before him he is traduced and abused for his supposed motives he will remember that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in the composition of all true glory he will remember that it was not only in the roman customs but it is in the nature and constitution of things that calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph these thoughts will support a mind which only exists for honor under the burden of temporary reproach he is doing indeed a great good such as rarely falls to the lot and almost as rarely coincides with the desires of any man let him use his time let him give the whole length of the reins to his benevolence he is now on a great eminence where the eyes of mankind are turned to him he may live long he may do much but here is the summit he never can exceed what he does this day  he has faults but they are faults that though they may in a small degree tarnish the luster and sometimes impede the march of his abilities have nothing in them to extinguish the fire of great virtues in those faults there is no mixture of deceit of hypocrisy of pride of ferocity of complexional despotism or want of feeling for the distresses of mankind his are faults which might exist in a descendant of henry the fourth of france as they did exist in that father of his country henry the fourth wished that he might live to see a fowl in the pot of every peasant of his kingdom that sentiment of homely benevolence was worth all the splendid sayings that are recorded of kings but he wished perhaps for more than could be obtained and the goodness of the man exceeded the power of the king but this gentleman a subject may this day say this at least with truth that he secures the rice in his pot to every man in india a poet of antiquity thought it one of the first distinctions to a prince whom he meant to celebrate that through a long succession of generations he had been the progenitor of an able and virtuous citizen who by force of the arts of peace had corrected governments of oppression and suppressed wars of rapine indole proh quanta juvenis quantumque daturus ausoniae populis ventura in saecula civem ille super gangem super exauditus et indos implebit terras voce et furialia bella fulmine compescet linguae  this was what was said of the predecessor of the only person to whose eloquence it does not wrong that of the mover of this bill to be compared but the ganges and the indus are the patrimony of the fame of my honorable friend and not of cicero i confess i anticipate with joy the reward of those whose whole consequence power and authority exist only for the benefit of mankind and i carry my mind to all the people and all the names and descriptions that relieved by this bill will bless the labors of this parliament and the confidence which the best house of commons has given to him who the best deserves it the little cavils of party will not be heard where freedom and happiness will be felt there is not a tongue a nation or religion in india which will not bless the presiding care and manly beneficence of this house and of him who proposes to you this great work your names will never be separated before the throne of the divine goodness in whatever language or with whatever rites pardon is asked for sin and reward for those who imitate the godhead in his universal bounty to his creatures these honors you deserve and they will surely be paid when all the jargon of influence and party and patronage are swept into oblivion  speech on mr foxs east india bill  fox mr he mr burke was sorry that his right honorable friend mr fox had dropped even a word expressive of exultation on that circumstance the assumption of citizenship by the french army etc or that he seemed of opinion that the objection from standing armies was at all lessened by it he attributed this opinion of mr fox entirely to his known zeal for the best of all causes liberty that it was with a pain inexpressible he was obliged to have even the shadow of a difference with his friend whose authority would be always great with him and with all thinking people  quae maxima semper consitur nobis et rit quae maxima semper  his confidence in mr fox was such and so ample as to be almost implicit that he was not ashamed to avow that degree of docility that when the choice is well made it strengthens instead of oppressing our intellect that he who calls in the aid of an equal understanding doubles his own he who profits of a superior understanding raises his powers to a level with the height of the superior understanding he unites with he had found the benefit of such a junction and would not lightly depart from it he wished almost on all occasions that his sentiments were understood to be conveyed in mr foxs words and that he wished as amongst the greatest benefits he could wish the country an eminent share of power to that right honorable gentleman because he knew that to his great and masterly understanding he had joined the greatest possible degree of that natural moderation which is the best corrective of power that he was of the most artless candid open and benevolent disposition disinterested in the extreme of a temper mild and placable even to a fault without one drop of gall in his whole constitution  mr fox then rose and declared in substance that so far as regarded the french army he went no farther than the general principle by which that army showed itself indisposed to be an instrument in the servitude of their fellow citizens but did not enter into the particulars of their conduct he declared that he did not affect a democracy that he always thought any of the simple unbalanced governments bad simple monarchy simple aristocracy simple democracy he held them all imperfect or vicious all were bad by themselves the composition alone was good that these had been always his principles in which he had agreed with his friend mr burke of whom he said many kind and slattering things which mr burke i take it for granted will know himself too well to think he merits from any thing but mr foxs acknowledged goodnature mr fox thought however that in many cases mr burke was rather carried too far by his hatred to innovation  speech on the army estimates in    0  grenville mr undoubtedly mr grenville was a firstrate figure in this country with a masculine understanding and a stout and resolute heart he had an application undissipated and unwearied he took public business not as a duty which he was to fulfill but as a pleasure he was to enjoy and he seemed to have no delight out of this house except in such things as some way related to the business that was to be done within it if he was ambitious i will say this for him his ambition was of a noble and generous strain it was to raise himself not by the low pimping politics of a court but to win his way to power through the laborious gradations of public service and to secure to himself a well earned rank in parliament by a thorough knowledge of its constitution and a perfect practice in all its business  sir if such a man fell into errors it must be from defects not intrinsical they must be rather sought in the particular habits of his life which though they do not alter the groundwork of character yet tinge it with their own hue he was bred in a profession he was bred to the law which is in my opinion one of the first and noblest of human sciences a science which does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all the other kinds of learning put together but it is not apt except in persons very happily born to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the same proportion passing from that study he did not go very largely into the world but plunged into business i mean into the business of office and the limited and fixed methods and forms established there much knowledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line and there is no knowledge which is not valuable but it may be truly said that men too much conversant in office are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the substance of business not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted these forms are adapted to ordinary occasions and therefore persons who are nurtured in office do admirably well as long as things go on in their common order but when the high roads are broken up and the waters out when a new and troubled scene is opened and the file affords no precedent then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind and a far more extensive comprehension of things is requisite than ever office gave or than office can ever give mr grenville thought better of the wisdom and power of human legislation than in truth it deserves he conceived and many conceived along with him that the flourishing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and institution and not quite so much to liberty for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce and taxes to be revenue among regulations that which stood first in reputation was his idol i mean the act of navigation he has often professed it to be so the policy of that act is i readily admit in many respects well understood but i do say that if the act be suffered to run the full length of its principle and be not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circumstances it must do great mischief and frequently even defeat its own purpose  speech on american taxation  grenville lord an able vigorous and wellinformed statesman  letter to a noble lord  george iii his majesty came to the throne of these kingdoms with more advantages than any of his predecessors since the revolution fourth in descent and third in succession of his royal family even the zealots of hereditary right in him saw something to flatter their favorite prejudices and to justify a transfer of their attachments without a change in their principles the person and cause of the pretender were become contemptible his title disowned throughout europe his party disbanded in england his majesty came indeed to the inheritance of a mighty war but victorious in every part of the globe peace was always in his power not to negociate but to dictate no foreign habitudes or attachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home his revenue for the civil establishment fixed as it was then thought at a large but definite sum was ample without being invidious his influence by additions from conquest by an augmentation of debt by an increase of military and naval establishment much strengthened and extended and coming to the throne in the prime and full vigor of youth as from affection there was a strong dislike so from dread there seemed to be a general averseness from giving any thing like offense to a monarch against whose resentment opposition could not look for a refuge in any sort of reversionary hope  the most ardent lover of his country cannot wish or great britain an happier fate than to continue as she was then left a people emulous as we are in affection to our present sovereign know not how to form a prayer to heaven for a greater blessing upon his virtues or an higher state of felicity and glory than that he should live and should reign and when providence ordains it should die exactly like his illustrious predecessor  thoughts on the cause of the present discontents  henry iv of france henry of navarre was a resolute active and politic prince he possessed indeed great humanity and mildness but an humanity and mildness that never stood in the way of his interests he never sought to be loved without putting himself first in a condition to be feared he used soft language with determined conduct he asserted and maintained his authority in the gross and distributed his acts of concession only in the detail he spent the income of his prerogatives nobly but he took care not to break in upon the capital never abandoning for a moment any of the claims which he made under the fundamental laws nor sparing to shed the blood of those who opposed him often in the field sometimes on the scaffold because he knew how to make his virtues respected by the ungrateful he has merited the praises of those whom if they had lived in his time he would have shut up in the bastile and brought to punishment along with the regicides whom he hanged after he had famished paris into a surrender  reflections on the revolution in france  hertzberg baron hertzberg the king of prussias late minister is so much of what is called a philosopher that he was of a faction with that sort of politicians in every thing and in every place even when he defends himself from the imputation of giving extravagantly into these principles he still considers the revolution of france as a great public good by giving credit to their fraudulent declaration of their universal benevolence and love of peace nor are his prussian majestys present ministers at all disinclined to the same system their ostentatious preamble to certain late edicts demonstrates if their actions had not been sufficiently explanatory of their cast of mind that they are deeply infected with the same distemper of dangerous because plausible though trivial and shallow speculation  memorial on the affairs of france in       howard mr i cannot name this gentleman without remarking that his labors and writings have done much to open the eyes and hearts of mankind he has visited all europe  not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces or the stateliness of temples not to make accurate measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur nor to form a scale of the curiosity of modern art nor to collect medals or collate manuscripts  but to dive into the depth of dungeons to plunge into the infection of hospitals to survey the mansions of sorrow and pain to take the gage and dimensions of misery depression and contempt to remember the forgotten to attend to the neglected to visit the forsaken and to compare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries his plan is original and it is as full of genius as it is of humanity it was a voyage of discovery a circummavigation of charity already the benefit of his labor is felt more or less in every country i hope he will anticipate his final reward by seeing all its effects lly realized in his own he will receive not by retail but in gross the reward of those who visit the prisoner and he has so forestalled and monopolized this branch of charity that there will be i trust little room to merit by such acts of benevolence hereafter  speech at bristol previous to the election  keppel lord i ever looked on lord keppel as one of the greatest and best men of his age and i loved and cultivated him accordingly he was much in my heart and i believe i was in his to the very last beat it was after his trial at portsmouth that he gave me this picture with what zeal and anxious affection i attended him through that his agony of glory what part my son in the early slush and enthusiasm of his virtue and the pious passion with which he attached himself to all my connections with what prodigality we both squandered ourselves in courting almost every sort of enmity for his sake i believe he felt just as i should have felt such friendship on such an occasion i partook indeed of this honor with several of the first and best and ablest in the kingdom but i was behind hand with none of them and i am sure that if to the eternal disgrace of this nation and to the total annihilation of every trace of honor and virtue in it things had taken a different turn from what they did i should have attended him to the quarter deck with no less good will and more pride though with far other feelings than i partook of the general flow of national joy that attended the justice that was done to his virtue  pardon my lord the feeble garrulity of age which loves to diffuse itself in discourse of the departed great at my years we live in retrospect alone and wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life we enjoy the best balm to all wounds the consolation of friendship in those only whom we have lost for ever feeling the loss of lord keppel at all times at no time did i feel it so much as on the first day when i was attacked in the house of lords  had he lived that reverend form would have risen in its place and with a mild parental reprehension to his nephew the duke of bedford he would have told him that the favor of that gracious prince who had honored his virtues with the government of the navy of great britain and with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom was not undeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life and his faithful companion and counselor under his rudest trials he would have told him that to whomever else these reproaches might be becoming they were not decorous in his near kindred he would have told them that when men in that rank lose decorum they lose every thing  on that day i had a loss in lord keppel but the public loss of him in this aweful crisis  i speak from much knowledge of the person he never would have listened to any compromise with the rabble rout of this sans culotterie of france his goodness of heart his reason his taste his public duty his principles his prejudices would have repelled him for ever from all connection with that horrid medley of madness vice impiety and crime  lord keppel had two countries one of descent and one of birth their interests and their glory are the same and his mind was capacious of both his family was noble and it was dutch that is he was of the oldest and purest nobility that europe can boast among a people renowned above all others for love of their native land though it was never shown in insult to any human being lord kepple was something high it was a wild stock of pride on which the tenderest of all hearts had grafted the milder virtues he valued ancient nobility and he was not disinclined to augment it with new honors he valued the old nobility and the new not as an excuse for inglorious sloth but as an incitement to virtuous activity he considered it as a sort of cure for selfishness and a narrow mind conceiving that a man born in an elevated place in himself was nothing but every thing in what went before and what was to come after him without much speculation but by the sure instinct of ingenuous feelings and by the dictates of plain unsophisticated natural understanding he felt that no great commonwealth could by any possibility long subsist without a body of some kind or other of nobility decorated with honor and fortified by privilege this nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a nation which otherwise with mr pain would soon be taught that no one generation can bind another he felt that no political fabric could be well made without some such order of things as might through a series of time afford a rational hope of securing unity coherence consistency and stability to the state he felt that nothing else can protect it against the levity of courts and the greater levity of the multitude that to talk of hereditary monarchy without any thing else of hereditary reverence in the commonwealth was a lowminded absurdity fit only for those detestable fools aspiring to be knaves who began to forge in      the false money of the french constitution  that it is one fatal objection to all new fancied and new fabricated republics among a people who once possessing such an advantage have wickedly and insolently rejected it that the prejudice of an old nobility is a thing that cannot be made it may be improved it may be corrected it may be replenished men may be taken from it or aggregated to it but the thing itself is matter of inveterate opinion and therefore cannot be matter of mere positive institution he felt that this nobility in fact does not exist in wrong of other orders of the state but by them and for them  i knew the man i speak of and if we can divine the future out of what we collect from the past no person living would look with more scorn and horror on the impious parricide committed on all their ancestry and on the desperate attainder passed on all their posterity by the orleans and the rochefoucaults and the fayettes and the viscomtes de noailles and the false perigords and the long et coetera of the perfidious sans culottes of the court who like demoniacs possessed with a spirit of fallen pride and inverted ambition abdicated their dignities disowned their families betrayed the most sacred of all trusts and by breaking to pieces a great link of society and all the cramps and holdings of the state brought eternal confusion and desolation on their country for the fate of the miscreant parricides themselves he would have had no pity compassion for the myriads of men of whom the world was not worthy who by their means have perished in prisons or on scaffolds or are pining in beggary and exile would leave no room in his or in any wellformed mind for any such sensation we are not made at once to pity the oppressor and the oppressed  looking to his batavian descent how could he bear to behold his kindred the descendants of the brave nobility of holland whose blood prodigally poured out had more than all the canals meers and inundations of their country protected their independence to behold them bowed in the basest servitude to the basest and vilest of the human race in servitude to those who in no respect were superior in dignity or could aspire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants to whose sceptered pride they had opposed an elevation of soul that surmounted and overpowered the loftiness of castile the haughtiness of austria and the overbearing arrogance of france  could he with patience bear that the children of that nobility who would have deluged their country and given it to the sea rather than submit to louis xiv who was then in his meridian glory when his arms were conducted by the turennes by the luxembourgs by the bousslers when his councils were directed by the colberts and the louvois when his tribunals were filled by the lamoignons and the daguessaus  that these should be given up to the cruel sport of the pichegrus the jourdans the santerres under the rollands and brissots and gorsas and robespierres the reubels the carnots and talliens and dantons and the whole tribe of regicides robbers and revolutionary judges that from the rotten carcass of their own murdered country have poured out innumerable swarms of the lowest and at once the most destructive of the classes of animated nature which like columns of locusts have laid waste the fairest part of the world  would keppel have borne to see the ruin of the virtuous patricians that happy union of the noble and the burgher who with signal prudence and integrity had long governed the cities of the confederate republic the cherishing fathers of their country who denying commerce to themselves made it flourish in a manner unexampled under their protection could keppel have borne that a vile faction should totally destroy this harmonious construction in favor of a robbing democracy founded on the spurious rights of man  he was no great clerk but he was perfectly well versed in the interests of europe and he could not have heard with patience that the country of grotius the cradle of the law of nations and one of the richest repositories of all law should be taught a new code by the ignorant slippancy of thomas pain the presumptuous soppery of la fayette with his stolen rights of man in his hand the wild profligate intrigue and turbulency of marat and the impious sophistry of condorcet in his insolent addresses to the batavian republic  could keppel who idolized the house of nassau who was himself given to england along with the blessings of the british and dutch revolutions with revolutions of stability with revolutions which consolidated and married the liberties and the interests of the two nations for ever could he see the fountain of british liberty itself in servitude to france could he see with patience a prince of orange expelled as a sort of diminutive despot with every kind of contumely from the country which that family of deliverers had so often rescued from slavery and obliged to live in exile in another country which owes its liberty to his house  would keppel have heard with patience that the conduct to be held on such occasions was to become short by the knees to the faction of the homicides to entreat them quietly to retire or if the fortune of war should drive them from their first wicked and unprovoked invasion that no security should be taken no arrangement made no barrier formed no alliance entered into for the security of that which under a foreign name is the most precious part of england what would he have said if it was even proposed that the austrian netherlands which ought to be a barrier to holland and the tie of an alliance to protect her against any species of rule that might be erected or even be restored in france should be formed into a republic under her influence and dependent upon her power  letter to a noble lord  khan fyzoolah fyzoolah khan though a bad soldier that is the true source of his misfortune has approved himself a good aumil having it is supposed in the course of a few years at least doubled the population and revenue of his country  in another part of the correspondence he is charged with making his country an asylum for the oppressed peasants who fly from the territories of oude the improvement of his revenue arising from this single crime which mr hastings considers as tantamount to treason is stated at an hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year  dr swift somewhere says that he who could make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before was a greater benefactor to the human race than all the politicians that ever existed this prince who would have been deified by antiquity who would have been ranked with osiris and bacchus and ceres and the divinities most propitious to men was for those very merits by name attacked by the companys government as a cheat a robber a traitor in the same breath in which he was accused as a rebel he was ordered at once to furnish  000 horse on delay or according to the technical phrase when any remonstrance is made to them  on evasion he was declared a violator of treaties and every thing he had was to be taken from him  not one word however of horse in this treaty  speech on mr foxs india bill  langrishe sir hercules m p you hated the old system popery laws in ireland as early as i did your first juvenile lance was broken against that giant i think you were even the first who attacked the grim phantom you have an exceeding good understanding very good humor and the best heart in the world the dictates of that temper and that heart as well as the policy pointed out by that understanding led you to abhor the old code you abhorred it as i did for its vicious perfection for i must do it justice it was a complete system full of coherence and consistency well digested and well composed in all its parts it was a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance and as well fitted for the oppression impoverishment and degradation of a people and the debasement in them of human nature itself as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man it is a thing humiliating enough that we are doubtful of the effect of the medicines we compound we are sure of our poisons my opinion ever was in which i heartily agreed with those that admired the old code that it was so constructed that if there was once a breach in any essential part of it the ruin of the whole or nearly of the whole was at some time or other a certainty for that reason i honor and shall for ever honor and love you and those who first caused it to stagger crack and gape  others may finish the beginners have the glory and take what part you please at this hour i think you will take the best your first services will never be forgotten by a grateful country  letter to sir h langrishe m p  louis xvi this unfortunate king not without a large share of blame to himself was deluded to his ruin by a desire to humble and reduce his nobility clergy and his corporate magistracy not that i suppose he meant wholly to eradicate these bodies in the manner since effected by the democratic power i rather believe that even neckers designs did not go to that extent with his own hand however louis the xvith pulled down the pillars which upheld his throne and this he did because he could not bear the inconveniences which are attached to every thing human because he found himself cooped up and in durance by those limits which nature prescribes to desire and imagination and was taught to consider as low and degrading that mutual dependence which providence has ordained that all men should have on one another he is not at this minute perhaps cured of the dread of the power and credit like to be acquired by those who would save and rescue him he leaves those who suffer in his cause to their fate and hopes by various mean delusive intrigues in which i am afraid he is encouraged from abroad to regain among traitors and regicides the power he has joined to take from his own family whom he quietly sees proscribed before his eyes and called to answer to the lowest of his rebels as the vilest of all criminals  memorial on the affairs of france in       louis xvi the only offense of this unhappy monarch toward his people was his attempt under a monarchy to give them a free constitution for this by an example hitherto unheard of in the world he has been deposed it might well disgrace sovereigns to take part with a deposed tyrant it would suppose in them a vicious sympathy but not to make a common cause with a just prince dethroned by traitors and rebels who proscribe plunder confiscate and in every way cruelly oppress their fellow citizens in my opinion is to forget what is due to the honor and to the rights of all virtuous and legal government  letter to a member of the national assembly  louis xvi a misfortune it has indeed turned out to him that he was born king of france but misfortune is not crime nor is indiscretion always the greatest guilt i shall never think that a prince the acts of whose whole reign were a series of concessions to his subjects who was willing to relax his authority to remit his prerogatives to call his people to a share of freedom not known perhaps not desired by their ancestors such a prince though he should be subject to the common frailties attached to men and to princes though he should have once thought necessary to provide force against the desperate designs manifestly carrying on against his person and the remnants of his authority though all this should be taken into consideration i shall be led with great difficulty to think he deserves the cruel and insulting triumph of paris and of dr price i tremble for the cause of liberty from such an example to kings i tremble for the cause of humanity in the unpunished outrages of the most wicked of mankind but there are some people of that low and degenerate fashion of mind that they look up with a sort of complacent awe and admiration to kings who know to keep firm in their seat to hold a strict hand over their subjects to assert their prerogative and by the awakened vigilance of a severe despotism to guard against the very first approaches of freedom against such as these they never elevate their voice deserters from principle listed with fortune they never see any good in suffering virtue nor any crime in prosperous usurpation  if it could have been made clear to me that the king and queen of france those i mean who were such before the triumph were inexorable and cruel tyrants that they had formed a deliberate scheme for massacring the national assembly i think i have seen something like the latter insinuated in certain publications i should think their captivity just if this be true much more ought to have been done but done in my opinion in another manner  reflections on the revolution in france  louis xvi louis the xvith was a diligent reader of history but the very lamp of prudence blinded him the guide of human life led him astray a silent revolution in the moral world preceded the political and prepared it it became of more importance than ever what examples were given and what measures were adopted their causes no longer lurked in the recesses of cabinets or in the private conspiracies of the factious they were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the grandees who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their discontents and to quiet them by their corruption the chain of subordination even in cabal and sedition was broken in its most important links it was no longer the great and the populace other interests were formed other dependencies other connexions other communications the middle class had swelled far beyond its former proportions like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in society that became the seat of all the active politics and the preponderating weight to decide on them there were all the energies by which fortune is acquired there the consequence of their success there were all the talents which assert their pretensions and are impatient of the place which settled society prescribes to them these descriptions had got between the great and the populace and the influence on the lower classes was with them the spirit of ambition had taken possession of this class as violently as ever it had done of any other they felt the importance of this situation the correspondence of the monied and the mercantile world the literary intercourse of academies but above all the press of which they had in a manner entire possession made a kind of electric communication every where the press in reality has made every government in its spirit democratic without it the great the first movements could not perhaps have been given but the spirit of ambition now for the first time connected with the spirit of speculation was not to be restrained at will there was no longer any means of arresting a principle in its course when louis the xvith under the influence of the enemies to monarchy meant to found but one republic he set up two when he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbor he lost the whole of his own louis the xvith could not countenance a new republic yet between that dangerous lodgment for an enemy which he had erected and his throne he had the whole atlantic for a ditch he had for an outwork the english nation itself friendly to liberty adverse to that mode of it he was surrounded by a rampart of monarchies most of them allied to him and generally under his influence yet even thus secured a republic erected under his auspices and dependent on his power became fatal to his throne the very money which he had lent to support this republic by a good faith which to him operated as perfidy was punctually paid to his enemies and became a resource in the hands of his assassins  regicide peace  louis xviii as to the prince who has a just claim to exercise the regency of france like other men he is not without his faults and his defects but faults or defects always supposing them faults of common human infirmity are not what in any country destroy a legal title to government after being well informed as any man here can be i do not find that these blemishes in this eminent person are at all considerable or that they at all affect a character which is full of probity honor generosity and real goodness in some points he has but too much resemblance to his unfortunate brother who with all his weaknesses had a good understanding and many parts of an excellent man and a good king but monsieur without supposing the other deficient as he was not excels him in general knowledge and in a sharp and keen observation with something of a better address and an happier mode of speaking and of writing his conversation is open agreeable and informed his manners gracious and princely  memorial on the affairs of france in       monk general you ask me what i think of the conduct of general monk how this affects your case i cannot tell i doubt whether you possess in france any persons of a capacity to serve the french monarchy in the same manner in which monk served the monarchy of england the army which monk commanded had been formed by cromwell to a perfection of discipline which perhaps has never been exceeded that army was besides of an excellent composition the soldiers were men of extraordinary piety after their mode of the greatest regularity and even severity of manners brave in the field but modest quiet and orderly in their quarters men who abhorred the idea of assassinating their officers or any other persons and who they at least who served in this island were firmly attached to those generals by whom they were well treated and ably commanded such an army once gained might be depended on i doubt much if you could now find a monk whether a monk could find in france such an army  i certainly agree with you that in all probability we owe our whole constitution to the restoration of the english monarchy the state of things from which monk relieved england was however by no means at that time so deplorable in any sense as yours is now and under the present sway is likely to continue cromwell had delivered england from anarchy his government though military and despotic had been regular and orderly under the iron and under the yoke the soil yielded its produce after his death the evils of anarchy were rather dreaded than felt every man was yet safe in his house and in his property but it must be admitted that monk freed this nation from great and just apprehensions both of future anarchy and of probable tyranny in some form or other  letter to a member of the national assembly  montesquieu place for instance before your eyes such a man as montesquieu think of a genius not born in every country or every time a man gifted by nature with a penetrating aquiline eye with a judgment prepared with the most extensive erudition with an herculean robustness of mind and nerves not to be broken with labor a man who could spend twenty years in one pursuit think of a man like the universal patriarch in milton who had drawn up before him in his prophetic vision the whole series of the generations which were to issue from his loins a man capable of placing in review after having brought together from the east the west the north and the south from the coarseness of the rudest barbarism to the most refined and subtle civilization all the schemes of government which had ever prevailed amongst mankind weighing measuring collating and comparing them all joining fact with theory and calling into council upon all this infinite assemblage of things all the speculations which have fatigued the understandings of profound reasoners in all times  let us then consider that all these were but so many preparatory steps to qualify a man and such a man tinctured with no national prejudice with no domestic affection to admire and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the constitution of england and shall we englishmen revoke to such a suit shall we when so much more than he has produced remains still to be understood and admired instead of keeping ourselves in the schools of real science choose for our teachers men incapable of being taught whose only claim to know is that they have never doubted from whom we can learn nothing but their own indocility who would teach us to scorn what in the silence of our hearts we ought to adore  appeal from the new to the old whigs  north lord i do not mean to speak disrespectfully of lord north he was a man of admirable parts of general knowledge of a versatile understanding fitted for every sort of business of infinite wit and pleasantry of a delightful temper and with a mind most perfectly disinterested but it would be only to degrade myself by a weak adulation and not to honor the memory of a great man to deny that he wanted something of the vigilance and spirit of command that the time required indeed a darkness next to the fog of this awful day loured over the whole region for a little time the helm appeared abandoned  ipse diem noctemque negat discernere coelo nec meminisse vioe media palinurus in unda letter to a noble lord  pit right hon william we hear as a reason for clinging to mr fox at present that nine years ago mr pit got into power by mischievous intrigues with the court with the dissenters and with other factious people out of parliament to the discredit and weakening of the power of the house of commons his conduct nine years ago i still hold to be very culpable there are however many things very culpable that i do not know how to punish my opinion on such matters i must submit to the good of the state as i have done on other occasions and particularly with regard to the authors and managers of the american war with whom i have acted both in office and in opposition with great confidence and cordiality though i thought many of their acts criminal and impeachable whilst the misconduct of mr pit and his associates was yet recent it was not possible to get mr fox of himself to take a single step or even to countenance others in taking any step upon the ground of that misconduct and false policy though if the matters had been then taken up and pursued such a step could not have appeared so evidently desperate as now it is  so far from pursuing mr pit i know that then and for some time after some of mr foxs friends were actually and with no small earnestness looking out to a coalition with that gentleman for years i never heard this circumstance of mr pitts misconduct on that occasion mentioned by mr fox either in public or in private as a ground for opposition to that minister all opposition from that period to this very session has proceeded upon the separate measures as they separately arose without any vindictive retrospect to mr pitts conduct in      my memory however may fail me i must appeal to the printed debates which so far as mr fox is concerned are unusually accurate  whatever might have been in our power at an early period at this day i see no remedy for what was done in      i had no great hopes even at the time i was therefore very eager to record a remonstrance on the journals of the house of commons as a caution against such a popular delusion in times to come and this i then feared and now am certain is all that could be done i know of no way of animadverting on the crown i know no mode of calling to account the house of lords who threw out the india bill in a way not much to their credit as little or rather less am i able to coerce the people at large who behaved very unwisely and intemperately on that occasion mr pit was then accused by me as well as others of attempting to be minister without enjoying the confidence of the house of commons though he did enjoy the confidence of the crown that house of commons whose confidence he did not enjoy unfortunately did not itself enjoy the confidence though we well deserved it either of the crown or of the public for want of that confidence the then house of commons did not survive the contest since that period mr pit has enjoyed the confidence of the crown and of the lords and of the house of commons through two successive parliaments and i suspect that he has ever since and that he does still enjoy as large a portion at least of the confidence of the people without doors as his great rival  letter to the duke of portland  rockingham marquis of the noble marquis of rockingham and his worthy colleagues whilst they trembled at the prospect of such distresses as you have since brought upon yourselves were not afraid steadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched he looked in the face one of the ablest and let me say not the most scrupulous oppositions that perhaps ever was in this house and withstood it unaided by even one of the usual supports of administration he did this when he repealed the stamp act he looked in the face a person he had long respected and regarded and whose aid was then particularly wanting i mean lord chatham he did this when he passed the declaratory act  it is now given out for the usual purposes by the usual emissaries that lord rockingham did not consent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by lord chatham and the reporters have gone so far as publicly to assert in an hundred companies that the honorable gentleman under the gallery general conway  who proposed the repeal in the american committee had another set of resolutions in his pocket directly the reverse of those he moved these artifices of a desperate cause are at this time spread abroad with incredible care in every part of the town from the highest to the lowest companies as if the industry of the circulation were to make amends for the absurdity of the report  sir whether the noble lord is of a complexion to be bullied by lord chatham or by any man i must submit to those who know him i confess when i look back to that time i consider him as placed in one of the most trying situations in which perhaps any man ever stood in the house of peers there were very few of the ministry out of the noble lords own particular connection except lord egmont who acted as far as i could discern an honorable and manly part that did not look to some other future arrangement which warped his politics there were in both houses new and menacing appearances that might very naturally drive any other than a most resolute minister from his measure or from his station the household troops openly revolted the allies of ministry those i mean who supported some of their measures but refused responsibility for any endeavored to undermine their credit and to take ground that must be fatal to the success of the very cause which they would be thought to countenance the question of the repeal was brought on by ministry in the committee of this house in the very instant when it was known that more than one court negotiation was carrying on with the heads of the opposition every thing upon every side was full of traps and mines earth below shook heaven above menaced all the elements of ministerial safety were dissolved it was in the mindst of this chaos of plots and counterplots it was in the midst of this complicated warfare against public opposition and private treachery that the firmness of that noble person was put to the proof he never stirred from his ground no not an inch he remained fixed and determined in principle in measure and in conduct he practiced no managements he secured no retreat he sought no apology  speech on american taxation  rousseau we have had the great professor and founder of the philosophy of vanity in england as i had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almost from day to day he left no doubt in my mind that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart or to guide his understanding but vanity with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness it is from the same deranged eccentric vanity that this the insane socrates of the national assembly was impelled to publish a mad confession of his mad faults and to attempt a new sort of glory from bringing hardily to light the obscure and vulgar vices which we know may sometimes be blended with eminent talents he has not observed on the nature of vanity who does not know that it is omnivorous that it has no choice in its food that it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices as what will excite surprise and draw attention and what will pass at worst for openness and candor it was this abuse and perversion which vanity makes even of hypocrisy which has driven rousseau to record a life not so much as chequered or spotted here and there with virtues or even distinguished by a single good action it is such a life he chooses to offer to the attention of mankind it is such a life that with a wild defiance he slings in the face of his creator whom he acknowledges only to brave your assembly knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept has chosen this man by his own account without a single virtue for a model to him they erect their first statue from him they commence their series of honors and distinctions  it is that new invented virtue which your masters canonize that led their moral hero constantly to exhaust the stores of his powerful rhetoric in the expression of universal benevolence whilst his heart was incapable of harboring one spark of common parental affection benevolence to the whole species and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact form the character of the new philosophy setting up for an unsocial independence this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of common labor as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius and which when paid honors the giver and the receiver and then he pleads his beggary as an excuse for his crimes he melts with tenderness for those only who touch him by the remotest relation and then without one natural pang casts away as a sort of offal and excrement the spawn of his disgustful amors and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings the bear loves licks and forms her young but bears are not philosophers vanity however finds its account in reversing the train of our natural feelings thousands admire the sentimental writer the affectionate father is hardly known in his parish  under this philosophic instructor in the ethics of vanity they have attempted in france a regeneration of the moral constitution of man statesmen like your present rulers exist by every thing which is spurious fictitious and false by every thing which takes the man from his house and sets him on a stage which makes him up an artificial creature with painted theatric sentiments fit to be seen by the glare of candlelight and formed to be contemplated at a due distance vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us and in all countries to the improvement of frenchmen it seems not absolutely necessary that it should be taught upon system but it is plain that the present rebellion was its legitimate offspring and it is piously fed by that rebellion with a daily dole  if the system of institution recommended by the assembly is false and theatric it is because their system of government is of the same character to that and to that alone it is strictly conformable to understand either we must connect the morals with the politics of the legislators your practical philosophers systematic in every thing have wisely began at the source as the relation between parents and children is the first among the elements of vulgar natural morality they erect statues to a wild ferocious lowminded hardhearted father of fine general feelings a lover of his kind but a hater of his kindred your masters reject the duties of this vulgar relation as contrary to liberty as not founded in the social compact and not binding according to the rights of men because the relation is not of course the result of free election never so on the side of the children not always on the part of the parents  the next relation which they regenerate by their statues to rousseau is that which is next in sanctity to that of a father they differ from those oldfashioned thinkers who considered pedagogues as sober and venerable characters and allied to the parental the moralists of the dark times preceptorem sancti volure parentis esse loco in this age of light they teach the people that preceptors ought to be in the place of gallants they systematically corrupt a very corruptible race for some time a growing nuisance amongst you a set of pert petulant literators to whom instead of their proper but severe unostentatious duties they assign the brilliant part of men of wit and pleasure of gay young military sparks and danglers at toilets they call on the rising generation in france to take a sympathy in the adventures and fortunes and they endeavor to engage their sensibility on the side of pedagogues who betray the most awful family trusts and vitiate their female pupils they teach the people that the debauchers of virgins almost in the arms of their parents may be safe inmates in their house and even fit guardians of the honor of those husbands who succeed legally to the office which the young literators had preoccupied without asking leave of law or conscience  thus they dispose of all the family relations of parents and children husbands and wives through this same instructor by whom they corrupt the morals they corrupt the taste taste and elegance though they are reckoned only among the smaller and secondary morals yet are of no mean importance in the regulation of life a moral taste is not of force to turn vice into virtue but it recommends virtue with something like the blandishments of pleasure and it infinitely abates the evils of vice rousseau a writer of great force and vivacity is totally destitute of taste in any sense of the word your masters who are his scholars conceive that all refinement has an aristocratic character the last age had exhausted all its powers in giving a grace and nobleness to our natural appetites and in raising them into higher class and order than seemed justly to belong to them through rousseau your masters are resolved to destroy these aristocratic prejudices the passion called love has so general and powerful an influence it makes so much of the entertainment and indeed so much the occupation of that part of life which decides the character for ever that the mode and the principles on which it engages the sympathy and strikes the imagination become of the utmost importance to the morals and manners of every society your rulers were well aware of this and in their system of changing your manners to accommodate them to their politics they found nothing so convenient as rousseau through him they teach men to love after the fashion of philosophers that is they teach to men to frenchmen a love without gallantry a love without any thing of that fine flower of youthfulness and gentility which places it if not among the virtues among the ornaments of life instead of this passion naturally allied to grace and manners they infuse into their youth an unfashioned indelicate sour gloomy ferocious medley of pedantry and lewdness of metaphysical speculations blended with the coarsest sensuality such is the general morality of the passions to be found in their famous philosopher in his famous work of philosophic gallantry the nouvelle eloise  when the fence from the gallantry of preceptors is broken down and your families are no longer protected by decent pride and salutary domestic prejudice there is but one step to a frightful corruption the rulers in the national assembly are in good hopes that the females of the first families in france may become an easy prey to dancing masters fiddlers patterndrawers friseurs and valets de chamber and other active citizens of that description who having the entry into your houses and being half domesticated by their situation may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations by a law they have made these people your equals by adopting the sentiments of rousseau they have made them your rivals in this manner these great legislators complete their plan of levelling and establish their rights of men on a sure foundation  i am certain that the writings of rousseau lead directly to this kind of shameful evil i have often wondered how he comes to be so much more admired and followed on the continent than he is here perhaps a secret charm in the language may have its share in this extraordinary difference  letter to a member of the national assembly  rousseau mr hume told me that he had from rousseau himself the secret of his principles of composition that acute though eccentric observer had perceived that to strike and interest the public the mavelous must be produced that the mavelous of the heathen mythology had long since lost its effect that giants magicians fairies and heroes of romance which succeeded had exhausted the portion of credulity which belonged to their age that now nothing was left to a writer but that species of the mavelous which might still be produced and with as great an effect as ever though in another way that is the mavelous in life in manners in characters and in extraordinary situations giving rise to new and unlookedfor strokes in politics and morals i believe that were rousseau alive and in one of his lucid intervals he would be shocked at the practical phrenzy of his scholars who in their paradoxes are servile imitators and even in their incredulity discover an implicit faith  reflections on the revolution in france  saville sir george when an act of great and signal humanity was to be done and done with all the weight and authority that belonged to it the world could cast its eyes upon none but him sir george i hope that few things which have a tendency to bless or to adorn life have wholly escaped my observation in my passage through it i have sought the acquaintance of that gentleman and have seen him in all situations he is a true genius with an understanding vigorous and acute and refined and distinguishing even to excess and illuminated with a most undounbed peculiar and original cast of imagination with these he possesses many external and instrumental advantages and he makes use of them all his fortune is among the largest a fortune which wholly unincumbered as it is with one single charge from luxury vanity or excess sinks under the benevolence of its dispenser this private benevolence expanding itself into patriotism renders his whole being the estate of the public in which he has not reserved a peculium for himself of profit diversion or relaxation during the session the first in and the last out of the house of commons he passes from the senate to the camp and seldom seeing the seat of his ancestors he is always in parliament to serve his country or in the field to defend it but in all wellwrought compositions some particulars stand out more eminently than the rest and the things which will carry his name to posterity are his two bills i mean that for a limitation of the claims of the crown upon landed estates and this for the relief of the roman catholics by the former he has emancipated property by the latter he has quieted conscience and by both he has taught that grand lesson to government and subject  no longer to regard each other as adverse parties  speech at bristol previous to the election  saxony elector of the present elector is a prince of a safe and quiet temper of great prudence and goodness he knows that in the actual state of things not the power and respect belonging to sovereigns but their very existence depends on a reasonable frugality it is very certain that not one sovereign in europe can either promise for the continuance of his authority in a state of indigence and insolvency or dares to venture on a new imposition to relieve himself without abandoning wholly the ancient magnificence of his court the elector has conducted his affairs with infinitely more economy than any of his predecessors so as to restore his finances beyond what was thought possible from the state in which the seven years war had left saxony saxony during the whole of that dreadful period having been in the hands of an exasperated enemy rigorous by resentment by nature and by necessity was obliged to bear in a manner the whole burden of the war in the intervals when their allies prevailed the inhabitants of that country were not better treated  the moderation and prudence of the present elector in my opinion rather perhaps respites the troubles than secures the peace of the electorate the offer of the succession to the crown of poland is truly critical whether he accepts or whether he declines it if the states will consent to his acceptance it will add to the difficulties already great of his situation between the king of prussia and the emperor but these thoughts lead me too far when i mean to speak only of the interior condition of these princes it has always however some necessary connection with their foreign politics  memorial on the affairs of france in       tacitus and machiavel it has been said and with regard to one of them with truth that tacitus and machiavel by their cold way of relating enormous crimes have in some sort appeared not to disapprove them that they seem a sort of professors of the art of tyranny and that they corrupt the minds of their readers by not expressing the detestation and horror that naturally belong to horrible and detestable proceedings  speech on mr foxs india bill  townshend charles there are many young members in the house such of late has been the rapid succession of public men who never saw that prodigy charles townshend nor of course know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings for failings he had undoubtedly  many of us remember them we are this day considering the effect of them but he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cause to an ardent generous perhaps an immoderate passion for fame a passion which is the instinct of all great souls he worshipped that goddess wheresoever she appeared but he paid his particular devotions to her in her favorite habitation in her chosen temple the house of commons besides the characters of the individuals that compose our body it is impossible mr speaker not to observe that this house has a collective character of its own that character too however imperfect is not unamiable like all great public collections of men you possess a marked love of virtue and an abhorrence of vice but among vices there is none which the house abhors in the same degree with obstinacy obstinacy sir is certainly a great vice and in the changeful state of political affairs it is frequently the cause of great mischief it happens however very unfortunately that almost the whole line of the great and masculine virtues constancy gravity magnanimity fortitude fidelity and firmness are closely allied to this disagreeable quality of which you have so just an abhorrence and in their excess all these virtues very easily fall into it he who paid such a punctilious attention to all your feelings certainly took care not to shock them by that vice which is the most disgustful to you  that fear of displeasing those who ought most to be pleased betrayed him sometimes into the other extreme he had voted and in the year      had been an advocate for the stamp act things and the disposition of mens minds were changed in short the stamp act began to be no favorite in this house he therefore attended at the private meeting in which the resolutions moved by a right honorable gentleman was settled resolutions leading to the repeal the next day he voted for that repeal and he would have spoken for it too if an illness not as was then given out a political but to my knowledge a very real illness had not prevented it  the very next session as the fashion of this world passes away the repeal began to be in as bad an odor in this house as the stamp act had been in the session before to conform to the temper which began to prevail and to prevail mostly amongst those most in power he declared very early in the winter that a revenue must be had out of america instantly he was tied down to his engagements by some who had no objection to such experiments when made at the cost of persons for whom they had no particular regard the whole body of courtiers drove him onward they always talked as if the king stood in a sort of humiliated state until something of the kind should be done  here this extraordinary man then chancellor of the exchequer found himself in great straits to please universally was the object of his life but to tax and to please no more than to love and to be wise is not given to men however he attempted it to render the tax palatable to the partisans of american revenue he made a preamble stating the necessity of such a revenue to close with the american distinction this revenue was external or port duty but again to soften it to the other party it was a duty of supply to gratify the colonists it was laid on british manufactures to satisfy the merchants of britain the duty was trivial and except that on tea which touched only the devoted east india company on none of the grand objects of commerce to counterwork the american contraband the duty on tea was reduced from a shilling to threepence but to secure the favor of those who would tax america the scene of collection was changed and with the rest it was levied in the colonies what need i say more this finespun scheme had the usual fate of all exquisite policy but the original plan of the duties and the mode of executing that plan both arose singly and solely from a love of our applause he was truly the child of the house he never thought did or said any thing but with a view to you he every day adapted himself to your disposition and adjusted himself before it as at a lookingglass  he had observed indeed it could not escape him that several persons infinitely his inferiors in all respects had formerly rendered themselves considerable in this house by one method alone they were a race of men i hope in god the species is extinct who when they rose in their place no man living could divine from any known adherence to parties to opinions or to principles from any order or system in their politics or from any sequel or connection in their ideas what part they were going to take in any debate it is astonishing how much this uncertainty especially at critical times called the attention of all parties on such men all eyes were fixed on them all ears open to hear them each party gaped and looked alternately for their vote almost to the end of their speeches while the house hung in this uncertainty now the hearhims rose from this side  now they rebellowed from the other and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance always received them in a tempest of applause the fortune of such men was a temptation too great to be resisted by one to whom a single whiff of incense withheld gave much greater pain than he received delight in the clouds of it which daily rose about him from the prodigal superstition of innumerable admirers he was a candidate for contradictory honors and his great aim was to make those agree in admiration of him who never agreed in any thing else  speech on american taxation  walpole mr in stating that walpole was driven by a popular clamor into a measure not to be justified i do not mean wholly to excuse his conduct my time of observation did not exactly coincide with that event but i read much of the controversies then carried on several years after the contests of parties had ceased the people were amused and in a degree warmed with them the events of that era seemed then of magnitude which the revolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance and the debates which then shook the nation now appear of no higher moment than a discussion in a vestry when i was very young a general fashion told me i was to admire some of the writings against that minister a little more maturity taught me as much to despise them i observed one fault in his general proceeding he never manfully put forward the entire strength of his cause he temporised he managed and adopting very nearly the sentiments of his adversaries he opposed their inferences  this for a political commander is the choice of a weak post his adversaries had the better of the argument as he handled it not as the reason and justice of his cause enabled him to manage it  regicide peace  warren hastings esquire attend i pray you to the situation and prosperity of benfield hastings and others of that sort the last of these has been treated by the company with an asperity of reprehension that has no parallel they lament that the power of disposing of their property for perpetuity should fall into such hands yet for fourteen years with little interruption he has governed all their affairs of every description with an absolute sway he has had himself the means of heaping up immense wealth and during that whole period the fortunes of hundreds have depended on his smiles and frowns he himself tells you he is incumbered with two hundred and fifty young gentlemen some of them of the best families in england all of whom aim at returning with vast fortunes to europe in the prime of life he has then two hundred and fifty of your children as his hostages for your good behavior and loaded for years as he has been with the execrations of the natives with the censures of the court of directors and struck and blasted with resolutions of this house he still maintains the most despotic power ever known in india he domineers with an overbearing sway in the assemblies of his pretended masters and it is thought in a degree rash to venture to name his offenses in this house even as grounds of a legislative remedy  speech on mr foxs east india bill  wilkes john esquire i will not believe what no other man living believes that mr wilkes was punished for the indecency of his publications or the impiety of his ransacked closet if he had fallen in a common slaughter of libellers and blasphemers i could well believe that nothing more was meant than was pretended but when i see that for years together full as impious and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion and virtue and order have not been punished nor their authors discountenanced that the most audacious libels on royal majesty have passed without notice that the most treasonable invectives against the laws liberties and constitution of the country have not met with the slightest animadversion i must consider this as a shocking and shameless pretense never did an envenomed scurrility against every thing sacred and civil public and private rage through the kingdom with such a furious and unbridled license all this while the peace of the nation must be shaken to ruin one libeller and to tear from the populace a single favorite  nor is it that vice merely skulks in an obscure and contemptible impunity does not the public behold with indignation persons not only generally scandalous in their lives but the identical persons who by their society their instruction their example their encouragement have drawn this man into the very faults which have furnished the cabal with a pretense for his persecution loaded with every kind of favor honor and distinction which a court can bestow add but the crime of servility the foedum crimen servitutis to every other crime and the whole mass is immediately transmuted into virtue and becomes the just subject of reward and honor when therefore i reflect upon this method pursued by the cabal in distributing rewards and punishments i must conclude that mr wilkes is the object of
