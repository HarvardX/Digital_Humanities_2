a further account of the most deplorable condition of mr edmund curll bookseller  price three pence  a further account of the most deplorable condition of mr edmund curll bookseller since his being poisoned on the   th of march  to be published weekly  london printed and sold by all the publishers mercuries and hawkers within the bills of mortality       a further account of the most deplorable condition of mr edmund curll bookseller the public is already acquainted with the manner of mr curlls impoisonment by a faithful though unpolite historian of grubstreet i am but the continuer of his history yet i hope a due distinction will be made between an undignifyd scribler of a sheet and half and the author of a threepenny stitcht book like my self  wit says sir richard blackmore proceeds from a concurrence of regular and exalted ferments and an affluence of animal spirits rectified and refined to a degree of purity on the contrary when the igneous particle rise with the vital liquor they produce an abstraction of the rational part of the soul which we commonly call madness the verity of this hypothesis is justified by the symptoms with which the unfortunate mr edmund curll bookseller has been afflicted ever since his swallowing the poison at the swan tavern in fleetstreet for though the neck of his retort which carries up the animal spirits to the head is of an extraordinary length yet the said animal spirits rise muddy being contaminated with the inflammable particles of this uncommon poison  the symptoms of his departure from his usual temper of mind were at first only speaking civilly to his customers taking a fancy to say his prayers singeing a pig with a new purchased libel and refusing two and nine pence for sir r b s essays  as the poor mans frenzy increased he began to void his excrements in his bed read rochester s bawdy poems to his wife gave oldmixon a slap on the chops and would have kissed mr pembertons a by violence  but at last he came to such a pass that he would dine upon nothing but copper plates took a clyster for a whipped syllabub and eat a suppository for a raddish with bread and butter  we leave it to every tender wife to imagine how sorely all this afflicted poor mrs curll at first she privately put a bill into several churches desiring the prayers of the congregation for a wretched stationer distempered in mind but when she was sadly convinced that his misfortune was public to all the world writ the following letter to her good neighbor mr lintott a true copy of mrs curlls letter to mr lintott worthy mr lintott you and all the neighbors know too well the frenzy with which my poor man is visited i never perceived he was out of himself till that melancholy day that he thought he was poisoned in a glass of sack upon this he took a strange fancy to run a vomiting all over the house and in the new washed dining room alas this is the greatest adversity that ever befell my poor man since he lost one testicle at school by the bite of a black boar good lord if he should die where should i dispose of the stock unless mr pemberton or you would help a distressed widow for god knows he never published any books that lasted above a week so that if we wanted daily books we wanted daily bread i can write no more for i hear the rap of mr curlls ivory headed cane upon the counter  pray recommend me to your pastry cook who furnishes you yearly with tarts in exchange for your papers for mr curll has disobliged ours since his fits came upon him  before that we generally lived upon baked meats  he is coming in and i have but just time to put his son out of the way for fear of mischief so wishing you a merry easter i remain your  most humble servant c curll p s as to the report of my poor husbands stealing a calf it is really groundless for he always binds in sheep       but return we to mr curll who all wednesday continued outragiously mad on thursday he had a lucid interval that enabled him to send a general summons to all his authors there was but one porter who could perform this office to whom he gave the following bill of directions where to find em this bill together with mrs curlls original letter lie at mr lintotts shop to be perused by the curious  instructions to a porter how to find mr curlls authors at a tallowchandlers in petty france half way under the blind arch ask for the historian  at the bedsted and bolster a music house in morefields two translators in a bed together  at the hercules and still in vinegaryard a schoolmaster with carbuncles on his nose  at a blacksmiths shop in the friars a pindarick writer in red stockings  in the calendar mill room at exeter change a composer of meditations  at the three tobacco pipes in dog and bitch yard one that has been a parson he wears a blue camblet coat trimmed with black my best writer against revealed religion  at mr summers a thiefcatchers in lewkners lane the man that wrote against the impiety of mr rowes plays  at the farthing pie house in tooting fields the young man who is writing my new pastorals  at the laundresses at the hole in the wall in cursitors alley up three pair of stairs the author of my church history  if his flux be over  you may also speak to the gentleman who lies by him in the flock bed my indexmaker  the cooks wife in buckingham court bid her bring along with her the similes that were lent her for her next new play  call at budge row for the gentleman you use to go to in the cockloft i have taken away the ladder but his landlady has it in keeping  i dont much care if you ask at the mint for the old beetlebrowd critic and the purblind poet at the alley over against st andrews holbourn but this as you have time   all these gentlemen appeared at the hour appointed in mr curlls dining room two excepted one of whom was the gentleman in the cockloft his landlady being out of the way and the gradus ad parnassum taken down the other happened to be too closely watched by the bailiffs  they no sooner entered the room but all of them showed in their behavior some suspicion of each other some turning away their heads with an air of contempt others squinting with a leer that showed at once fear and indignation each with a haggard abstracted mien the lively picture of scorn solitude and short commons so when a keeper feeds his hungry charge of vultures panthers and of lybian leopards each eyes his fellow with a fiery glare high hung the bloody liver tempts their maw or as a housewife stands before her pales surrounded by her geese they fight they hiss they gaggle beat their wings and down is scattered as the winters snow for a poor grain of oat or tare or barley such looks shot through the room transverse oblique direct such was the stir and din till curll thus spoke but without rising from his closestool  whores and authors must be paid beforehand to put them in good humor therefore here is half a crown a piece for you to drink your own healths and confusion to mr addison and all other successful writers  ah gentlemen what have i not done what have i not suffered rather than the world should be deprived of your lucubrations i have taken involuntary purges i have been vomited three times have i been cand once was i hunted twice was my head broke by a grenadier twice was i tossed in a blanket i have had boxes on the ear slaps on the chops i have been frighted pumped kicked slandered and beshitten  i hope gentlemen you are all convinced that this author of mr lintotts could mean nothing else but starving you by poisoning me it remains for us to consult the best and speediest methods of revenge    he had scarce done speaking but the historian proposed a history of his life the exeter exchange gentleman was for penning articles of his faith some pretty smart pindarick says the redstocking gentleman would effectually do his business but the indexmaker said their was nothing like an index to his homer  after several debates they came to the following resolutions resolved that every member of this society according to his several abilities shall contribute some way or other to the defamation of mr pope resolved that toward the libelling of the said mr pope there be a sum employed not exceeding six pounds sixteen shillings and nine pence not including advertisements resolved that mr d make an affidevit before mr justice tully that in mr popes homer there are several passages contrary to the established rules of our sublime resolved that he has on purpose in several passages perverted the true ancient heathen sense of homer for the more effectual propagation of the popish religion resolved that the printing of homers battles at this juncture has been the occasion of all the disturbances of this kingdom ordered that mr barnivelt be invited to be a member of this society in order to make further discoveries resolved that a number of effective erratas be raised out of mr popes homer not exceeding      and that every gentleman who shall send in one error for his encouragement shall have the whole works of this society gratis resolved that a sum not exceeding ten shillings and sixpence be distributed among the members of this society for coffee and tobacco in order to enable them the more effectually to defame him in coffeehouses resolved that toward the further lessening the character of the said mr pope some persons be deputed to abuse him at ladies tea tables and that in consideration our authors are not well dressed enough mr cy be deputed for that service resolved that a ballad be made against mr pope and that mr oldmixon mr gildon and mrs centlivre do prepare and bring in the same resolved that above all some effectual ways and means be found to increase the joint stock of the reputation of this society which at present is exceedingly low and to give their works the greater currency whether by raising the denomination of the said works by counterfeit title pages or mixing a greater quantity of the fine metal of other authors with the alloy of this society resolved that no member of this society for the future mix stout in his ale in a morning and that mr b remove from the hercules and still resolved that all our members except the cooks wife be provided with a sufficient quantity of the vivifying drops or byfields sal volatile resolved that sir r b be appointed to endue this society with a large quantity of regular and exalted ferments in order to enliven their cold sentiments being his true receipt to make wits   these resolutions being taken the assembly was ready to break up but they took so near apart in mr curlls afflictions that none of them could leave him without giving some advice to reinstate him in his health  mr gildon was of opinion that in order to drive a pope out of his belly he should get the mummy of some deceased moderator of the general assembly in scotland to be taken inwardly as an effectual antidote against antichrist but mr oldmixon did conceive that the liver of the person who administered the poison boiled in broth would be a more certain cure  while the company were expecting the thanks of mr curll for these demonstrations of their zeal a whole pile of essays on a sudden fell on his head the shock of which in an instant brought back his dilirium he immediately rose up overturnd the closestool and beshit the essays which may probably occasion a second edition then without putting up his breeches in a most furious tone he thus broke out to his books which his distempered imagination represented to him as alive coming down from their shelves fluttering their leaves and flapping their covers at him  now gd damn all folios quartos octavos and duodecimos ungrateful varlets that you are who have so long taken up my house without paying for your lodging  are you not the beggarly brood of fumbling journeymen born in garrets among lice and cobwebs nursed upon gray peace bullocks liver and porters ale  was not the first light you saw the farthing candle i paid for did you not come before your time into dirty sheets of brown paper  and have not i clothed you in double royal lodged you handsomely on decent shelves laced your backs with gold equipt you with splendid titles and sent you into the world with the names of persons of quality must i be always plagued with you  why flutter ye your leaves and flap your covers at me damn ye all ye wolves in sheeps clothing rags ye were and to rags ye shall return why hold you forth your texts to me ye paltry sermons why cry ye  at every word to me ye bawdy poems  to my shop at tunbridge ye shall go by g and thence be drawn like the rest of your predecessors bit by bit to the passagehouse for in this present emotion of my bowels how do i compassionate those who have great need and nothing to wipe their breech with  having said this and at the same time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped he abated of his fury and with great gravity applied to that function the unfinished sheets of the conduct of the e of nm  finis
