ministry  the second edition  london printed and sold by s keimer at the printingpress in paternoster row      price six pence  burnet and bradbury or the confederacy of the press and the pulpit etc were there not always a difference between real grievances and party quarrels if a just distinction were not to be made between the complaints of a nation and the clamours of a prejudiced party this tract had not been published  again if there were not an evident difference between a thirst of blood and a demand of justice between party vengeance and legal prosecutions this pen which has never yet been drawn in any of these public quarrels had not now been employed  yet again if there were not allowances needful to be made for the characters of the persons who complain and a difference between the just complaints of men whose principles morals and virtues gave them some weight in the world and the rudeness of profligates and bullies if there were not distinctions to be made between conscientious pious patriots known to be lovers of their country and zealous for the liberties and privileges of their posterity and a vicious abandoned crew bloody in principle forsaken of all commendable virtue swallowed up in revenge and the prejudices of their parties swelling in envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness raging for the blood of those who they hate and like some of their fathers calling for justice justice that they might draw the people into the worst sort of murder if i say these things had not been in the case before me i who never engaged in this manner before would not have undertaken this task  but if these men pass unreprovd then all manner of villainies must be tolerated among us from the authority of bullies and incendiaries and whoever these people please to prescribe as in the triumvirate at rome shall come to be sacrificed under the pretense of justice the cry is for justice it is directed to the government the government would do wisely if they thought fit to do justice on these men who have the face to tell them who must be put to death by them and that the people expect it that is to say a party expect it to please and gratify their revenge if justice may not be obtained against such insolence then each hackney writer shall lead the ministry nay even the king himself to cruelty and blood to make good the resentment of an enraged faction and to obey the commands of a daring dissenting preacher and a detestable exasperated b to begin with the first of these viz t bry the dissenting preacher  how great the rage of this man is and how it transports him even beyond the bounds of modesty duty and justice will be best illustrated by reflection upon the late injunctions published by his majestys special command directing the clergy to restrain themselves within the limits of their duty and not to intermeddle ni their sermons with affairs of state it should seem this man esteems himself as no minister and so that he is not spoken to in these injunctions or that the kings injunctions are of such a private interpretation that they should imply a restraint to the church clergy only and an allowance to all others to preach sedition or otherwise this man must let the king know that the dissenting preachers do not think themselves under his authority or within the power of any of his restraints so as to be liable to his injunctions  it will be to the purpose many ways to consider the insolence of this man in his late manner of preaching and what views he must have in his behaving thus as also the unhappy condition of the church of england the state her clergy are reduced to and the injustice of suffering the dissenting preachers thus to trample under their feet the ministers of that church by whom they are indulged in the liberties they show themselves so unworthy to enjoy  the due examination of these particulars may it is hoped open the eyes of those who at present seem so willing to reduc the church to extremities nay it may perhaps cause even the more moderat among the dissenters to awake and to consider whether such behavior becomes their ministers or preachers whether it is their true interest to act in this manner and whether a time may not come if the church may ever recover from this mischievous usage when she may do her self justice  it must be acknowledged that the church of england will be in danger if her clergy must have their mouths sealed up and while they obey the royal injunctions published by his majestys command not to intermeddle with statematters in their sermons the dissenting preachers as not concerned in that command and as if by being not named in those injunctions they had thereby an indulgence for the purpose take the liberty to condemn to death those who they please to prescribe and to call the people together to cry for blood blood under the old cant of    justice justice what height of unparalled insolence has been shown in this part by bt and by and some others by bt not to be paralleled indeed but by one another in two pamphlets published the last week the one a letter to my lord hx and the other a sermon on the late thansgiving both calling on the government for blood both leading the king and ministry to blood which in these men is murder whateve it must be in the other the circumstance of both of these render the crime flagrant and the criminals odious  preachers one would think ought no to be prompters of blood and revenge more espeecially those who a few year past spoke so much for moderation forbearance charity and what not yet thi young gentleman has given the world  taste of the justice which these men do as well as of the justice which they seek with what front durst this incendiary enter upon the subject when he knew hi majesty had but even then strictly forbidden the clergy to meddle in their pulpit with such matters can he have the i manners to say that his majesty designed that the mouths of the clergy of the church of england should be stopped and the mouths of schismatics and dissenter should be opened what satyr would thi have been on the person and conduct o the king and how would it have opened the mouths of the people against such partial usage of the church who shall say the church is not in danger even in the utmost danger if this be her case i on the other side he will say he does not understand the injunctions to be a prescribing the clergy of the church and leaving the other preachers of all the sects free then with what front durst this man disobey his majestys injunctions and taking upon him to lead the king and his ministry to what they ought or ought not to do to summon the people to call for justice which as aforesaid is blood and insinuate who are the men they should clamor against which manifestly is practicing sedition and murder  i am unacquainted with the sects of dissenters yet i have often heard that they have vindicated themselves or endeavored to do so frequently against the charge often brought upon them of being regardless of kings and governments practicing sedition and such things as these those among them who are sober and modest must abhor this man and his preaching seeing the king from a principle of peaceableness as we would hope and to keep the people quiet has forbid by the injunctions published in the public gazette the ministers of the church to meddle with these things this by surely ought to have esteemed himself equally restrained by those injunctions otherwise he must expose the justice of the king in the highest manner if he has the front to do this let him bring in his plea let him say the king allowed dissenting preachers to meddle with state affairs in their pulpits while he denied the church of england ministers the same liberty and saying and proving this will state the condition of the church of england in a few words and put it out of question for the future whether she is in danger yea or no this incendiary is unable to deny but tha he is expressly forbidden by the injunction to preach in this manner as much as the church clergy i have a better opinion o his cunning than to suppose otherwise o him nay should he fly to that weak and foolish pretense  viz that the injunction are directed to the church of england clergy only it would fail him seeing the very words of the injunctions will convict him the first clause includes him and all those of his or of any other sect thus viz that no preacher whatsoever in his sermon or lecture do presume etc vide the injunctions wherein especially two things are directed art iii that above all things they all preachers whatsoever abstain from bitter invectives and scurrilous languag against all persons whatsoever art iv tha they do not presume etc to intermeddle in an affairs of state or government or the constitution of the realm where in the nex place is then his obedience to the highe powers and more effectually where hi regard to king george after all the fulsome parasitical stuff he has been so long venting about the king which is to honest men odious and to the king himself contemptible is this his observing the legal injunctions as one of his class calls them of the king upon the clergy  now should we call upon the ministry to do justice upon this incendiary and implore his majesty in his justice to the clergy of the church of england and in vindication of his own injunctions to let this offender be brought to condign punishment this i persuade my self his majesty will not deny or that on the other hand his royal justice will move him to take off those injunctions from the clergy of the church which they now lie under the restraints whereof they have with deference to his majesty strictly conformed to what just complaints may the clergy make of being hardly and unjustly dealt with if such a manifest breach of his majestys commands shall not be resented is it not expressed in the said injunctions that the breach thereof will incur his royal displeasure and that the king will give charge to the judges and all their civil officers to do their duty toward preventing and punishing such as shall offend herein and is it the misfortune of the churchclergy only to be capable of incurring his majestys displeasure and the dissenting preachers who notwithstanding they are only admitted or suffered to preach by a kind exemption from the punishment due by the law to schismatics and recusants may without offense take that very liberty which the others are forbidden what a desolate abandoned condition is the church of england brought to if this be her fate and where may we suppose this will end  but i will not persuade any true churchman to entertain a thought so prejudicial to the honor of the king neither will i presume to suggest that the king can hear such things if ever his majesty shall have opportunity to hear them without the utmost resentment  unhappy is the state of the church of england if such things can be practiced in this kingdom and not one of her members be so faithful to her interest as to give a true impartial account of this matter to her head and sworn defender but there is no room to doubt but some will be found who will lay these things before the king and will inform his majesty who they are that inflame and despise his subjects by bitter invectives in their sermons and by scurrilous language in their pulpits notwithstanding his injunction to the contrary which if done wisely and with clearness will soon convince his majesty who they are that are the cause of the present dissatisfaction of his subjects and who they are that desire he may be the peaceable and gracious sovereign lord over all his people it can scarce be believed that these men should make any impression on his majesty by this way of preaching and printing but surely a faithful account given to him of this behavior in defiance of his injunction must make impression on his mind very much to their prejudice and no less to the advantage of the public peace both in church and state mean time those who think that this management of himself is becoming either the person of this bradbury who calls himself a minister or his friends the dissenters quatenus dissenter and tolerated by the church may encourage him to proceed as he has begun but a time may come when they may see themselves mistaken and may find they unseasonably discovered the bloody disposition to be so much their own there are many among the dissenters who are sensible of it already and are only wanting in that they do not think fit to do themselves the justice to declare their minds which is their fear of the people and lest they should be cast out of the synagogue loving the praise of men more etc  from this preaching incendiary i proceed to the laypreacher bt who takes upon him after a series of lewdness and debauchery in his former life to set up for an instructor of ministry and impudently tells the ministers of state the kings majesty and all that he expects the last ministry should be sacrificed to his resentments and their heads be given to him in a charger as that lewd dancer did to john the baptist  were this demand made by a less flagrant villain one that had not been the shame as well as grief of his father the scandal of his family and the contempt of men of honor or had it been by one who had not sent his right reverend father to her late majesty to beg mercy for him and to entreat her majesty that a just prosecution might be stopped which was issued against him for insulting her royal person and government which application the very same persons whose bloods he now thirsts after were earnest suitors to the queen to accept and prompted her native clemency to pardon a man whom his own father had nothing to say for but merely to ask it of her grace and goodness the same grace and goodness which led her to spare many more who now stamp upon her memory with the greatest ingratitude and contempt was this demand i say made by one who had not thus been in debt to the men he would destroy some room would have been left to believe there might have been something of a public spirited zeal in the motion however extravagant in itself and however it might be carried beyond the bounds of christianity and honor  but when a man is put into a rage by envy and in the height of a party distraction calls out for blood and demands the heads of such as he and his fellow furies have thought fit to prescribe it is time then to let the world know the meaning of these things and what is to be said or done in the case  the actions of every english man are to be inquired into by legal process heard in due form and judged by the proper persons it is criminal for any one to tamper with the juries who are to pass upon any man in cases of life and death to offer to bribe or prepossess them either to acquit or condemn it is not therefore allowed for any man to enter upon his own vindication in public while his case is depending in any court of justice because it is anticipating his trial and a prepossessing the people out of whom his jury is to be chosen and consequently prepossessing and tampering with the jury itself in like manner ought not to be allowed that men who are liable to be questioned in public for any actions which they may have done which are supposed to be illegal should be arraigned before hand in public by every lewd scribler who in this respect prepossesses the world against them as much as in him lies find him guilty before he is tried and execute him as it were in effigy when such methods are made use of to make men publicly obnoxious it is a plain over awing those who may come to pass upon these men for life or death who are made afraid to do justice least they are marked out for the same popular hatred what but this is the real design of these men they are for prepossessing the whole nation with such notions of the guilt of the last ministry that whosoever shall not find them guilty when impeached or shall not be forward to impeach them shall be in danger of having his house pulled down by the rabble and of being set upon in the streets on every tumultuous occasion  the question before these men is not ow to do justice whatever the specious watch word is at this time they must have the blood of the men they have marked out and if those who are to be judges should not find every man whom they accuse guilty they will be equally unsatisfied as they are now they tell the ministers of state now that they expect the late ministry shall be impeached when that is done they will with the same imperious tone tell the house of lords they expect they should be found guilty and to give a seeming weight to their insolence every scribler now has learnt of stl to speak high and say the nation expects it than which nothing is more false for the kingdom expects a healing of our breaches not a widening them a just moderate and clement government not using power to oppression not gratifying party rage and setting one half the people to devour the other  the ignorant young man now speaking of has but one thing in the whole pamphlet which he has published that has weight in it and this is that he says all the executors of a sovereigns illegal orders from a plenipotentiary down to a constable are answerable for their execution of them this i say is all that has weight in his book and this is what every old woman in politics knows and could have said as well as he the men he rails at and in his rough language abuses join issue with the whole party upon this foot and then challenge him and all his brotherhood of the bloodhound pack for they are no better to show one illegal order of her majestys which they have executed  after all that this scurrilous mad creature has said to provoke his readers to the same height with himself one would have thought he should have given an instance of at least one illegal order issued by her majesty and executed by her ministry upon which they are to expect their heads and i searched narrowly for it but could not find the least appearance thereof which justifies fully the liberty i take with these two scriblers in saying it is not justice but blood which they hunt after and least they should fail of obtaining the heads of these men by the course of a just prosecution they are thus raising a flame in the minds of the people against them that if possible they may awe the world not only into the impeachment but into the verdict and may signify that whoever shall dissent shall be marked by the people to be sacrificed by them upon the first occasion what is this but blood as in my title and how can the government bear this without showing a just resentment or making men fear that they are in worse circumstances than it is hoped they ever will be  i know that there is a design in these men that looks another way and some of them have had weakness enough to bewray the folly viz they hope by this popular rage to intimidate the persons they threaten and filling them with apprehensions of not obtaining a fair and just trial oblige them to absent themselves and reserve their defense for better times it is true had the persons concerned nothing to expect but what these envenomed spirits would do had they not a firm and fixed assurance that they can neither prove the charge nor influence the house of peers to condemn men without guilt and without fair hearing were it not for this it must be confessed it would be a madness not to be accounted for that any innocent men should put themselves into their hands but hitherto they have not been able to obtain that point the gentlemen stand fairly and are ready to defend themselves fairly and if they are accused it may with much more justice and modesty be said that the people of england expect they should be heard fairly and used fairly and if innocent be acquitted fairly and not be run down by pamphlets and preaching  the parliament of england now of great britain is an awful assembly and it is hoped they will not permit themselves to be driven any more than led into any thing which their own wisdom does not satisfy them is for the good of their country their business is well known to them they will not fail to do their country justice but they will not be made the butchers of a party no not although they were more composed of their own friends than they are  we had indeed a set of men who were called the redcoat parliament and they were indeed tools of a party and did the drudgery which was provided for them whoever they liked not they found guilty whoever their supporters commanded them to murder they murdered to blast they blasted to sacrifice they sacrificed but those were not a free parliament they were nominated arbitrarily sword in hand as may properly be said by a usurper and rebel who was himself a murderer and a parricide in the worst and most odiou sense of that word for he was the slaye of the father of his country  but if we have a free parliament choen by the freeholders and corporations f great britain according to law other things will be found redressing grievanes establishing the liberties of their counry and doing such justice as necessity requires will certainly be their work and with as little blood as possible the paraments of great britain content themselves often with redressing a grievance without entering into every private resentment and at the worst they pursue none ut by law and without private views f they did not act thus they would be ill ualified to restore the public tranquiliy what these mad fellows would bring arliaments to i know very well but it  hoped the gentlemen of great britain will let them know in due time that it  not their place either from the pulpit or ress to dictate to the parliament who shall be impeached whose head shall be cut ff and whose not  the design of this tract is not to enter unto a defense of the late management of ffairs under the queen or upon an enuiry how far the ministry acted according  their duty i am not to try the cause in rint any more than these men ought to rraign them in the like manner but as very freeborn subject of the british crown has a right to the protection  the laws and to complain of injustice  in the name of every person aimed at b these bloodthirsty men i must enter the caveat by way of protest that to arraig men by popular tumult is illegal to stir up others by popular tumults to arraign or impeach is illegal accusation must be brought with a clear hand on the foot of public justice and no other neither is public justice to be prompted or pushed on much less awed or influenced by public clamor every thing of that kind is illegal and will be called a malicious prosecution the people of englan are willing to have justice done but the never desire to have more than justice they desire generous justice it is the characte of our nation to act generously to thos who submit to justice nay justice wit clemency is the distinguishing characte of all the legal proceedings in this nation it is known to be so and it is the honor of the nation that it is so foreigners wi acknowledge the same to our great reputation  the gentlemen pushed at by these furies are objects of this generous justice they freely cast themselves upon the justic of their country they fly to the protecton of the laws which are their birthright it behooves the government to take care that they have no wrong done them i say it behooves the government for in such cases every man who gives himself up to the law is under the kings protection in a more particular manner than an another person is for this reason people who have been destroyed in the tower or in any other prisons it has been esteemed greatly to cast reproach upon the king himself seeing a man imprisoned is taken out of his own protection deprived of power to defend himself and therefore is in the especial protection of the prince this was alleged by the lawyers as a great aggravation of the crime in the murder of sir tho overbury at the trial of the murderers and especially at the lord somersets trial it was urged that he had exceedingly dishonored the king in whose particular protection sir thomas then was and the king as might be said was made responsible for his life because while in prison he was in the kings custody likewise in the present case of those persons whom the madmen mentioned excessively rail at and demand to the block as they flee to the protection of the laws which are their birthright so the government is in charge of them and is obliged to protect them from every kind of injustice and particularly from that injustice which is founded on the summum jus of the law which by the received maxims of the law is summa injuria  if the people who rail in this horrid manner had nothing to desire but justice they would not make so great a bustle on that account for why should they doubt of obtaining justice it is a great affront to the king and ministry now in being that they should make so great clamours for obtaining justice as if they found themselves in danger of failing thereof and that justice would not take place unless in terrorem the ministry were told publicly that the people expect it implying that the people will resent it if it is not done i will not give any credit to that scandalous supposition that the present ministry have desired these men to make public clamours for impeachments that they may have it to allege that they were obliged to do it by the general demand of the people it is a scandalous reflection on the ministers of state and merits to be exposed if there are crimes sufficient to warrant an impeachment of any men in the kingdom the ministry have given no ground to any to supect they are backward to do their country justice and the directing bts libel to the earl of hx lbeit it is evidently intended by the youth s a satyr upon the known wisdom and moderation of that great person yet the effort is so weak and so ill directed that ike a mine ill charged it plays back upon the unskilful engineer and covers him n the rubbish and dirt of his own design the case speaks itself if the ministry had reason for falling upon the persons he aims at why should he doubt their doing it f no reason why bully them into it with elling them in a threatening manner that he people expect it from them if their crimes are sufficient to condemn them justly the persons are not so consideable as that the government should not atempt it if not they are not so inconsiderable as that the government should attempt t the using ministers of state in this manner as bt has used my lord hx s in so many words telling them they want both spurring and whipping too into doing justice for their country and that hey would not do it unless they are frighted into it by the peoples resentments threatened openly in those words borrowed from a like author the people expect it  it sufficiently exposes the baseness o these men and shows that it is blood they seek and revenge not justice that they take upon them to call every action they dislike a crime against their country things which are against no law they call treason and demand mens heads upon every frivolous vexatious pretense and in a villainous manner  for nothing can be more villainous call men traitors before they are convicted of any treasonable action  i have said before that the libeller bt has asserted one truth viz that every officer is answerable for the execution of the queens illegal orders the reverse of this aphorism it is hoped has the same authority viz that what the queen had a legal authority to command her servants might legally execute and that no man could be answerable for executing the queens legal orders supposing this to be allowed it was natural to search those illegal orders which the queen had given and which these men had executed and not finding them or any o them in that libel the men seem not to be answerable at all in the opinion of those who judge of this mans libel with impartiality but to descend to particulars  the first thing he would have them taken up for is because there were riots n the day of rejoicing for the kings accession no man approves of tumults but as not justice been done was not the goernment at a sufficient charge for a commission of oyer and terminer to try these rioers at bristol and was not justice done here to fineing and whipping yea justice was done but there was no blood without blood these men cannot be appeased and therefore the late ministers of state must be taken into custody though it does not appear any of them are concerned in the said mobs this is the justice these men are for  the next charge is that insolent and seditious pamphlets have been dispersed abroad and therefore the heads of the faction as he calls the late queens servants must be seized the english liberty is such thanks be to god that no man can be seized and imprisoned without some crime being sworn against him yet his lover of justice would have these men seized because other men disperse seditious pamphlets why not rather the auhors ofthose pamphlets  but the next is the main charge and of most weight viz the peace and this it seems is the treason it is an undisputed branch of the royal prerogative of the crown of great britain that the king or queen for time being has the sole right of making peace and war and learned lawyers say that the king is not bound by any opinions representations advice resolutions or any thing of that nature from the people in any capacity whatever neither have the parliament any right to prescribe the time the manner or the condition if this is not law then let the raging authors show where the right is and prove it to be so the other needs no evidence it is acknowledged even in parliament on diverse eminent occasions which i am able to produce there not being room for it here it being lawful then for the queen to make peace it was lawful for her majesty to issue out orders to her servants to do every thing that was necessary or which her majesty thought proper for that end or can they be made answerable for exeuting those orders which it was lawfu for the queen to give  their treating by her majestys orders with any prince or without the knowledge of any allies or confederate whether it was so or not or whether it was contrary to alliances or not is not to purpose but it must be asked where is the law they have broken in it what act of parliament is it against supposing all was granted which they allege if then no act of parliament has made it criminal where is the crime no law no transgression is there an act of parliament that the queen should not treat with france without acquainting the dutch is there a law the queen should not if she could get dunkirk by the bargain make a cessation of arms with france that if prince euene would not come into it her general should not draw off from them is there  act of parliament that the queen should go on with the war though none of l the confederates answered their quos etc if laws can be found for these things then these ministers of state may erhaps be found guilty of high trean but if not then it must be otherwise and if such laws are extant why are they ot quoted by this lybeller this is a full answer to every other charge they make for all that he lybels them with turn upon the same head  again was there any law that the duke of man should be general that the other ministry should never be turned out that the catalans should be supported at great britains charge after their own lord had withdrawn from them not one act of parliament is brought which they have acted against and yet he calls them traitors and expects their blood  there remains but one thing more in his clamor viz their being concerned with the pretender of this he offers no facts no evidence no nor circumstances to make good the charge which he brings yet the blood of the queens servants must satisfy his inexorable party and such is the preposterous rage of these men that it betrays them to gross absurdity especially this that they should threaten the present ministry if they do not impeach etc suggesting strongly as before that the ministry incline not to do it have not evidence to support it and are too sensible that if justice be done the accused persons cannot be hurt and that therefore they will press the present ministry to fa on them per fas aut nefas and to cast them by number of voices whether they are guilty or not guilty  to conclude there seems to be the height of malice and partyrage in all these things and nothing of justice is concerned in it the temper is hellish the men scandalous they are a satyr upon themselves and all good men abhor them the doing justice on offenders none can oppose neither is any thing in this tract offered against it but let not justice be pretended and the pretense be made a stalkinghorse to introduce the private revenge of disobliged persons or parties let not public justice be hackneyd out to men of no principles this will bring innocent blood upon the nation and who knows when the thirst will be quenched  the king is a prince of wisdom and prudence and it is hoped he will show that moderation in the midst of these violent extremes as may preserve the peace of his people and prevent that cannibal temper which would set one half of his people to devour the other and it is especially hoped his majesty will take the church of england which he has sworn to maintain into his peculiar consideration and inform himself exactly who they are who may be said to constitute that church whether the few who side with these men or ten twelfths of the clergy who as some think is the least of those who are disobliged by these men  the affront offered by this filthy libeller to the government merits contemp and the author is no otherwise wort naming than to let the world see the cause by its being espoused only by such  detestable person  finis this week will be published  a friendly epistle from one of the people called quakers to thomas bradbury a dealer in many words
