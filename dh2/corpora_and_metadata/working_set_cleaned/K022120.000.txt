that of shallow thinkers who fall short of the truth and that of abstruse thinkers who go beyond it the latter class are by far the most uncommon and i may add by far the most useful and valuable they suggest hints at least and start difficulties which they want perhaps skill to pursue but which may produce very fine discoveries when handled by men who have a more just way of thinking at worst what they say is uncommon and if it should cost some pains to comprehend it one has however the pleasure of hearing something that is new an author is little to be valued who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffeehouse conversation  all people of shallow thought are apt to decry even those of solid understanding as abstruse thinkscience ers and metaphysicians and refiners and never will allow any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak conceptions there are some cases i own where an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presumption of falsehood and where no reasoning is to be trusted but what is natural and easy when a man deliberates concerning his conduct in any particular affair and forms schemes in politics trade economy or any business in life he never ought to draw his arguments too fine or connect too long a chain of consequences together something is sure to happen that will disconcert his reasoning and produce an event different from what he expected but when we reason upon general subjects one may justly affirm that our speculations can scarce ever be too fine provided they be just and that the difference betwixt a common man and a man of genius is chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they proceed general reasonings seem intricate merely because they are general nor is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish in a great number of particulars that common circumstance in which they all agree or to extract it pure and unmixt from the other superfluous circumstances every judgment or conclusion with them is particular they cannot enlarge their view to those universal propositions which comprehend under them an infinite number of individuals and include a whole in a single theorem their eye is confounded with such an extensive prospect and the conclusions derived from it even though clearly expressed seem intricate and obscure but however intricate they may seem it is certain that general principles if just and sound must always prevail in the general course of things though they may fail in particular cases and it is the chief business of philosophers to regard the general course of things i may add that it is also the chief business of politicians especially in the domestic government of the state where the public good which is or ought to be their object depends on the concurrence of a multitude of cases not as in foreign politics upon accidents and chances and the caprices of a few persons this therefore makes the difference betwixt particular deliberations and general reasonings and renders subtilty and refinement much more suitable to the latter than to the former  i thought this introduction necessary before the following discourses on commerce luxury money interest etc where perhaps there will occur some principles which are uncommon and which may seem too refined and subtle for such vulgar subjects if false let them be rejected but no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them merely because they are out of the common road  the greatness of a state and the happiness of its subjects however independent they may be supposed in some respects are commonly allowed to be inseparable with regard to commerce and as private men receive greater security in the possession of their trade and riches from the power of the public so the public becomes powerful in proportion to the riches and extensive commerce of private men this maxim is true in general though i cannot forbear thinking that it may possibly admit of some exceptions and that we often establish it with too little reserve and limitation there may be some circumstances where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals instead of adding strength to the public may serve only to thin its armies and diminish its authority among the neighboring nations man is a very variable being and susceptible of many different opinions principles and rules of conduct what may be true while he adheres to one way of thinking will be found false when he has embraced an opposite set of manners and opinions  the bulk of every state may be divided into husbandmen and manufacturers the former are employed in the culture of the land the latter work up the materials furnished by the former into all the commodities which are necessary or ornamental to human life as soon as men quit their savage state where they live chiefly by huntthe ing and fishing they must fall into these two classes though the arts of agriculture employ at first the most numerous part of the society mons melon in his political essay on commerce asserts that even at present if you divide france into  0 parts    are laborers or peasants   only artizans one belonging to the law church and military and one merchants financiers and bourgeois this calculation is certainly very erroneous in france england and indeed most parts of europe half of the inhabitants live in cities and even of those who live in the country a very great number are artizans perhaps above a third  time and experience improve so much these arts that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men than those who are immediately employed in its cultivation or who furnish the more necessary manufactures to such as are so employed  if these superfluous hands be turned toward the finer arts which are commonly denominated the arts of luxury they add to the happiness of the state since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments with which they would otherways have been unacquainted but may not another scheme be proposed for the employment of these superfluous hands may not the sovereign lay claim to them and employ them in fleets and armies to increase the dominions of the state abroad and spread its fame over distant nations it is certain that the fewer desires and wants are found in the proprietors and laborers of land the fewer hands do they employ and consequently superfluities of the land instead of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers may support fleets and armies to a much greater extent than where a great many arts are required to minister to the luxury of particular persons here therefore seems to be a kind of opposition betwixt the greatness of the state and the happiness of the subjects a state is never greater than when all its superfluous hands are employed in the service of the public the ease and convenience of private persons require that these hands should be employed in their service the one can never be satisfied but at the expense of the other as the ambition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals so the luxury of individuals must diminish the force and check the ambition of the sovereign  nor is this reasoning merely chimerical but is founded on history and experience the republic of sparta was certainly more powerful than any state now in the world consisting of an equal number of people and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury the helotes were the laborers the spartans were the soldiers or gentlemen it is evident that the labor of the helotes could not have maintained so great a number of spartans had these latter lived in ease and delicacy and given employment to a great variety of trades and manufactures the like policy may be remarked in rome and indeed through all ancient history it is observable that the smallest republics raised and maintained greater armies than states consisting of triple the number of inhabitants are able to support at present it is computed that in all european nations the proportion betwixt soldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred but we read that the city of rome alone with its small territory raised and maintained in early times ten legions against the latins athens whose whole dominions were not larger than yorkshire sent to the expedition against sicily near forty thousand men thucydides lib    dionysius the elder it is said maintained a standing army of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse beside a large fleet of four hundred sail diod sic lib   this account i own is somewhat suspicious not to say worse chiefly because this army was not composed of citizens but of mercenary forces see discourse x though his territories extended no farther than the city of syracuse about a third part of the island of sicily and some seaport towns or garrisons on the coast of italy and illyricum it is true the ancient armies in time of war subsisted much upon plunder but did not the enemy plunder in their turn which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax than any other that could be devised in short no probable reason can be given for the great power of the more ancient states above the modern but their want of commerce and luxury few artizans were maintained by the labor of the farmers and therefore more soldiers might live upon it titus livius says that rome in his time would find it difficult to raise as large an army as that which in her early days she sent out against the gauls and latins titi livit lb   cap    adeo in quae laboramus says he sola crevimus divitias luxurianque  instead of those soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in camilluss time there were in augustuss days musicians painters cooks players and tailors and if the land was equally cultivated at both periods it is evident it could maintain equal numbers in the one profession as in the other they added nothing to the mere necessaries of life in the latter period more than in the former  it is natural on this occasion to ask whether sovereigns may not return to the maxims of ancient policy and consult their own interest in this respect more than the happiness of their subjects i answer that it appears to me almost impossible and that because ancient policy was violent and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things it is well known with what peculiar laws sparta was governed and what a prodigy that republic is justly esteemed by every one who has considered human nature as it has displayed itself in other nations and other ages were the testimony of history less positive and circumstantial such a government would appear a mere philosophical whim or fiction and impossible ever to be reduced to practice and though the roman and other ancient republics were supported on principles somewhat more natural yet was there a very extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burdens they were free states they were small ones and the age being martial all the neighboring states were continually in arms freedom naturally begets public spirit especially in small states and this public spirit this amor patriae must increase when the public is almost in continual alarm and men are obliged every moment to expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defense a continual succession of wars makes every citizen a soldier they take the field in their turn and during their service are chiefly maintained by themselves and notwithstanding that this service is equivalent to a very severe tax it is less felt by a people addicted to arms who fight for honor and revenge more than pay and are unacquainted with gain and industry as well as pleasure the more ancient romans lived in perpetual war with all their neighbors and in old latin the term hostis expressed both a stranger and an enemy this is remarked by cicero but by him is ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors who softened as much as possible the denomination of an enemy by calling him by the same appellation which signified a stranger de off lib   it is however much more probable from the manners of the times that the ferocity of those people was so great as to make them regard all strangers as enemies and call them by the same name it is not besides consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of nature that any state should regard its public enemies with a friendly eye or preserve any such sentiments for them as the roman orator would ascribe to his ancestors not to mention that the early romans really exercised piracy as we learn from their first treaties with carthage preserved by polybius lib   and consequently like the salle and algerine rovers were actually at war with most nations and a stranger and an enemy were with them almost synonimous not to mention the great equality of fortunes amongst the inhabitants of the ancient republics where every field belonging to a different proprietor was able to maintain a family and rendered the numbers of citizens very considerable even without trade and manufactures  but though the want of trade and manufactures amongst a free and very martial people may sometimes have no other effect than to render the public more powerful it is certain that in the common course of human affairs it will have a quite contrary tendency sovereigns must take mankind as they find them and cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in their principles and ways of thinking a long course of time with a variety of accidents and circumstances are requisite to produce those great revolutions which so much diversify the face of human affairs and the less natural any set of principles are which support a particular society the more difficulty will a legislator meet with in raising and cultivating them it is his best policy to comply with the common bent of mankind and give it all the improvements of which it is susceptible now according to the most natural course of things industry and arts and trade increase the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects and that policy is violent which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals this will easily appear from a few considerations which will present to us the consequences of sloth and barbarity  where manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated the bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture and if their skill and industry increase there must arise a great superfluity from their labor beyond what suffices to maintain them they have no temptation therefore to increase their skill and industry since they cannot exchange that superfluity for any commodities which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity a habit of indolence naturally prevails the greater part of the land lies uncultivated what is cultivated yields not its utmost for want of skill or assiduity in the farmers if at any time the public exigencies require that great numbers should be employed in the public service the labor of the people furnishes now no superfluities by which these numbers can be maintained the laborers cannot increase their skill and industry on a sudden lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for some years the armies mean while must either make sudden and violent conquests or disband for want of subsistence a regular attack or defense therefore is not to be expected from such a people and their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers  every thing in the world is purchased by labor and our passions are the only causes of labor when a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts the proprietors of land as well as the farmers study agriculture as a science and redouble their industry and attention the superfluity which arises from their labor is not lost but is exchanged with the manufacturers for those commodities which mens luxury now makes them covet by this means land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life than what suffices for those who cultivate it in times of peace and tranquillity this superfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts but it is easy for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into soldiers and maintain them by that superfluity which arises from the labor of the farmers accordingly we find that this is the case in all civilized governments when the sovereign raises an army what is the consequence he imposes a tax this tax obliges all the people to retrench what is least necessary to their subsistence those who labor in such commodities must either enlist in the troops or turn themselves to agriculture and thereby oblige some laborers to enlist for want of business and to consider the matter abstractly manufactures increase the power of the state only as they store up so much labor and that of a kind which the public may lay claim to without depriving any one of the necessaries of life the more labor therefore is employed beyond mere necessaries the more powerful is any state since the persons engaged in that labor may easily be converted to the public service in a state without manufactures there may be the same number of hands but there is not the same quantity of labor nor of the same kind all the labor is there bestowed upon necessaries which can admit of little or no abatement  thus the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the state are in a great measure united with regard to trade and manufactures it is a violent method and in most cases impracticable to oblige the labourer to toil in order to raise from the land more than what subsists himself and family furnish him with manufactures and commodities and he will do it of himself afterward you will find it easy to seize some part of his superfluous labor and employ it in the public service without giving him his wonted return being accustomed to labor he will think this less grievous than if at once you obliged him to an augmentation of labor without any reward the case is the same with regard to the other members of the state the greater is the stock of labor of all kinds the greater quantity may be taken from the heap without making any sensible alteration upon it  a public granary of corn a storehouse of cloth a magazine of arms all these must be allowed to be real riches and strength in any state trade and industry are really nothing but a stock of labor which in time of peace and tranquillity is employed for the ease and satisfaction of individuals but in the exigencies of state may in part be turned to public advantage could we convert a city into a kind of fortified camp and infuse into each breast so martial a genius and such a passion for public good as to make every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the public these affections might now as in ancient times prove alone a sufficient spur to industry and support the community it would then be advantageous as in camps to banish all arts and luxury and by restrictions on equipage and tables make the provisions and forage last longer than if the army were loaded with a number of superfluous retainers but as these principles are too disinterested and too difficult to support it is requisite to govern men by other passions and animate them with a spirit of avarice and industry art and luxury the camp is in this case loaded with a superfluous retinue but the provisions flow in proportionably larger the harmony of the whole is still supported and the natural bent of mens minds being more complied with individuals as well as the public find their account in the observance of those maxims  the same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of foreign commerce in augmenting the power of the state as well as the riches and happiness of the subjects it increases the stock of labor in the nation and the sovereign may convert what share of it he finds necessary to the service of the public foreign trade by its imports furnishes materials for new manufactures and by its exports it produces labor in particular commodities which could not be consumed at home in short a kingdom that has a large import and export must abound more with labor and that upon delicacies and luxuries than a kingdom which rests contented with its native commodities it is therefore more powerful as well as richer and happier the individuals reap the benefit of these commodities so far as they gratify the senses and appetites and the public is also a gainer while a greater stock of labor is by this means stored up against any public exigency that is a greater number of laborious men are maintained who may be diverted to the public service without robbing any one of the necessaries or even the chief conveniences of life  if we consult history we shall find that in most nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures and given birth to domestic luxury the temptation is stronger to make use of foreign commodities which are ready for use and which are entirely new to us than to make improvements on any domestic commodity which always advance by slow degrees and never affect us by their novelty the profit is also very great in exporting what is superfluous at home and what bears no price to foreign nations whose soil or climate is not favorable to that commodity thus men become acquainted with the pleasures of luxury and the profits of commerce and their delicacy and industry being once awakened carry them to farther improvements in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade and this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from a commerce with strangers it rouses men from their lethargic indolence and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury which they never before dreamed of raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed and at the same time the few merchants who possess the secret of this importation and exportation make exorbitant profits and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce imitation soon diffuses all those arts while domestic manufacturers emulate the foreign in their improvements and work up every homecommodity to the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible their own steel and iron in such laborious hands become equal to the gold and rubies of the indies  when the affairs of the society are once brought to this situation a nation may lose most of its foreign trade and yet continue a great and powerful people if strangers will not take any particular commodity of ours we must cease to labor in it the same hands will turn themselves toward some refinement in other commodities which may be wanted at home and there must always be materials for them to work upon till every person in the state who possesses riches possesses as great plenty of homecommodities and those in as great perfection as he desires which can never possibly happen china is represented as one of the most flourishing empires in the world though it has very little commerce beyond its own territories  it will not i hope be considered as a superfluous digression if i here observe that as the multitude of mechanical arts is advantageous so is the great number of persons to whose share the productions of these arts fall a too great disproportion among the citizens weakens any state every person if possible ought to enjoy the fruits of his labor in a full possession of all the necessaries and many of the conveniences of life noone can doubt but such an equality is most suitable to human nature and diminishes much less from the happiness of the rich than it adds to that of the poor it also augments the power of the state and makes any extraordinary taxes or impositions be paid with much more cheerfulness where the riches are engrossed by a few these must contribute very largely to the supplying the public necessities but when the riches are dispersed among multitudes the burden feels light on every shoulder and the taxes make not a very sensible difference on any ones way of living  add to this that where the riches are in few hands these must enjoy all the power and will readily conspire to lay the whole burden on the poor and oppress them still farther to the discouragement of all industry  in this circumstance consists the great advantage of england above any nation at present in the world or that appears in the records of any story it is true the english feel some disadvantages in foreign trade by the high price of labor which is in part the effect of the riches of their artizans as well as of the plenty of money but as foreign trade is not the most material circumstance it is not to be put in competition with the happiness of so many millions and if there were no more to endear to them that free government under which they live this alone were sufficient the poverty of the common people is a natural if not an infallible consequence of absolute monarchy though i doubt whether it be always true on the other hand that their riches are an infallible consequence of liberty that seems to depend on particular accidents and a certain turn of thinking in conjunction with liberty my lord bacon accounting for the great advantages obtained by the english in their wars with france ascribes them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common people amongst the former yet the governments of the two kingdoms were at that time pretty much alike where the laborers and artizans are accustomed to work for low wages and to retain but a small part of the fruits of their labor it is difficult for them even in a free government to better their condition or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages but even where they are accustomed to a more plentiful way of life it is easy for the rich in a despotic government to conspire against them and throw the whole burden of the taxes on their shoulders  it may seem an odd position that the poverty of the common people in france italy and spain is in some measure owing to the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate and yet there want not many reasons to justify this paradox in such a fine mold or soil as that of those more southern regions agriculture is an easy art and one man with a couple of sorry horses will be able in a season to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty considerable rent to the proprietor all the art which the farmer knows is to leave his ground fallow for a year as soon as it is exhausted and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it and restore its fertility such poor peasants therefore require only a simple maintenance for their labor they have no stock nor riches which claim more and at the same time they are for ever dependent on their landlord who gives no leases nor fears that his land will be spoiled by the ill methods of cultivation in england the land is rich but coarse must be cultivated at a great expense and produces slender crops when not carefully managed and by a method which gives not the full profit but in a course of several years a farmer therefore in england must have a considerable stock and a long lease which beget proportional profits the fine vineyards of champagne and burgundy that often yield to the landlord above five pounds per acre are cultivated by peasants who have scarce bread and the reason is that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs along with instruments of husbandry which they can buy for  0 shillings the farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those countries but the graziers are most at their ease of all those who cultivate the land the reason is still the same men must have profits proportionable to their expense and hazard where so considerable a number of the laboring poor as the peasants and farmers are in very low circumstances all the rest must partake of their poverty whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican  we may form a similar remark with regard to the general history of mankind what is the reason why no people living betwixt the tropics could ever yet attain to any art or civility or reach even any police in their government and any military discipline while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether deprived of these advantages it is probable that one cause of this phenomenon is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid zone that render clothes and houses less requisite for the inhabitants and thereby remove in part that necessity which is the great spur to industry and invention curis acuens mortalia corda not to mention that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy the fewer quarrels are likely to arise amongst them and the less necessity will there be for a settled police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other  discourse ii of luxury luxury is a word of a very uncertain signification and may be taken in a good as well as a bad sense in general it means great refinement in the gratification of the senses and any degree of it may be innocent or blameable according to the age or country or condition of the person the bounds betwixt the virtue and the vice cannot here be fixed exactly more than in other moral subjects to imagine that the gratifying any of the senses or the indulging any delicacy in meats drinks or apparel is of itself a vice can never enter into any head that is not disordered by the frenzies of a fanatical enthusiasm i have indeed heard of a monk abroad who because the windows of his cell opened upon a very noble prospect made a covenant with his eyes never to turn that way or receive so sensual a gratification and such is the crime of drinking champagne or burgundy preferably to small beer or porter these indulgences are only vices when they are pursued at the expense of some virtue as liberality or charity in like manner as they are follies when for them a man ruins his fortune and reduces himself to want and beggary where they entrench upon no virtue but leave ample subject whence to provide for friends family and every proper object of generosity or compassion they are entirely innocent and have in every age been acknowledged such by almost all moralists to be entirely occupyd with the luxury of the table for instance without any relish for the pleasures of ambition study or conversation is a mark of gross stupidity and is incompatible with any vigor of temper or genius to confine ones expense entirely to such a gratification without regard to friends or family is an indication of a heart entirely devoid of humanity or benevolence but if a man reserve time sufficient for all laudable pursuits and money sufficient for all generous purposes he is free from every shadow of blame or reproach  since luxury may be considered either as innocent or blameable one may be surprised at those preposterous opinions which have been entertained concerning it while men of libertine principles bestow praises even on vicious luxury and represent it as highly advantageous to society and on the other hand men of severe morals blame even the most innocent luxury and represent it as the source of all the corruptions disorders and factions incident to civil government we shall here endeavor to correct both these extremes by proving first that the ages of refinement and luxury are both the happiest and most virtuous secondly that wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carried a degree too far is a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society  to prove the first point we need but consider the effects of luxury both on private and on public life human happiness according to the most received notions seems to consist in three ingredients action pleasure and indolence and though these ingredients ought to be mixed in different proportions according to the particular dispositions of the person yet no one ingredient can be entirely wanting without destroying in some measure the relish of the whole composition indolence or repose indeed seems not of itself to contribute much to our enjoyment but like sleep is requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of human nature which cannot support an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure that quick march of the spirits which takes a man from himself and chiefly gives satisfaction does in the end exhaust the mind and requires some intervals of repose which though agreeable for a moment yet if prolonged beget a languor and lethargy that destroy all enjoyment education custom and example have a mighty influence in turning the mind to any of these pursuits and it must be owned that where they promote a relish for action and pleasure they are so far favorable to human happiness in times when industry and arts flourish men are kept in perpetual occupation and enjoy as their reward the occupation itself as well as those pleasures which are the fruits of their labor the mind acquires new vigor enlarges its powers and faculties and by an affiduity in honest industry both satisfies its natural appetites and prevents the growth of unnatural ones which commonly spring up when nourished with ease and idleness banish those arts from society you deprive men both of action and of pleasure and leaving nothing but indolence in their place you even destroy the relish of indolence which never is agreeable but when it succeeds to labor and recruits the spirits exhausted by too much application and fatigue  another advantage of industry and of refinements in the mechanical arts is that they commonly produce some refinements in the liberal arts nor can the one be carried to perfection without being accompanied in some degree with the other the same age which produces great philosophers and politicians renowned generals and poets usually abounds with skilful weavers and shipcarpenters we cannot reasonably expect that a piece of woolen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation that is ignorant of astronomy or where ethics are neglected the spirit of the age affects all the arts and the minds of men being once roused from their lethargy and put into a fermentation turn themselves on all fides and carry improvements into every art and science profound ignorance is totally banished and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures to think as well as to act to cultivate the pleasures of the mind as well as those of the body  the more these refined arts advance the more sociable do men become nor is it possible that when enriched with science and possessed of a fund of conversation they should be contented to remain in solitude or live with their fellow citizens in that distant manner which is peculiar to ignorant and barbarous nations they flock into cities love to receive and communicate knowledge to show their wit or their breeding their taste in conversation or living in clothes or furniture curiosity allures the wise vanity the foolish and pleasure both particular clubs and societies are every where formed both sexes meet in an easy and sociable manner and mens tempers as well as behavior refine apace so that beside the improvements they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts it is impossible but they must feel an increase of humanity from the very habit of conversing together and contributing to each others pleasure and entertainment thus industry knowledge and humanity are linkt together by an indissoluble chain and are found from experience as well as reason to be peculiar to the more polished and luxurious ages  nor are these advantages attended with disadvantages that bear any proportion to them the more men refine upon pleasure the less will they indulge in excesses of any kind because nothing is more destructive to true pleasure than such excesses one may safely affirm that the tartars are oftener guilty of beastly gluttony when they feast on their dead horses than european courtiers with all their refinements of cookery and if libertine love or even infidelity to the marriage bed be more frequent in polite ages when it is often regarded only as a piece of gallantry drunkenness on the other hand is much less common a vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body and in this matter i would appeal not only to an ovid or a petronius but to a seneca or a cato we know that caesar during catalines conspiracy being necessitated to put into catos hands a billetdoux which discovered an intrigue with servilia catos own sister that stern philosopher threw it back to him with indignation and in the bitterness of his wrath gave him the appellation of drunkard as a term more opprobrious than that with which he could more justly have reproached him  but industry knowledge and humanity are not advantageous in private life alone they diffuse their beneficial influence on the public and render the government as great and flourishing as they make individuals happy and prosperous the increase and consumption of all the commodities which serve to the ornament and pleasure of life are advantageous to society because at the same time that they multiply those innocent gratifications to individuals they are a kind of storehouse of labor which in the exigencies of state may be turned to the public service in a nation where there is no demand for such superfluities men sink into indolence lose all the enjoyment of life and are useless to the public which cannot maintain nor support its fleets and armies from the industry of such slothful members  the bounds of all the european kingdoms are at present pretty near the same they were two hundred years ago but what a difference is there in the power and grandeur of those kingdoms which can be ascribed to nothing but the increase of art and industry when charles the viii of france invaded italy he carried with him about  0000 men and yet this armament so exhausted the nation as we learn from guicciardin that for some years it was not able to make so great an effort the late king of france in time of war kept in pay above  00000 men the inscription on the placedevendome says   0000 though from mazarines death to his own he was engaged in a course of wars that lasted near thirty years  this industry is much promoted by the knowledge inseparable from the ages of arts and luxury as on the other hand this knowledge enables the public to make the best advantage of the industry of its subjects laws order police discipline these can never be carried to any degree of perfection before human reason has refined itself by exercise and by an application to the more vulgar arts at least of commerce and manufactures can we expect that a government will be well modeled by a people who know not how to make a spinning wheel or to employ a loom to advantage not to mention that all ignorant ages are infested with superstition which throws the government off its bias and disturbs men in the pursuit of their interest and happiness  knowledge in the arts of government naturally begets mildness and moderation by instructing men in the advantages of humane maxims above rigor and severity which drive subjects into rebellion and render the return to submission impracticable by cutting off all hopes of pardon when mens temper is softened as well as their knowledge improved this humanity appears still more conspicuous and is the chief characteristic that distinguishes a civilized age from times of barbarity and ignorance factions are then less inveterate revolutions less tragical authority less severe and seditions less frequent even foreign wars abate of their cruelty and after the field of battle where honor and interest steel men against compassion as well as fear the combatants divest themselves of the brute and resume the man  nor need we fear that men by losing their ferocity will lose their martial spirit or become less undaunted and vigorous in defense of their country or their liberty the arts have no such effect in enervating either the mind or body on the contrary industry their inseparable attendant adds new force to both and if anger which is said to be the whetstone of courage loses somewhat of its asperity by politeness and refinement a sense of honor which is a stronger more constant and more governable principle acquires fresh vigor by that elevation of genius which arises from knowledge and a good education add to this that courage can neither have any duration nor be of any use when not accompanied with discipline and martial skill which are seldom found among a barbarous people the ancients remarked that datames was the only barbarian that ever knew the art of war and pyrrhus seeing the romans marshal their army with some art and skill said with surprise these barbarians have nothing barbarous in their discipline it is observable that as the old romans by applying themselves solely to war were the only uncivilizd people that ever possessed military discipline so the modern italians are the only civilized people among europeans that ever wanted courage and a martial spirit those who would ascribe this effeminacy of the italians to their luxury or politeness or application to the arts need but consider the french and english whose bravery is as uncontestable as their love of luxury and their assiduity in commerce the italian historians give us a more satisfactory reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen they show us how the sword was dropped at once by all the italian sovereigns while the venetian aristocracy was jealous of its subjects the florentine democracy applied itself entirely to commerce rome was governed by priests and naples by women war then became the business of soldiers of fortune who spared one another and to the astonishment of the world could engage a whole day in what they called a battle and return at night to their camps without the least bloodshed  what has chiefly induced severe moralists to declaim against luxury and refinement in pleasure is the example of ancient rome which joining to its poverty and rusticity virtue and public spirit rose to such a surprising height of grandeur and liberty but having learned from its conquered provinces the grecian and asiatic luxury fell into every kind of corruption whence arose sedition and civil wars attended at last with the total loss of liberty all the latin classics whom we peruse in our infancy are full of these sentiments and universally ascribe the ruin of their state to the arts and riches imported from the east insomuch that sallust represents a taste for painting as a vice no less than lewdness and drinking and so popular were these sentiments during the latter ages of the republic that this author abounds in praises of the old rigid roman virtue though himself the most egregious instance of modern luxury and corruption speaks contemptuously of grecian eloquence though the most elegant writer in the world nay employs preposterous digressions and declamations to this purpose though a model of taste and correctness  but it would be easy to prove that these writers mistook the cause of the disorders in the roman state and ascribed to luxury and the arts what really proceeded from an ill modeled government and the unlimited extent of conquests luxury or refinement on pleasure has no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption the value which all men put upon any particular pleasure depends on comparison and experience nor is a porter less greedy of money which he spends on bacon and brandy than a courtier who purchases champagne and ortolans riches are valuable at all times and to all men because they always purchase pleasures such as men are accustomed to and desire nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but a sense of honor and virtue which if it be not nearly equal at all times will naturally abound most in ages of luxury and knowledge  of all european kingdoms poland seems the most defective in the arts of war as well as peace mechanical as well as liberal and yet it is there that venality and corruption do most prevail the nobles seem to have preserved their crown elective for no other purpose but regularly to sell it to the highest bidder this is almost the only species of commerce with which that people are acquainted  the liberties of england so far from decaying since the origin of luxury and the arts have never flourished so much as during that period and though corruption may seem to increase of late years this is chiefly to be ascribed to our established liberty when our princes have found the impossibility of governing without parliaments or of terrifying parliaments by the fantom of prerogative not to mention that this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more among the electors than the elected and therefore cannot justly be ascribed to any refinements in luxury  if we consider the matter in a proper light we shall find that luxury and the arts are rather favorable to liberty and have a natural tendency to preserve if not produce a free government in rude unpolished nations where the arts are neglected all the labor is bestowed on the cultivation of the ground and the whole society divides into two classes proprietors of land and their vassals or tenants the latter are necessarily dependent and fitted for slavery and subjection especially where they possess no riches and are not valued for their knowledge in agriculture as must always be the case where the arts are neglected the former naturally erect themselves into petty tyrants and must either submit to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order or if they will preserve their independency like the gothic barons they must fall into feuds and contests amongst themselves and throw the whole society into such confusion as is perhaps worse than the most despotic government but where luxury nourishes commerce and industry the peasants by a proper cultivation of the land become rich and independent while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of the property and draw authority and consideration to that middling rank of men who are the best and firmest basis of public liberty these submit not to slavery like the poor peasants from poverty and meanness of spirit and having no hopes of tyrannizing over others like the barons they are not tempted for the sake of that gratification to submit to the tyranny of their sovereign they covet equal laws which may secure their property and preserve them from monarchical as well as aristocratical tyranny  the house of commons is the support of our popular government and all the world acknowledge that it owed its chief influence and consideration to the increase of commerce which threw such a balance of property into the hands of the commons how inconsistent then is it to blame so violently luxury or a refinement in the arts and to represent it as the bane of liberty and public spirit  to declaim against present times and magnify the virtue of remote ancestors is a propensity almost inherent in human nature and as the sentiments and opinions of civilized ages alone are transmitted to posterity hence it is that we meet with so many severe judgments pronounced against luxury and even science and hence it is that at present we give so ready an assent to them but the fallacy is easily perceived from comparing different nations that are contemporaries where we both judge more impartially and can better set in opposition those manners with which we are sufficiently acquainted treachery and cruelty the most pernicious and most odious of all vices seem peculiar to uncivilizd ages and by the refined greeks and romans were ascribed to all the barbarous nations which surrounded them they might justly therefore have presumed that their own ancestors so highly celebrated possessed no greater virtue and were as much inferior to their posterity in honor and humanity as in taste and science an ancient frank or saxon may be highly extolled but i believe every man would think his life or fortune much less secure in the hands of a moor or tartar than in those of a french or english gentleman the rank of men the most civilized in the most civilized nations  we come now to the second position which we proposed to illustrate viz that as innocent luxury or a refinement in pleasure is advantageous to the public so wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carried a degree farther begins to be a quality pernicious though perhaps not the most pernicious to political society  let us consider what we call vicious luxury no gratification however sensual can of itself be esteemed vicious a gratification is only vicious when it engrosses all a mans expense and leaves no ability for such acts of duty and generosity as are required by his situation and fortune suppose that he correct the vice and employ part of his expense in the education of his children in the support of his friends and in relieving the poor would any prejudice result to society on the contrary the same consumption would arise and that labor which at present is employed only in producing a slender gratification to one man would relieve the necessitous and bestow satisfaction on hundreds the same care and toil which raise a dish of peace at christmas would give bread to a whole family during six months to say that without a vicious luxury the labor would not have been employed at all is only to say that there is some other defect in human nature such as indolence selfishness inattention to others for which luxury in some measure provides a remedy as one poison may be an antidote to another but virtue like wholesome food is better than poisons however corrected  suppose the same number of men that are at present in britain with the same soil and climate i ask is it not possible for them to be happier by the most perfect way of life that can be imagined and by the greatest reformation which omnipotence itself could work in their temper and disposition to assert that they cannot appears evidently ridiculous as the land is able to maintain more than all its inhabitants they could never in such an utopian state feel any other ills than those which arise from bodily sickness and these are not the half of human miseries all other ills spring from some vice either in ourselves or others and even many of our diseases proceed from the same origin remove the vices and the ills follow you must only take care to remove all the vices if you remove part you may render the matter worse by banishing vicious luxury without curing sloth and an indifference to others you only diminish industry in the state and add nothing to mens charity or their generosity let us therefore rest contented with asserting that two opposite vices in a state may be more advantageous than either of them alone but let us never pronounce vice in it self advantageous is it not very inconsistent for an author to assert in one page that moral distinctions are inventions of politicians for public interest and in the next page maintain that vice is advantageous to the public fable of the he is and indeed it seems upon any system of morality little less than a contradiction in terms to talk of a vice that is in general beneficial to society  i thought this reasoning necessary in order to give some light to a philosophical question which has been much disputed in britain i call it a philosophical question not a political one for whatever may be the consequence of such a miraculous transformation of mankind as would endow them with every species of virtue and free them from every vice this concerns not the magistrate who aims only at possibilities he cannot cure every vice by substituting a virtue in its place very often he can only cure one vice by another and in that case he ought to prefer what is least pernicious to society luxury when excessive is the source of many ills but is in general preferable to sloth and idleness which would commonly succeed in its place and are more pernicious both to private persons and to the public when sloth reigns a mean uncultivated way of life prevails amongst individuals without society without enjoyment and if the sovereign in such a situation demands the service of his subjects the labor of the state suffices only to furnish the necessaries of life to the laborers and can afford nothing to those who are employed in the public service  discourse iii of money money is not properly speaking one of the subjects of commerce but only the instrument which men have agreed upon to facilitate the exchange of one commodity for another it is none of the wheels of trade it is the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy if we consider any one kingdom by itself it is evident that the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence since the prices of commodities are always proportioned to the plenty of money and a crown in harry the viis time served the same purpose as a pound does at present it is only the public that draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money and that only in its wars and negociations with foreign states and this is the reason why all rich and trading countries from carthage to britain and holland have employed mercenary troops which they hired from their poorer neighbors were they to make use of their native subjects they would find less advantage from their superior riches and from their great plenty of gold and silver since the pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence our small army in britain of  0000 men are maintained at as great expense as a french army thrice as numerous the english fleet during the late war required as much money to support it as all the roman legions which kept the whole world in subjection during the time of the emperors aprivate soldier in the roman infantry had a denarius a day somewhat less than   pence the roman emperors had commonly    legions in pay which allowing  000 men to a legion makes    000 tacit ann lib   it is true there were also auxiliaries to the legions but their numbers are uncertain as well as their pay to consider only the legionaries the pay of the private men could not exceed   00000 pound now the parliament in the last war commonly allowed for the fleet   00000 we have therefore  00000 over for the officers and other expenses of the roman legions there seem to have been but few officers in the roman armies in comparison of what are employed in all our modern troops except some swiss corpse and these officers had very small pay a centurion for instance only double a common soldier and as the soldiers from their pay tacit ann lib   bought their own clothes arms tents and baggage this must also diminish considerably the other charges of the army so little expensive was that mighty government and so easy was its yoke over the world and indeed this is the more natural conclusion from the foregoing calculations for money after the conquest of egypt seems to have been nearly in as great plenty at rome as it is at present in the richest of the european kingdoms   the greater number of people and their greater industry are serviceable in all cases at home and abroad in private and in public but the greater plenty of money is very limited in its use and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce with foreigners  there seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human affairs which check the growth of trade and riches and hinder them from being confined entirely to one people as might naturally at first be dreaded from the advantages of an established commerce where one nation has got the start of another in trade it is very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lost because of the superior industry and skill of the former and the greater stocks which its merchants are possest of and which enable them to trade for so much smaller profits but these advantages are compensated in some measure by the low prices of labor in every nation that has not an extensive commerce and does not very much abound in gold and silver manufactures therefore gradually shift their places leaving those countries and provinces which they have already enriched and flying to others whither they are allured by the cheapness of provisions and labor till they have enriched these also and are again banished by the same causes and in general we may observe that the dearness of every thing from plenty of money is a disadvantage that attends an established commerce and sets bounds to it in every country by enabling the poorer states to undersell the richer in all foreign markets  this has made me entertain a great doubt concerning the benefit of banks and paper credit which are so generally esteemed advantageous to every nation that provisions and labor should become dear by the increase of trade and money is in many respects an inconvenience but an inconvenience that is unavoidable and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity which are the end of all our wishes it is compensated by the advantages we reap from the possession of these precious metals and the weight which they give the nation in all foreign wars and negotiations but there appears no reason for increasing that inconvenience by a counterfeit money which foreigners will never accept of and which any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing there are it is true many people in every rich state who having large sums of money would prefer paper with good security as being of more easy transport and more safe custody if the public provide not a bank private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance as the goldsmiths formerly did in london or as the bankers do at present in dublin and therefore it is better it may be thought that a public company should enjoy the benefit of that paper credit which always will have place in every opulent kingdom but to endeavor artificially to increase such a credit can never be the interest of any trading nation but must lay them under disadvantages by increasing money beyond its natural proportion to labor and commodities and thereby heightening their price to the merchant and manufacturer and in this view it must be allowed that no bank could be more advantageous than such a one as locked up all the money it received and never augmented the circulating coin as is usual by returning part of its treasure into commerce a public bank by this expedient might cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and money jobbers and though the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank for according to the preceding supposition it would have no profit from its dealings the national advantage resulting from the low price of labor and the destruction of paper credit would be a sufficient compensation not to mention that so large a sum lying ready at command would be a great convenience in times of public danger and distress and might be replacd at leisure when peace and tranquillity were restored to the nation  but of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely hereafter and i shall finish this essay of money by proposing and explaining two observations which may perhaps serve to employ the thought of our speculative politicians for to these only i all along address myself it is enough that i submit to the ridicule sometimes in this age attached to the character of a philosopher without adding to it that which belongs to a projector  i t was a shrewd observation of anacharsis plut quomodo quis suos profectus in virtute sentire possit the scythian who had never seen money in his own country that gold and silver seemed to him of no use to the greeks but to assist them in numeration and arithmetic it is indeed evident that money is nothing but the representation of labor and commodities and serves only as a method of rating or estimating them where coin is in greater plenty as a greater quantity of it is then required to represent the same quantity of goods it can have no effect either good or bad taking a nation within itself no more than it would make any alteration on a merchants books if instead of the arabian method of notation which requires few characters he should make use of the roman which requires a great many nay the greater plenty of money like the roman characters is rather inconvenient and troublesome and requires greater care to keep and transport it but notwithstanding this conclusion which must be allowed just it is certain that since the discover of the mines in america industry has increased in all the nations of europe except in the possessors of those mines and this may justly be ascribed amongst other reasons to the increase of gold and silver accordingly we find that in every kingdom into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly every thing takes a new face labor and industry gain life the merchant becomes more enterprizing the manufacturer more diligent and skillful and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention this is not easily to be accounted for if we consider only the influence which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself by heightening the price of commodities and obliging every one to pay a greater number of these little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases and as to foreign trade it appears that great plenty of money is rather disadvantageous by raising the price of every kind of labor  to account then for this phenomenon we must consider that though the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the increase of gold and silver yet it follows not immediately upon that increase but some time is required before the money circulate through the whole state and make its effects be felt on all ranks of people at first no alteration is perceived by degrees it raises the price first of one commodity then of another till the whole at last rises to a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which is in the kingdom in my opinion it is only in this interval or intermediate situation betwixt the acquisition of money and rise of prices that the increasing quantity of gold and silver is favorable to industry when any quantity of money is imported into a nation it is not at first dispersed into many hands but is confined to the coffers of a few persons who immediately seek to employ it to the best advantage here are a set of manufacturers or merchants we shall suppose who have received returns of gold and silver for goods which they sent to cadiz they are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly who never dream of demanding higher wages but are glad of employment from such good paymasters if workmen become scarce the manufacturer gives higher wages but at first requires an increase of labor and this is willingly submitted to by the artizan who can now eat and drink better to compensate his additional toil and fatigue he carries his money to market where he finds every thing at the same price as formerly but returns with greater quantity and of better kinds for the use of his family the farmer and gardener finding that all their commodities are taken off apply themselves with alacrity to the raising of more and at the same time can afford to take better and more clothes from their tradesmen whose price is the same as formerly and their industry only whetted by so much new gain it is easy to trace the money in its progress through the whole commonwealth where we shall find that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual before it increase the price of labor  and that the specie may increase to a considerable pitch before it have this latter effect appears amongst other reasons from the frequent operations of the french king on the money where it was always found that the augmenting the numerary value did not produce a proportional rise of the prices at least for some time in the last year of louis the xiv money was raised three sevenths but prices augmented only one corn in france is now sold at the same price or for the same number of livres it was in      though silver was then at  0 livres the mark and is now at  0 these facts i give upon the authority of mons de tot in his reflections politiques an author of reputation though i must confess that the facts which he advances on other occasions are often so suspicious as to make his authority less in this matter however the general observation that the augmenting the money in france does not at first proportionably augment the prices is certainly just  by the bye this seems to be one of the best reasons for a gradual and universal augmentation of the money which can be given though it has been entirely overlooked in all those volumes which have been wrote on that question by melon du tot and paris de verney were all our money for instance recoind and a pennys worth of silver taken from every shilling the new shilling would probably purchase every thing that could have been bought by the old the prices of every thing would thereby be insensibly diminished foreign trade enlivened and domestic industry by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and shillings would receive some increase and encouragement in executing such a project twoud be better to make the new shilling pass for    halfpence in order to preserve the illusion and make it be taken for the same   not to mention the great addition of gold and silver which may have come into that kingdom since the former period  from the whole of this reasoning we may conclude that it is of no manner of consequence with regard to the domestic happiness of a state whether money be in a greater or less quantity the good policy of the magistrate consists only in keeping it if possible still increasing because by that means he keeps a spirit of industry alive in the nation and increases the stock of labor wherein consists all real power and riches a nation whose money decreases is actually at that time much weaker and more miserable than another nation who possesses no more money but is on the increasing hand this will be easily accounted for if we consider that the alterations in the quantity of money either on the one side or the other are not immediately attended with proportionable alterations in the prices of commodities there is always an interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation and this interval is as pernicious to industry when gold and silver are diminishing as it is advantageous when these metals are increasing the workman has not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant though he pays the same price for every thing in the market the farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cattle though he must pay the same rent to his landlord the poverty and beggary and sloth which must ensue are easily foreseen  ii the second observation i proposed to make with regard to money may be explained after the following manner there are some kingdoms and many provinces in europe and all of them were once in the same condition where money is so scarce that the landlord can get none at all from his tenants but is obliged to take his rent in kind and either to consume it himself or transport it to places where he may find a market in those countries the prince can levy few or no taxes but in the same manner and as he will receive very small benefit from impositions so paid it is evident that such a kingdom has very little force even at home and cannot maintain fleets and armies to the same extent as if every part of it abounded in gold and silver there is surely a greater disproportion betwixt the force of germany at present and what it was three centuries ago the italians gave to the emperor maximilian the nickname of pocchidanari none of the enterprises of that prince ever succeeded for want of money than there is in its industry people and manfactures the austrian dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well cultivated and are of great extent but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of europe proceeding as is commonly supposed from their scarcity of money how do all these facts agree with that principle of reason that the quantity of gold and silver is in itself altogether indifferent according to that principle wherever a sovereign has numbers of subjects and these have plenty of commodities he should of course be great and powerful and they rich and happy independent of the greater or lesser abundance of the precious metals these admit of divisions and subdivisions to a great extent and where they would become so small as to be in danger of being lost it is easy to mix them with a baser metal as is practiced in some countries of europe and by that means raise them to a bulk more sensible and convenient they still serve the same purposes of exchange whatever their number may be or whatever color they may be supposed to have  to these difficulties i answer that the effect here supposed to flow from scarcity of money really arises from the manners and customs of the inhabitants and that we mistake as is usual a collateral effect for a cause the contradiction is only apparent but it requires some thought and reflection to discover the principles by which we can reconcile reason to experience  it seems a maxim almost selfevident that the prices of every thing depend on the proportion betwixt commodities and money and that any considerable alteration on either of these has the same effect either of heightening or diminishing the price increase the commodities they become cheaper increase the money they rise in their value as on the other hand a diminution of the former and that of the latter have contrary tendencies  it is also evident that the prices do not so much depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and of money which are in a nation as on that of the commodities which come or may come to market and of the money which circulates if the coin be locked up in chests it is the same thing with regard to prices as if it were annihilated if the commodities be hoarded in granaries a like effect follows as the money and commodities in these cases never meet they cannot affect each other were we at any time to form conjectures concerning the prices of provisions the corn which the farmer must reserve for the maintenance of himself and family ought never to enter into the estimation it is only the overplus compared to the demand that determines the value  to apply these principles we must consider that in the first and more uncultivated ages of any state ere fancy has confounded her wants with those of nature men contented with the productions of their own fields or with those rude preparations which they themselves can work upon them have little occasion for exchange or at least for money which by agreement is the common measure of exchange the wool of the farmers own flock spun in his own family and wrought by a neighboring weaver who receives his payment in corn or wool suffices for furniture and clothing the carpenter the smith the mason the tailor are retained by wages of a like nature and the landlord himself dwelling in the neighborhood is contented to receive his rent in the commodities raised by the farmer the greatest part of these he consumes at home in rustic hospitality the rest perhaps he disposes of for money to the neighboring town whence he draws the materials of his expense and luxury  but after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments and live not always at home nor are contented with what can be raised in their neighborhood there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds and more money enters into that exchange the tradesmen will not be paid in corn because they want something more than barely to eat the farmer goes beyond his own parish for the commodities he purchases and cannot always carry his commodities to the merchant who supplies him the landlord lives in the capital or in a foreign country and demands his rent in gold and silver which can easily be transported to him great undertakers and manufacturers and merchants arise in every commodity and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie and consequently in this situation of society the coin enters into many more contracts and by that means is much more employed than in the former  the necessary effect is that provided the money does not increase in the nation every thing must become much cheaper in times of industry and refinement than in rude uncultivated ages it is the proportion betwixt the money that circulates and the commodities in the market that determines the prices goods that are consumed at home or exchanged with other goods in the neighborhood never come to market they affect not in the least the current specie with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated and consequently this method of using them sinks the proportion on the side of the commodities and increases the prices but after money enters into all contracts and sales and is every where the measure of exchange the same national cash has a much greater task to perform all commodities are then in the market the sphere of circulation is enlarged it is the same case as if that individual sum were to serve a larger kingdom and therefore the proportion being here diminished on the side of the money every thing must become cheaper and the prices gradually fall  by the most exact computations that have been formed all over europe after making allowance for the change in the numerary value or the denomination it is found that the prices of all things have only risen three or at most four times since the discovery of the west indies but will any one assert that there is no more than four times the coin in europe that was in the fifteenth century and the centuries preceding it the spaniards and portuguese from their mines the english french and dutch by their african trade and by their interlopers in the west indies bring home about seven millions a year of which not above a tenth part goes to the east indies this sum alone in five years would probably double the ancient stock of money in europe and no other satisfactory reason can be given why all prices have not risen to a much more exorbitant height except that derived from a change of customs and manners besides that more commodities are produced by additional industry the same commodities come more to market after men depart from their ancient simplicity of manners and though this increase has not been equal to that of money it has however been considerable and has preserved the proportion betwixt coin and commodities nearer the ancient standard  were the question proposed which of these methods of living in the people the simple or the refined is the most advantageous to the state or public i should without much scruple prefer the latter in a view to politics at least and should produce this as an additional reason for the encouragement of trade and manufactures  when men live in the ancient simple manner and supply all their necessities from their domestic industry or from the neighborhood the sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part of his subjects and if he will impose on them any burdens he must take his payment in commodities with which alone they abound a method attended with such great and obvious inconveniences that they need not here be insisted on all the money he can pretend to raise must be from his principal cities where alone it circulates and these it is evident cannot afford him so much as the whole state could did gold and silver circulate through the whole but besides this obvious diminution of the revenue there is also another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation not only the sovereign receives less money but the same money goes not so far as in times of industry and general commerce every thing is dearer where the gold and silver are supposed equal and that because fewer commodities come to market and the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what is to be purchased by it whence alone the prices of every thing are fixed and determined  here then we may learn the fallacy of the remark often to be met with in historians and even in common conversation that any particular state is weak though fertile populous and well cultivated merely because it wants money it appears that the want of money can never injure any state within itself for men and commodities are the real strength of any community it is the simple manner of living which here hurts the public by confining the gold and silver to few hands and preventing its universal diffusion and circulation on the contrary industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state however small its quantity may be they digest it into every vein so to speak and make it enter into every transaction and contract no hand is entirely empty of it and as the prices of every thing fall by that means the sovereign has a double advantage he may draw money by his taxes from every part of the state and what he receives goes farther in every purchase and payment  we may infer from a comparison of prices that money is not more plentiful in china than it was in europe three centuries ago but what immense power is that empire possessed of if we may judge by the civil and military list maintained by it polybius lib   cap    tells us that provisions were so cheap in italy during his time that in some places the stated club in the inns was a semis a head little more than a farthing yet the roman power had even then subdued the whole known world about a century before that period the carthaginian ambassadors said by way of raillery that no people lived more sociably amongst themselves than the romans for that in every entertainment which as foreign ministers they received they still observed the same plate at every table plin lib    cap    the absolute quantity of the precious metals is a matter of great indifference there are only two circumstances of any importance viz their gradual increase and their thorough concoction and circulation through the state and the influence of both these circumstances has been here explained  in the following discourse we shall see an instance of a like fallacy as that above mentioned where a collateral effect is taken for a cause and where a consequence is ascribed to the plenty of money though it be really owing to a change in the manners and customs of the people  discourse iv of interest nothing is esteemed a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest and with reason though i believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended the lowness of interest is generally ascribed to the plenty of money but money however plentiful has no other effect if fixed than to raise the price of labor silver is more common than gold and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same commodities but do you pay less interest for it interest in batavia and jamaica is at  0 per cent in portugal at   though these places as we may learn from the prices of every thing abound much more in gold and silver than either london or amsterdam  were all the gold in england annihilated at once and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea would money be more plentiful or interest lower no surely we should only use silver instead of gold were gold rendered as common as silver and silver as common as copper would money be more plentiful or interest lower we may assuredly give the same answer our shillings would then be yellow and our halfpence white and we should have no guineas no other difference would ever be observed no alteration on commerce manufactures navigation or interest unless we imagine that the color of the metal is of any consequence  now what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance of the precious metals must hold in all inferior changes if the multiplying gold and silver fifteen times makes no difference much less can the doubling or tripling them all augmentation has no other effect than to heighten the price of labor and commodities and even this variation is little more than that of a name in the progress toward these changes the augmentation may have some influence by exciting industry but after the prices are settled suitable to the new abundance of gold and silver it has no manner of influence  an effect always holds proportion with its cause prices have risen about four times since the discovery of the indies and it is probable gold and silver have multiplied much more but interest has not fallen much above half the rate of interest therefore is not derived from the quantity of the precious metals  money having merely a fictitious value arising from the agreement and convention of men the greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence if we consider a nation within itself and when once fixed though in never so great abundance it has no other effect than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shining bits of metal for clothes furniture or equipage without increasing any one convenience of life if a man borrows money to build a house he then carries home a greater load because the stone timber lead glass etc with the labor of the masons and carpenters are represented by a greater quantity of gold and silver but as these metals are considered merely as representations there can no alteration arise from their bulk or quantity their weight or color either upon their real value or their interest the same interest in all cases bears the same proportion to the sum and if you lent me so much labor and so many commodities by receiving five per cent you receive always proportional labor and commodities however represented whether by yellow or white coin whether by a pound or an ounce it is in vain therefore to look for the cause of the fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and silver which is fixed in any nation  high interest arises from three circumstances a great demand for borrowing little riches to supply that demand and great profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry not of the scarcity of gold and silver low interest on the other hand proceeds from the three opposite circumstances a small demand for borrowing great riches to supply that demand and small profits arising from commerce and these circumstances are all connected together and proceed from the increase of industry and commerce not of gold and silver we shall endeavor to prove these points as fully and distinctly as possible and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small demand for borrowing  when a people have emergd ever so little from a state of barbarity and their numbers have increased beyond the original multitude there must immediately arise an inequality of property and while some possess large tracts of land others are confined within narrow limits and some are entirely without any landed property those who possess more land than they can labor employ those who possess none and agree to receive a determinate part of the product thus the landed interest is immediately established nor is there any settled government however rude wherein affairs are not on this footing of these proprietors of land some must presently discover themselves to be of different tempers from others and while one would willingly store up the product of his land for futurity another desires to consume at present what should suffice for many years but as the spending a settled revenue is a way of life entirely without occupation men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them that pleasures such as they are will be the pursuit of the greatest part of the landholders and the prodigals amongst them will always be more numerous than the misers in a state therefore where there is nothing but a landed interest as there is little frugality the borrowers must be very numerous and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it the difference depends not on the quantity of money but on the habits and manners which prevail by this alone the demand for borrowing is increased or diminished were money so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for sixpence as long as there are only landed gentry and peasants in the state the borrowers must be numerous and interest high the rent for the same farm would be heavier and more bulky but the same idleness of the landlord with the higher prices of commodities would dissipate it in the same time and produce the same necessity and demand for borrowing i have been informed by a very eminent lawyer and a man of great knowledge and observation that it appears from ancient papers and records that about four centuries ago money in scotland and probably in other parts of europe was only at five per cent and afterward rose to ten before the discovery of the west indies this fact is curious but might easily be reconciled to the foregoing reasoning men in that age lived so much at home and in so very simple and frugal a manner that they had no occasion for money and though the lenders were then few the borrowers were still fewer the high rate of interest among the early romans is accounted for by historians from the frequent losses sustained by the inroads of the enemy   nor is the case different with regard to the second circumstance we proposed to consider viz the great or little riches to supply this demand this effect also depends on the habits and ways of living of the people not on the quantity of gold and silver in order to have in any state a great number of lenders it is not sufficient nor requisite that there be great abundance of the precious metals it is only requisite that the property or command of that quantity which is in the state whether great or small should be collected in particular hands so as to form considerable sums or compose a great moneyed interest this begets a number of lenders and sinks the rate of usury and this i shall venture to affirm depends not on the quantity of specie but on particular manners and customs which make the specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable value  for suppose that by miracle every man in britain should have five pounds slipped into his pocket in one night this would much more than double the whole money that is at present in the kingdom and yet there would not next day nor for some time be any more lenders nor any variation on the interest and were there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state this money however abundant could never gather into sums and would only serve to increase the prices of every thing without any farther consequence the prodigal landlord dissipates it as fast as he receives it and the beggarly peasant has no means nor view nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood the overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same there will follow no reduction of interest that depends upon another principle and must proceed from an increase of industry and frugality of arts and commerce  every thing useful to the life of man arises from the ground but few things arise in that condition which is requisite to render them useful there must therefore beside the peasants and the proprietors of land be another rank of men who receiving from the former the rude materials work them into their proper form and retain part for their own use and subsistence in the infancy of society these contracts betwixt the artizans and the peasants and betwixt one species of artizan and another are commonly entered into immediately by the persons themselves who being neighbors are readily acquainted with each others necessities and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them but when mens industry increases and their views enlarge it is found that the most remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous and that this intercourse of good offices may be carried on to the greatest extent and intricacy hence the origin of merchants the most useful race of men in the whole society who serve as agents betwixt those parts of the state that are wholly unacquainted and are ignorant of each others necessities here are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen and a thousand customers and these two ranks of men so necessary to each other can never rightly meet till one man erects a shop to which all the workmen and all the customers repair in this province grass rises in abundance the inhabitants abound in cheese and butter and cattle but want bread and corn which in a neighboring province are in too great abundance for the uses of the inhabitants one man discovers this he brings corn from the one province and returns with cattle and supplying the wants of both he is so far a common benefactor as the people increase in numbers and industry the difficulty of their mutual intercourse increases the business of the agency or merchandise becomes more intricate and divides subdivides compounds and mixes to a greater variety in all these transactions it is necessary and reasonable that a considerable part of the commodities and labor should belong to the merchant to whom in a great measure they are owing and these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind or more commonly convert into money which is their common representation if gold and silver have increased in the state along with industry it will require a great quantity of these metals to represent a great quantity of commodities and labor if industry alone has increased the prices of every thing must sink and a very small quantity of specie will serve as a representation  there is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits deprive a man of all business and serious occupation he runs restless from one amusement to another and the weight and oppression which he feels from idleness is so great that he forgets the ruin which must follow from his immoderate expenses give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or body he is satisfied and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure but if the employment you give him be profitable especially if the profit be attached to every particular exertion of industry he has gain so often in his eye that he acquires by degrees a passion for it and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily increase of his fortune and this is the reason why trade increases frugality and why among merchants there is the same overplus of misers above prodigals as among the possessors of land there is the contrary  commerce increases industry by conveying it readily from one member of the state to another and allowing none of it to perish or become useless it increases frugality by giving occupation to men and employing them in the arts of gain which soon engage their affection and remove them from all relish of pleasure and expense it is an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure among lawyers and physicians who have any practice there are many more who live within their income than who exceed it or even live up to it but lawyers and physicians beget no industry and it is even at the expense of others they acquire their riches so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellow citizens as fast as they increase their own merchants on the contrary beget industry by serving as canals to convey it through every corner of the state and at the same time by their frugality they acquire great power over that industry and collect a large property in the labor and commodities which they are the chief instruments in producing there is no other profession therefore except merchandise which can make the moneyed interest considerable or in other words can increase industry and by also increasing frugality give a great command of that industry to particular members of the society without commerce the state must consist chiefly of landed gentry whose prodigality and expense make a continual demand for borrowing and of peasants who have no sums to supply that demand the money never gathers into large stocks or sums that can be lent at interest it is dispersed into numberless hands who either squander it in idle show and magnificence or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life commerce alone assembles it into considerable sums and this effect it has merely from the industry which it begets and the frugality which it inspires independent of the quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the state  thus an increase of commerce by a necessary and infallible consequence raises a great number of lenders and by that means produces a lowness of interest we must now consider how far this increase of commerce diminishes the profits arising from that profession and gives rise to the third circumstance requisite to produce a lowness of interest  it may be proper to observe on this head that low interest and low profits of merchandise are two events that mutually forward each other and are both originally derived from that extensive commerce which produces opulent merchants and renders the moneyed interest considerable where merchants possess great stocks whether represented by few or many pieces of metal it must frequently happen that when they either become tired of business or have heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce a great deal of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure revenue the plenty diminishes their price and makes the lenders accept of a low interest this consideration obliges many to keep their stocks in trade and rather be content with low profit than dispose of their money at an undervalue on the other hand when commerce has become very extensive and employs very large stocks there must arise rivalships among the merchants which diminish the profits of trade at the same time that they increase the trade itself the low profits of merchandise induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest when they leave off business and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence it is needless therefore to enquire which of these circumstances viz low interest or low profits is the cause and which the effect they both arise from an extensive commerce and mutually forward each other no man will accept of low profits where he can have high interest and no man will accept of low interest where he can have high profits an extensive commerce by producing large stocks diminishes both interest and profit and is always assisted in its diminution of the one by the proportional sinking of the other i may add that as low profits arise from the increase of commerce and industry they serve in their turn to the farther increase of commerce by rendering the commodities cheaper increasing the consumption and heightening the industry and thus if we consider the whole connection of causes and effects interest is the true barometer of the state and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing of a people it proves the increase of industry and its prompt circulation through the whole state little inferior to a demonstration and though perhaps it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind by throwing so many stocks out of trade it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor that besides its short duration it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other  those who have asserted that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause since the same industry which sinks the interest does commonly acquire great abundance of the precious metals a variety of fine manufactures along with vigilant enterprising merchants will soon draw money to a state if it be any where to be found in the world the same cause by multiplying the conveniences of life and increasing industry collects great riches into the hands of persons who are not proprietors of land and produces by that means a lowness of interest but though these effects plenty of money and low interest do both naturally arise from commerce and industry they are altogether independent of each other for suppose a nation removed into the pacific ocean without any foreign commerce or any knowledge of navigation suppose that this nation possesses always the same stock of coin but is continually increasing in its numbers and industry it is evident that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that kingdom since it is the proportion betwixt money and any species of goods which fixes their mutual value and upon the present supposition the conveniences of life become every day more abundant without any alteration on the current specie a less quantity of money therefore amongst this people will make a rich man during the times of industry than would serve to that purpose in ignorant and slothful ages less money will build a house portion a daughter buy an estate support a manufactory or maintain a family and equipage these are the uses for which men borrow money and therefore the greater or less quantity of it in a state has no influence on the interest but it is evident that the greater or less stock of labor and commodities must have a great influence since we really and in effect borrow these when we take money upon interest it is true when commerce is extended all over the globe the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious metals so that low interest and plenty of money are in fact almost inseparable but still it is of consequence to know the principle whence any phenomenon arises and to distinguish betwixt a cause and a concomitant effect besides that the speculation is curious it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs at least it must be owned that nothing can be of more use than to improve by practice the method of reasoning on these subjects which of all others are the most important though they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless manner  another reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest seems to be the instance of some nations where after a sudden acquisition of riches or of the precious metals by means of foreign conquest the interest has fallen not only amongst them but in all the neighboring states as soon as that money was dispersed and had insinuated itself into every corner thus interest in spain fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the west indies as we are informed by garcilasso de la vega and it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of europe interest in rome after the conquest of egypt fell from   to   per cent as we learn from dion lib      the causes of the sinking of interest upon such an event seem different in the conquering country and in the neighboring states but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the increase of gold and silver  in the conquering country it is natural to imagine that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands and be gathered into large sums which seek a secure revenue either by the purchase of land or by interest and consequently the same effect follows for a little time as if there had been a great occasion of industry and commerce the increase of lenders above the borrowers sinks the interest and so much the faster if those who have acquired those large sums find no industry or commerce in the state and no method of employing their money but by lending it at interest but after this new mass of gold and silver has been digested and has circulated through the whole state affairs will soon return to their former situation while the landlords and new moneyholders living idly squander above their income and the former daily contract debt and the latter encroach on their stock till its final extinction the whole money may still be in the state and make itself felt by the increase of prices but not being now collected into any large masses or stocks the disproportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders is the same as formerly and consequently the high interest returns  accordingly we find in rome that so early as tiberiuss time interest had again mounted to   per cent columella lib   cap   though no accident had happened to drain the empire of money in trajans time money lent on mortgages in italy bore   per cent plinii epist lib   ep    on common securities in bithynia    ibid lib  0 ep    and if interest in spain has not risen to its old pitch this can be ascribed to nothing but the continuance of the same cause that sunk it viz the large fortunes continually made in the indies which come over to spain from time to time and supply the demand of the borrowers but this accidental and extraneous cause more money is to be lent in spain that is more money is collected into large sums than would otherways be found in a state where there are so little commerce and industry  as to the reduction of interest which has followed in england france and other kingdoms of europe that have no mines it has been gradual and has not proceeded from the increase of money considered merely in itself but from the increase of industry which is the natural effect of the former increase in that interval before it raises the price of labor and provisions for to return to the foregoing supposition if the industry of england had risen as much from other causes and that rise might easily have happened though the stock of money had remained the same must not all the same consequences have followed which we observe at present the same people would in that case be found in the kingdom the same commodities the same industry manufactures and commerce and consequently the same merchants with the same stocks that is with the same command over labor and commodities only represented by a smaller number of white or yellow pieces which being a circumstance of no moment would only affect the waggoner porter and trunkmaker luxury therefore manufactures arts industry frugality flourishing equally as at present it is evident that interest must also have been as low since that is the necessary result of all these circumstances so far as they determine the profits of commerce and the proportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders in any state  discourse v of the balance of trade it is very usual amongst nations ignorant of the nature of commerce to prohibit the exportation of commodities and to preserve amongst themselves whatever they think valuable and useful they consider not that in this prohibition they act directly contrary to their intentions and that the more is exported of any commodity the more will be raised at home of which they themselves will always have the first offer  it is well known to the learned that the ancient laws of athens rendered the exportation of figs criminal that being supposed a species of fruit so excellent in attica that the athenians esteemed it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner and in this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest that informers were thence called sycophants among them from two greek words which signify figs and discoverer plut de curiositate i have been told that many old acts of parliament show the same ignorance in the nature of commerce and to this day in a neighboring kingdom the exportation of corn is almost always prohibited in order as they say to prevent famines though it is evident that nothing contributes more to the frequent famines which so much distress that fertile country  the same jealous fear with regard to money has also prevailed amongst several nations and it required both reason and experience to convince any people that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them and produce a still greater exportation  these errors one may say are gross and palpable but there still prevails even amongst nations well acquainted with commerce a strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade and a fear that all their gold and silver may be leaving them this seems to me almost in every case a very groundless apprehension and i should as soon dread that all our springs and rivers would be exhausted as that money should abandon a kingdom where there are people and industry let us carefully preserve these latter advantages and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former  it is easy to observe that all calculations concerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions the customhouse books are owned to be an insufficient ground of reasoning nor is the rate of exchange much better unless we consider it with all nations and know also the proportions of the several sums remitted which one may safely pronounce impossible every man who has ever reasoned on this subject has always proved his theory whatever it was by facts and calculations and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms  the writings of mr gee struck the nation with an universal pannic when they saw it plainly demonstrated by a detail of particulars that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years but luckily twenty years have since elapsed along with an expensive foreign war and yet it is commonly supposed that money is still more plentiful amongst us than in any former period  nothing can be more entertaining on this head than dr swift an author who has more humor than knowledge more taste than judgment and more spleen prejudice and passion than any of these qualities he says in his short view of the state of ireland that the whole cash of that kingdom amounted but to  00000 l that out of this they remitted every year a neat million to england and had scarce any other source to compensate themselves from and little other foreign trade but the importation of french wines for which they paid ready money the consequence of this situation which must be owned disadvantageous was that in a course of three years the current money of ireland from  00000 l was reduced to less than two and at present i suppose in a course of near  0 years it is absolutely nothing yet i know not how that opinion of the advance of riches in ireland which gave the doctor so much indignation seems still to continue and gain ground amongst every body  in short this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade appears of such a nature that it discovers itself wherever one is out of humor with the ministry or is in low spirits and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports which counterbalance the imports it may here be proper to form a general argument which may prove the impossibility of that event as long as we preserve our people and our industry  suppose four parts of all the money in britain to be annihilated in one night and the nation reduced to the same condition in this particular as in the reigns of the harrys and edwards what would be the consequence must not the price of all labor and commodities sink in proportion and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages what nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at the same price which to us would afford sufficient profit in how little time therefore must this bring back the money which we had lost and raise us to the level of all the neighboring nations where after we have arrived we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labor and commodities and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our fullness and repletion  again suppose that all the money in britain were multiplied fourfold in a night must not the contrary effect follow must not all labor and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height that no neighboring nations could afford to buy from us while their commodities on the other hand became so cheap in comparison that in spite of all the laws which could be formed they would be run in upon us and our money would flow out till we fall to a level with foreigners and lose that great superiority of riches which had laid us under such disadvantages  now it is evident that the same causes which would correct these exorbitant inequalities were they to happen miraculously must prevent their happening in the common course of nature and must for ever in all neighboring nations preserve money nearly proportioned to the art and industry of each nation all water wherever it communicates remains always at a level ask naturalists the reason they tell you that were it to be raised in any one place the superior gravity of that part not being balanced must depress it till it meets a counterpoize and that the same cause which redresses the inequality when it happens must for ever prevent it without some violent external operation there is another cause though more limited in its operation which checks the wrong balance of trade to every particular nation to which the kingdom trades when we import more goods than we export the exchange turns against us and this becomes a new encouragement to export as much as the charge of carriage and insurance of the money due would amount to for the exchange can never rise higher than that sum   can one imagine that it had ever been possible by any laws or even by any art or industry to have preserved all the money in spain which the galleons have brought from the indies or that all commodities could be sold in france for a tenth of the price they would yield on the other side of the pyrenees without finding their way thither and draining from that immense treasure what other reason indeed is there why all nations at present gain in their trade with spain and portugal but because it is impossible to heap up money more than any fluid beyond its proper level the sovereigns of these countries have shown that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves had it been in any degree practicable  but as any body of water may be raised above the level of the surrounding element if the former has no communication with the latter so in money if the communication be cut off by any material or physical impediment for all laws alone are ineffectual there may in such a case be a very great inequality of money thus the immense distance of china along with the monopolies of our india companies obstructing the communication preserve in europe the gold and silver especially the latter in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom but notwithstanding this great obstruction the force of the causes above mentioned is still evident the skill and ingenuity of europe in general much surpasses that of china with regard to manual arts and manufactures yet are we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage and were it not for the continual recruits we receive from america money would very soon sink in europe and rise in china till it came nearly to a level in both places nor can any reasonable man doubt but that industrious nation were they as near us as poland or barbary would drain us of the overplus of our specie and draw to themselves a larger share of the west indian treasures we need have no recourse to a physical attraction to explain the necessity of this operation there is a moral attraction arising from the interests and passions of men which is full as potent and infallible  how is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom among themselves but by the force of this principle which makes it impossible for money to lose its level and either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of the labor and commodities that is in each province did not long experience make people easy on this head what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford a melancholy yorkshire man while he computed and magnified the sums drawn to london by taxes absentees commodities and found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior and no doubt had the heptarchy subsisted in england the legislature of each state had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong balance and as it is probable that the mutual hatred of these states would have been extremely violent on account of their close neighborhood they would have loaded and oppressed all commerce by a jealous and superfluous caution since the union has removed the barriers betwixt scotland and england which of these nations gains from the other by this free commerce or if the former kingdom has received any increase of riches can it be reasonable accounted for by any thing but the increase of its art and industry twas a common apprehension in england before the union as we learn from labbe du bos les interets dangleterre malentendus that scotland would soon drain them of their treasure were an open trade allowed and on the other side the tweed a contrary apprehension prevailed with what justice in both time has shown  what happens in small portions of mankind must take place in greater the provinces of the roman empire no doubt kept their balance with each other and with italy independent of the legislature as much as the several counties of britain or the several parishes of each county and any man who travels over europe at this day may see by the prices of commodities that money in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states has brought itself nearly to a level and that the difference betwixt one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect than it is often betwixt different provinces of the same kingdom men naturally flock to capital cities seaports and navigable rivers there we find more men more industry more labor and consequently more money but still the latter difference holds proportion with the former and the level is preserved it must carefully be remarked that throughout this discourse wherever i speak of the level of money i mean always its proportional level to the commodities labor industry and skill which is in the several states and i assert that where these advantages are double triple quadruple to what they are in the neighboring states the money infallibly will also be double triple quadruple the only circumstance that can obstrust the exactness of these proportions is the expense of transporting the commodities from one place to another and this expense is sometimes unequal thus the corn cattle cheese butter of derbyshire cannot draw the money of london so much as the manufactures of london draw the money of derbyshire but this objection is only a seeming one for so far as the transport of commodities is expensive so far is the communication betwixt the places obstructed and imperfect   our jealousy and our hatred of france are without bounds and the former sentiment at least must be acknowledged very reasonable and well grounded these passions have occasioned innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce where we are accused of being commonly the aggressors but what have we gained by the bargain we lost the french market for our woolen manufactures and transferred the commerce of wine to spain and portugal where we buy much worse liquor at a higher price there are few englishmen that would not think their country absolutely ruined were french wines sold in england so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant in some measure all ale and homebrewn liquors but would we lay aside prejudice it would not be difficult to prove that nothing could be more innocent perhaps advantageous each new acre of vineyard planted in france in order to supply england with wine would make it requisite for the french to take the product of an english acre sown in wheat or barley in order to subsist themselves and it is evident we have thereby got command of the better commodity  there are many edicts of the french king prohibiting the planting of new vineyards and ordering all those lately planted to be grubbd up so sensible are they in that country of the superior value of corn above every other product  marshall vauban complains often and with reason of the absurd duties which load the entry of wines of languedoc guienne and those other southern provinces that are imported into britany and normandy he entertained no doubt but these latter provinces could preserve their balance notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommends and it is evident that a few leagues more navigation to england would make no difference or if it did that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms  there is indeed one expedient by which it is possible to sink and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom but these cases when examined will be found to resolve into our general theory and to bring additional authority to it  i scarce know any method of sinking money below its level but those institutions of banks funds and paper credit with which we are in this kingdom so much infatuated these render paper equivalent to money circulate it through the whole state make it supply the place of gold and silver raise proportionably the price of labor and commodities and by that means either banish a great part of those precious metals or prevent their farther increase what can be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head we fancy because an individual would be much richer were his stock of money doubled that the same good effect would follow were the money of every one increased not considering that this would raise as much the price of every commodity and reduce every man in time to the same condition as before it is only in our public negotiations and transactions with foreigners that a greater stock of money is advantageous and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant we feel by its means all the ill effects arising from a great abundance of money without reaping any of the advantages  suppose there are    millions of paper that circulate in the kingdom as money for we are not to imagine that all our enormous funds are employed in that shape and suppose that the real cash of the kingdom is    millions here is a state which is found by experience able to hold a stock of  0 millions i say if it be able to hold it it must of necessity have acquired it in gold and silver had we not obstructed the entrance of these metals by this new invention of paper whence would it have acquired that sum from all the kingdoms of the world but why because if you remove these    millions money in this state is below its level compared with our neighbors and we must immediately draw from all of them till we be full and saturate so to speak and can hold no more by our wise politics we are as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bankbills and chequernotes as if we were afraid of being overburthend with the precious metals  it is not to be doubted but the great plenty of bullion in france is in a great measure owing to the want of paper credit the french have no banks merchants bills do not there circulate as with us usury or lending on interest is not directly permitted so that many have large sums in their coffers great quantities of plate are used in private houses and all the churches are full of it by this means provisions and labor still remain much cheaper amongst them than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver the advantage of this situation in point of trade as well as in great public emergencies is too evident to be disputed  the same fashion a few years ago prevailed in genoa which still has place in england and holland of using services of china ware instead of plate but the senate wisely foreseeing the consequences prohibited the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent while the use of silver plate was left unlimited and i suppose in their late distresses they felt the good effect of this ordonnance our tax on plate is perhaps in this view impolitic   before the introduction of paper money into our colonies they had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation since the introduction of that commodity the least of the inconveniences that has followed is the total banishment of the precious metals and after the abolition of paper can it be doubted but money will return while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities the only things valuable in commerce and for whose sake alone all men desire money  what pity lycurgus did not think of paper credit when he wanted to banish gold and silver from sparta it would have served his purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money and would also have prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers as being of so much less real and intrinsic value  but as our darling projects of paper credit are pernicious being almost the only expedient by which we can sink money below its level so in my opinion the only expedient by which we can raise money above its level is a practice we would all exclaim against as destructive viz the gathering large sums into a public treasure locking them up and absolutely preventing their circulation the fluid not communicating with the neighboring element may by such an artifice be raised to what height we please to prove this we need only return to our first supposition of the annihilating the half or any part of our cash where we found that the immediate consequence of such an event would be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighboring kingdoms nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set by the nature of things to this practice of hoarding a small city like geneva continuing this policy for ages might engross nine tenths of the money of europe there seems indeed in the nature of man an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches a weak state with an enormous treasure would soon become a prey to some of its poorer but more powerful neighbors a great state would dissipate its wealth on dangerous and illconcerted projects and probably destroy along with it what is much more valuable the industry morals and numbers of its people the fluid in this case raised to too great a height bursts and destroys the vessel that contains it and mixing itself with the surrounding element soon falls to its proper level  so little are we commonly acquainted with this principle that though all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event as the immense treasure amassed by harry the vii which they make amount to   00000 pounds we rather reject their concurring testimony than admit of a fact which agrees so ill with our inveterate prejudices it is indeed probable that that sum might be three fourths of all the money in england but where is the difficulty that such a sum might be amassed in twenty years by a cunning rapacious frugal and almost arbitrary monarch nor is it probable that the diminution of circulating money was ever sensibly felt by the people or ever did them any prejudice the sinking of the prices of all commodities would immediately replace it by giving england the advantage in its commerce with all the neighboring kingdoms  have we not an instance in the small republic of athens with its allies who in about fifty years betwixt the median and peloponesian wars amassed a sum greater than that of harry the vii there were about eight ounces of silver in a pound sterling in harry the viis time for all the greek historians thucydidis lib   and diod sic lib    and orators vid aeschinis and demosthenis epist agree that the athenians collected in the citadel more than  0000 talents which they afterward dissipated to their own ruin in rash and imprudent enterprises but when this money was set a running and began to communicate with the surrounding fluid what was the consequence did it remain in the state no for we find by the memorable census mentioned by demosthenes  and polybius lib   cap    that in about fifty years afterward the whole value of the republic comprehending lands houses commodities slaves and money was less than  000 talents  what an ambitious high spirited people was this to collect and keep in their treasury with a view to conquests a sum which it was every day in the power of the citizens by a single vote to distribute among themselves and which would go near to triple the riches of every individual for we must observe that the numbers and private riches of the athenians are said by ancient writers to have been no greater at the beginning of the peloponnesian war than at the beginning of the macedonian  money was little more plentiful in greece during the age of philip and perseus than in england during that of harry the vii yet these two monarchs in  0 years titi livii lib    cap  0 collected from the small kingdom of macedon a much larger treasure than that of the english monarch paulus aemilius brought to rome about   00000 pounds sterling vel patcrc lib   cap   pliny says   00000 lib    cap   and that was but a part of the macedonian treasure the rest was dissipated by the resistance and flight of perseus titi livii ibid   we may learn from stanyan that the canton of berne had  00000 pounds lent at interest and had above six times as much in their treasury here then is a sum hoarded of   00000 pounds sterling which is at least quadruple of what should naturally circulate in such a petty state and yet no one who travels into the pais de vaux or any part of that canton observes any want of money more than could be supposed in a country of that extent soil and situation on the contrary there are scarce any inland provinces in the continent of france or germany where the inhabitants are at this time so opulent though that canton has vastly increased its treasure since      the time when stanyan wrote his judicious account of switzerland the poverty which stanyan speaks of is only to be seen in the most mountainous cantons where there is no commodity to bring money and even there the people are not poorer than in the diocese of saltzburg on the one hand or savoy on the other if they be so poor   the account given by appian proem of the treasure of the ptolemies is so prodigious that one cannot admit of it and so much the more that the historian says the other successors of alexander were also frugal and had many of them treasures not much inferior for this saving humor of the neighboring princes must necessarily have checked the frugality of the egyptian monarchs according to the foregoing theory the sum he mentions is   0000 talents or           pounds    shillings and   pence according to dr arbuthnots computation and yet appian says that he extracted his account from the public records and he was himself a native of alexandria  from these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to form of those numberless bars obstructions and imposts which all nations of europe and none more than england have put upon trade from an exorbitant desire of amassing money which never will heap up beyond its level while it circulates or from an ill grounded apprehension of losing their specie which never will sink below it could any thing scatter our riches twoud be such impolitic contrivances but this general ill effect however results from them that they deprive neighboring nations of that free communication and exchange which the author of the world has intended by giving them soils climates and geniuses so different from each other  our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money the using paper credit they reject the only method of amassing it the practice of hoarding and they adopt a hundred contrivances which serve to no purpose but to check industry and rob ourselves and our neighbors of the common benefits of art and nature  all taxes however upon foreign commodities are not to be regarded as prejudicial or useless but those only which are founded on the jealousy above mentioned a tax on german linen encourages home manufactures and thereby multiplies our people and industry a tax on brandy increases the sale of rum and supports our southern colonies and as it is necessary imposts should be levied for the support of government it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities which can easily be intercepted at the port and subjected to the impost we ought however always to remember the maxim of dr swift that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two make not four but often make only one it can scarcely be doubted but if the duties on wine were lowered to a third they would yield much more to the government than at present our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor and no prejudice would ensue to the balance of trade of which we are so jealous the manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable and gives employment to few hands the transport of wine and corn would not be much inferior  but are there not frequent instances you will say of states and kingdoms that were formerly rich and opulent and are now poor and beggarly has not the money left them with which they formerly abounded i answer if they lose their trade industry and people they cannot expect to keep their gold and silver for these precious metals hold proportion to the former advantages when lisbon and amsterdam got the east india trade from venice and genoa they also got the profits and money that arose from it where the seat of government is transferred where expensive armies are maintained at a distance where great funds are possessed by foreigners there naturally follows from these causes a diminution of the specie but these we may observe are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money and are in time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry but where these remain and the drain is not continued the money always finds its way back again by a hundred canals of which we have no notion nor suspicion what immense treasures have been spent by so many nations in flanders since the revolution in the course of three long wars more money perhaps than the half of what is at present in all europe but what has now become of it is it in the narrow compass of the austrian provinces no surely it has most of it returned to the several countries whence it came and has followed that art and industry by which at first it was acquired  in short a government has great reason to preserve with care its people and its manufactures its money it may safely trust to the course of human affairs without fear or jealousy or if it ever give attention to that latter circumstance it ought only to be so far as it affects the former  discourse vi of the balance of power it is a question whether the idea of the balance of power be owing entirely to modern policy or whether the phrase only has been invented in these latter ages it is certain that lib i xenophon in his institution of cyrus represents the combination of the asiatic powers to have arisen from a jealousy of the increasing force of the medes and persians and though that elegant composition should be supposed altogether a romance this sentiment ascribed by the author to the eastern princes is at least a proof of the prevailing notions of ancient times  in the whole politics of greece the anxiety with regard to the balance is most apparent and is expressly pointed out to us even by the ancient historians thucydides lib i represents the league which was formed against athens and which produced the peloponnesian war as entirely owing to this principle and after the decline of athens when the thebans and lacedaemonians disputed for sovereignity we find that the athenians as well as many other republics threw themselves always into the lighter scale and endeavored to preserve the balance they supported thebes against sparta till the great victory gained by epaminondas at leuctra after which they immediately went over to the conquered from generosity as they pretended but in reality from their jealousy of the conquerors xenoph hist graec lib   and     whoever will read demostheness oration for the megalopolitans may see the utmost refinements on this principle that ever entered into the head of a venetian or english speculatist and upon the first rise of the macedonian power this orator immediately discovered the danger sounded the alarm through all greece and at last assembled that confederacy under the banners of athens which fought the great and decisive battle of chaeronea  it is true the grecian wars are regarded by historians as wars of emulation rather than of politics and each state seems to have had more in view the honor of leading the rest than any wellgrounded hopes of authority and dominion if we consider indeed the small number of inhabitants in any one republic compared to the whole the great difficulty of forming sieges in those times and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman amongst that noble people we shall conclude that the balance of power was of itself sufficiently secured in greece and needed not to be guarded with that caution which may be requisite in other ages but whether we ascribe the shifting sides in all the grecian republics to jealous emulation or cautious politics the effects were alike and every prevailing power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it and that often composed of its former friends and allies  the same principle call it envy or prudence which produced the ostracism of athens and petalism of syracuse and expelled every citizen whose fame or power overtopd the rest the same principle i say naturally discovered itself in foreign politics and soon raised enemies to the leading state however moderate in the exercise of its authority  the persian monarch was really in his force a petty prince compared to the grecian republics and therefore it behooved him from views of safety more than from emulation to interest himself in their quarrels and to support the weaker side in every contest this was the advice given by alcibiades to tissaphernes thuc lib   and it prolonged near a century the date of the persian empire till the neglect of it for a moment after the first appearance of the aspiring genius of philip brought that lofty and frail edifice to the ground with a rapidity of which there are few instances in the history of mankind  the successors of alexander showed an infinite jealousy of the balance of power a jealousy founded on true politics and prudence and which preserved distinct for several ages the partitions made after the death of that famous conqueror the fortune and ambition of antigonus diod sic lib  0 threatened them anew with an universal monarchy but their combination and their victory at ipsus saved them and in after times we find that as the eastern princes considered the greeks and macedonians as the only real military force with whom they had any intercourse they kept always a watchful eye over that part of the world the ptolemies in particular supported first aratus and the achaeans and then cleomenes king of sparta from no other view than as a counterbalance to the macedonian monarchs for this is the account which polybius gives of the egyptian politics lib   cap      the reason why it is supposed that the ancients were entirely ignorant of the balance of power seems to be drawn from the roman history more than the greek and as the transactions of the former are generally the most familiar to us we have thence formed all our conclusions it must be owned that the romans never met with any such general combination or confederacy against them as might naturally be expected from their rapid conquests and declared ambition but were allowed peaceably to subdue their neighbors one after another till they extended their dominion over the whole known world not to mention the fabulous history of their italic wars there have strong suspicions of late arisen amongst crities and in my opinion not without reason concerning the first ages of the roman history as if they were almost entirely fabulous till after the sacking of the city by the gauls and were even doubtful for some time afterward till the greeks began to give attention to roman affairs and commit them to writing this skepticism however seems to me scarcely defensible in its full extent with regard to the domestic history of rome which has some air of truth and probability and could scarce be the invention of an historian who had so little morals or judgment as to indulge himself in fiction and romance the revolutions seem so well proportioned to their causes the progress of the factions is so conformable to political experience the manners and maxims of the age are so uniform and natural that scarce any real history affords more just reflection and improvement is not machiavels comment on livy a work surely of great judgment and genius founded entirely on this period which is represented as fabulous i would willingly therefore in my private sentiments divide the matter with these critics and allow that the battles and victories and triumphs of those ages had been extremely falsifyd by family memoirs as cicero says they were but as in the accounts of domestic factions there were two opposite relations transmitted to posterity this both served as a check upon fiction and enabled latter historians to gather some truth from comparison and reasoning half of the slaughter which livy commits on the aequi and the volsci would depopulate france and germany and that historian though perhaps he may justly be charged as superficial is at last shocked himself with the incredibility of his narration the same love of exaggeration seems to have magnified the numbers of the romans in their armies and census  there was upon hannibals invasion of the roman state a very remarkable crisis which ought to have called up the attention of all civilized nations it appeared afterward nor was it difficult to be observed at the time it was observed by some as appears by the speech of agelaus of naupactum in a general congress of greece see polyb lib   cap  0   that this was a contest for universal empire and yet no prince or state seems to have been in the least alarmed about the event or issue of the quarrel philip of macedon remained neuter till he saw the victories of hannibal and then most imprudently formed an alliance with the conqueror upon terms still more imprudent he stipulated that he was to assist the carthaginian state in their conquest of italy after which they engaged to send over forces into greece to assist him in subduing the grecian commonwealths titi livii lib    cap      the rhodian and achaean republics are much celebrated by ancient historians for their wisdom and sound policy yet both of them assisted the romans in their wars against philip and antiochus and what may be esteemed still a stronger proof that this maxim was not familiarly known in those ages no ancient author has ever remarked the imprudence of those measures nor has even blamed that absurd treaty above mentioned made by philip with the carthaginians princes and statesmen may in all ages be blinded in their reasonings with regard to events before hand but it is somewhat extraordinary that historians afterward should not form a sounder judgment of them  massinissa attalus prusias in satisfying their private passions were all of them the instruments of the roman greatness and never seem to have suspected that they were forging their own chains while they advanced the conquests of their ally a simple treaty and agreement betwixt massinissa and the carthaginians so much required by mutual interest barred the romans from all entrance into africa and preserved liberty to mankind  the only prince we meet with in the roman history who seems to have understood the balance of power is hiero king of syracuse though ally of rome he sent assistance to the carthaginians during the war of the auxiliaries esteeming it requisite says polybius lib   cap     both in order to retain his dominions in sicily and to preserve the roman friendship that carthage should be safe lest by its fall the remaining power should be able without contraste or opposition to execute every purpose and undertaking and here he acted with great wisdom and prudence for that is never on any account to be overlookt nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into one hand as to incapacitate the neighboring states from defending their rights against it here is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms  in short the maxim of preserving the balance of power is founded so much on common sense and obvious reasoning that it is impossible it could altogether have escaped antiquity where we find in other particulars so many marks of deep penetration and discernment if it was not so generally known and acknowledged as at present it had at least an influence on all the wiser and more experienced princes and politicians and indeed even at present however generally known and acknowledged amongst speculative reasoners it has not in practice an authority much more extensive amongst those who govern the world  after the fall of the roman empire the form of government established by the northern conquerors incapacitated them in a great measure from farther conquests and long maintained each state in its proper boundaries but when vassalage and the feudal militia were abolished mankind were anew alarmed by the danger of universal monarchy from the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in the person of the emperor charles but the power of the house of austria founded on extensive but divided dominions and their riches derived chiefly from mines of gold and silver were more likely to decay of themselves from internal defects than to overthrow all the bulwarks raised against them in less than a century the force of that violent and haughty race was shattered their opulence dissipated their splendour eclipsed a new power succeeded more formidable to the liberties of europe possessing all the advantages of the former and laboring under none of its defects except a share of that spirit of bigotry and persecution with which the house of austria were so long and still are so much infatuated  europe has now for above a century remained on the defensive against the greatest force that ever perhaps was formed by the civil or political combination of mankind and such is the influence of the maxim here treated of that though that ambitious nation in the five last general wars have been victorious in four those concluded by the peace of the pyrences nimeguen ryswick and aixlachapelle  and unsuccessful only in one that concluded by the peace of utrecht  they have not much enlarged their dominions nor acquired a total ascendant over europe on the contrary there remain still some hopes of maintaining the resistance so long that the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil  in the three last of these general wars britain has stood foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintains her station as guardian of the general liberties of europe and patron of mankind beside her advantages of riches and situation her people are animated with such a national spirit and are so fully sensible of the inestimable blessings of their government that we may hope their vigor never will languish in so necessary and so just a cause on the contrary if we may judge by the past their passionate ardour seems rather to require some moderation and they have oftener erred from a laudable excess than from a blamable deficiency  in the first place we seem to have been more possessed with the ancient greek spirit of jealous emulation than actuated with the prudent views of modern politics our wars with france have been begun with justice and even perhaps from necessity but have always been too far pushed from obstinacy and passion the same peace which was afterward made at ryswick in      was offered so early as the ninety two that concluded at utrecht in      might have been finished on as good conditions at gertruytenberg in the eight and we might have given at frankfort in      the same terms which we were glad to accept of at aixlachapelle in the forty eight here then we see that above half of our wars with france and all our public debts are owing more to our own imprudent vehemence than to the ambition of our neighbors  in the second place we are so declared in our opposition to french power and so alert in defense of our allies that they always reckon upon our force as upon their own and expecting to carry on war at our expense refuse all reasonable terms of accommodation habent subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos all the world knows that the factious vote of the house of commons in the beginning of the last parliament along with the professed humor of the nation made the queen of hungary inflexible in her terms and prevented that agreement with prussia which would immediately have restored the general tranquillity of europe  in the third place we are such true combatants that when once engaged we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity and consider only how we may best annoy the enemy to mortgage our revenues at so deep a rate in wars where we were only accessaries was surely the most fatal delusion that a nation who had any pretension to politics and prudence has ever yet been guilty of that remedy of funding if it be a remedy and not rather a poison ought in all reason to be reserved to the last extremity and no evil but the greatest and most urgent should ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient  these excesses to which we have been carried are prejudicial and may perhaps in time become still more prejudicial another way by begeting as is usual the opposite extreme and rendering us totally careless and supine with regard to the fate of europe the athenians from the most bustling intriguing warlike people of greece finding their error in thrusting themselves into every quarrel abandoned all attention to foreign affairs and in no contest ever took party on either side except by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor  enormous monarchies such as europe at present is in danger of falling into are probably destructive to human nature in their progress in their continuance if the roman empire was of advantage it could only proceed from this that mankind were generally in a very disorderly uncivilizd condition before its establishment and even in their downfall which never can be very distant from their establishment the military genius which aggrandizd the monarchy soon leaves the court the capital and the center of such a government while the wars are carried on at a great distance and interest so small a part of the state the ancient nobility whose affections attach them to their sovereign live all at court and never will accept of military employments which would carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers where they are distant both from their pleasure and their fortune the arms of the state must therefore be trusted to mercenary strangers without zeal without attachment without honor ready on every occasion to turn them against the prince and join each desperate malecontent who offers pay and plunder this is the necessary progress of human affairs thus human nature checks itself in its airy elevations thus ambition blindly labors for the destruction of the conqueror of his family and of every thing near and dear to him the bourbons trusting to the support of their brave faithful and affectionate nobility would push their advantage without reserve or limitation these while fired with glory and emulation can bear the fatigues and dangers of war but never would submit to languish in the garrisons of hungary or lithuania forgot at court and sacrisicd to the intrigues of every minion or mistress that approaches the prince the troops are filled with cravates and tartars hussars and cossacs intermingled perhaps with a few soldiers of fortune from the better provinces and the melancholy fate of the roman emperors from the same causes is renewed over and over again till the final dissolution of the monarchy  discourse vii of taxes there is a maxim that prevails amongst those whom in this country we call ways and means men and who are denominated financiers and maltotiers in france that every new tax creates a new ability in the subjects to bear it and that each increase of public burdens increases proportionably the industry of the people this maxim is of such a nature as is most likely to be extremely abused and is so much the more dangerous that its truth cannot be altogether denied but it must be owned when kept within certain bounds to have some foundation in reason and experience  when a tax is laid upon commodities that are consumed by the common people the necessary consequence may seem to be that either the poor must retrench something from their way of living or raise their wages so as to make the burden of the tax fall entirely upon the rich but there is a third consequence which very often follows upon taxes viz that the poor increase their industry perform more work and live as well as before without demanding more for their labor where taxes are moderate are laid on gradually and affect not the necessaries of life this consequence naturally follows and it is certain that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people and render them more opulent and laborious than others who enjoy the greatest advantages for we may observe as a parallel instance that the most trading nations have not always possessed the greatest extent of fertile land but on the contrary that they have labored under many natural disadvantages tire athens carthage rhodes genoa venice holland are strong examples to this purpose and in all history we find only three instances of large and fertile countries that have possessed much trade the netherlands england and france the two former seem to have been allured by the advantages of their maritime situation and the necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports in order to procure what their own climate refused them and as to france trade has come very late into that kingdom and seems to have been the effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and enterprising people who remarked the immense riches acquired by such of the neighboring nations as cultivated navigation and commerce  the places mentioned by cicero epist ad at lib   ep    as possessed of the greatest commerce in his time are alexandria colchos tire sidon andros cyprus pamphilia lycia rhodes chios byzantium lesbos smyrna miletum coos all these except alexandria were either small islands or narrow territories and that city owed its trade entirely to the happiness of its situation  since therefore some natural necessities or disadvantages may be thought favorable to industry why may not artificial burdens have the same effect sir william temple account of the netherlands chap   i am sure ascribes the industry of the dutch entirely to necessity proceeding from their natural disadvantages and illustrates his doctrine by a very striking comparison with ireland where says he by the largeness and plenty of the soil and scarcity of people all things necessary to life are so cheap that an industrious man by two days labor may gain enough to feed him the rest of the week which i take to be a very plain ground of the laziness attributed to the people for men naturally prefer ease before labor and will not take pains if they can live idle though when by necessity they have been enured to it they cannot leave it being grown a custom necessary to their health and to their very entertainment nor perhaps is the change harder from constant ease to labor than from constant labor to ease after which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine by enumerating as above the places where trade has most flourished in ancient and modern times and which are commonly observed to be such narrow confined territories as beget a necessity for industry  it is always observed in years of scarcity if it be not extreme that the poor labor more and really live better than in years of great plenty when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot i have been told by a considerable manufacturer that in the year    0 when bread and provisions of all kinds were very dear his workmen not only made a shift to live but paid debts which they had contracted in former years that were much more favorable and abundant to this purpose see also discourse i at the end   this doctrine therefore with regard to taxes may be admitted in some degree but beware of the abuse taxes like necessity when carried too far destroy industry by engendring despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wages of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities an attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument ceases and the prejudice begins but as the contrary character is much more common it is to be feared that taxes all over europe are multiplying to such a degree as will entirely crush all art and industry though perhaps their first increase along with other circumstances might contribute to the growth of these advantages  the best taxes are those which are levied upon consumptions especially those of luxury because such taxes are less felt by the people they seem to be in some measure voluntary since a man may choose how far he will use the commodity which is taxed they are paid gradually and insensibly and being confounded with the natural price of the commodity they are scarcely perceived by the consumers their only disadvantage is that they are expensive in the levying  taxes upon possessions are levied without expense but have every other disadvantage most states however are obliged to have recourse to them in order to supply the deficiencies of the other  but the most pernicious of all taxes are those which are arbitrary they are commonly converted by their management into punishments on industry and also by their unavoidable inequality are more grievous than by the real burden which they impose it is surprising therefore to see them have place amongst any civilized people  in general all polltaxes even when not arbitrary which they commonly are may be esteemed dangerous because it is so easy for the sovereign to add a little more and a little more to the sum demanded that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppressive and intolerable on the other hand a duty upon commodities checks itself and a prince will soon find that an increase of the impost is no increase of his revenue it is not easy therefore for a people to be altogether ruined by such taxes  historians inform us that one of the chief causes of the destruction of the roman state was the alteration which constantine introduced into the finances by substituting an universal polltax in lieu of almost all the tithes customs and excises which formerly composed the revenue of the empire the people in all the provinces were so grinded and oppressed by the publicans that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians whose dominion as they had fewer necessities and less art was found preferable to the refined tyranny of the romans  there is a prevailing opinion that all taxes however levied fall upon the land at last such an opinion may be useful in britain by checking the landed gentlemen in whose hands our legislature is lodged and making them preserve great regard for trade and industry but i must confess that this principle though first advanced by a celebrated writer has so little appearance of reason that were it not for his authority it had never been received by any body every man to be sure is desirous of pushing off from himself the burden of any tax that is imposed and laying it upon others but as every man has the same inclination and is upon the defensive no set of men can be supposed to prevail altogether in this contest and why the landed gentleman should be the victim of the whole and should not be able to defend himself as well as others are i cannot readily imagine all tradesmen indeed would willingly prey upon him and divide him among them if they could but this inclination they always have though no taxes were levied and the same methods by which he guards against the imposition of tradesmen before taxes will serve him afterward and make them share the burden with him  i shall conclude this subject with observing that we have with regard to taxes an instance of what frequently happens in political institutions that the consequences of things are diametrically opposite to what we should expect on the first appearance it is regarded as a fundamental maxim of the turkish government that the grand signior though absolute master of the lives and fortunes of each individual has no authority to impose a new tax and every ottoman prince who has made such an attempt either has been obliged to retract or has found the fatal effects of his perseverance one would imagine that this prejudice or established opinion were the firmest barrier in the world against oppression yettis certain that its effect is quite contrary the emperor having no regular method of increasing his revenue must allow all the bashas and governors to oppress and abuse the subjects and these he squeezes after their return from their government whereas if he could impose a new tax like our european princes his interest would so far be united with that of his people that he would immediately feel the bad effects of these disorderly levies of money and would find that a pound raised by a general imposition would have less pernicious effects than a shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner  discourse viii of public credit it appears to have been the common practice of antiquity to make provision in time of peace for the necessities of war and to hoard up treasures before hand as the instruments either of conquest or defense without trusting to extraordinary imposts much less to borrowing in times of disorder and confusion besides the immense sums abovementioned discourse v which were amassed by athens and by the ptolemies and other successors of alexander we learn from plato alcib   that the frugal lacedaemonians had also collected a great treasure and arrian lib   and plutarch plut in vita alex he makes these treasures amount to  0000 talents or about    millions sterling quintus curtius lib   cap   says that alexander found in susa above  0000 talents specify the riches which alexander got possession of on the conquest of susa and ecbatana and which were reserved some of them from the time of cyrus if i remember right the scripture also mentions the treasure of hezekiah and the jewish princes as profane history does that of philip and perseus kings of macedon the ancient republics in gaul had commonly large sums in reserve strabo lib   every one knows the treasure seized in rome by julius caesar during the civil wars and we find afterward that the wiser emperors augustus tiberius vespasian severus etc always discovered the prudent foresight of saving great sums against any public exigency  on the contrary our modern expedient which has become very general is to mortgage the public revenues and to trust that posterity during peace will pay off the encumbrances contracted during the preceding war and they having before their eyes so good an example of their wise fathers have the same prudent reliance on their posterity who at last from necessity more than choice are obliged to place the same confidence in a new posterity but not to waste time in declaiming against a practice which appears ruinous beyond the evidence of a hundred demonstrations it seems pretty apparent that the ancient maxims are in this respect much more prudent than the modern even though the latter had been confined within some reasonable bounds and had ever in any instance been attended with such frugality in time of peace as to discharge the debts incurred by an expensive war for why should the case be so very different betwixt the public and an individual as to make us establish such different maxims of conduct for each if the funds of the former be greater its necessary expenses are proportionably larger if its resources be more numerous they are not infinite and as its frame should be calculated for a much longer duration than the date of a single life or even of a family it should embrace maxims large durable and generous suitable to the supposed extent of its existence to trust to chances and temporary expedients is indeed what the necessity of human affairs frequently reduces us to but whoever voluntarily depend on such resources have not necessity but their own folly to accuse for their misfortunes when any such befall them  if the abuses of treasures be dangerous either by engaging the state in rash enterprises or making them neglect military discipline in confidence of their riches the abuses of mortgaging are more certain and inevitable poverty impotence and subjection to foreign powers  according to modern policy war is attended with every destructive circumstance loss of men increase of taxes decay of commerce dissipation of money plunder by sea and land according to ancient maxims the opening of the public treasure as it produced an uncommon affluence of gold and silver served as a temporary encouragement to industry and atoned in some degree for the inevitable calamities of war  what then shall we say to the new paradox that public encumbrances are of themselves advantageous independent of the necessity of contracting them and that any state even though it were not pressed by a foreign enemy could not possibly have embraced a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches than to create funds and debts and taxes without limitation discourses such as these might naturally have past for trials of wit among rhetoricians like the panegyrics on folly and a fever on busiris and nero had we not seen such absurd maxims patronized by great ministers and by a whole party among us and these puzzling arguments for they deserve not the name of specious though they could not be the foundation of lord oxfords conduct for he had more sense served at least to keep his partisans in countenance and perplex the understanding of the nation  let us examine the consequences of public debts both in our domestic management by their influence on commerce and industry and in our foreign transactions by their effects on wars and negotiations  there is a word which is here in the mouth of every body and which i find has also got abroad and is much employed by foreign writers melon du tot law in the pamphlets published in france in imitation of the english and that is circulation this word serves as an account of every thing and though i confess that i have sought for its meaning in the present subject ever since i was a schoolboy i have never yet been able to discover it what possible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand or is there any parallel to be drawn from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequer notes and india bonds where a manufacturer has a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enlivens industry and gives new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and makes them produce more and better commodities of the same species a stagnation is here pernicious wherever it happens because it operates backwards and stops or benumbs the industrious hand in its production of what is useful to human life but what production we owe to changealley or even what consumption except that of coffee and pen ink and paper i have not yet learned nor can one foresee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity though that place and all its inhabitants were for ever buried in the ocean  but though this term circulation has never been explained by those who insist so much on the advantages that result from it there seems however to be some benefit of a similar kind arising from our encumbrances as indeed what human evil is there which is not attended with some advantage this we shall endeavor to explain that we may estimate the weight we ought to allow it  public securities are with us become a kind of money and pass as readily at the current price as gold or silver wherever any profitable undertaking offers itself however expensive there are never wanting hands enough to embrace it nor need a trader who has sums in the public stocks fear to launch out into the most extensive trade since he is possessed of funds which will answer the most sudden demand that can be made upon him no merchant thinks it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash bank stock or india bonds especially the latter serve to all the same purposes because he can dispose of them or pledge them to a banker in a quarter of an hour and at the same time they are not idle even when in his scritoire but bring him in a constant revenue in short our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money that is continually multiplying in their hands and produces sure gain beside the profits of their commerce this must enable them to trade upon less profit the small profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper causes a greater consumption quickens the labor of the common people and helps to spread arts and industry through the whole society  there are also we may observe in england and in all states that have both commerce and public debts a set of men who are half merchants half stockholders and may be supposed willing to trade for small profits because commerce is not their principal or sole support and their revenues in the funds are a sure resource for themselves and their families were there no funds great merchants would have no expedient for realizing or securing any part of their profit but by making purchases of land and land has many disadvantages in comparison of funds requiring more care and inspection it divides the time and attention of the merchant upon any tempting offer or extraordinary accident in trade it is not so easily converted into money and as it attracts too much both by the many natural pleasures it affords and the authority it gives it soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman more men therefore with large stocks and incomes may naturally be supposed to continue in trade where there are public debts and this it must be owned is of some advantage to commerce by diminishing its profits promoting circulation and encouraging industry on this head i shall observe without interrupting the thread of the argument that the multiplicity of our public debts serves rather to sink the interest and that the more the government borrows the cheaper may they expect to borrow contrary to first appearance and contrary to common opinion the profits of trade have an influence on interest see discourse iv   but in opposition to these two favorable circumstances perhaps of no very great importance weigh the many disadvantages that attend our public debts in the whole interior economy of the state you will find no comparison betwixt the ill and the good that result from them  first it is certain that national debts cause a mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital by the great sums which are levied in the provinces to pay the interest of those debts and perhaps too by the advantages in trade above mentioned which they give the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom the question is whether in our case it be for the public interest that so many privileges should be conferred on london which has already arrived at such an enormous size and seems still increasing some men are apprehensive of the consequences for my part i cannot forbear thinking that though the head is undoubtedly too big for the body yet that great city is so happily situated that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom there is more difference betwixt the prices of all provisions in paris and languedoc than betwixt those in london and yorkshire  secondly public stocks being a kind of papercredit have all the disadvantages attending that species of money they banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the state reduce them to common circulation and by that means render all provisions and labor dearer than otherwise they would be  thirdly the taxes which are levied to pay the interest of these debts are a check upon industry heighten the price of labor and are an oppression on the poorer sort  fourthly as foreigners possess a share of our national funds they render the public in a manner tributary to them and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry  fifthly the greatest part of public stock being always in the hands of idle people who live on their revenue our funds give great encouragement to an useless and inactive life  but though the injury that arises to commerce and industry from our public funds will appear upon balancing the whole very considerable it is trivial in comparison of the prejudice that results to the state considered as a body politic which must support itself in the society of nations and have various transactions with other states in wars and negotiations the ill there is pure and unmixt without any favorable circumstance to atone for it and it is an ill too of a nature the highest and most important  we have indeed been told that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts since they are mostly due amongst ourselves and bring as much property to one as they take from another it is like transferring money from the right hand to the left which leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass where we judge not upon principles i ask is it possible in the nature of things to overburthen a nation with taxes even where the sovereign resides amongst them the very doubt seems extravagant since it is requisite in every commonwealth that there be a certain proportion observed betwixt the laborious and the idle part of it but if all our present taxes be mortgaged must we not invent new ones and may not this matter be carried to a length that is ruinous and destructive  in every nation there are always some methods of levying money more easy than others suitable to the way of living of the people and the commodities they make use of in britain the excises upon malt and beer afford a very large revenue because the operations of malting and brewing are very tedious and are impossible to be concealed and at the same time these commodities are not so absolutely necessary to life as that the raising their price would very much affect the poorer sort these taxes being all mortgaged what difficulty to find new ones what vexation and ruin of the poor  duties upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon possessions what a loss to the public that the former are all exhausted and that we must have recourse to the more grievous method of levying taxes  were all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public must not necessity force them to practice all the arts of oppression used by stewards where the absence and negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry  twill scarce be asserted that no bounds ought ever to be set to national debts and that the public would be no weaker were    or    shillings in the pound land tax mortgaged along with all the present customs and excises there is something therefore in the case beside the mere transferring of property from one hand to another in  00 years the posterity of those now in the coaches and of those upon the boxes will probably have changed places without affecting the public by these revolutions  i must confess that there is a strange supineness from long custom crept into all ranks of men with regard to public debts not unlike what divines so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines we all own that the most sanguine imagination cannot hope either that this or any future ministry will be possessed of such rigid and steady frugality as to make any considerable progress in the payment of our debts or that the situation of foreign affairs will for any long time allow them leisure and tranquillity sufficient for such an undertaking in times of peace and security when alone it is possible to pay debt the moneyed interest are averse to receive partial payments which they know not how to dispose of to advantage and the landed interest are averse to continue the taxes requisite for that purpose why therefore should a minister persevere in a measure so disagreeable to all parties for the sake i suppose of a posterity which be will never see or of a few reasonable reflecting people whose united interest perhaps will not be able to secure him the smallest borough in england it is not likely we shall ever find any minister so bad a politician with regard to these narrow destructive maxims of politics all ministers are expert enough what then is to become of us were we ever so good christians and ever so resigned to providence this methinks were a curious question even considered as a speculative one and what it might not be altogether impossible to form some conjectural solution of the events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles negotiations intrigues and factions there seems to be a natural progress of things which may guide our reasoning as it would have required but a moderate share of prudence when we first began this practice of mortgaging to have foretold from the nature of men and of ministers that things would necessarily be carried to the length we see so now that they have at last happily reached it it may not be difficult to guess at the consequence it must indeed be one of these two events either the nation must destroy public credit or public credit will destroy the nation it is impossible they can both subsist after the manner they have been hitherto managed in this as well as in some other nations  there was indeed a scheme for the payment of our debts which was proposed by an excellent citizen mr hutchinson above  0 years ago and which was much approved of by some men of sense but never was likely to take effect he asserted that there was a fallacy in imagining that the public owed this debt for that really every individual owed a proportional share of it and paid in his taxes a proportional share of the interest beside the expenses of levying these taxes had we not better then says he make a proportional distribution of the debt amongst us and each of us contribute a sum suitable to his property and by that means discharge at once all our funds and public mortgages he seems not to have considered that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the taxes by their annual consumptions though they could not advance at once a proportional part of the sum required not to mention that property in money and stock in trade might easily be concealed or disguised and that visible property in lands and houses would really at last answer for the whole an inequality and oppression which never would be submitted to but though this project is never likely to take place it is not altogether improbable that when the nation become heartily sick of their debts and are cruelly oppressed by them some daring projector may arise with visionary schemes for their discharge and as public credit will begin by that time to be a little frail the least touch will destroy it as happened in france and in this manner it will dye of the doctor some neighboring states practice an easy expedient by which they lighten their public debts the french have a custom as the romans formerly had of augmenting their money and this the nation has been so much familiarizd to that it hurts not public credit though it be really cutting off at once by an edict so much of their debts the dutch diminish the interest without the consent of their creditors or which is the same thing they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property could we practice either of these methods we need never be oppressed by the national debt and it is not impossible but one of these or some other method may at all adventures be tried on the augmentation of our encumbrances and difficulties but people in this country are so good reasoners upon whatever regards their interest that such a practice will deceive no body and public credit will probably tumble at once by so dangerous a trial   but it is more probable that the breach of national faith will be the necessary effect of wars defeats misfortunes and public calamities or even perhaps of victories and conquests i must confess when i see princes and states fighting and quarreling amidst their debts funds and public mortgages it always brings to my mind a match of cudgelplaying fought in a china shop how can it be expected that sovereigns will spare a species of property which is pernicious to themselves and to the public when they have so little compassion on lives and properties which are useful to both let the time come and surely it will come when the new funds created for the exigencies of the year are not subscribed to and raise not the money projected suppose either that the cash of the nation is exhausted or that our faith which has been hitherto so ample begins to fail us suppose that in this distress the nation is threatened with an invasion a rebellion is suspected or broke out at home a squadron cannot be equipt for want of pay victuals or repairs or even a foreign subsidy cannot be advanced what must a prince or minister do in such an emergence the right of selfpreservation is unalienable in every individual much more in every community and the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt or what is more than that of those who trusted or continue to trust this security if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands and do not employ it the funds created and mortgaged will by that time bring in a large yearly revenue sufficient for the defense and security of the nation money is perhaps lying in the exchequer ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest necessity calls fear urges reason exhorts compassion alone exclaims the money will immediately be seized for the current service under the most solemn protestations perhaps of being immediately replacd but no more is requisite the whole fabric already tottering falls to the ground and buries thousands in its ruins and this i think may be called the natural death of public credit for to this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to its dissolution and destruction so great dupes are the generality of mankind that notwithstanding such a violent shock to public credit as a voluntary bankruptcy in england would occasion it would not probably be long ere credit would again revive in as flourishing a condition as before the present king of france during the late war borrowed money at lower interest than ever his grandfather did and as low as the british parliament comparing the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms and though men are commonly more governed by what they have seen than by what they foresee with whatever certainty yet promises protestations fair appearances with the allurements of present interest have such powerful influence as few are able to resist mankind are in all ages caught by the same baits the same tricks played over and over again still trepan them the heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny flattery to treachery standing armies to arbitrary government and the glory of god to the temporal interest of the clergy the fear of an everlasting destruction of credit allowing it to be an evil is a needless bugbear a prudent man in reality would rather lend to the public immediately after they had taken a sponge to their debts than at present as much as an opulent knave even though one could not force him to pay is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt for the former in order to carry on business may find it his interest to discharge his debts where they are not exorbitant the latter has it not in his power the reasoning of tacitus hist lib   as it is eternally true is very applicable to our present case sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur apud sapientes cassa habebantur quae neque dari neque accepi salva republica poterant the public is a debtor whom no man can oblige to pay the only check which the creditors have on it is the interest of preserving credit an interest which may easily be overbalancd by a very great debt and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence even supposing that credit irrecoverable not to mention that a present necessity often forces states into measures which are strictly speaking against their interest   these two events supposed above are calamitous but not the most calamitous thousands are thereby sacrificed to the safety of millions but we are not without danger that the contrary event may take place and that millions may be sacrificed for ever to the temporary safety of thousands i have heard it has been computed that the whole creditors of the public natives and foreigners amount only to   000 these make a figure at present on their income but in case of a public bankruptcy would in an instant become the lowest as well as the most wretched of the people the dignity and authority of the landed gentry and nobility is much better rooted and would render the contention very unequal if ever we come to that extremity one would incline to assign to this event a very near period such as half a century had not our fathers prophesies of this kind been already found fallacious by the duration of our public credit so much beyond all reasonable expectation when the astrologers in france were every year foretelling the death of harry the iv these fellows says he must be right at last we shall therefore be more cautious than to assign any precise date and shall content ourselves with pointing out the event in general our popular government perhaps will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient as that of a voluntary bankruptcy and though the house of lords be altogether composed of the proprietors of lands and the house of commons chiefly and consequently neither of them can be supposed to have great property in the funds yet the connexions of the members may be so great with the proprietors as to render them more tenacious of public faith than prudence policy or even justice strictly speaking requires and perhaps too our foreign enemies or rather enemy for we have but one to dread may be so politic as to discover that our safety lies in despair and may not therefore show the danger open and barefaced till it be inevitable the balance of power in europe our grandfathers our fathers and we have all justly esteemed too unequal to be preserved without our attention and assistance but our children weary with the struggle and fettered with encumbrances may sit down secure and see their neighbors oppressed and conquered till at last they themselves and their creditors lie both at the mercy of the conqueror and this may properly enough be denominated the violent death of our public credit  these seem to be the events which are not very remote and which reason foresees as clearly almost as she can do any thing that lies in the womb of time and though the ancients maintained that in order to reach the gift of prophesy a certain divine fury or madness was requisite one may safely affirm that in order to deliver such prophesies as these no more is necessary than merely to be in ones senses free from the influence of popular madness and delusion  discourse ix of some remarkable customs i shall observe three remarkable customs in three celebrated governments and shall conclude from the whole that all general maxims in politics ought to be established with great reserve and that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently discovered in the moral as well as in the physical world the former perhaps we can better account for after they happen from springs and principles of which every one has within himself or from obvious observation the strongest assurance and conviction but it is often fully as impossible for human prudence before hand to foresee and foretell them  i one would think it essential to every supreme council or assembly which debates that entire liberty of speech should be granted to every member and that all motions or reasonings should be received which can any way tend to illustrate the point under deliberation one would conclude with still greater assurance that after a motion was made which was voted and approved by that assembly in which the legislature is lodged the member who made the motion must for ever be exempted from farther trial and enquiry but no political maxim can at first sight appear more undisputable than that he must at least be secured from all inferior jurisdiction and that nothing less than the same supreme legislative assembly in their subsequent meetings could render him accountable for those motions and harangues which they had before approved of but these axioms however irrefragable they may appear have all failed in the athenian government from causes and principles too which appear almost inevitable  by the  or indictment of illegality though it has not been remarked by antiquaries or commentators any man was tried and punished in a common court of judicature for any law which had passed upon his motion in the assembly of the people if that law appeared to the court unjust or prejudicial to the public thus demosthenes finding that ship money was levied irregularly and that the poor bore the same burden as the rich in equipping the galleys corrected this inequality by a very useful law which proportioned the expense to the revenue and income of each individual he moved for this law in the assembly he proved its advantages his harangue for it is still extant  he convinced the people the only legislature in athens the law passed and was carried into execution and yet he was tried in a criminal court for that law upon the complaint of the rich who resented the alteration he had introduced into the finances pro ctesiphonte he was indeed acquitted upon proving anew the usefulness of his law  ctesiphon moved in the assembly of the people that particular honors should be conferred on demosthenes as on a citizen affectionate and useful to the commonwealth the people convinced of this truth voted those honors yet was ctesiphon tried by the  it was asserted amongst other topics that demosthenes was not a good citizen nor affectionate to the commonwealth and the orator was called upon to defend his friend and consequently himself which he executed by that sublime piece of eloquence that has ever since been the admiration of mankind  after the fatal battle of chaeronea a law was past upon the motion of hyperides giving liberty to slaves and enrolling them in the troops plutarch in vita december oratorum demosthenes gives a different account of this law contra aristogiton orat ii he says that its purport was to render the  or to restore the privilege of bearing offices to those who had been declared incapable perhaps these were both clauses of the same law on account of this law the orator was afterward tried by the indictment above mentioned and defended himself amongst other topics by that stroke celebrated by plutarch and longinus it was not i said he that moved for this law it was the necessities of war it was the battle of chaeronea the orations of demosthenes abound with many instances of trials of this nature and prove clearly that nothing was more commonly practiced  the athenian democracy was such a mobbish government as we can scarce form a notion of in the present age of the world the whole collective body of the people voted in every law without any limitation of property without any distinction of rank without control from any magistracy or senate the senate of the bean was only a less numerous mob chosen by lot from among the people and their authority was not great and consequently with little regard to order justice or prudence the athenians soon became sensible of the mischiefs attending this constitution but being averse to the checking themselves by any rule or restriction they resolved at least to check their demagogues or counselors by the fear of future punishment and enquiry they accordingly instituted this remarkable law a law esteemed so essential to their government that aeschines insists on it as a known truth that were it abolished or neglected it were impossible for the democracy to subsist in ctesiphontem it is remarkable that the first step after the dissolution of the democracy by critias and the thirty was to annul the  as we learn from demosthenes  the orator in this oration gives us the words of the law establishing the  page     ex edit aldi and he accounts for it from the same principles that we here reason upon   the people feared not any ill consequences to liberty from the authority of the criminal courts because these were nothing but very numerous juries chosen by lot from amongst the people and they considered themselves justly as in a state of pupillage where they had an authority after they came to the use of reason not only to retract and control whatever had been determined but to punish any guardian for measures which they had embraced by his persuasion the same law had place in thebes plut in vita pelop and for the same reason  it appears to have been an usual practice in athens on the establishment of any law esteemed very useful or popular to prohibit for ever its abrogation and repeal thus the demagogue who diverted all the public revenues to the support of shows and spectacles made it criminal so much as to move for a reversement of this law demost olynth     thus leptines moved for a law not only to recall all the immunities formerly granted but to deprive the people for the future of the power of granting any more demost contra lept thus all bills of attainder demost contra aristocratem were forbid or laws that affect one athenian without extending to the whole commonwealth these absurd clauses by which the legislature vainly attempted to bind itself for ever proceeded from an universal sense of the levity and inconstancy of the people  ii a wheel within a wheel such as we observe in the german empire is considered by lord shaftsbury essay on the freedom of wit and humor part   sect   as an absurdity in politics but what must we say to two equal wheels which govern the same political machine without any mutual check control or subordination and yet preserve the greatest harmony and concord to establish two distinct legislatures each of which possesses full and absolute authority within itself and stands in no need of the others assistance in order to give validity to its acts this may appear before hand altogether impracticable as long as men are actuated by the passions of ambition emulation and avarice which have been hitherto their chief governing principles and should i assert that the state i have in my eye was divided by two distinct factions each of which predominated in a distinct legislature and yet produced no clashing of these independent powers the supposition may appear almost incredible and if to augment the paradox i should affirm that this disjointed irregular government was the most active triumphant and illustrious commonwealth that ever yet appeared on the stage of the world i should certainly be told that such a political chimera was as absurd as any vision of the poets but there is no need for searching long in order to prove the reality of the foregoing suppositions for this was actually the case with the roman republic  the legislative power was there lodged both in the comitia centuriata and comitia tributa in the former it is well known the people voted accordingly to their census so that when the first class was unanimous as commonly happened though it contained not perhaps the hundredth part of the commonwealth it determined the whole and with the authority of the senate established a law in the latter every vote was alike and as the authority of the senate was not there requisite the lower people entirely prevailed and gave law to the whole state in all party divisions at first betwixt the patricians and plebeians afterward betwixt the nobles and the people the interest of the aristocracy was predominant in the first legislature that of the democracy in the second the one could always destroy what the other had established nay the one by a sudden and unforeseen motion might take the start of the other and totally annihilate its rival by a vote which from the nature of the constitution had the full authority of a law but no such contest or struggle is observed in the history of rome no instance of a quarrel betwixt these two legislatures though many betwixt the parties that governed in each whence arose this concord which may seem so extraordinary  the legislature established at rome by the authority of servius tullius was the comitia centuriata which after the expulsion of the kings rendered the government for some time altogether aristocratical but the people having numbers and force on their side and being elated with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign wars always prevailed when pushed to extremities and first extorted from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes and then the legislative power of the comitia tributa it then behooved the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people for beside the force which the latter were always possessed of they had now got possession of legal authority and could instantly break in pieces any order or institution which directly opposed them by intrigue by influence by money by combination and by the respect paid their character the nobles might often prevail and direct the whole machine of government but had they openly set their comitia centuriata in oposition to the tributa they had soon lost the advantage of that institution along with their consuls praetors ediles and all the magistrates elected by it but the comitia tributa not having the same reason for respecting the centuriata frequently repealed laws favorable to the aristocracy they limited the authority of the nobles protected the people from oppression and controlled the actions of the senate and magistracy the centuriata found it convenient always to submit and though equal in authority yet being inferior in power durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature either by repealing its laws or establishing laws which it foresaw would soon be repealed by it  no instance is found of any opposition or struggle betwixt these comitia except one slight attempt of this kind mentioned by appian in the  d book of his civil wars mark anthony resolving to deprive decimus brutus of the government of cisalpine gaul railed in the forum and called one of the comitia in order to prevent the meeting of the other which had been ordered by the senate but affairs were then fallen into such confusion and the roman constitution was so near its last extremity that no inserence can be drawn from such an expedient this contest besides was founded more on form than party twas the senate who ordered the comitia tributa that they might obstruct the meeting of the centuriata which by the constitution or at least forms of the government could alone dispose of provinces  cicero was recalled by the comitia centuriata though banished by the tributa that is by a plebiscitum but his banishment we may observe never was considered as a legal deed arising from the free choice and inclination of the people it was always ascribed to the violence alone of clodius and the disorders introduced by him into the government  iii the third custom we proposed to observe regards england and though it be not so important as those which we have pointed out in athens and rome it is no less singular and remarkable it is a maxim in politics which we readily admit as undisputed and universal that a power however great when granted by law to an eminent magistrate is not so dangerous to liberty as an authority however inconsiderable which he acquires from violence and usurpation for besides that the law always limits every power which it bestows the very receiving it as a concession establishes the authority whence it is derived and preserves the harmony of the constitution by the same right that one prerogative is assumed without law another may also be claimed and another with still greater facility while the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the following and give force to maintain them hence the heroism of hampden who sustained the whole violence of royal prosecution rather than pay a tax of  0 shillings not imposed by parliament hence the care of all english patriots to guard against the first encroachments of the crown and hence alone the existence at this day of english liberty  there is however one occasion wherein the parliament has departed from this maxim and that is in the pressing of seamen the exercise of an illegal power is here tacitly permitted in the crown and though it has frequently been deliberated on how that power might be rendered legal and under what restrictions it might be granted to the sovereign no safe expedient could ever be proposed for that purpose and the danger to liberty always appeared greater from law than from usurpation while this power is exercised to no other end than to man the navy men willingly submit to it from a sense of its use and necessity and the sailors who are alone affected by it find no body to support them in claiming the rights and privileges which the law grants without distinction to all english subjects but were this power on any occasion made an instrument of faction or ministerial tyranny the opposite faction and indeed all lovers of their country would immediately take the alarm and support the injured party the liberty of englishmen would be asserted juries would be implacable and the tools of tyranny acting both against law and equity would meet with the severest vengeance on the other hand were the parliament to grant such an authority they would probably fall into one of these two inconveniences they would either bestow it under so many restrictions as would make it lose its effects by cramping the authority of the crown or they would render it so large and comprehensive as might give occasion to great abuses for which we could in that case have no remedy the very illegality of the power at present prevents its abuses by affording so easy a remedy against them  i pretend not by this reasoning to exclude all possibility of contriving a register for seamen which might mann the navy without being dangerous to liberty i only observe that no satisfactory scheme of that nature has yet been proposed rather than adopt any project hitherto invented we continue a practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable authority in times of full internal peace and concord is armed against law a continued and open usurpation in the crown is permitted amidst the greatest jealousy and watchfulness in the people nay proceeding from those very principles liberty in a country of the highest liberty is left entirely to its own defense without any countenance or protection the wild state of nature is renewed in one of the most civilized societies of mankind and great violences and disorders amongst the people the most humane and the best natured are committed with impunity while the one party pleads obedience to the supreme magistrate the other the permission of fundamental laws  discourse x of the populousness of ancient nations an eminent clergyman in edinburgh having wrote some years ago a discourse on the same question with this of the populousness of ancient nations was pleased lately to communicate it to the author it maintained the opposite side of the argument to what is here insisted on and contained much erudition and good reasoning the author acknowledges to have borrowed with some variations from that discourse two computations that with regard to the number of inhabitants in belgium and that with regard to those in epirus if this learned gentleman be prevailed on to publish his differtation it will serve to give great light into the present question the most curious and important of all questions of erudition  there is very little ground either from reason or experience to conclude the universe eternal or incorruptible the continual and rapid motion of matter the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated the changes remarked in the heavens the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world and its passage by corruption or dissolution from one state or order to another it must therefore have its infancy youth manhood and old age as well as each individual form which it contains and it is probable that in all these variations man equally with every animal and vegetable will partake in the flourishing age of the world it may be expected that the human species should possess greater vigor both of mind and body more prosperous health higher spirits longer life and a stronger inclination and power of generation but if the general system of things and human society of course have any such gradual revolutions they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition stature and force of body length of life even courage and extent of genius seem hitherto to have been naturally in all ages pretty much the same the arts and sciences indeed have flourished in one period and have decayed in another but we may observe that at the time when they rose to greatest perfection amongst one people they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighboring nations and though they universally decayed in one age yet in a succeeding generation they again revived and diffused themselves over the world as far therefore as observation reaches there is no universal difference discernible in the human species and though it were allowed that the universe like an animal body had a natural progress from infancy to old age yet as it must still be uncertain whether at present it be advancing to its point of perfection or declining from it we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature collumela says lib   cap   that in egypt and africa the bearing of twins was frequent and even customary gemini parties familiares ac paene solennes sunt if this was true there is a physical difference both in countries and ages for travelers make no such remark of those countries at present on the contrary we are apt to suppose the northern nations more fertile as those two countries were provinces of the roman empire it is difficult though not altogether absurd to suppose that such a man as columella might be mistaken with regard to them to prove therefore or account for the greater populousness of antiquity by the imaginary youth or vigor of the world will scarce be admitted by any just reasoner these general physical causes ought entirely to be excluded from that question  there are indeed some more particular physical causes of great importance diseases are mentioned in antiquity which are almost unknown to modern medicine and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves of which there are no traces in ancient history and in this particular we may observe upon comparison that the disadvantage is very much on the side of the moderns not to mention some others of less importance the small pox commits such ravages as would almost alone account for the great superiority supposed in ancient times the tenth or the twelfth part of mankind destroyed every generation should make a vast difference it may be thought in the numbers of the people and when joined to venereal distempers a new plague diffused every where this disease is perhaps equivalent by its constant operation to the three great scourges of mankind war pestilence and famine were it certain therefore that ancient times were more populous than the present and could no moral causes be assigned for so great a change these physical causes alone in the opinion of many would be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head  but is it certain that antiquity was so much more populous as is pretended the extravagancies of vossius with regard to this subject are well known but an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventured to affirm that according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of there are not now the fiftieth part of mankind on the face of the earth which existed in the time of julius caesar lettres persanes see also lesprit des loix live    chap          it may easily be observed that the comparisons in this case must be very imperfect even though we confine ourselves to the scene of ancient history europe and the nations about the mediterranean we know not exactly the numbers of any european kingdom or even city at present how can we pretend to calculate those of ancient cities and states where historians have left us such imperfect traces for my part the matter appears to me so uncertain that as i intend to throw together some reflections on that head i shall intermingle the enquiry concerning causes with that concerning facts which ought never to be admitted where the facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance we shall first consider whether it be probable from what we know of the situation of society in both periods that antiquity must have been more populous secondly whether in reality it was so if i can make appear that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended in favor of antiquity it is all i aspire to  in general we may observe that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms implies very important consequences and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police manners and constitution of government for as there is in all men both male and female a desire and power of generation more active than is ever universally exerted the restraints which it lies under must proceed from some difficulties in mens situation which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one and the human species at this rate of propagation would more than double every generation were every one coupled as soon as he comes to the age of puberty how fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement where it is an easy matter to provide for a family and where men are no way straightened or confined as in long established governments history tells us frequently of plagues that have swept away the third or fourth part of a people yet in a generation or two the destruction was not perceived and the society had again acquired their former number the lands that were cultivated the houses built the commodities raised the riches acquired enabled the people who escaped immediately to marry and to rear families which supplied the place of those who had perished this too is a good reason why the small pox does not depopulate countries so much as may at first sight be imagined where there is room for more people they will always arise even without the assistance of naturalization bills it is remarkt by don geronimo de ustariz that the provinces of spain which send most people to the indies are most populous which proceeds from their superior riches and for a like reason every wise just and mild government by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure will always abound most in people as well as in commodities and riches a country indeed whose climate and soil are fitted for vines will naturally be more populous than one which produces only corn and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage but if every thing else be equal it seems natural to expect that wherever there are most happiness and virtue and the wisest institutions there will also be most people  the question therefore concerning the populousness of ancient and modern times being allowed of great importance twill be requisite if we would bring it to some determination to compare both the domestic and political situation of these two periods in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes which is the first view in which we proposed to consider them  the chief difference betwixt the domestic economy of the ancients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery which prevailed amongst the former and which has been abolished for some centuries throughout the greatest part of europe some passionate admirers of the ancients and zealous partisans of civil liberty for these sentiments as they are both of them in the main extremely just are also found to be almost inseparable cannot forbear regreting the loss of this institution and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery they would gladly subject the greatest part of mankind to real slavery and subjection but to one who considers cooly of the subject it will appear that human nature in general really enjoys more liberty at present in the most arbitrary government of europe than it ever did during the most flourishing period of ancient times as much as submission to a petty prince whose dominions extend not beyond a single city is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever the more the master is removed from us in place and rank the greater liberty do we enjoy the less are our actions inspected and controlled and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes betwixt our own subjection and the freedom and even dominion of another the remains that are left of domestic slavery in our colonies and amongst some european nations would never surely create a desire os rendering it more universal the little humanity commonly observed in persons accustomed from their infancy to exercise so great authority over their fellow creatures and to trample upon human nature were sufficient alone to disgust us with that authority nor can a more probable reason be given for the severe i might say barbarous manners of ancient times than the practice of domestic slavery by which every man of rank was rendered a petty tyrant and educated amidst the flattery submission and low debasement of his slaves  according to the ancient practice all checks were on the inferior to restrain him to the duty of submission none on the superior to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity in modern times a bad servant finds not easily a good master nor a bad master a good servant and the checks are mutual suitable to the inviolate and eternal laws of reason and equity  the custom of exposing old useless or sick slaves in an island of the tyber there to starve seems to have been pretty common in rome and whoever recovered after having been so exposed had his liberty given him by an edict of the emperor claudius where it was likeways forbid to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness suetonius in vita claudii but supposing that this edict was strictly obeyed would it better the domestic treatment of slaves or render their lives much more comfortable we may imagine what others would practice when it was the professed maxim of the elder cato to sell his superannuated slaves for any price rather than maintain what he esteemed an useless burden plut in vita catonis   the ergastula or dungeons where slaves in chains were beat to work were very common all over italy columella lib   cap   advises that they be always built under ground and recommends id lib    cap   it as the duty of a careful overseer to call over every day the names of these slaves like the mustering of a regiment or ships company in order to know presently when any of them had deserted a proof of the frequency of these ergastula and of the great number of slaves confined in them partem italiae ergastula a solitudine vindicant says livy  achaind slave for a porter was usual in rome as appears from ovid amor lib   eleg   and other authors sueton de claris rhetor so also the ancient poet janitoris tintinnire impedimenta audio had not these people shaken off all sense of compassion toward that unhappy part of their species would they have presented all their friends at the first entrance with such an image of the severity of the master and misery of the slave  nothing so common in all trials even of civil causes as to call for the evidence of slaves which was always extorted by the most exquisite torments demosthenes says in oneterem orat   that where it was possible to produce for the same fact either freemen or slaves as witnesses the judges always preferred the torturing of slaves as a more certain and infallible evidence the same practice was common in rome but cicero seems not to think this evidence so certain as the testimony of free citizens pro caelio   seneca draws a picture of that disorderly luxury which changes day into night and night into day and inverts every stated hour of every office in life amongst other circumstances such as displacing the meals and time of bathing he mentions that regularly about the third hour of the night the neighbors of one who indulges this false refinement hear the noise of whips and lashes and upon enquiry find he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants and giving them due correction and discipline this is not remarked as an instance of cruelty but only of disorder which even in actions the most usual and methodical changes the fixed hours that an established custom had assigned them epist     the inhuman sports exhibited at rome may justly be considered too as an effect of the peoples contempt for slaves and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror or who is surprised that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors ones humanity on that occasion is apt to renew the barbarous wish of caligula that the people had but one neck a man could almost be pleased by a single blow to put an end to such a race of monsters you may thank god says the author above cited epist   addressing himself to the romans people that you have a master viz the mild and merciful nero who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example this was spoke in the beginning of his reign but he fitted them very well afterward and no doubt was considerably improved by the sight of the barbarous objects to which he had from his infancy been accustomed   but our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state it is pretended that in this particular the ancient practice has infinitely the advantage and was the the chief cause of that extreme populousness which is supposed in those times at present all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants and admit not by any means the marriage of the female who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for their service but where the property of the servants is lodged in the master their marriage and sertility form his riches and bring him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled he encourages therefore their propagation as much as that of his cattle rears the young with the same care and educates them to some art or calling which may render them more useful or valuable to him the opulent are by this policy interested in the being at least though not the wellbeing of the poor and enrich themselves by increasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them each man being a sovereign in his own family has the same interest with regard to it as the prince with regard to the state and has not like the prince any opposite motives of ambition or vainglory which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty all of it is at all times under his eye and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects we may here observe that if domestic slavery really increased populousness it would be an exception to the general rule that the happiness of any society and its populousness are necessary attendants a master from humor or interest may make his slaves very unhappy and yet be careful from interest to increase their number their marriage is not a matter of choice with them no more than any other action of their life   such are the consequences of domestic slavery according to the first aspect and appearance of things but if we enter deeper into the subject we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations the comparison is shocking betwixt the management of human creatures and that of cattle but being extremely just when applied to the present subject it may be proper to trace the consequences of it at the capital near all great cities in all populous rich industrious provinces few cattle are bred provisions lodging attendance labor are there dear and men find better their account in buying the cattle after they come to a certain age from the remoter and cheaper countries these are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle and by a parity of reason for men too when the latter are put on the same footing with the former to rear a child in london till he could be serviceable would cost much dearer than to buy one of the same age from scotland or ireland where he had been raised in a cottage covered with rags and fed on oatmeal or potatoes those who had slaves therefore in all the richer and more populous countries would discourage the pregnancy of the females and either prevent or destroy the birth the human species would perish in those places where it ought to increase the fastest and a perpetual recruit be needed from all the poorer and more desert provinces such a continued drain would tend mightily to depopulate the state and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us where every man is master of himself and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature not the calculations of sordid interest if london at present without much increasing needs a yearly recruit from the country of  000 people as is commonly computed what must it require if the greatest part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves and were hindered from breeding by their avaricious masters  all ancient authors tell us that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to italy from the remoter provinces particularly syria cilicia ten thousand slaves in a day have been often sold for the use of the romans at delus in cilicia strabo lib    cappadocia the lesser asia thrace and egypt yet the number of people increased not in italy and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agriculture columella lib   proem et cap   et   varro lib   cap   horace lib   od    tacit annal lib   cap    sueton in vita aug cap    plin lib    cap    where then is that extreme fertility of the roman slaves which is commonly supposed so far from multiplying they could not it seems so much as keep up the stock without immense recruits and though great numbers were continually manumitted and converted into roman citizens the numbers even of these did not increase minore indies plebe ingenua says tacitus ann lib   cap    till the freedom of the city was communicated to foreign provinces  the term for a slave born and bred in the family was verna as servus was the name of the genus and verna of the species without any correlative this forms a strong presumption that the latter were by far the least numerous it is an universal observation which we may form upon language that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other in numbers rank or consideration there are always correlative terms invented which answer to both the parts and express their mutual relation if they bear no proportion to each other the term is only invented for the less and marks its distinction from the whole thus man and woman master and servant father and son prince and subject stranger and citizen are correlative terms but the words seaman carpenter smith tailor etc have no correspondent terms which express those who are no seaman no carpenter etc languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains and may thence afford very strong inferences concerning the manners and customs of different nations the military government of the roman emperors had exalted the soldiery so high that they balanced all the other orders of the state hence miles and paganus became relative terms a thing till then unknown to ancient and still so to modern languages modern superstition exalted the clergy so high that they overbalanced the whole state hence clergy and laity are terms opposed in all modern languages and in these alone and from the same principles i infer that if the number of slaves bought by the romans from foreign countries had not extremely exceeded those bred at home verna would have had a correlative which would have expressed the former species of slaves but these it would seem composed the main body of the ancient slaves and the latter were but a few exceptions and these slaves seem to have been entitled by custom to privileges and indulgences beyond others a sufficient reason why the masters would not be fond of rearing many of that kind verna is used by roman writers as a word equivalent to scurra on account of the petulance and impudence of those slaves mart lib   cp    horace also mentions the vernae procaces and petronius cap    vernula urbanitas seneca de provid cap   vernularum licentia whoever is acquainted with the maxims of our planters will acknowledge the justness of this observation it is computed in the west indies that a stock of slaves grow worse five per cent every year unless new slaves be bought to recruit them they are not able to keep up their own number even in those warm countries where clothes and provisions are so easily got how much more must this happen in european countries and in or near great cities   atticus is much praised by his historian for the care which he took in recruiting his family from the slaves born in it corn nepes in vita attici may we not thence infer that that practice was not then very common  the names of slaves in the greek comedies syrus mysus geta thrax davus lydus phryx etc afford a presumption that at athens at least most of the slaves were imported from foreign nations the athenians says strabo lib   gave to their slaves either the names of the nations whence they were bought as lydus syrus or the names that were most common amongst those nations as manes or midas to a phrygian tibias to a paphlagonian  demosthenes after having mentioned a law which forbid any man to strike the slave of another praises the humanity of this law and adds that if the barbarians from whom slaves were bought had information that their countrymen met with such gentle treatment they would entertain a great esteem for the athenians in midiam p     ex edit aldi isocrates panegyr also says that all the greek slaves were barbarians  it is well known that demosthenes in his nonage had been defrauded of a large fortune by his tutors and that afterward he recovered by a prosecution at law the value of his patrimony his orations on that occasion still remain and contain a very exact detail of the whole substance left by his father in aphobum orat   in money merchandise houses and slaves along with the value of each particular amongst the rest were    slaves handicraftsmen viz    swordcutlers and  0 cabinetmakers  makers of those beds which the ancients lay upon at meals all males not a word of any wives children or family which they certainly would have had had it been a common custom at athens to breed from the slaves and the value of the whole must have depended very much on that circumstance no female slaves are even so much as mentioned except some chambermaids that belonged to his mother this argument has great force if it be not altogether decisive  consider this passage of plutarch in vita catenit speaking of the elder cato he had a great number of slaves which he took care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war and he chose them young that they might easily be accustomed to any diet or manner of life and be instructed in any business or labor as men teach any thing to young dogs or horses  and esteeming love the chief source of all disorders he allowed the male slaves to have a commerce with the female in his family upon paying a certain sum for this privilege but he strictly forbid all intrigues out of his family are there any symptoms in this narration of that care which is supposed in the ancients of the marriage and propagation of their slaves if that was a common practice founded on general interest it would surely have been embraced by cato who was a great occonomist and lived in times when the ancient frugality and simplicity of manners were still in credit and reputation  it is expressly remarked by the writers of the roman law that scarce any ever purchase slaves with a view of breeding from them non temere ancillae ejus rei causa comparantur ut pariant digest lib   tit   de haered petit lex    the following texts are to the same purpose spadonem morbosum non esse neque vitiosum verius mihi videtur sed sanum esse sicuti illum qui unum testiculum habet qui etiam generare potest digest lib   tit   de aedilicio edicto lex   sect   sin

respects he was full as valuable the same reasoning is employed with regard to female slaves quaeritur de ea muliere quae semper mortuos parit an morbosa sit et ait sabinus si vulvae vitio hoc contingit morbosam esse id lex    it has even been doubted whether a woman pregnant was morbid or vitiated and it is determined that she is sound not on account of the value of her offspring but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children si mulier praegnans venerit inter omnes convenit sanam eam esse maximum enim ac praecipuum munus faeminarum accipere ac tueri

sit si vitio corporis centra id   our lackeys and chambermaids i own do not serve much to multiply the species but the ancients beside those who attended on their person had all their labor performed by slaves who lived many of them in their family and some great men possessed to the number of  0000 if there be any suspicion therefore that this institution was unfavourable to propagation and the same reason at least in part holds with regard to ancient slaves as well as modern servants how destructive must slavery have proved  history mentions a roman nobleman who had  00 slaves under the same roof with him and having been assassinated at home by the furious revenge of one of them the law was executed with rigor and all without exception were put to death tacit ann lib    cap    many other roman noblemen had families equally or more numerous and i believe every one will allow that this would scarce be practicable were we to suppose all the slaves married and the females to be breeders the slaves in the great houses had little rooms assigned them called cellae whence the name of cell was transferred to the monks room in a convent see farther on this head just lipsius saturn   cap    these form strong presumptions against the marriage and propagation of the family slaves   so early as the poet hesiod opera and dies lib        also     0 married slaves whether male or female were esteemed very inconvenient how much more where families had increased to such an enormous size as in rome and the ancient simplicity of manners was banished from all ranks of people  xenophon in his oeconomics where he gives directions for the management of a farm recommends a strict care and attention of laying the male and female slaves at a distance from each other he seems not to suppose they are ever married the only slaves amongst the greeks that appear to have continued their own breed were the helotes who had houses apart and were more the slaves of the public than of individuals strabo lib     the ancients talk so frequently of a fixed stated portion of provisions assigned to each slave see cato de re rustica cap    donatus in phormion       seneca epist  0 that we are naturally led to conclude that slaves lived almost all single and received that portion as a kind of board wages  the practice indeed of marrying the slaves seems not to have been very common even amongst the country laborers where it is more naturally to be expected cato de re rust cap  0    enumerating the slaves requisite to labor a vineyard of a hundred acres makes them amount to    the overseer and his wife villicus and villica and    male slaves for an olive plantation of   0 acres the overseer and his wife and ii male slaves and so in proportion to a greater or less plantation or vineyard  varro lib   cap    citing this passage of cato allows his computation to be just in every other respect except the last for as it is requisite says he to have an overseer and his wife whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small this must alter the exactness of the proportion had catos computation been erroneous in any other respect it had certainly been corrected by varro who seems fond of discovering so trivial an error  the same author lib   cap    as well as columella lib   cap    recommends it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer in order to attach him the more strongly to his masters service this was therefore a peculiar indulgence granted to a slave in whom so great a confidence was reposed  in the same place varro mentions it as an useful precaution not to buy too many slaves from the same nation lest they beget factions and seditions in the family a presumption that in italy the greatest part even of the country laboring slaves for he speaks of no other were bought from the remoter provinces all the world knows that the family slaves in rome who were instruments of show and luxury were commonly imported from the east hoc profecere says pliny speaking of the jealous care of masters mancipiorum legiones et in domo turba externa ac servorum quoque causa nomenclator adhibendus lib    cap     it is indeed recommended by varro lib   cap  0 to propagate young shepherds in the family from the old ones for as grasing farms were commonly in remote and cheap places and each shepherd lived in a cottage apart his marriage and increase were not liable to the same inconveniences as in dearer places and where many servants lived in a family which was universally the case in such of the roman farms as produced wine or corn if we consider this exception with regard to shepherds and weigh the reason of it it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our foregoing suspicions pastoris duri est hic filius ills bubulet juven sat xi       columella lib   cap   i own advises the master to give a reward and even liberty to a female slave that had reared him above three children a proof that sometimes the ancients propagated from their slaves which indeed cannot be denied were it otherwise the practice of slavery being so common in antiquity must have been destructive to a degree which no expedient could repair all i pretend by these reasonings is that slavery is in general disadvantageous both to the happiness and populousness of mankind and that its place is much better supplied by the practice of hired servants  the laws or as some writers call them the seditions of the gracchi were occasioned by their observing the increase of slaves all over italy and the diminution of freecitizens appian de bell civ lib   ascribes this increase to the propagation of the slaves plutarch in vita tib andc grach to the purchase of barbarians who were chained and imprisoned  to the same purpose is that passage of the elder seneca ex controversia   lib   arata quondam populis rura singulorum ergastulorum sunt latiusque nunc villici quam olim reges imperant at nunc eadem says pliny vincti pedes damnatae manus inscripti vultus

army in spain by the same expedient id lib   cap    if the country laborers throughout the roman empire were so generally in this situation and if it was difficult or impossible to find separate lodgings for the families of the city servants how unfavourable to propagation as well as humanity must the institution of domestic slavery be esteemed  constantinople at present requires the same recruits of slaves from all the provinces which rome did of old and these provinces are of consequence far from being populous  egypt according to mons maillet sends continual colonies of black slaves to the other parts of the turkish empire and receives annually an equal return of white the one brought from the inland parts of africa the other from mingrelia circassia and tartary  our modern convents are no doubt very bad institutions but there is reason to suspect that anciently every great family in italy and probably in other parts of the world was a species of convent and though we have reason to detest all these popish institutions as nurseries of the most abject superstition burdensome to the public and oppressive to the poor prisoners male as well as female yet may it be questioned whether they be so destructive to the populousness of a state as is commonly imagined were the land which belongs to a convent bestowed on a nobleman he would spend its revenue on dogs horses grooms footmen cooks and chambermaids and his family would not furnish many more citizens than the convent  the common reason why parents thrust their daughters into nunneries is that they may not be overburthend with too numerous a family but the ancients had a method almost as innocent and more effectual to that purpose viz the exposing their children in the earliest infancy this practice was very common and is not mentioned by any author of those times with the horror it deserves or scarce tacitus blames it de morib germ even with disapprobation plutarch the humane good natured plutarch de fraterno amore seneca also approves of the exposing of sickly infirm children de ira lib   cap    recommends it as a virtue in attalus king of pergamus that he murdered or if you will exposed all his own children in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother eumenes signalizing in this manner his gratitude and affection to eumenes who had left him his heir preferably to that son twas solon the most celebrated of the sages of greece who gave parents permission by law to kill their children sext emp lib   cap      shall we then allow these two circumstances to compensate each other viz monastic vows and the exposing of children and to be unfavourable in equal degrees to the propagation of mankind i doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity perhaps by an odd conexion of causes the barbarous practice of the ancients might rather render those times more populous by removing the terrors of too numerous a family it would engage many people in marriage and such is the force of natural affection that very few in comparison would have resolution enough when it came to the push to carry into execution their former intentions  china the only country where this barbarous practice of exposing children prevails at present is the most populous country we know and every man is married before he is twenty such early marriages could scarce be general had not men the prospect of so easy a method of getting rid of their children i own that plutarch de amore prolis speaks of it as a very universal maxim of the poor to expose their children and as the rich were then averse to marriage on account of the courtship they met with from those who expected legacies from them the public must have been in a bad situation betwixt them the practice of leaving great sums of money to friends though one had near relations was common to greece as well as rome as we may gather from lucian this practice prevails very little in modern times and ben johnsons volpone is therefore almost entirely extracted from ancient authors and suits better the manners of those times   of all sciences there is none where first appearances are more deceitful than politics hospitals for foundlings seem favorable to the increase of numbers and perhaps may be so when kept under proper restrictions but when they open the door to every one without distinction they have probably a contrary effect and are pernicious to the state it is computed that every ninth child born at paris is sent to the hospital though it seems certain according to the common course of human affairs that it is not a hundredth part whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate them the infinite difference for health industry and morals betwixt an education in an hospital and that in a private family should induce us not to make the entrance into an hospital too easy and engaging to kill ones own child is shocking to nature and must therefore be pretty unusual but to turn over the care of him upon others is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind  having considered the domestic life and manners of the ancients compared to those of the moderns it may justly be thought that the liberty of divorces in rome was another discouragement to marriage such a practice prevents not quarrels from humor or rather increases them and occasions also those from interest which are much more dangerous and destructive see farther on this head essays moral and political essay xxi perhaps too the unnatural lusts of the ancients ought to be taken into consideration as of some moment where in the main we seem rather superior so far as the present question is concerned we shall now examine the political customs and institutions of both ages and weigh their influence in retarding or forwarding the propagation of mankind  before the increase of the roman power or rather till its full establishment almost all the nations which are the scene of ancient history were divided into small territories or petty commonwealths where of course a great equality of fortune prevailed and the center of government was always very near its frontiers this was the situation of affairs not only in greece and italy but also in spain gaul germany afric and a great part of the lesser asia and it must be owned that no institution could be more favorable to the propagation of mankind for though a man of an overgrown fortune not being able to consume more than another must share it with those who serve and attend him yet their possession being precarious they have not the same encouragement to marriage as if each had a small fortune secure and independent enormous cities are besides destructive to society beget vice and disorder of all kinds starve the remoter provinces and even starve themselves by the high prices to which they raise all provisions where each man had his little house and field to himself and each county had its capital free and independent what a happy situation of mankind how favorable to industry and agriculture to marriage and propagation the prolific virtue of men were it to act in its full extent without that restraint which poverty and necessity imposes on it would double the numbers every generation and nothing surely can give it more liberty than such small commonwealths and such an equality of fortune amongst the citizens all small states naturally produce equality of fortune because they afford no opportunities of great increase but small commonwealths much more by that division of power and authority which is essential to them  when xenophon de exp cyr lib   returned after the famous expedition with cyrus he hired himself and  000 of the greeks into the service of seuthes a prince of thrace and the articles of his agreement were that each soldier should receive a daric a month each captain two darics and he himself as general four a regulation of pay which would not a little surprise our modern officers  when demosthenes and aeschines with eight more were sent ambassadors to philip of macedon their appointments for above four months were a thousand drachmas which is less than a dram a

happiness of mankind europe is shared out mostly into great monarchies and such parts of it as are divided into small territories are commonly governed by absolute princes who ruin their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater monarchs in the splendour of their court and number of their forces swisserland alone and holland resemble the ancient republics and though the former is far from possessing any advantage either of soil climate or commerce yet the numbers of people with which it abounds notwithstanding their enlisting themselves into every service in europe prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions  the ancient republics derived their chief or only security from the numbers of their citizens the trachinians having lost great numbers of their people the remainder instead of enriching themselves by the inheritance of their fellow citizens applied to sparta their metropolis for a new stock of inhabitants the spartans immediately collected ten thousand men amongst whom the old citizens divided the lands of which the former proprietors had perished diod sic lib    thucyd lib     after timoleon had banished dionysius from syracuse and had

of equality could not fail to produce populousness  we must now consider what disadvantages the ancients lay under with regard to populousness and what checks they received from their political maxims and institutions there are commonly compensations in every human condition and though these compensations be not always perfectly equivalent yet they serve at least to restrain the prevailing principle to compare them and estimate their influence is indeed very difficult even where they take place in the same age and in neighboring countries but where several ages have intervened and only scattered lights are afforded us by ancient authors what can we do but amuse ourselves by talking pro and con on an interesting subject and thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations  first we may observe that the ancient republics were almost in perpetual war a natural effect of their martial spirit their love of liberty their mutual emulation and that hatred which generally prevails amongst nations that live in a close neighborhood now war in a small state is much more destructive than in a great one both because all the inhabitants in the former case must fill the armies and because the state is all frontier and all exposed to the inroads of the enemy  the maxims of ancient war were much more destructive than those of modern chiefly by the distribution of plunder in which the soldiers were indulged our common soldiers are such a low rascally set of people that we find any abundance beyond their simple pay breeds confusion and disorder and a total dissolution of discipline the very wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the modern armies render them less destructive to the countries which they invade one instance amongst many of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political reasonings the ancient soldiers being free citizens above the lowest rank were all married our modern soldiers are either forcdto live unmarryd or their marriages turn to small account toward the increase of mankind a circumstance which ought perhaps to be taken into consideration as of some consequence in favor of the ancients   ancient battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employed in them the ancients drew up their men    or  0 sometimes  0 men deep which made a narrow front and twas not difficult to find a field in which both armies might be marshalled and might engage with each other even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges hillocks woods or hollow ways the battle was not so soon decided betwixt the contending parties but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties that opposed them and take part in the engagement and as the whole armies were thus engaged and each man closely buckld to his antagonist the battles were commonly very bloody and great slaughter made on both sides but especially on the vanquished the long thin lines required by fire arms and the quick decision of the fray render our modern engagements but partial rencounters and enable the general who is foiled in the beginning of the day to draw off the greatest part of his army sound and entire could folards project of the column take place which seems impracticable what is the advantage of the column after it has broke the enemys line only that it then takes them in the flank and dissipates whatever stands near it by a fire from all sides but till it has broke them does it not present a flank to the enemy and that exposed to their musquetry and what is much worse to their cannon  it would render modern battles as destructive as the ancient  the battles of antiquity both by their duration and their resemblance of single combats were wrought up to a degree of fury quite unknown to latter ages nothing could then engage the combatants to give quarter but the hopes of profit by making slaves of their prisoners in civil wars as we learn from tacitus hist lib   cap    the battles were the most bloody because the prisoners were not slaves  what a stout resistance must be made where the vanquished expected so hard a fate how inveterate the rage where the maxims of war were in every respect so bloody and severe  instances are very frequent in ancient history of cities besieged whose inhabitants rather than open their gates murdered their wives and children and rushed themselves on a voluntary death sweetened perhaps with a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy greeks as abydus mentioned by livy lib    cap       and polyb lib    as also the xanthians appian de bell civil lib   as well as barbarians have been often wrought up to this degree of fury and the same determinate spirit and cruelty must in many other instances less remarkable have been extremely destructive to human society in those petty commonwealths that lived in a close neighborhood and were engaged in perpetual wars and contentions  sometimes the wars in greece says plutarch in vita arati were carried on entirely by inroads and robberies and pyracies such a method of war must be more destructive in small states than the bloodiest battles and sieges  by the laws of the    tables possession for two years formed a prescription for land one year for movables inst lib   cap   it is true the same law seems to have been continued till the time of justinian but abuses introduced by barbarism are not always corrected by civility an indication that there was not in italy during that period much more order tranquillity and settled police than there is at present amongst the tartars  the only cartel i remember in ancient history is that betwixt demetrius poliorcetes and the rhodians when it was agreed that a free citizen should be restored for  000 drachamas a slave bearing arms for  00 diod sicul lib  0   but secondly it appears that ancient manners were more unfavourable than the modern not only in time of war but also in time of peace and that too in every respect except the love of civil liberty and equality which is i own of considerable importance to exclude faction from a free government is very difficult if not altogether impracticable but such inveterate rage betwixt the factions and such bloody maxims are found in modern times amongst religious parties alone where bigoted priests are the accusers judges and executioners in ancient history we may always observe where one party prevailed whether the nobles or people for i can observe no difference in this respect lysias who was himself of the popular faction and very narrowly escaped from the  0 tyrants says that the democracy was as violent a government as the oligarchy orat    de statu popul  that they immediately butchered all of the opposite party they laid their hands on and banished such as had been so fortunate as to escape their fury no form of process no law no trial no pardon a fourth a third perhaps near a half of the city were slaughtered or expelled every revolution and the exiles always joined foreign enemies and did all the mischief possible to their fellow citizens till fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution and as these were very frequent in such violent governments the disorder diffidence jealousy enmity which must prevail are not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world  there are only two revolutions i can recollect in all ancient history which past without great severity and great effusion of blood in massacres and assassinations viz the restoration of the athenian democracy by thrasybulus and the subduing the roman republic by caesar we learn from ancient history that thrasybulus past a general amnesty for all past offenses and first introduced that word as well as practice into greece cicero philip   it appears however from many orations of lysias as orat    contra eratost orat    contra agorat orat    pro mantith that the chief and even some of the subaltern offenders in the preceding tyranny were tried and capitally punished this is a difficulty not cleared up and even not observed by antiquarians and historians and as to caesars clemency though much celebrated it would not gain great applause in the present age he butchered for instance all catos senate when he became master of utica appian de bell civ lib   and these we may readily believe were not the most worthless of the party all those who had born arms against that usurper were forfeited and by hirtiuss law declared incapable of all public offices  these people were extremely fond of liberty but seem not to have understood it very well when the thirty tyrants first established their dominion at athens they began with seizing all the sycophants and informers that had been so troublesome during the democracy and putting them to death by an arbitrary sentence and execution every man says sallust see caesars speech de bell catil and lysias orat    and in orat    he mentions the faction only as the cause why these illegal punishments should displease was rejoiced at these punishments not considering that liberty was from that moment annihilated  the utmost energy of thucydidess nervous style and the great copiousness and expression of the greek language seem to sink under that historian when he attempts to describe the disorders that arose from faction throughout all the greek commonwealths you would imagine that he still labors with a thought greater than he can find words to communicate and he concludes his pathetic description with an observation which is at once very refined and very solid in these contests says he those who were dullest and most stupid and had the least foresight commonly prevailed for being conscious of this weakness and dreading to be overreached by those of greater penetration they went to work hastily without premeditation by the sword and poniard and thereby prevented their antagonists who were forming fine schemes and projects for their destruction lib   the country in europe wherein i have observed the factions to be most violent and party hatred the strongest is ireland this goes so far as to cut off even the most common intercourse of civilities betwixt the protestants and catholics their cruel insurrections and the severe revenges which they have taken of each other are the causes of this mutual ill will which is the chief source of disorder poverty and depopulation in that country the greek factions i imagine to have been inflamed still to a higher degree of rage the revolutions being commonly more frequent and the maxims of assassination much more avowed and acknowledged   not to mention dionysius plut de virt et fort alex the elder who is computed to have butchered in cold blood above  0000 of his fellow citizens nor agathocles diod sic lib       nabis tit live lib          and others still more bloody than he the transactions even in free governments were extremely violent and destructive at athens the thirty tyrants and the nobles in a twelvemonth murdered without trial about   00 of the people and banished above the half of the citizens that remained diod sic lib    isocrates says there were only  000 banished he makes the number of those killed amount to   00 arcop aeschines contra ctesi assigns precisely the same number seneca de tranq anim cap   says   00 in argos near the same time the people killed   00 of the nobles and afterward their own demagogues because they had refused to carry their prosecutions farther diod sic lib    the people also in corcyra killed   00 of the nobles and banished a thousand diod sic lib    these numbers will appear the more surprising if we consider the extreme smallness of these states but all ancient history is full of such instances we shall mention from diod siculus alone a few which past in the course of sixty years during the most shining age of greece there were banished from sybaris  00 of the nobles and their partisans lib    p    ex edit rhodomanni of chians  00 citizens banished lib    p     at ephesus   0 killed  000 banished lib    p     of cyrenians  00 nobles killed all the rest banished lib    p     the corinthians

place they killed  00 of the people but these again revolting killed above  00 of the nobles and banished the rest lib    p     in arcadia   00 banished besides many killed the banished retired to sparta and to pallantium the latter delivered up to their countrymen and all killed lib    p     of the banished from argos and thebes there were  00 in the spartan army id p     here is a detail of the most remarkable of agathocles cruelties from the same author the people before his usurpation had banished  00 nobles lib    p     afterward that tyrant in concurrence with the people killed  000

capitulation id p     it is to be remarkt that agathocles was a man of great sense and courage   when alexander ordered all the exiles to be restored through all the cities it was found that the whole amounted to  0000 men diod sic lib    the remains probably of still greater slaughters and massacres what an astonishing multitude in so narrow a country as ancient greece and what domestic confusion jealousy partiality revenge heartburnings must tear those cities where factions were wrought up to such a degree of fury and despair  twoud be easier says isocrates to philip to raise an army in greece at present from the vagabonds than from the cities  even where affairs came not to such extremities which they failed not to do almost in every city twice or thrice every century property was rendered very precarious by the maxims of ancient government xenophon in the banquet of socrates gives us a very natural unaffected description of the tyranny of the athenian people in my poverty says charmides i am much more happy than ever i was during my riches as much as it is happier to be in security than in terrors free than a slave to receive than to pay court to be trusted than suspected formerly i was obliged to caress every informer some imposition was continually laid upon me and it was never allowed me to travel or be absent from the city at present when i am poor i look big and threaten others the rich are afraid of me and show me every kind of civility and respect and i am become a kind of tyrant in the city page     exedit lenl   in one of the pleadings of lysias orat    in nicom the orator very coolly speaks of it by the bye as a maxim of the athenian people that whenever they wanted money they put to death some of the rich citizens as well as strangers for the sake of the forfeiture in mentioning this he seems to have no intention of blaming them still less of provoking them who were his audience and judges  whether a man was a citizen or a stranger amongst that people it seems indeed requisite either that he should impoverish himself or the people would impoverish him and perhaps kill him into the bargain the orator last mentioned gives a pleasant account of an estate laid out in the public service in order to recommend his client to the favor of the people he enumerates all the sams he had expended when   0 minas upon a chorus of men  0 minas    minas   0 minas    minas seven times trierarch where he spent   talents taxes once  0 minas another time  0     minas     minas     minas    minas     minas   0 minas in the whole  0 talents    minas an immense sum for an athenian fortune and what alone would be esteemed great riches orat  0 it is true he says the law did not oblige absolutely to be at so much expense not above a fourth but without the favor of the people no body was so much as safe and this was the only way to gain it see farther orat    de pop statu in another place he introduces a speaker who says that he had spent his whole fortune and an immense one eighty talents for the people orat    de prob evandri the  or strangers find says he if they do not contribute largely enough to the peoples fancy that they have reason to repent orat  0 contra phil you may see with what care demosthenes displays his expenses of this nature when he pleads for himself de corona and how he exaggerates midias stinginess in this particular in his accusation of that criminal all this by the bye is a mark of a very iniquitous judicature and yet the athenians valued themselves on having the most legal and regular administration of any people in greece that is above the third of it in rareeshows and figured dances  ineed not insist on the greek tyrannies which were altogether horrible even the mixed monarchies by which most of the ancient states of greece were governed before the introduction of republics were very unsettled scarce any city but athens says isocrates could show a succession of kings for four or five generations panath   besides many other obvious reasons for the instability of ancient monarchies the equal division of property amongst the brothers in private families by a necessary consequence must contribute to unsettle and disturb the state the universal preference given to the elder in modern governments though it increases the inequality of fortunes has however this good effect that it accustoms men to the same idea of public succession and cuts off all claim and pretension of the younger  the new settled colony of heraclea falling immediately into factions applied to sparta who sent heripidas with full authority to quiet their dissensions this man not provoked by any opposition not inflamed by party rage knew no better expedient than immediately putting to death about  00 of the citizens diod sic lib     a strong proof how deeply rooted these violent maxims of government were throughout all greece  if such was the disposition of mens minds amongst that refined people what may be expected in the commonwealths of italy afric spain and gaul which were denominated barbarous why otherways did the greeks so much value themselves on their humanity gentleness and moderation above all other nations this reasoning seems very natural but unluckily the history of the roman commonwealth in its earlier times if we give credit to the received accounts stands against us no blood was ever shed in any sedition at rome till the murder of the gracchi dionysius halicarnassoeus lib    observing the singular humanity of the roman people in this respect makes use of it as an argument that they were originally of grecian extraction whence we may conclude that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous republics were more violent than even those of greece above mentioned  if the romans were so late in coming to blows they made ample compensation after they had once entered upon the bloody scene and appians history of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture of massacres proscriptions and forfeitures that ever was presented to the world what pleases most in that historian is that he seems to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous proceedings and talks not with that provoking coolness and indifference which custom had produced in many of the greek historians the authorities cited above are all historians orators and philosophers whose testimony is unquestioned it is dangerous to rely upon writers who deal in ridicule and satire what will posterity for instance infer from this passage of dr swift i told him that in the kingdom of tribnia britain by the natives called langdon london where i had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the colors the conduct and pay of ministers of state and their deputies the plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons etc gullivers travels such a representation might suit the government of athens but not that of england which is a prodigy even in modern times for humanity justice and liberty yet the doctors satire though carried to extremes as is usual with him even beyond other satirical writers did not altogether want an object the bishop of rochester who was his friend and of the same party had been banished a little before by a bill of attainder with great justice but without such a proof as was legal or according to the strict forms of common law   the maxims of ancient politics contain in general so little humanity and moderation that it seems superfluous to give any particular reason for the violences committed at any particular period yet i cannot forbear observing that the laws in the latter ages of the roman commonwealth were so absurdly contrived that they obliged the heads of parties to have recourse to these extremities all capital punishments were abolished however criminal or what is more however dangerous any citizen might be he could not regularly be punished otherways than by banishment and it became necessary in the revolutions of party to draw the sword of private vengeance nor was it easy when laws were once violated to set bounds to these sanguinary proceedings had brutus himself prevailed over the triumvirate could he in common prudence have allowed octavius and anthony to live and have contented himself with banishing them to rhodes or marseilles where they might still have plotted new commotions and rebellions his executing c antonius brother to the triumvir shows evidently his sense of the matter did not cicero with the approbation of all the wise and virtuous of rome arbitrarily put to death catilines associates contrary to law and without any trial or form of process and if he moderated his executions did it not proceed either from the clemency of his temper or the conjunctures of the times a wretched security in a government which pretends to laws and liberty  thus one extreme produces another in the same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution so their excessive lenity naturally engenders cruelty and barbarity it is dangerous to force us in any case to use freedom with their sacred regulations and prescriptions  one general cause of the disorders so frequent in all ancient governments seems to have consisted in the great difficulty of establishing any aristocracy in those ages and the perpetual discontents and seditions of the people whenever even the meanest and most beggarly were excluded from the legislature and from public offices the very quality of freeman gave such a rank being opposed to that of slave that it seemed to entitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the commonwealth salons plutarch in vita salon laws excluded no freeman from votes or elections but confined some magistracies to a particular census yet were the people never satisfied till those laws were repealed by the treaty with antipater diod sic lib     no athenian had a vote whose census was less than  000 drachmas about  0 l sterling and though such a government would to us appear sufficiently democratical it was so disagreeable to that people that above two thirds immediately deserted their country id ibid cassander reduced that census to the half id ibid  yet still the government was considered as an oligarchical tyranny and the effect of foreign violence  servius tulliuss tit live lib   cap    laws seem very equal and reasonable by fixing the power in proportion to the property yet the roman people could never be brought quietly to submit to them  in those days there was no medium betwixt a severe jealous aristocracy over discontented subjects and a turbulent factious tyrannical democracy  but thirdly there are many other circumstances in which ancient nations seem inferior to the modern both for the happiness and increase of mankind trade manufactures industry were no where in former ages so flourishing as they are at present in europe the only garb of the ancients both for males and females seems to have been a kind of flannel which they wore commonly white or gray and which they scoured as often as it grew dirty tire which carried on after carthage the greatest commerce of any city in the mediterranean before it was destroyed by alexander was no mighty city if we credit arrians account of its inhabitants lib   there were  000 killed during the siege and the whole captives amounted to  0000 diodorus siculus lib    says only   000 but he accounts for this small number by saying that the tyrians had sent away beforehand part of their wives and children to carthage  athens is commonly supposed to have been a trading city but it was as populous before the median war as at any time after it according to herodotus lib   he makes the number of the citizens amount to  0000  and yet its commerce at that time was so inconsiderable that as the same historian observes ib    even the neighboring coasts of asia were as little frequented by the greeks as the pillars of hercules for beyond these he conceived nothing  great interest of money and great profits of trade are an infallible indication that industry and commerce are but in their infancy we read in lysias orat    advers diagit of  00 per cent profit made on a cargo of two talents sent to no greater distance than from athens to the adriatic nor is this mentioned as an instance of exorbitant profit antidorus says demosthenes contra aphob p    ex edit aldi  paid three talents and a half for a house which he let at a talent a year and the orator blames his own tutors for not employing his money to like advantage my fortune says he in eleven years minority ought to have been tripled the value of  0 of the slaves left by his father he computes at  0 minas and the yearly profit of their labor at twelve id ibid p     the most moderate interest at athens for there was higher id ibid often paid was    per cent id ibid and aeschines contra ciesiph  and that paid monthly not to insist upon the exorbitant interest of    per cent to which the vast sums distributed in elections had raised money epist ad attic lib   epist    at rome we find that verres before that factious period stated    per cent for money which he left in the publicans hands and though cicero exclaims against this article it is not on account of the extravagant usury but because it had never been customary to state any interest on such occasions contra verr orat    interest indeed sunk at rome after the settlement of the empire but it never remained any considerable time so low as in the commercial states of modern ages see discourse iv   amongst the other inconveniences which the athenians felt from the fortifying decelia by the lacedaemonians it is represented by thucydides lib   as one of the most considerable that they could not bring over their corn from euboea by land passing by oropus but were obliged to embark it and to sail about the promontory of sunium a surprising instance of the imperfection of ancient navigation for the water carriage is not here above double the land  i do not remember any passage in any ancient author wherein the growth of any city is ascribed to the establishment of a manufacture the commerce which is said to flourish is chiefly the exchange of those commodities for which different soils and climates were suited the sale of wine and oil into africa according to diodorus siculus lib     was the foundation of the riches of agrigentum the situation of the city of sybaris according to the same author lib     was the cause of its immense populousness being built near the two rivers crathys and sybaris but these two rivers we may observe are not navigable and could only produce some fertile valleys for agriculture and husbandry an advantage so inconsiderable that a modern writer would scarcely have taken notice of it  the barbarity of the ancient tyrants along with the extreme love of liberty which animated those ages must have banished every merchant and manufacturer and have quite depopulated the state had it subsisted upon industry and commerce while the cruel and suspicious dionysius was carrying on his butcheries who that was not detained by his landed property and could have carried along with him any art or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries would have remained exposed to such implacable barbarity the persecutions of philip the ii and lewis the xiv filled all europe with the manufacturers of flanders and of france  i grant that agriculture is the species of industry which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes of people and it is possible that this industry may flourish even where manufactures and other arts are unknown or neglected swisserland is at present a very remarkable instance where we find at once the most skilful husbandmen and the most bungling tradesmen that are to be met with in all europe that agriculture flourished mightily in greece and italy at least in some parts of them and at some periods we have reason to presume and whether the mechanical arts had reached the same degree of perfection may not be esteemed so material especially if we consider the great equality in the ancient republics where each family was obliged to cultivate with the greatest care and industry its own little field in order to its subsistence  but is it just reasoning because agriculture may in some instances flourish without trade or manufactures to conclude that in any great extent of country and for any great tract of time it would subsist alone the most natural way surely of encouraging husbandry is first to excite other kinds of industry and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment this method is infallible and universal and as it prevails more in modern governments than in the ancient it affords a presumption of the superior populousness of the former  every man says xenophon oecon may be a farmer no art or skill is requisite all consists in the industry and attention to the execution a strong proof as columella hints that agriculture was but little known in the age of xenophon  all our latter improvements and refinements have they operated nothing toward the easy subsistence of men and consequently toward their propagation and increase our superior skill in mechanics the discovery of new worlds by which commerce has been so much enlarged the establishment of posts and the use of bills of exchange these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art industry and populousness were we to strike off these what a check would we give to every kind of business and labor and what multitudes of families would immediately perish from want and hunger and it seems not probable that we could supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution  have we reason to think that the police of ancient states was any way comparable to that of modern or that men had then equal security either at home or in their journeys by land or water i question not but every impartial examiner would give us the preference in this particular see essays moral and political essay xv   thus upon comparing the whole it seems impossible to assign any just reason why the world should have been more populous in ancient than in modern times the equality of property amongst the ancients liberty and the small divisions of their states were indeed favorable to the propagation of mankind but their wars were more bloody and destructive their governments more factious and unsettld commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing and the general police more loose and irregular these latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient counterbalance to the former advantages and rather favor the opposite opinion to that which commonly prevails with regard to this subject  but there is no reasoning it may be said against matter of fact if it appear that the world was then more populous than at present we may be assured that our conjectures are false and that we have overlooked some material circumstance in the comparison this i readily own all our preceding reasonings i acknowledge to be mere trifling or at least small skirmishes and frivolous rencounters that decide nothing but unluckily the main combat where we compare facts cannot be rendered much more decisive the facts delivered by ancient authors are either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing decisive in this matter how indeed could it be otherwise the very facts which we must oppose to them in computing the greatness of modern states are far from being either certain or complete many grounds of calculation proceeded on by celebrated writers are little better than those of the emperor heliogabalus who formed an estimate of the immense greatness of rome from ten thousand pound weight of cobwebs which had been found in that city aelii lamprid in vita heliog cap      it is to be remarked that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in ancient manuscripts and have been subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text and that for a very obvious reason any alteration in other places commonly affects the sense or grammar and is more readily perceived by the reader and transcriber  few enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any ancient author of good authority so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison  it is probable that there was formerly a good foundation for the numbers of citizens assigned to any free city because they entered for a share of the government and there were exact registers kept of them but as the number of slaves is seldom mentioned this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever with regard to the populousness even of single cities  the first page of thucydides is in my opinion the commencement of real history all preceding narrations are so intermixed with fable that philosophers ought to abandon them in a great measure to the embellishment of poets and orators in general there is more candor and sincerity in ancient historians but less exactness and care than in the moderns our speculative factions especially those of religion throw such an illusion over our minds that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics as a vice or weakness but the commonness of books by means of printing has obliged modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incongruities diodorus siculus is a good writer but it is with pain i see his narration contradict in so many particulars the two most authentic pieces of all greek history viz xenophons expedition and demosthenes orations plutarch and appian seem scarce ever to have read ciceros epistles   with regard to remote times the numbers of people assigned are often ridiculous and lose all credit and authority the free citizens of sybaris able to bear arms and actually drawn out in battle were  00000 they encountered at siagra with  00000 citizens of crotona another greek city contiguous to them and were defeated this is diodorus siculuss lib    account and is very seriously insisted on by that historian strabo lib   also mentions the same number of sybarites  diodorus siculus lib     enumerating the inhabitants of agrigentum when it was destroyed by the carthaginians says that they amounted to  0000 citizens  00000 strangers besides slaves who in so opulent a city as he represents it would probably be at least as numerous we must remark that the women and the children are not included and that therefore upon the whole the city must contain near two millions of inhabitants diagenes laertius in vita empedoclis says that agrigentum contained only  00000 inhabitants and what was the reason of so immense an increase they were very industrious in cultivating the neighboring fields not exceeding a small english county and they traded with their wine and oil to africa which at that time had none of these commodities  ptolemy says theocritus idyll     commands       cities i suppose the singularity of the number was the reason of assigning it diodorus siculus lib   gives three millions of inhabitants to egypt a very small number but then he makes the number of their cities amount to   000 an evident contradiction  he says id ibid  the people were formerly seven millions thus remote times are always most envied and admired  that xerxess army was extremely numerous i can readily believe both from the great extent of his empire and from the foolish practice of the eastern nations of encumbering their camp with a superfluous multitude but will any reasonable man cite herodotuss wonderful narrations as an authority there is something very rational i own in lysiass orat funebris argument upon this subject had not xerxess army been incredibly numerous says he he had never made a bridge over the hellespont it had been much easier to have transported his men over so short a passage with the numerous shipping he was master of  polybius lib   says that the romans betwixt the first and second punic wars being threatened with an invasion from the gauls mustered all their own forces and those of their allies and found them amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear arms a great number surely and which when joined to the slaves is probably more than that extent of country affords at present the country that supplied this number was not above a third of italy viz the popes dominions tuscany and a part of the kingdom of naples the enumeration too seems to have been made with some exactness and polybius gives us the detail of the particulars but might not the number be magnified in order to encourage the people  diodorus siculus lib   makes the same enumeration amount to near a million these variations are suspicious he plainly too supposes that italy in his time was not so populous another very suspicious circumstance for who can believe that the inhabitants of that country diminished from the time of the first punic war to that of the triumvirates  julius caesar according to appian celtica  encountered four millions of gauls killed one million and took another prisoner plutarch in vita caes makes the number that caesar fought with amount only to   millions julian in caesarihus to    supposing the numbers of the enemys army and of the killed could be exactly assigned which never is possible how could it be known how often the same man returned into the armies or how distinguish the new from the old levied soldiers no attention ought ever to be given to such loose exaggerated calculations especially where the author tells us not the mediums upon which the calculations were formed  paterculus lib   cap    makes the number killed by caesar amount only to  00000 a much more probable account and more easily reconciled to the history of these wars given by that conqueror himself in his commentaries  one would imagine that every circumstance of the life and actions of dionysius the elder might be regarded as authentic and free from all fabulous exaggerations both because he lived at a time when letters flourished most in greece and because his chief historian was philistus a man allowed to be of great genius and who was a courtier and minister of that prince but can we admit that he had a standing army of  00000 foot  0000 horse and a fleet of  00 galleys diod sic lib   these we may observe were mercenary forces and subsisted upon their pay like our armies in europe for the citizens were all disarmed and when dion afterward invaded sicily and called on his countrymen to vindicate their liberty he was obliged to bring arms along with him which he distributed among those who joined him plutarch in vita dionis in a state where agriculture alone flourishes there may be many inhabitants and if these be all armed and disciplined a great force may be called out upon occasion but great numbers of mercenary troops can never be maintained without either trade and manufactures or very extensive dominions the united provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land as that which is said to belong to dionysius yet they possess as large a territory perfectly well cultivated and have infinitely more resources from their commerce and industry diodorus siculus allows that even in his time the army of dionysius appeared incredible that is as i interpret it it was entirely a fiction and the opinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himself  the critical art may very justly be suspected of temerity when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of ancient historians by any probable or analogical reasonings yet the license of authors upon all subjects particularly with regard to numbers is so great that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve whenever the facts advanced depart in the least from the common bounds of nature and experience i shall give an instance with regard to modern history sir william temple tells us in his memoirs that having a free conversation with charles the ii he took the opportunity of representing to that monarch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of france chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people the romans says he were forced to keep up    legions for that purpose a great absurdity strabo lib   says that one legion would be sufficient with a few cavalry but the romans commonly kept up somewhat a greater force in this island which they never took pains entirely to subdue  and cromwell left an army of near eighty thousand men must not this last fact be regarded as unquestioned by future critics when they find it asserted by a wise and learned minister of state contemporary to the fact and who addressed his discourse upon an ungrateful subject to a great monarch who was also contemporary and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before yet by the most undoubted authority we may insist that cromwells army when he died did not amount to half the number here mentioned  it is a very usual fallacy to consider all the ages of antiquity as one period and to compute the numbers contained in the great cities mentioned by ancient authors as if these cities had been all contemporary the greek colonies flourished extremely in sicily during the age of alexander but in augustuss time they were so decayed that almost all the product of that fertile island was consumed in italy strabo lib     let us now examine the numbers of inhabitants assigned to particular cities in antiquity and omitting the numbers of nineveh babylon and the egyptian thebes let us confine ourselves to the sphere of real history to the grecian and roman empires i must own the more i consider this subject the more am i inclined to skepticism with regard to the great populousness ascribed to ancient times  athens is said by apolog socr plato to be a very great city and it was surely the greatest of all the greek argos seems also to have been a great city for lysias contents himself with saying that it did not exceed athens orat    cities excepting syracuse which was nearly about the same size in thucydidess lib   see also plutarch in vita niciae time and afterward increased beyond it for cicero orat contra verrem lib   cap    strabo lib   says it was    miles in compass but then we are to consider that it contained two harbors within it one of which was a very large one and might be regarded as a kind of bay mentions it as the greatest of all the greek cities in his time not comprehending i suppose either antioch or alexandria under that denomination athenaeus lib   cap  0 says that by the enumeration of demetrius phalereus there were in athens   000 citizens  0000 strangers and  00000 slaves this number is very much insisted on by those whose opinion i call in question and is esteemed a fundamental fact to their purpose but in my opinion there is no point of criticism more certain than that athenaeus and ctesicles whom he cites are here mistaken and that the number of slaves is augmented by a whole cipher and ought not to be regarded as more than  0000  first when the number of citizens is said to be   000 by athenaeus demosthenes assigns  0000 contra aristog men of full age are only understood for   herodotus lib   says that aristagoras ambassador from the ionians found it harder to deceive one spartan than  0000 athenians meaning in a loose way the whole state supposed in one popular assembly excluding the women and children   thucydides lib   says that making allowances for all the absentees in the fleet army garrisons and for people employed in their private affairs the athenian assembly never rose to five thousand   the forces enumerated by the same historian lib   diodorus siculuss account perfectly agrees lib     being all citizens and amounting to   000 heavy armed infantry prove the same method of calculation as also the whole tenor of the greek historians who always understand men of full age when they assign the number of citizens in any republic now these being but the fourth of the inhabitants the free athenians were by this account   000 the strangers  0000 and the slaves calculating by the smaller number and allowing that they married and propagated at the same rate with freemen were   0000 and the whole inhabitants    000 a large enough number surely the other number    0000 makes athens larger than london and paris united  secondly there were but  0000 houses in athens xenopbon mem lib     thirdly though the extent of the walls as given us by thucydides be great lib   viz    miles beside the seacoast yet xenophon de ratione red says there was much waste ground within the walls they seem indeed to have joined four distinct and separate cities we are to observe that when dionysius halycarnassaeus says that if we regard the ancient walls of rome the extent of the city will not appear greater than that of athens he must mean the acropolis or high town only no ancient author ever speaks of the piraeum phalerus and micnychia as the same with athens much less can it be supposed that dionysius would consider the matter in that light after the walls of cimon and pericles were destroyed and athens was entirely separated from these other towns this observation destroys all vossiuss reasonings and introduces common sense into these calculations   fourthly no insurrection of the slaves or suspicion of insurrection ever mentioned by historians except one commotion of the miners athen lib     fifthly the athenians treatment of their slaves is said by xenophon de rep athen and demosthenes philip   and plautus sticho to have been extremely gentle and indulgent which could never have been the case had the disproportion been twenty to one the disproportion is not so great in any of our colonies and yet we are obliged to exercise a very rigorous military government over the negroes  sixthly no man is ever esteemed rich for possessing what may be reckoned an equal distribution of property in any country or even triple or quadruple that wealth thus every person in england is computed by some to spend six pence a day yet is he esteemed but poor that has five times that sum now timarchus is said by aeschines contra timarch to have been left in easy circumstances but he was master only of  0 slaves employed in manufactures lysias and his brother two strangers were proscribed by the thirty for their great riches though they had but  0 a piece orat    demosthenes was left very rich by his father yet he had no more than    slaves contra aphob his workhouse of  0 cabinet makers is said to be a very considerable manufactory ibid   seventhly during the decelian war as the greek historians call it  0000 slaves deserted and brought brought the athenians to great distress as we learn from thucydides lib   this could not have happened had they been only the twentieth part the best slaves would not desert  eighthly xenophon de rat red proposes a scheme for entertaining by the public  0000 slaves and that so great a number may possibly be supported any one will be convinced says he who considers the numbers we had before the decelian war a way of speaking altogether incompatible with the larger number of athenaeus  ninthly the whole census of the state of athens was less than  000 talents and though numbers in ancient manuscripts be often suspected by critics yet this is unexceptionable both because demosthenes de classibus who gives it gives also the detail which checks him and because polybius lib   cap    assigns the same number and reasons upon it now the most vulgar slave could yield by his labor an obolus a day over and above his maintenance as we learn from xenophon de rat red who says that niciass overfeer paid his master so much for slaves whom he employed in digging of mines and also kept up the number of slaves if you will take the pains to estimate an obolus a day and the slaves at  00000 computing only at   years purchase you will find the sum above   000 talents even though allowance be made for the great number of holy days in athens besides many of the slaves would have a much greater value from their art the lowest that demosthenes contra aphobum estimates any of his fathers slaves is two minas ahead and upon this supposition it is a little difficult i confess to reconcile even the number of  0000 slaves with the census of  000 talents  tenthly chios is said by thucydides lib   to contain more slaves than any greek city except sparta sparta then had more than athens in proportion to the number of citizens the spartans were  000 in the town  0000 in the country plutarch in vita lycurg the male slaves then of full age must have been more than   0000 the whole more than    0000 a number impossible to be maintained in a narrow barren country such as laconia which had no trade had the helotes been so very numerous the murder of  000 mentioned by thucydides lib   would have irritated them without weakening them  besides we are to consider that the number assigned by athenaeus the same author affirms that corinth had once   0000 slaves aegina   0000 but the foregoing arguments hold strongagainst these facts it is however remarkable that athenaeus cites so great an authority as aristotle for this last fact and the scholiast on pindar mentions the same number of slaves in aegina whatever it is comprehends all the inhabitants of attica as well as those of athens the athenians affected much a couner try life as we learn from thucydides lib   and when they were all chased into town by the invasion of their territory during the peloponnesian war the city was not able to contain them and they were obliged to lie in the porticos temples and even streets for want of lodging id ibid   the same remark is to be extended to all the other greek cities and when the number of the citizens is assigned we must always understand it of the inhabitants of the neighboring country as well as of the city yet even with this allowance it must be confessed that greece was a populous country and much exceeded what we could imagine of so narrow a territory naturally not very fertile and which drew no supplies of corn from other places for excepting athens which traded to pontus for that commodity the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly from their neighboring territory demost contra lept the athenians brought yearly from pontus  00000 medimni or bushels of corn as appeared from the customhouse books and at that time they imported little corn from any other place this by the bye is a strong proof that there is some great mistake in the foregoing passage of athenaeus for attica itself was so barren in corn that it produced not enough even to maintain the peasants tit livii lib    cap   lucian in his navigium sive vota says that a ship which by the dimensions he gives seems to have been about the size of our third rates carried as much corn as would maintain all attica for a twelvemonth but perhaps athens was decayed at that time and besides it is not safe to trust such loose rhetorical calculations   rhodes is well known to have been a city of extensive commerce and of great fame and splendour yet it contained only  000 citizens able to bear arms when it was besieged by demetrius diod sic lib  0   thebes was always one of the capital cities of greece isoc paneg but the number of its citizens exceeded not those of rhodes diod sic lib    and    phliasia is said to be a small city by xenophon hist graec lib   yet we find that it contained  000 citizens id lib   i pretend not to reconcile these two facts  mantinaea was equal to any city in arcadia polyb lib   consequently it was equal to megalopolis which was  0 stadia or   miles and a quarter in circumference polyb lib   cap  0 but mantinaea had only  000 citizens lysias orat    the greek cities therefore contained often fields and gardens along with the houses and we cannot judge of them by the extent of their walls athens contained no more than  0000 houses yet its walls with the sea coast were above  0 miles in extent syracuse was    miles in circumference yet was scarce ever spoke of by the ancients as more populous than athens babylon was a square of    miles or  0 miles in circuit but it contained large cultivated fields and enclosures as we learn from pliny though aurelians wall was  0 miles in circumference vopiscus in vita aurel the circuit of all the    divisions of rome taken apart according to publius victor was only about    miles when an enemy invaded the country the whole inhabitants retired within the walls of the ancient cities along with their cattle and furniture and instruments of husbandry and the great height to which the walls were raised enabled a small number to defend them with facility  sparta says xenophon de rep laced this passage is not easily reconciled with that of plutarch above who says that sparta had  000 citizens is one of the cities of greece that has the fewest inhabitants yet polybius polyb lib   cap  0 says it was    stadia in circumference and was round  all the aetolians able to bear arms in antipaters time were but ten thousand men diod sic lib      polybius legate tells us that the achaean league might without any inconvenience march  0 or  0000 men and this account seems very probable for that league comprehended the greatest part of peloponnesus yet pausanias in achaicis speaking of the same period says that all the achaeans able to bear arms even when several manumitted slaves were joined to them did not amount to fifteen thousand  the thessalians till their final conquest by the romans were in all ages turbulent factious seditious disorderly tit live lib    cap    plato in critone it is not therefore natural to suppose that that part of greece abounded much in people  the whole inhabitants of epirus of all ages sexes and conditions who were sold by paulus aemilius amounted only to   0000 tit live lib    cap    yet epirus might be double the extent of yorkshire a late trench writer in his observations on the greeks has remarked that philip of macedon being declared captain general of the greeks would have been backed by the force of   0000 of that nation in his intended expedition against persia this number comprehends i suppose all the free citizens throughout all the cities but the authority on which that computation is founded has i own escaped either my memory or reading and that writer though otherwise very ingenious has given into a bad practice of delivering a great deal of erudition without one citation but supposing that that enumeration could be justified by good authority from antiquity we may establish the following computation the free greeks of all ages and sexes were   0000 the slaves computing them by the number of athenian slaves as above who seldom married or had families were double the male citizens of full age viz   0000 and the whole inhabitants of ancient greece about one million three hundred and eighty thousand no mighty number nor much exceeding what may be found at present in scotland a country of nearly the same extent and which is very indifferently peopled   we may now consider the numbers of people in rome and italy and collect all the lights afforded us by scattered passages in ancient authors we shall find upon the whole a great difficulty in fixing any opinion on that head and no reason to support those exaggerated calculations so much insisted on by modern writers  dionysius halycarnasseus lib   says that the ancient walls of rome were nearly of the same compass with those of athens but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent and it was difficult to tell where the town ended or the country begun in some places of rome it appears from the same author lib  0 from juvenal satyr   l       0 and from other ancient writers strabo lib   says that the emperor augustus prohibited the raising houses higher than  0 foot in another passage lib    he speaks of the houses of rome as remarkably high see also to the same purpose vitruvius lib   cap   aristides the sophist in his oration  says that rome consisted of cities on the the top of cities and that if one were to spread it out and unfold it it would cover the whole surface of italy where an author indulges himself in such extravagant declamations and gives so much into the hyperbolical style one knows not how far he must be reduced but this reasoning seems natural if rome was built in so scattered a manner as dionysius says and ran so much into the country there must have been very few streets where the houses were raised so high it is onlyf or want of ground that any body builds in that inconvenient manner that the houses were high and families lived in separate stories one above another but it is probable these were only the poorer citizens and only in some few streets if we may judge from the younger plinys lib   epist    lib   epist   it is true pliny there describes a country house but since that was the idea the ancients formed of a magnificent and convenient building the great men would certainly build the same way in town in laxitatem ruris excurrunt says seneca of the rich and voluptuous epist     valerius maximus lib   cap   speaking of cincinnatuss field of   acres says anguste se habitare nunc putat cujus domus tantum patet quantum cincinnati rura patuerant to the same purpose see lib    cap    also lib    cap   account of his house and from bartolis plans of ancient buildings the men of quality had very spacious palaces and their buildings were like the chinese houses at this day where each apartment is separate from the rest and rises no higher than a single story to which if we add that the roman nobility much affected very extensive porticos and even woods vitruv lib   cap    tacit annal lib    cap   sucton in vita octav cap    etc in town we may perhaps allow vossius though there is no manner of reason for it to read the famous passage of the elder pliny moenia ejus romae collegere ambitu imperatoribus censoribusque vespasianis a u c     pass xiii mcc complexa montes septem ipsa dividitur in regiones quatuordecim compita earum     ejusdem spatii mensura currente a milliario in capite romans fori statuto ad singulas portas quae sunt body numero    ita ut duodecim portae semel numerentur praetereanturque ex veteribus septem quae esse desierunt efficit passuum per directum  0    ad extrema vero tectorum cum castris praetoriis ab eodem milliario per vicos omnium viarum mensura collegit paulo amplius septuaginta millia passuum quo si quis altitudinem tectorum addat dignam profecto aestimationem concipiat fateaturque nullius urbis magnitudinem in toto orb potuisse ei comparari plin lib   cap    all the best manuscripts of pliny read the passage as here cited and fix the compass of the walls of rome to be    miles the only question is what pliny means by  0    paces and how that number was formed the manner in which i conceive it is this rome was a semicircular area of    miles circumference the forum and consequently the milliarium we know was situated on the banks of the tyber and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the semicircular area though there were    gates to rome yet only twelve of them had straight streets leading from them to the milliarium pliny therefore having assigned the circumference of rome and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give in a just notion of its surface uses this farther method he supposes all the streets leading from the milliarium to the    gates to be laid together into one straight line and supposes we run along that line so as to count each gate once in which case he says that the whole line is  0    paces or in other words that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half and the whole length of rome is   miles and its breadth about half as much beside the scattered suburbs  pere hardouin understands this passage in the same manner with regard to the laying together the several streets of rome into one line in order to compose  0    paces but then he supposes that streets led from the milliarium to every gate and that no street exceeded  00 paces in length but   a semicircular area whose radius was only  00 paces could never have a circumference near    miles the compass of rome as assigned by pliny a radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference   there is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference these streets must interfere as they approach   this diminishes too much from the greatness of ancient rome and reduces that city below even bristol or rotterdam  the sense which vossius in his observationes variae puts on this passage of pliny errs widely in the other extreme one manuscript of no authority instead of    miles has assigned  0 miles for the compass of the walls of rome and vossius understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference supposing that as the tyber formed the diameter there were no walls built on that side but   this reading is allowed contrary to almost all the manuscripts   why should pliny a concise writer repeat the compass of the walls of rome in two successive sentences   why repeat it with so sensible a variation   what is the meaning of plinys mentioning twice the milliarium if a line was measured that had no dependence on the milliarium   aurelians wall is said by vopiscus to have been drawn laxiore ambitu and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the northside of the tyber yet its compass was only  0 miles and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text it is not probable that rome would diminish from augustus to aurelian it remained still the capital of the same empire and none of the civil wars in that long period except the tumults on the death of maximus and balbinus ever affected the city caracalla is said by aurelius victor to have increased rome   there are no remains of ancient buildings which mark any such greatness of rome vossiuss reply to this objection seems absurd that the rubbish would sink  0 or  0 foot below ground it appears from spartian in vita severi that the five mile stone in via lavicana was out of the city   olympiodorus and publius victor fix the number of houses in rome to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand   the very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic as well as lipsius if they be necessary destroys the foundation on which they are grounded that rome contained    millions of inhabitants while the whole kingdom of france contains only five according to his computation etc  the only objection to the sense which we have affixed above to the passage of pliny seems to lie in this that pliny after mentioning the    gates of rome assigns only a reason for suppressing the seven old ones and says nothing of the    gates the streets leading from which terminated according to my opinion before they reached the forum but as pliny was writing to the romans who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets it is not strange he should take a circumstance for granted which was so familiar to every body perhaps too many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river   his own way without admitting own way without admitting the extravagant consequences he draws from it  the number of citizens who received corn by the public distribution in augustuss time ex monument ancyr were  00000 this one would esteem a pretty certain ground of calculation yet is it attended with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and uncertainty  did the poorer citizens only receive the distribution it was calculated to be sure chiefly for their benefit but it appears from a passage of cicero tusc quaest lib   cap    that the rich might also take their portion and that it was esteemed no reproach in them to apply for it  to whom was the corn given whether only to heads of families or to every man woman and child the portion every month was five modii to each licinius apud sallust hist frag lib   about of a bushel this was too little for a family and too much for an individual a very accurate antiquarian nicolaus hortensius de re frumentaria roman therefore infers that it was given to every man of full years but he allows the matter to be uncertain  was it strictly inquired whether the claimant lived within the precincts of rome or was it sufficient that he presented himself at the monthly distribution this last seems more probable not to take the people too much from their business augustus ordained the distribution of corn to be made only thrice a year but the people finding the monthly distributions more convenient as preserving i suppose a more regular economy in their family desired to have them restored sucton august cap  0 had not some of the people come from some distance for their corn augustuss precaution seems superfluous   were there no false claimants we are told sueton in jul cap    that caesar struck off at once   0000 who had crept in without a just title and it is very little probable that he remedied all abuses  but lastly what proportion of slaves must we assign to these citizens this is the most material question and the most uncertain it is very doubtful whether athens can be established as a rule for rome perhaps the athenians had more slaves because they employed them in manufactures for which a capital city like rome seems not so proper perhaps on the other hand the romans had more slaves on account of their superior luxury and riches  there were exact bills of mortality kept in rome but no ancient author has given us the number of burials except suetonius in vita neronis who tells us that in one season there were  0000 names carried to the temple of libitina but this was during a plague which can afford no certain foundation for any inference  the public corn though distributed only to  00000 citizens affected very considerably the whole agriculture of italy lib   cap   a fact no way reconcilable to some modern exaggerations with regard to the inhabitants of that country  the best ground of conjecture i can find concerning the greatness of ancient rome is this we are told by herodian sueton aug cap    that antioch and alexandria were very little inferior to rome it appears from diodorus siculus lib    that one straight street of alexandria reaching from port to port was five miles long and as alexandria was much more extended in length than breadth it seems to have been a city nearly of the bulk of paris quintus curtius says its walls were only ten miles in circumference when founded by alexander lib   cap   strabo who had traveled to alexandria as well as diodorus siculus says it was scarce four miles long and in most places about a mile broad lib    pliny says it resembled a macedonian cassock stretching out in the corners lib   cap  0 notwithstanding this bulk of alexandria which seems but moderate diodorus siculus speaking of its circuit as drawn by alexander which it never exceeded as we learn from ammianus marcellinus lib    cap    says it was  extremely great ibid the reason which he assigns for its surpassing all cities of the world for he excepts not rome is that it contained  00000 free inhabitants he also mentions the revenues of the kings viz  000 as another circumstance to the same purpose no such mighty sum in our eyes even though we make allowances for the different value of money what strabo says of the neighboring country means only that it was well peopled  might not one affirm without any great hyperbole that the whole banks of the river from gravesend to windsor are one city this is more than strabo says of the banks of the lake mareotis and of the canal to canopus it is a vulgar saying in italy that the king of sardinia has but one town in piedmont for it is all a town agrippa in josephus de bello judaic lib   cap    to make his audience comprehend the excessive greatness of alexandria which he endeavors to magnify describes only the compass of the city as drawn by alexander a clear proof that the bulk of the inhabitants were lodged there and that the neighboring country was no more than what might be expected about all great towns very well cultivated and well peopled and rome might be about the size of london  there lived in alexandria in diodorus siculuss time lib     00000 free people comprehending i suppose women and children he says  not  which must have been understood of citizens alone and grown men but what number of slaves had we any just ground to fix these at an equal number with the free inhabitants it would favor the foregoing calculation  there is a passage in herodian which is a little surprising he says positively and plainly that the palace of the emperor was as large as all the rest of the city lie   cap i  politian interprets it aedibus majoribus etiam reliqua urbe this was neros golden house which is indeed represented by suetonius he says in nerone cap  0 that a portico or piazza of it was  000 feet long tanta laxitas ut porticus triplices milliarias haberet he cannot mean three miles for the whole extent of the house from the palatine to the esquiline was not near so great so when vopisc in aureliano mentions a portico in sallusts gardens which he calls porticus milliarensis it must be understood of a thousand feet so also horace nulla decempedis metata privatis opacam porticus excipiebat arcton lib   ode    so also in lib   satyr    mill pedes in front trecentos cippus in agrum hic dabat   and pliny lie    cap    bis vidimus urbem totam cingi domibus principum caii ac neronis as of an enormous extent but no power of imagination can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to such a city as london  we may observe had the historian been relating neros extravagance and had he made use of such an expression it would have had much less weight these rhetorical exaggerations being so apt to creep into an authors style even when the most chaste and correct but it is mentioned by herodian only by the bye in relating the quarrels betwixt geta and caracalla  it appears from the same historian lib   cap    that there was then much land uncultivated and put to no manner of use and he ascribes it as a great praise to pertinax that he allowed every one to take such land either in italy or elsewhere and cultivate it as he pleased without paying any taxes lands uncultivated and put to no manner of use this is not heard of in any part of christendom except perhaps in some remote parts of hungary as i have been informed and it surely corresponds very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity so much insisted on  we learn from vopiscus in aurelian cap    that there was in etruria much fertile land uncultivated which the emperor aurelian intended to convert into vineyards in order to furnish the roman people with a gratuitous distribution of wine a very proper expedient to dispeople still farther that capital and all the neighboring territories  it may not be amiss to take notice of the account which polybius lib    cap   gives of the great herds of swine to be met with in tuscany and lombardy as well as in greece and of the method of feeding them which was then practiced there are great herds of swine says he throughout all italy particularly in former times through etruria and cisalpine gaul and a herd frequently contains a thousand or more swine when one of these herds in feeding meets with another they mix together and the swineherds have no other expedients to separate them than to go to different quarters where they sound their horn and these animals being accustomed to that signal run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper whereas in greece if the herds of swine happen to mix in the forests he who has the greatest flock takes cunningly the opportunity of driving all away and thieves are very apt to purloin the straggling hogs which have wandered to a great distance from their keeper in search of food  may we not infer from this account that the north of italy was then much less peopled and worse cultivated than at present how could these vast herds be fed in a country so thick of enclosures so improved by agriculture so divided by farms so planted with vines and corn intermingled together i must confess that polybiuss relation has more the air of that economy which is to be met with in our american colonies than the management of an european country  we meet with a reflection in aristotles lie   cap  0 his expression is  not  inhabitant not citizen ethics which seems to me unaccountable on any supposition and by proving too much in favor of our present reasoning may be thought really to prove nothing that philosopher treating of friendship and observing that that relation ought neither to be contracted to a very few nor extended over a great multitude illustrates his opinion by the following argument in like manner says he as a city cannot subsist if it either have so few inhabitants as ten or so many as a hundred thousand so is there a mediocrity required in the number of friends and you destroy the essence of friendship by running into either extreme what impossible that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants had aristotle never seen nor heard of a city that was near so populous this i must own passes my comprehension  pliny lie   cap    tells us that seleucia the seat of the greek empire in the east was reported to contain  00000 people carthage is said by strabo lie    to have contained  00000 the inhabitants of pekin are not much more numerous london paris and constantinople may admit of nearly the same computation at least the two latter cities do not exceed it rome alexandria antioch we have already spoke of from the experience of past and present ages one might conjecture that there is a kind of impossibility in the nature of things that any city could ever rise much beyond this proportion whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire there seem to be invincible obstacles which prevent its farther progress the seats of vast monarchies by introducing extravagant luxury irregular expense idleness dependence and false ideas of rank and superiority are improper for commerce extensive commerce checks itself by raising the price of all labor and commodities when a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility possessed of overgrown fortunes the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns where they can make a figure on a moderate income and if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size there necessarily arise many capitals in the remoter provinces whither all the inhabitants except a few courtiers repair for education fortune and amusement such were alexandria anticob carthage ephesus lions etc in the roman empire such are even bourdeaux toulouse dijon rennes rouen aix etc in france dublin edinburgh york in the british dominions london by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire has perhaps arrived at a greatness which no city will ever be able to exceed  choose dover or calais for a center draw a circle of two hundred miles radius you comprehend london paris the netherlands the united provinces and some of the best cultivated counties of france and england it may safely i think be affirmed that no spot of ground can be found in antiquity of equal extent which contained near so many great and populous cities and was so stockt with riches and inhabitants to balance in both periods the states which possessed most art knowledge civility and the best police seems the truest method of comparison  it is an observation of labbe du bos vol   sect    that italy is warmer at present than it was in ancient times the annals of rome tell us says he that in the year   0 ab u c the winter was so severe that it destroyed the trees the tyber froze in rome and the ground was covered with snow for forty days when juvenal sat   describes a superstitious woman he represents her as breaking the ice of the tyber that she may perform her ablutions  hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem ter matutino tyberi mergetur he speaks of that rivers freezing as a common event many passages of horace suppose the streets of rome full of snow and ice we should have more certainty with regard to this point had the ancients known the use of thermometers but their writers without intending it give us information sufficient to convince us that the winters are now much more temperate at rome than formerly at present the tyber no more freezes at rome than the nile at cairo the romans esteem the winter very rigorous if the snow lies two days and if one sees for eight and forty hours a few small icicles hang from a fountain that has a north exposition  the observation of this ingenious critic may be extended to other european climates who could discover the mild climate of france in diodorus siculuss lib   description of gaul as it is a northern climate says he it is infested with cold to an extreme degree in cloudy weather instead of rain there fall great snows and in clear weather it there freezes so excessive hard that the rivers acquire bridges of their own substance over which not only single travelers may pass but large armies accompanied with all their baggage and loaded wagons and there being many rivers in gaul the rhone the rhine etc almost all of them are froze over and it is usual in order to prevent falling to cover the ice with chaff and straw at the places where the road passes  north of the cevennes says strabo lib   gaul produces not figs and olives and the vines that have been planted bear not grapes that will ripen  ovid positively maintains with all the serious affirmation of prose that the euxine sea froze every winter in his time and he appeals to roman governors whom he names for the truth of his assertion trist lib   eleg   de ponto lib   eleg      0 this never happens at present in the latitude of tomi whither ovid was banished all the complaints of the same poet seem to mark a rigor of the seasons which is scarce experienced at present in petersburg or stockholm  tournefort a provencal who had traveled into the same countries observes that there is not a finer climate in the world and he asserts that nothing but ovids melancholy could have given him such dismal ideas of it but the facts mentioned by that poet are too circumstantiate to bear any such interpretation  polybius lib   cap    says that the climate in arcadia was very cold and the air moist  italy lib   cap   says varro is the most temperate climate in europe the inland parts gaul germany and pannonio no doubt have almost perpetual winter  the northern parts of spain according to strabo lib   are but ill inhabited because of the great cold  allowing therefore this remark to be just that europe is become warmer than formerly how can we account for it plainly by no other method but by supposing that the land is at present much better cultivated and that the woods are cleared which formerly threw a shade upon the earth and kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to it our northern colonies in america become more temperate in proportion as the woods are felled the warm southern also become more healthful and it is remarkable that in the spanish histories of the first discovery and conquest of these countries they appear to have been very healthful being then well peopled and cultivated no account of the sickness or decay of cortess or pizzarros small armies but in general every one may remark that cold still makes itself much more severely felt both in north and south america than in places under the same latitude in europe  saserna cited by columella lib   cap   affirmed that the disposition of the heavens was altered before his time  nd that the air had become much milder and warmer as appears hence says he that many places now abound with vineyards and olive plantations which formerly by reason of the rigor of the climate could raise none of these productions such a change if real will be allowed an evident sign of the better cultivation and peopling of countries before the age of saserna he seems to have lived about the time of the younger africanus id ib and if it be continued to the present times is a proof that these advantages have been continually increasing throughout this part of the world  let us now cast our eye over all the countries that were the scene of ancient and modern history and compare their past and present situation we shall not perhaps find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world egypt is represented by maillet to whom we owe the best account of it as extremely populous though he esteems the number of its inhabitants to be diminished syria and the lesser asia as well as the coast of barbary i can readily own to be very desert in comparison of their ancient condition the depopulation of greece is also very obvious but whether the country now called turkey in europe may not in general contain as many inhabitants as during the flourishing period of greece may be a little doubtful the thracians seem then to have lived like the tartars at present by pasturage and plunder xenoph exp lib   polyb lib   cap    the getes were still more uncivilizd ovid passim etc strabo lib   and the illyrians were no better polyb lib   cap    these occupy nine tenths of that country and though the police and government of the turks be not very favorable to industry and propagation yet it preserves at least peace and order amongst the inhabitants and is preferable to that barbarous unsettled condition in which they anciently lived  poland and muscovy in europe are not very populous but are certainly much more so than the ancient sarmatia and scythia where no husbandry or agriculture was ever heard of and pasturage was the sole art by which the people were maintained the like observation may be extended to denmark and sweden no one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people that formerly came from the north and overran all europe to be any objection to this opinion where a whole nation or even half of it remove their seat it is easy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form with what desperate courage they must make their attacks and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations will make these magnify in their imagination both the courage and multitude of the invaders scotland is neither extensive nor populous but were the half of its inhabitants to seek a new habitation they would form a colony as large as the teutons and cimbri and would shake all europe supposing it in no better a condition for defense than formerly  germany has surely at present twenty times more inhabitants than in ancient times when they cultivated no ground and each tribe valued itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around as we learn from caesar debello gallico lib   and tacitus de moribus germ and strabo lib   a proof that the division into small republics will not alone render a nation populous unless attended with the spirit of peace order and industry  the barbarous condition of britain in former times is well known and the thinness of its inhabitants may easily be conjectured both from their barbarity and from a circumstance mentioned by herodian lib   cap    that all britain was marshy even in severuss time after the romans had been fully settled in it above a whole century  it is not easily imagined that the gauls were anciently much more advanced in the arts of life than their northern neighbors since they traveled to this island for their education in the mysteries of the religion and philosophy of the druids caesar de bello gallico lib   strabo lib   says the gauls were not much more improved than the germans i cannot therefore think that gaul was then near so populous as france is at present  were we to believe indeed and join together the testimony of appian and that of diodorus siculus we must admit an incredible populousness in gaul the former historian celt pars   says that there were  00 nations in that country the latter affirms lib   that the largest of the gallic nations consisted of  00000 men besides women and children and the least of  0000 calculating therefore at a medium we must admit of near  00 millions of people in a country which we esteem populous at present though supposed to contain little more than  0 ancient gaul was more extensive than modern france such calculations therefore by their extravagance lose all manner of authority we may observe that that equality of property to which the populousness of antiquity may be ascribed had no place amongst the gauls caesar de bello gallico lib   their intestine wars also before caesars time were almost perpetual id ibid and strabo lib   observes that though all gaul was cultivated yet it was not cultivated with any skill or care the genius of the inhabitants leading them less to arts than arms till their slavery to rome produced peace among themselves  caesar de bello gallico lib   enumerates very particularly the great forces which were levied in belgium to oppose his conquests and makes them amount to  0 000 these were not the whole people able to bear arms in belgium for the same historian tells us that the bellovaci could have brought a hundred thousand men into the field though they engaged only for sixty taking the whole therefore in this proportion of ten to six the sum of fighting men in all the states of belgium was above half a million the whole inhabitants two millions and belgium being about the fourth of gaul that country might contain eight millions which is not above the third of its present inhabitants it appears from caesars account that the gauls had no domestic slaves the whole common people were indeed a kind of slaves to the nobility as the people of poland are at this day and a nobleman of gaul had sometimes ten thousand clients or dependants of this kind nor can we doubt that the armies were composed of the people as well as of the nobility an army of  00000 noblemen from a very small state is incredible the fighting men amongst the helvetii were the fourth part of the whole inhabitants a clear proof that all the males of military age bore arms see caesar de bello gall lib    we may remark that the numbers in caesars commentaries can be more depended on than those of any other ancient author because of the greek translation which still remains and which checks the original     the ancient helvetia was   0 miles in length and   0 in breadth according to caesar de bello gallico lib   yet contained only   0000 inhabitants the canton of berne alone has at present as many people  after this computation of appian and diodorus siculus i know not if i dare say that the modern dutch are more numerous than the ancient batavi  spain is decayed from what it was three centuries ago but if we step backward two thousand years and consider the restless turbulent unsettld condition of its inhabitants we may probably be inclined to think that it is now much more populous many spaniards killed themselves when deprived of their arms by the romans titi livii lib    cap    it appears from plutarch in vita marii that robbery and plunder were esteemed honorable amongst the spaniards hirtius de bello hisp represents in the same light the situation of that country in caesars time and he says that every man was obliged to live in castles and walled towns for his security twas not till their final conquest under augustus that these disorders were represt vell pater lib   sect  0 the account which strabo lib   and justin lib    give of spain corresponds exactly with those above mentioned how much therefore must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity when we find that cicero comparing italy afric gaul greece and spain mentions the great number of inhabitants as the peculiar circumstance which rendered that latter country formidable nec numero hispanos nec robore galls nec calliditate paenos nec artibus graeces nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis ac terrae domestico nativoque sensu italos ipsos ac latins   superavimus de harusp resp cap   the disorders of spain seem to have been almost proverbial nec impacatos a tego horrebis iberos virg georg lib   the iberi are here plainly taken by a poetical figure for robbers in general   italy it is probable however has decayed but how many great cities does it still contain venice genoa pavia turin milan naples florence leghorn which either subsisted not in ancient times or were then very inconsiderable if we reflect on this we shall not be apt to carry matters to so great an extreme as usual with regard to this subject  when the roman authors complain that italy which formerly exported corn became dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread they never ascribe this alteration to the increase of its inhabitants but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture varro de re rustica lib   praef columella praef suston august cap    a natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing corn in order to distribute it gratis among the roman citizens and a very bad means of multiplying the inhabitants of any country though the observation of labbe du bos should be admitted that italy is now warmer than in former times the consequence may not be necessary that it is more populous or better cultivated if the other countries of europe were more savage and woody the cold winds that blowed from them might affect the climate of italy the sportula so much talked of by martial and juvenal being presents regularly made by the great lords to their smaller clients must have had a like tendency to produce idleness debauchery and a continual decay amongst the people  were i to assign a period when i imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present i should pitch upon the age of trajan and the antonines the great extent of the roman empire being then civilized and cultivated settled almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic and living under the same regular police and government the inhabitants of marseilles lost not their great superiority ever the gauls in commerce and the mechanic arts till the roman dominion turned the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life see strabo lib   that author in several places repeats the observation concerning the improvement arising from the roman arts and civility and he lived at the time when the change was new and would be more sensible so also pliny quis exim non communicato orb terrarum majestate romani imperii profecisse vitam putet commercio rerum ac societate festae pacis omniaque exam quae acculta antea fuerant in promiscuousu facta lib    proem numine deum electa speaking of italy quae caelum ipsum clarius faceret sparsa congregaret imperia ritusque moiliret ct tot populorum discordes ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraberet ad colloquia et humanitatem homini daret breviterque una cunctarum gentium in toto orb patria fieret lib   cap   nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from tertullian who lived about the age of severus cere quidem ipse orbis in promptu est culticr de die et instructior pristino omnia jam pervia omnia nota omnia negotiosa solitudines famosas retro fandi amaenissimi obliteraverunt silvas arva domuerunt feras pecora fugaverant arenae seruntur saxa panguntur paludes cliquantur tantae urbes quantae non casae quendam jam nec insulae horrent

querelae apud omnes dum jane nos natura non sustinet de anima cap  0 the air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage diminishes somewhat from its authority but does not entirely destory it a man of violent imagination such as tertullian augments every thing equally and for that reason his comparative judgments are the most to be depended on the same remark may be extended to the following passage of aristides the sophist who lived in the age of adrian the whole world says he addressing himself to the romans seems to keep one holiday and mankind laying aside the swords they formerly wore now betake themselves to feasting and to joy the cities forgetting their ancient contentions preserve only one emulation which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament theaters every where arise amphitheatres porticos aqueducts temples schools academies and one may safely pronounce that the sinking world has been again raised by your auspicious empire nor have cities alone received an increase of ornament and beauty but the whole earth like a garden or paradise is cultivated and adorned insomuch that such of mankind as are placed out of the limits of your empire who are but few seem to merit our simpathy and compassion  it is remarkable that though diodorus siculus makes the whole inhabitants of egypt when conquered by the romans amount only to three millions yet josephus de bello jud lib   cap    says that its inhabitants excluding those of alexandria were seven millions and a half in the reign of nero and he expressly says that he drew this account from the books of the roman publicans who levied the poll tax strabo lib    praises the superior police of the romans with regard to the finances of egypt above that of its former monarchs and no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people yet we read in athenaeus lib   cap    who flourished during the reign of the antonines that the town mareia near alexandria which was formerly a large city had dwindled into a village this is not properly speaking a contradiction suidas august says that the emperor augustus having numbered the whole roman empire found it contained only   0 0   men  there is here surely some great mistake either in the author or transcriber but this authority feeble as it is may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of herodotus and diodorus siculus with regard to more early times   but we are not told that all extensive governments especially absolute monarchies are destructive to population and contain a secret vice and poison which destroy the effect of all these promising appearances lesprit des loix livre    chap    to confirm this there is a passage cited from plutarch de orac defectu which being somewhat singular we shall here examine it  that author endeavoring to account for the silence of many of the oracles says that it may be ascribed to the present desolation of the world proceeding from former wars and factions which common calamity he adds has fallen heavier upon greece than on any other country insomuch that the whole could scarce at present furnish out three thousand warriors which in the time of the median war were supplied by the single city of megara the gods therefore who affect works of dignity and importance have suppressed many of their oracles and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people  i must confess that this passage contains so many difficulties that i know not what to make of it you may observe that plutarch assigns for a cause of the decay of mankind not the extensive dominion of the romans but the former wars and factions of the several nations all which were quieted by the roman arms plutarchs reasoning therefore is directly contrary to the inference which is drawn from the fact he advances  polybius supposes that greece had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the roman yoke lib   cap    it may perhaps be imagined that polybius being dependent on rome would naturally extol the roman dominion but in the first place polybius though one sees sometimes instances of his caution discovers no symptoms of flattery secondly this opinion is only delivered in a single stroke by the bye while he is intent upon another subject and it is allowed if there be any suspicion of an authors insincerity that these oblique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions and though that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated from being the patrons to be the plunderers of mankind yet as we find from tacitus annal lib   cap   that the severity of the emperors afterward corrected the license of the governors we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it is often represented  we learn from strabo lib   and   that the romans from their regard to the greeks maintained to his time most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated nation and nero afterward rather increased them plutarch de his qui sero a numine puniuntur how therefore can we imagine that the roman yoke was so burdensome over that part of the world the oppression of the proconsuls was checked and the magistracies in greece being all bestowed in the several cities by the free votes of the people there was no great necessity for the competitors to attend the emperors court if great numbers went to seek their fortunes in rome and advance themselves by learning or eloquence the commodities of their native country many of them would return with the fortunes they had made and thereby enrich the grecian commonwealths  but plutarch says that the general depopulation had been more sensibly felt in greece than in any other country how is this reconcilable to its superior privileges and advantages  besides this passage by proving too much really proves nothing only three thousand men able to bear arms in all greece who can admit so strange a proposition especially if we consider the great numbers of greek cities whose names still remain in history and which are mentioned by writers long after the age of plutarch there are there surely ten times more people at present when there scarce remains a city in all the bounds of ancient greece that country is still tolerably cultivated and furnishes a sure supply of corn in case of any scarcity in spain italy or the south of france  we must observe that the ancient frugality of the greeks and their equality of property still subsisted during the age of plutarch as appears from lucian de mercede conductis nor is there any ground to imagine that that country was possessed by a few masters and a great number of slaves  it is probable indeed that military discipline being entirely useless was extremely neglected in greece after the establishment of the roman empire and if these commonwealths formerly so warlike and ambitious maintained each of them a small city guard to prevent mobbish disorders it is all they had occasion for and these perhaps did not amount to three thousand men throughout all greece i own that if plutarch had this fact in his eye he is here guilty of a very gross paralogism and assigns causes no way proportioned to the effects but is it so great a prodigy that an author should fall into a mistake of this nature i must confess that that discourse of plutarch concerning the silence of the oracles is in general of so odd a texture and so unlike his other productions that one is at a loss what judgment to form of it it is wrote in dialogue which is a method of composition that plutarch commonly little affects the personages he introduces advance very wild absurd and contradictory opinions more like the visionary systems of plato than the solid sense of plutarch there runs also through the whole an air of superstition and credulity which resembles very little the spirit that appears in the other philosophical compositions of that author for it is remarkable that though plutarch be an historian as superstitious as herodotus or livy yet there is scarcely in all antiquity a philosopher less superstitious excepting cicero and lucian i must therefore confess that a passage of plutarch cited from this discourse has much less authority with me than if it had been found in most of his other compositions  there is only one other discourse of plutarch liable to like objections viz that concerning those whose punishment is delayed by the deity it is also wrote in dialogue contains like superstitious wild visions and seems to have been chiefly composed in rivalship to plato particularly his last book de republica  and here i cannot but observe that mons fontenelle a writer eminent for candor seems to have departed a little from his usual character when he endeavors to throw a ridicule upon plutarch on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles the absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascribed to plutarch he makes them resute each other and in general he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions which fontenelle would ridicule him for maintaining see histoire des oracles     but whatever force may remain in this passage of plutarch we shall endeavor to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in diodorus siculus where the historian after mentioning ninuss army of   00000 foot and  00000 horse endeavors to support the credibility of this account by some posterior facts and adds that we must not form a notion of the ancient populousness of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which is spread over the world lib   thus an author who lived at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous he was contemporary with caesar and augustus complains of the desolation which then prevailed gives the preference to former times and has recourse to ancient fables as a foundation for his opinion the humor of blaming the present and admiring the past is strongly rooted in human nature and has an influence even on persons endud with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning  discourse xi of the protestant succession i suppose that a member of parliament in the reign of king william or queen anne while the establishment of the protestant succession was yet uncertain were deliberating concerning the party he would choose in that important question and weighing with impartiality the advantages and disadvantages on each side i believe the following particulars would have entered into his consideration  he would easily perceive the great advantages resulting from the restoration of the stuart family by which we should preserve the succession clear and undisputed free from a pretender with such a specious title as that of blood which with the multitude is always the claim the strongest and most easily comprehended it is in vain to say as many have done that the question with regard to governors independent of government is frivolous and little worth disputing much less fighting about the generality of mankind never will enter into these sentiments and it is much happier i believe for society that they do not but continue in their natural prejudices and prepossessions how could stability be preserved in any monarchical government which though perhaps not the best is and always has been the most common of any unless men had so passionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family and even though weak in understanding or infirm in years gave him so great a preference above persons the most accomplished in shining talents or celebrated for great achievements would not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy or even without any vacancy and the kingdom become the theater of perpetual wars and convulsions the condition of the roman empire surely was not in this respect much to be envied nor is that of the eastern nations who pay little regard to the title of their sovereigns but sacrifice them every day to the caprice or momentary humor of the populace or soldiery it is but a foolish wisdom which is so carefully displayed in undervaluing princes and placing them on a level with the meanest of mankind to be sure an anatomist finds no more in the greatest monarch than in the lowest peasant or daylabourer and a moralist may perhaps frequently find less but what do all these reflections tend to we all of us still retain these prejudices in favor of birth and family and neither in our serious occupations nor most careless amusements can we ever get entirely rid of them a tragedy that would represent the adventures of common sailors or porters or even of private gentlemen would presently disgust us but one that introduces kings and princes acquires in our eyes an air of importance and dignity or should a man be able by his superior wisdom to get entirely above such prepossessions he would soon by means of the same wisdom again bring himself down to them for the sake of society whose welfare he would perceive to be intimately connected with them far from endeavoring to undeceive the people in this particular he would cherish and foster such sentiments of reverence to their princes as requisite to preserve a due subordination in society and though the lives of twenty thousand men be often sacrificed to maintain a king in possession of his throne or preserve the right of succession undisturbed he entertains no indignation at the loss on pretense that every individual of these was perhaps in himself as valuable as the prince he served he considers the consequences of violating the hereditary right of kings consequences which may be felt for many centuries while the loss of several thousand men brings so little prejudice to a large kingdom that it may not be perceived a few years afterward  the advantages of the hanover succession are of an opposite nature and arise from this very circumstance that it violates hereditary right and places on the throne a prince to whom birth gave no title to that dignity it is evident to any one who considers the history of this island that the privileges of the people have during the two last centuries been continually upon the increase by the division of the church lands by the alienations of the barons estates by the progress of trade and above all by the happiness of our situation which for a long time gave us sufficient security without any standing army or military establishment on the contrary public liberty has almost in every other nation of europe been during the same period extremely upon the decline while the people were disgusted at the hardships of the old gothic militia and chose rather to entrust their prince with mercenary armies which he easily turned against themselves twas nothing extraordinary therefore that some of our british sovereigns mistook the nature of the constitution and genius of the people and as they embraced all the favorable precedents left them by their ancestors they overlooked all those which were contrary and which supposed a limitation in our government they were encouraged in this mistake by the example of all the neighboring princes who bearing the same title or appellation and being adorned with the same ensigns of authority naturally led them to claim the same powers and prerogatives it appears from the speeches and proclamations and whole train of king james the i s actions as well as his sons that they considered the english government as a simple monarchy and never imagined that any considerable part of their subjects entertained a contrary idea this made them discover their pretensions without preparing any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which are always employed by those who enter upon any new project or endeavor to innovate in any government king james told his parliament plainly when they meddled in state affairs ne suitor ultra crepidam he used also at his table in promiscuous companies to advance his notions in a manner still more undisguisd as we may learn from a story told in the life of mr waller and which that poet used frequently to repeat when mr waller was young he had the curiosity to go to court and he stood in the circle and saw king james dine where amongst other company there sat at table two bishops the king openly and aloud proposed this question whether he might not take his subjects money when he had occasion for it without all this formality of parliament the one bishop readily replied god forbid you should not for you are the breath of our nostrils the other bishop declined answering and said he was not skilled in parliamentary cases but upon the kings urging him and saying he would admit of no evasion his lordship replied very pleasantly why then i think your majesty may lawfully take my brothers money for he offers it in sir walter raleighs preface to the history of the world there is this remarkable passage philip the ii by strong hand and main force attempted to make himself not only an absolute monarch over the netherlands like unto the kings and sovereigns of england and france but turklike to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privileges and ancient rights spenser speaking of some grants of the english kings to the irish corporations says all which though at the time of their first grant they were tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient but all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majestys prerogative against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforced state of ireland page      edit   0   as these were very common though not perhaps the universal notions of the times the two first princes of the house of stuart were the more excusable for their mistake and rapin the most judicious of historians seems sometimes to treat them with too much severity upon account of it   the flattery of courtiers farther blinded them and above all that of the clergy who from several passages of their scripture and these wrested too had erected a regular and avowed system of tyranny and despotic power the only method of destroying at once all these exorbitant claims and pretensions was to depart from the true hereditary line and choose a prince who being plainly a creature of the public and receiving the crown on conditions expressed and avowed found his authority established on the same bottom with the privileges of the people by electing him in the royal line we cut off all hopes of ambitious subjects who might in future emergencies disturb the government by their cabals and pretensions by rendering the crown hereditary in his family we avoided all the inconveniences of elective monarchy and by excluding the lineal heir we secured all our constitutional limitations and rendered our government uniform and of a piece the people cherish monarchy because protected by it the monarch favors liberty because created by it and thus every advantage is obtained by the new establishment as far as human skill and wisdom can extend itself  these are the separate advantages of fixing the succession either in the house of stuart or in that of hanover there are also disadvantages in each establishment which an impartial patriot would ponder and examine in order to form a just judgment upon the whole  the disadvantages of the protestant succession consist in the foreign dominions which are possessed by the princes of the hanover line and which it might be supposed would engage us in the intrigues and wars of the continent and lose us in some measure the inestimable advantage we possess of being surrounded and guarded by the sea which we command the disadvantages of recalling the abdicated family consist chiefly in their religion which is more prejudicial to society than that established amongst us is contrary to it and affords no toleration or peace or security to any other religion  it appears to me that all these advantages and disadvantages are allowed on both sides at least by every one who is at all susceptible of argument or reasoning no subject however loyal pretends to deny that the disputed title and foreign dominions of the present royal family are a loss nor is there any partizan of the stuart family but will confess that the claim of hereditary indefeasible right and the roman catholic religion are also disadvantages in that family it belongs therefore to a philosopher alone who is of neither party to put all these circumstances in the scale and assign to each of them its proper poize and influence such an one will readily at first acknowledge that all political questions are infinitely complicated and that there scarce ever occurs in any deliberation a choice which is either purely good or purely ill consequences mixed and varied may be foreseen to flow from every measure and many consequences unforeseen do always in fact result from it hesitation and reserve and suspense are therefore the only sentiments he brings to this essay or trial or if he indulges any passion it is that of derision and ridicule against the ignorant multitude who are always clamorous and dogmatical even in the nicest questions of which from want of temper perhaps still more than of understanding they are altogether unfit judges  but to say something more determinate on this head the following reflections will i hope show the temper if not the understanding of a philosopher  were we to judge merely by first appearance and by past experience we must allow that the advantages of a parliamentary title in the house of hanover are much greater than those of an undisputed hereditary title in the house of stuart and that our fathers acted wisely in preferring the former to the latter so long as the house of stuart reigned in britain which with some interruptions was above  0 years the government was kept in a continual fever by the contentions betwixt the privileges of the people and the prerogatives of the crown if arms were dropped the noise of disputes continued or if these were silenced jealousy still corroded the heart and threw the nation into an unnatural ferment and disorder and while we were thus occupyd in domestic contentions a foreign power dangerous if not fatal to public liberty erected itself in europe without any opposition from us and even sometimes with our assistance  but within these last sixty years when a parliamentary establishment has taken place whatever factions may have prevailed either amongst the people or in public assemblies the whole force of our constitution has always fallen to one side and an uninterrupted harmony has been preserved betwixt our princes and our parliaments public liberty with internal peace and order has flourished almost without interruption trade and manufactures and agriculture have increased the arts and sciences and philosophy have been cultivated even religious parties have been necessitated to lay aside their mutual rancour and the glory of the nation has spread itself all over europe while we stand the bulwark against oppression and the great antagonist of that power which threatens every people with conquest and subjection so long and so glorious a period no nation almost can boast of nor is there another instance in the whole history of mankind that so many millions of people have during such a space of time been held together in a manner so free so rational and so suitable to the dignity of human nature  but though this recent instance seems clearly to decide in favor of the present establishment there are some circumstances to be thrown into the other scale and it is dangerous to regulate our judgment by one event or example  we have had two rebellions during the flourishing period above mentioned besides plots and conspiracies without number and if none of these have produced any very fatal event we may ascribe our escape chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes who disputed our establishment and may esteem ourselves so far fortunate but the claims of the banished family i fear are not yet antiquated and who can foretell that their future attempts will produce no greater disorder  the disputes betwixt privilege and prerogative may easily be composed by laws and votes and conferences and concessions where there is tolerable temper or prudence on both sides or on either side amongst contending titles the question can only be determined by the sword and by devastation and by civil war  a prince who fills the throne with a disputed title dares not arm his subjects the only method of securing a people fully both against domestic oppression and foreign conquest  notwithstanding all our riches and renown what a critical escape did we lately make from dangers which were owing not so much to bad conduct and ill success in war as to the pernicious practice of mortgaging our finances and the still more pernicious maxim of never paying off our encumbrances such fatal measures could never have been embraced had it not been to secure a precarious establishment those who consider how universal this pernicious practice of funding has become all over europe may perhaps dispute this last opinion but we lay under less necessity than other states   but to convince us that an hereditary title is to be embraced rather than a parliamentary one which is not supported by any other views or motives a man needs only transport himself back to the era of the restoration and suppose that he had had a seat in that parliament which recalled the royal family and put a period to the greatest disorders that ever arose from the opposite pretensions of prince and people what would have been thought of one that had proposed at that time to set aside charles the second and settle the crown on the duke of york or gloucester merely in order to exclude the high claims of their father and grandfather would not such an one have been regarded as a very extravagant projector who loved dangerous remedies and could tamper and play with a government and national constitution like a quack with a sickly patient  the advantages which result from a parliamentary title preferably to an hereditary one though they are great are too refined ever to enter into the conception of the vulgar the bulk of mankind would never allow them to be sufficient for committing what would be regarded as an injustice to the prince they must be supported by some gross popular and familiar topics and wise men though convinced of their force would reject them in compliance with the weakness and prejudices of the people an encroaching tyrant or deluded bigot alone by his misconduct is able to enrage the nation and render practicable what was always perhaps desirable  in reality the reason asiignd by the nation for excluding the race of stuart and so many other branches of the royal family is not on account of their hereditary title which however just in itself would to vulgar apprehensions have appeared altogether absurd but on account of their religion which leads us to compare the disadvantages above mentioned of each establishment  i confess that considering the matter in general it were rather to be wished that our prince had no foreign dominions and could confine all his attention to the government of this island for not to mention some real inconveniences that may result from territories on the continent they afford such a handle for calumny and defamation as is greedily seized by the people who are always disposed to think ill of their superiors it must however be acknowledged that hanover is perhaps the spot of ground in europe the least inconvenient for a king of britain it lies in the heart of germany at a distance from the great powers which are our natural rivals it is protected by the laws of the empire as well as by the arms of its own sovereign and it serves only to connect us more closely with the house of austria which is our natural ally  in the last war it has been of service to us by furnishing us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops the bravest and most faithful in the world the elector of hanover is the only considerable prince in the empire who has drove no separate end and has raised up no stale pretensions during the late commotions of europe but has acted all along with the dignity of a king of britain and ever since the accession of that family twoud be difficult to show any harm we have ever received from the electoral dominions except that short disgust in      with charles the twelfth who regulating himself by maxims very different from those of other princes made a personal quarrel of every public injury  the religious persuasion of the house of stuart is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye and would threaten us with much more dismal consequences the roman catholic religion with its huge train of priests and friars is vastly more expensive than ours even though unaccompanyd with its natural attendants of inquisitors and stakes and gibbets it is less tolerating and not contented with dividing the sacerdotal from the regal office which must be prejudicial to any state it bestows the former on a foreigner who has always a separate and may often have an opposite interest to that of the public  but were this religion ever so advantageous to society it is contrary to that which is established among us and which is likely to keep possession for a long time of the minds of the people and though it is much to be hoped that the progress of reason and philosophy will by degrees abate the virulent acrimony of opposite religious all over europe yet the spirit of moderation has as yet made too slow advances to be entirely trusted the conduct of the saxon family where the same person can be a catholic king and a protestant elector is perhaps the first instance in modern times of so reasonable and prudent a behavior and the gradual progress of the catholic superstition does even there prognosticate a speedy alteration after which it is justly to be apprehended that persecutions will put a speedy period to the protestant religion in the place of its nativity  thus upon the whole the advantages of the settlement in the family of stuart which frees us from a disputed title seem to bear some proportion with those of the settlement in the family of hanover which frees us from the claims of prerogative but at the same time its disadvantages by placing on the throne a roman catholic are much greater than those of the other establishment in settling the crown on a foreign prince what party an impartial patriot in the reign of king william or queen anne would have chosen amidst these opposite views may perhaps to some appear hard to determine for my part i esteem liberty so invaluable a blessing in society that whatever favors its progress and security can scarce be too fondly cherished by every one who is a lover of human kind  but the settlement in the house of hanover has actually taken place the princes of that family without intrigue without cabal without solicitation on their part have been called to mount our throne by the united voice of the whole legislative body they have since their accession displayed in all their actions the utmost mildness equity and regard to the laws and constitution our own ministers our own parliaments ourselves have governed us and if aught ill has befallen us we can only blame fortune or ourselves what a reproach must we become amongst nations if disgusted with a settlement so deliberately made and whose conditions have been so religiously observed we should throw every thing again into confusion and by our levity and rebellious disposition prove ourselves totally unfit for any state but that of absolute slavery and subjection  the greatest inconvenience attending a disputed title is that it brings us in danger of civil wars and rebellions what wise man to avoid this inconvenience would run directly upon a civil war and rebellion not to mention that so long possession secured by so many laws must ere this time in the apprehension of a great part of the nation have begot a title in the house of hanover independent of their present possession so that now we should not even by a revolution obtain the end of avoiding a disputed title  no revolution made by national forces will ever be able without some other great necessity to abolish our debts and encumbrances in which the interest of so many persons is concerned and a revolution made by foreign forces is a conquest a calamity with which the precarious balance of power very nearly threatens us and which our civil dissensions are likely above all other circumces to bring suddenly upon us  discourse xii idea of a perfect commonwealth of all mankind there are none so pernicious as political projectors if they have power nor so ridiculous if they want it as on the other hand a wise politician is the most beneficial character in nature if accompanied with authority and the most innocent and not altogether useless even if deprived of it it is not with forms of government as with other artificial contrivances where an old engine may be rejected if we can discover another more accurate and commodious or where trials may safely be made even though the success be doubtful an established government has an infinite advantage by that very circumstance of its being established the bulk of mankind being governed by authority not reason and never attributing authority to any thing that has not the recommendation of antiquity to tamper therefore in this affair or try projects merely upon the credit of supposed argument and philosophy can never be the part of a wise magistrate who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age and though he may attempt some improvement for the public good yet will he adjust his innovations as much as possible to the ancient fabric and preserve entire the chief pillars and supports of the constitution  the mathematicians in europe have been much divided concerning that figure of a ship which is the most commodious for sailing and huygens who at last fixed this controversy is justly thought to have obliged the learned as well as commercial world though columbus had sailed to america and sir francis drake made the tour of the world without any such discovery as one form of government must be allowed more perfect than another independent of the manners and humors of particular men why may we not enquire what is the most perfect of all though the common botcht and inaccurate governments seem to serve the purposes of society and though it be not so easy to establish a new government as to build a vessel upon a new plan the subject is surely the most worthy curiosity of any the wit of man can possibly devise and who knows if this controversy were fixed by the universal consent of the learned but in some future age an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice either by a dissolution of the old governments or the combination of men to form a new one in some distant part of the world in all cases it must be advantageous to know what is most perfect in the kind that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possible by such gentle alterations and innovations as may not give too great disturbance to society  all ipretend to in the present essay is to revive this subject of speculation and therefore i shall deliver my sentiments in as few words as possible a long dissertation on that head would not i apprehend be very acceptable to the public who will be apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chimerical  all plans of government which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind are plainly imaginary of this nature are the republic of plato and the utopia of sir thomas more the oceana is the only valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offered to the public  the chief defects of the oceana seem to be these first its rotation is inconvenient by throwing men of whatever ability by intervals out of public employments secondly its agrarian is impracticable men will soon learn the art which was practiced in ancient rome of concealing their possessions under other peoples names till at last the abuse will become so common that they will throw off even the appearance of restraint thirdly the oceana provides not a sufficient security for liberty or the redress of grievances the senate must propose and the people consent by which means the senate have not only a negative upon the people but what is of infinitely greater consequence their negative goes before the votes of the people were the kings negative of the same nature in the english constitution and could he prevent any bill from coming into parliament he would be an absolute monarch as his negative follows the votes of the houses it is of little consequence such a difference is there in the manner of placing the same thing when a popular bill has been debated in the two houses is brought to maturity all its conveniences and inconveniences weighed and balanced if afterward it be presented for the royal assent few princes will venture to reject the unanimous desire of the people but could the king crush a disagreeable bill in embryo as was the case for some time in the scotch parliament by means of the lords of the articles the british government would have no balance nor would grievances ever be redrest and it is certain that exorbitant power proceeds not in any government from new laws so much as from neglecting to remedy the abuses which frequently rise upon the old ones a government says machiavel must often be brought back to its original principles it appears then that in the oceana the whole legislature may be said to rest in the senate which harrington would own to be an inconvenient form of government especially after the agrarian is abolished  here is a form of government to which i cannot in theory discover any considerable objection let great britain and ireland or any territory of equal extent be divided into  00 counties and each county into  00 parishes making in all  0000 if the country purposed to be erected into a commonwealth be of more narrow extent we may diminish the number of counties but never bring them below thirty if it be of greater extent twere better to enlarge the parishes or throw more parishes into a county than increase the number of counties  let all the freeholders in the country parishes and those who pay scot and lot in the town parishes meet annually in the parish church and choose by ballot some freeholder of the county for their member whom we shall call the county representative  let the  00 county representatives two days after their election meet in the county town and choose by ballot from their own body ten county magistrates and one senator there are therefore in the whole commonwealth  00 senators   00 county magistrates and  0000 county representatives for we shall bestow on all senators the authority of county magistrates and on all county magistrates the authority of county representatives  let the senators meet in the capital and be endowed with the whole executive power of the commonwealth the power of peace and war of giving orders to generals admirals and ambassadors and in short all the prerogatives of a british king except his negative  let the county representatives meet in their particular counties and possess the whole legislative power of the commonwealth the greatest number of counties deciding the question and where these are equal let the senate have the casting vote  every new law must first be debated in the senate and though rejected by it if ten senators insist and protest it must be sent down to the counties the senate may join to the copy of the law their reasons for receiving or rejecting it  because it would be troublesome to assemble the whole county representatives for every trivial law that may be requisite the senate have their choice of sending down the law either to the county magistrates or county representatives  the magistrates though the law be referred to them may if they please call the representatives and submit the affair to their determination  whether the law be referred by the senate to the county magistrates or representatives a copy of it and of the senates reasons must be sent to every representative eight days before the day appointed for the assembling in order to deliberate concerning it and though the determination be by the senate referred to the magistrates if five representatives of the county order the magistrates to assemble the whole court of representatives and submit the affair to their determination they must obey  either the county magistrates or representatives may give to the senator of the county the copy of a law to be proposed to the senate and if five counties concur in the same order the law though refused by the senate must come either to the county magistrates or representatives as is contained in the order of the five counties  any twenty counties by a vote either of their magistrates or representatives may throw any man out of all public offices for a year thirty counties for three years  the senate has a power of throwing out any member or number of members of its own body not to be reelected for that year the senate cannot throw out twice in a year the senator of the same county  the power of the old senate continues for three weeks after the annual election of the county representatives then all the new senators are shut up in a conclave like the cardinals and by an intricate ballot such as that of venice or malta they choose the following magistrates a protector who represents the dignity of the commonwealth and presides in the senate two secretaries of state these six councils a council of state a council of religion and learning a council of trade a council of laws a council of war a council of the admiralty each council consisting of five persons along with six commissioners of the treasury and a chief commissioner all these must be senators the senate also names all the ambassadors to foreign courts who may either be senators or not  the senate may continue any or all of these but must reelect them every year  the protector and two secretaries have session and suffrage in the council of state the business of that council is all foreign politics the council of state has session and suffrage in all the other councils  the council of religion and learning inspects the universities and clergy that of trade inspects every thing that may affect commerce that of laws inspects all the abuses of laws by the inferior magistrates and examines what improvements may be made of the municipal law that of war inspects the militia and its discipline magazines stores etc and when the republic is in war examines into the proper orders for generals the council of admiralty has the same power with regard to the navy along with the nomination of the captains and all inferior officers  none of these councils can give orders themselves except where they receive such powers from the senate in other cases they must communicate every thing to the senate  when the senate is under adjournment any of the councils may assemble it before the day appointed for its meeting  besides these councils or courts there is another called the court of competitors which is thus constituted if any candidates for the office of senator have more votes than a third of the representatives that candidate which has most votes next to the senator elected becomes incapable for one year of all public offices even of being a magistrate or representative but he takes his seat in the court of competitors here then is a court which may sometimes consist of a hundred members sometimes have no members at all and by that means be for a year abolished  the court of competitors has no power in the commonwealth it has only the inspection of public accounts and the accusing any man before the senate if the senate acquit him the court of competitors may if they please appeal to the people either magistrates or representatives upon that appeal the magistrates or representatives meet on the day appointed by the court of competitors and choose in each county three persons from which number every senator is excluded these to the number of  00 meet in the capital and bring the person accused to a new trial  the court of competitors may propose any law to the senate and if refused may appeal to the people that is to the magistrates or representatives who examine it in their counties every senator who is thrown out of the senate by a vote of the court takes his seat in the court of competitors  the senate possesses all the judicative authority of the house of lords that is all the appeals from the inferior courts it likewise nominates the lord chancellor and all the officers of the law  every county is a kind of republic within itself and the representatives may make county laws which have no authority till three months after they are voted a copy of the law is sent to the senate and to every other county the senate or any single county may at any time annul any law of another county  the representatives have all the authority of the british justices of the peace in trials commitments etc  the magistrates have the nomination of all the officers of the revenue in each county all causes with regard to the revenue are appealed ultimately to the magistrates they pass the accounts of all the officers but must have all their own accounts examined and past at the end of the year by the representatives  the magistrates name rectors or ministers to all the parishes  the presbyterian government is established and the highest ecclesiastical court is an assembly or synod of all the presbyters of the county the magistrates may take any cause from this court and determine it themselves  the magistrates may try and depose or suspend any presbyter  the militia is established in imitation of that in swisserland which being well known we shall not insist upon it twill only be proper to make this addition that an army of  0000 be annually drawn out by rotation paid and encamped during six weeks in summer that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown  the magistrates nominate all the colonels and downwards the senate all upwards during war the general nominates the colonel and downwards and his commission is good for a twelvemonth but after that it must be confirmed by the magistrates of the county to which the regiment belongs the magistrates may break any officer in the county regiment and the senate may do the same to any officer in the service if the magistrates do not think proper to confirm the generals choice they may nominate another officer in the place of him they reject  all crimes are tried within the county by the magistrates and a jury but the senate can stop any trial and bring it before themselves  any county may indict any man before the senate for any crime  the protector the two secretaries the council of state with any five more that the senate appoints on extraordinary emergencies are possessed of dictatorial power for six months  the protector may pardon any person condemned by the inferior courts  in time of war no officer of the army that is in the field can have any civil office in the commonwealth  the capital which we shall call london may be allowed four members in the senate it may therefore be divided into four counties the representatives of each of these choose one senator and ten magistrates there are therefore in the city four senators forty four magistrates and four hundred representatives the magistrates have the same authority as in the counties the representatives also have the same authority but they never meet in one general court they give their votes in their particular county or division of hundreds  when they enact any city law the greatest number of counties or divisions determines the matter and where these are equal the magistrates have the casting vote  the magistrates choose the mayor sheriff recorder and other officers of the city  in the commonwealth no representative magistrate or senator as such has any salary the protector secretaries councils and ambassadors have salaries  the first year in every century is set apart to correct all inequalities which time may have produced in the representation this must be done by the legislature  the following political aphorisms may explain the reason of these orders  the lower sort of people and small proprietors are good enough judges of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation and therefore in their parochial meetings will probably choose the best or nearly the best representative but they are wholly unfit for county meetings and for electing into the higher offices of the republic their ignorance gives the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them  ten thousand even though they were not annually elected are a large enough basis for any free government it is true the nobles in poland are more than  0000 and yet these oppress the people but as power continues there always in the same persons and families this makes them in a manner a different nation from the people besides the nobles are there united under a few heads of families  all free governments must consist of two councils a less and a greater or in other words of a senate and people the people as harrington observes would want wisdom without the senate the senate without the people would want honesty  a large assembly of  000 for instance to represent the people if allowed to debate would fall into disorder if not allowed to debate the senate has a negative upon them and the worst kind of negative that before resolution  here therefore is an inconvenience which no government has yet fully remedied but which is the easiest to be remedied in the world if the people debate all is confusion if they do not debate they can only resolve and then the senate carves for them divide the people into many separate bodies and then they may debate with safety and every inconvenience seems to be prevented  cardinal de retz says that all numerous assemblies however composed are mere mob and swayed in their debates by the least motive this we find confirmed by daily experience when an absurdity strikes a member he conveys it to his neighbor and so on till the whole be infected separate this great body and tho every member be only of middling sense it is not probable that any thing but reason can prevail over the whole influence and example being removed good sense will always get the better of bad among a number of people good sense is one thing but follies are numberless and every man has a different one the only way of making a people wise is to keep them from uniting into large assemblies  there are two things to be guarded against in every senate its combination and its division its combination is most dangerous and against this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies   the great dependence of the senators on the people by annual elections and that not by an undistinguishing rabble like the english electors but by men of fortune and education   the small power they are allowed they have few offices to dispose of almost all are given by the magistrates in the counties   the court of competitors which being composed of men that are their rivals next to them in interest and uneasy in their present situation will be sure to take all advantages against them  the division of the senate is prevented   by the smallness of their number   as faction supposes a combination to a separate interest it is prevented by their dependence on the people   they have a power of expelling any factious member it is true when another member of the same spirit comes from the county they have no power of expelling him nor is it fit they should for that shows the humor to be in the people and probably arises from some ill conduct in public affairs   almost any man in a senate so regularly chosen by the people may be supposed fit for any civil office twoud be proper therefore for the senate to form some general resolutions with regard to the disposing of offices among the members which resolutions would not confine them in critical times when extraordinary parts on the one hand or extraordinary stupidity on the other appears in any senator but yet they would be sufficient to prevent brigue and faction by making the disposal of the offices a thing of course for instance let it be a resolution that no man shall enjoy any office till he has sat four years in the senate that except ambassadors no man shall be in office two years following that no man shall attain the higher offices but through the lower that no man shall be protector twice etc the senate of venice govern themselves by such resolutions  in foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarc eever be divided from that of the people and therefore it is fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them otherwise there could be no se crecy nor refined policy besides without money no alliance can be executed and the senate is still sufficiently dependent not to mention that the legislative power being always superior to the executive the magistrates or representatives may interpose whenever they think proper  the chief support of the british government is the opposition of interests but that though in the main serviceable breeds endless factions in the foregoing plan it does all the good without any of the harm the competitors have no power of controlling the senate they have only the power of accusing and appealing to the people  it is necessary likewise to prevent both combination and division in the thousand magistrates this is done sufficiently by the separation of places and interests  but lest that should not be enough their dependence on the  0000 for their elections serves to the same purpose  nor is that all for the  0000 may resume the power whenever they please and not only when they all please but when any five of a hundred please which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest  the  0000 are too large a body either to unite or divide except when they meet in one place and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders not to mention their annual election by almost the whole body of the people  a small commonwealth is the happiest government in the world within itself because every thing lies under the eye of the rulers but it may be subdued by great force from without this scheme seems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth  every county law may be anulld either by the senate or another county because that shows an opposition of interests in which case no part ought to decide for itself the matter must be referred to the whole which will best determine what agrees with general interest  as to the clergy and militia the reasons of these orders are obvious without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrate and without a militia it is folly to think any free government will ever have security or stability  in many governments the inferior magistrates have no rewards but what arise from their ambition vanity or public spirit the salaries of the french judges amount not to the interest of the sums they pay for their offices the dutch burgomasters have little more immediate profit than the english justices of peace or the members of the house of commons formerly but lest any should suspect that this would beget negligence in the administration which is little to be feared considering the natural ambition of mankind let the magistrates have competent salaries the senators have access to so many honorable and lucrative offices that their attendance needs not be bought there is little attendance required of the representatives  that the foregoing plan of government is practicable no one can doubt who considers the resemblance it bears to the commonwealth of the united provinces formerly one of the wisest and most renowned governments that ever was in the world the alterations in the present scheme are all evidently to the better   the representation is more equal   the unlimited power of the burgomasters in the towns which forms a perfect aristocracy in the dutch commonwealth is corrected by a well tempered democracy in giving to the people the annual election of the county representatives   the negative which every province and town has upon the whole body of the dutch republic with regard to alliances peace and war and the imposition of taxes is here removed   the counties in the present plan are not so independent of each other nor do they form separate bodies so much as the seven provinces where the jealousy and envy of the smaller provinces and towns against the greater particularly holland and amsterdam have frequently disturbed the government   larger powers though of the safest kind are entrusted to the senate than the states general possess by which means the former may become more expeditious and secret in their resolutions than it is possible for the latter  the chief alterations that could be made on the british government in order to bring it to the most perfect model of limited monarchy seem to be the following first the plan of the republican parliament ought to be restored by making the representation equal and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who possess not a hundred a year secondly as such a house of commons would be too weighty for a frail house of lords like the present the bishops and scotch peers ought to be removed whose behavior in former parliaments destroyed entirely the authority of that house the number of the upper house ought to be raised to three or four hundred their seats not hereditary but during life they ought to have the election of their own members and no commoner should be allowed to refuse a seat that was offered him by this means the house of lords would consist entirely of the men of chief credit ability and interest of the nation and every turbulent leader in the house of commons might be taken off and connected in interest with the house of peers such an aristocracy would be an excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it at present the balance of our government depends in some measure on the ability and behavior of the sovereign which are variable and uncertain circumstances  i allow that this plan of limited monarchy however corrected is still liable to three great inconveniences first it removes not entirely tho it may soften the parties of court and country secondly the kings personal character must still have a great influence on the government thirdly the sword is in the hands of a single person who will always neglect to discipline the militia in order to have a pretext for keeping up a standing army it is evident that this is a mortal distemper in the british government of which it must at last inevitably perish i must however confess that sweden seems in some measure to have remedied this inconvenience and to have a militia along with its limited monarchy as well as a standing army which is less dangerous than the british  we shall conclude this subject with observing the falsehood of the common opinion that no large state such as france or britain could ever be modeled into a commonwealth but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory the contrary seems evident though it is more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city there is more facility when once it is formed of preserving it steady and uniform without tumult and faction in the former than in the latter it is not easy for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any plan of free government but they easily conspire in the esteem and reverence for a single person who by means of this popular favor may seize the power and forcing the more obstinate to submit may establish a monarchical government on the other hand a city readily concurs in the same notions of government the natural equality of property favors liberty and the nearness of habitation enables the citizens mutually to assist each other even under absolute princes the subordinate government of cities is commonly republican while that of counties and provinces is monarchical but these same circumstances which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities render their constitution more frail and uncertain democracies are turbulent for however the people may be separated or divided into small parties either in their votes or elections their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very sensible aristocracies are better adapted for peace and order and accordingly were most admired by ancient writers but they are jealous and oppressive in a large government which is modeled with masterly skill there is compass and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people who may be admitted into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth to the higher magistrates who direct all the motions at the same time the parts are so distant and remote that it is very difficult either by intrigue prejudice or passion to hurry them into any measures against the public interest  it is needless to enquire whether such a government would be immortal i allow the justness of the poets exclamation on the endless projects of human race man and for ever the world itself probably is not immortal such consuming plagues may arise as would leave even a perfect government a weak prey to its neighbors we know not how far enthusiasm or other extraordinary motions of the human mind may transport men to the neglect of all order and public good where difference of interest is removed whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise from personal favor or enmity perhaps rust may grow to the springs of the most accurate political machine and disorder its motions lastly extensive conquests when pursued must be the ruin of every free government and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect because of the very advantages which the former possess above the latter and though such a state ought to establish a fundamental law against conquests yet republics have ambition as well as individuals and present interest makes men forgetful of their posterity it is a sufficient incitement to human endeavors that such a government would flourish for many ages without pretending to bestow on any work of man that immortality which the almighty seems to have refused to his own productions  finis
