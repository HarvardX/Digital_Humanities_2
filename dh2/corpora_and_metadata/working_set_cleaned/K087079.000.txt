the life of john buncle esquire containing various observations and reflections made in several parts of the world and many extraordinary relations  foelix ille animi divisque simillimus ipsis quem non mendaci resplendens gloria fuco sollicitat non fastosi mala gaudia luxus sed tacitos sinit ire dies et paupere cultu exigit innocuae tranquilla silentia vitae volusenus london printed for j noon at the white heart in cheapside near the poultry  mdcclvi  to the critics this journal is most humbly dedicated by their most humble servant  the author  a preface by way of dedication gentlemen this book is not addressed to you in order to ask your protection for its faults or in hopes that such valuable names at the head of it may preserve it things in print must stand by their own worth but it is offered to you to let the world see i had that confidence in the goodness of my design in writing it as to submit it to such great and impartial judges and that i believe you will report your opinion in such a manner as to procure me the esteem of the virtuous when you find that my principal intention in this piece is to serve the interests of truth liberty and religion and to advance useful learning to the best of my abilities  that i have the happiness of mankind at heart and attempt in a historical manner to increase their knowledge in general and in particular to lead them to a pious contemplation and acknowledgment of gods unspeakable wisdom and goodness manifested in the works of the creation  show them the truth of the testimony of jesus christ concerning a divine providence immortality and a future state and that as virtue advances and improves human felicity augments and becomes a sure prognostic of that fullness of bliss which men of goodness and integrity are to enjoy without interruption frailty and infirmity in an unchangeable and everlasting life this was my scheme these things i had principally in view when to vindicate my character from misrepresentation and idle stories and to illustrate my memoirs of several ladies of great britain i sat down to write a true history of my life and notions you will see at once gentlemen that this is the labored part of my work were i able to write so as to persuade even a few to alter their way of living and employ their time for the future in forming and training up their moral powers to perfection i should think myself more fortunate and glorious than the greatest genius in the temple of fame indeed gentlemen fame or name in this world is not the thing i think of non est mortale quod opto i can say with lactantius and were it within my power to choose sure i am that i would be for ever unknown but that was impossible in justice to myself as before observed and that tradition might not hand me down when i am gone in that variety of bad and foolish characters which a malice that knows nothing of me whispers while i am living it was necessary i should tell my own story the relation was likewise requisite to render the memoirs before mentioned intelligible the volumes of that work which are to be published would be quite dark and not so grateful as intended without a previous account of the authors life  this gentlemen is the truth of the case and as i say as little of myself in my relation as i can and as much for true religion and useful learning as i was able i hope from your rectitude and judgment that you will get me a fair hearing and i call upon you as my patrons and the friends to learning and truth for your approbation of my good and pious intentions though you should not be able to say one word of any excellencies in my writings this is all i ask as i wish well to your cause the cause of virtue and letters and have chiefly endeavored according to my abilities to make my readers acquainted with the majesty of the deity and his kingdom and the greatness of his excellency before whom all the inhabitants of the earth all powers and principalities are as nothing i hope you will in return favor me with your best wishes  as to some strange things you will find in the following journal and a life in various particulars quite contrary to the common course of action i can assure you gentlemen in respect of the strange things that however wonderful they may appear to you yet they are exclusive of a few decorations and figures necessary in all works strictly true and as to the difference of my life from that of the generality of men let it only be considered that i was born in london and carried an infant to ireland where i learned the irish language and became intimately acquainted with its original inhabitants  that i was not only a lover of books from the time i could spell them to this hour but read with an extraordinary pleasure before i was twenty the works of several of the fathers and all the old romances which tinged my ideas with a certain piety and extravagance that rendered my virtues as well as my imperfections particularly mine  that by hard measure i was compelled to be an adventurer when very young and had not a friend in the universe but what i could make by good fortune and my own address  that my wandering life wrong conduct and the iniquity of my kind with a passion for extraordinary things and places brought me into several great distresses and that i had quicker and more wonderful deliverances from them than people in tribulation generally receive  that the dull the formal and the visionary the hardhonest man and the poorliver are a people i have had no connection with but have always kept company with the polite the generous the lively the rational and the brightest freethinkers of this age  that beside all this i was in the days of my youth one of the most active men in the world at every exercise and to a degree of rashness often venturous when there was no necessity for running any hazards in diebus illis i have descended headforemost from a high cliff into the ocean to swim when i could and ought to have gone off a rock not a yard from the surface of the deep  i have swam near a mile and a half out in the sea to a ship that lay off went on board got clothes from the mate of the vessel and proceeded with them to the next port while my companion i left on the beach concluded me drowned and related my sad fate in the town  i have taken a cool thrust over a bottle without the least animosity on either side but both of us depending on our skill in the small sword for preservation from mischief  such things as these i now call wrong and mention them only as samples of a rashness i was once subject to as an opportunity happened to come in the way let all these things be taken into the account and i imagine gentlemen that what may at first sight seem strange and next to incredible will on considering these particulars not long remain so in your opinion though you may think the relator an odd man as to that i have nothing to say and if oddness consists in spirit freedom of thought and a zeal for the divine unity in a taste for what is natural antique romantic and wild in honoring women who are admirable for goodness letters and arts and in thinking after all the scenes i have gone through that every thing here is vanity except that virtue and charity which gives us a right to expect beyond the grave and procures us in this world the direction of infinite wisdom the protection of infinite power and the friendship of infinite goodness  then may it be written on my stone  here lies an odd man  thus much gentlemen i thought proper to say to you that by being acquainted with the particulars relative to the complexion and design of the author you might the easier and the better comprehend the various things you will find in the work he dedicates to you  i have only to add that i wish you all happiness that your heads may lack no ointment and your garments be always white and odoriferous but especially may you press on like true critics toward perfection and may bliss glory and honor be your reward and your portion  barbican aug        contents n b what refers to the notes is distinguished thus     introduction  page     a

that the transactions of my life and the observations and reflections i have made on men and things by sea and land in various parts of the world might not be buried in oblivion and by length of time be blotted out of the memory of men it has been my wont from the days of my youth to this time to write down memorandums of every thing i thought worth noticing as men and matters books and circumstances came in my way and in hopes they may be of some service to my fellowmortals i publish them some pleasing and some surprising things the reader will find in them he will meet with miscellany thoughts upon several subjects he will read if he pleases some tender stories but all the relations the thoughts the observations are designed for the advancement of valuable learning and to promote whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report    a reflection about fifty years ago the midwife wheeled me in and much sooner than half a century hence in all human probability death will wheel me out when heaven pleases i am satisfied life and death are equally welcome because equally parts of my way to eternity my lot has been a swarthy one in this first state and i am in hopes i shall exchange worlds to advantage as god without all peradventure brought his moral creatures into being in order to increase their virtue and provide suitable happiness for the worthy the most unfortunate here may expect immutable felicity at last if they have endeavored in proportion to what power they had to render themselves useful and valuable by a sincerity and benevolence of temper a disinterestedness a communicativeness and the practice of those duties to which we are obliged by the frame of our nature and by the relations we bear to god and to the subjects of his government  for my part i confess that many have been the failings of my life and great the defects of my obedience but in the midst of all my failings and imperfections my soul has always sympathised with the afflicted and my heart has ever aked for the miseries of others my hand has often relieved when i wanted the shilling to comfort my self and when it has not been in my power to relieve i have grieved for the scanty accommodations of others many troublesome and expensive offices i have undertaken to do good to men and ever social and free have i been in my demeanor easy and smooth in my address and therefore i trust that whenever i am removed from this horizon it will be from a dark and cloudy state to that of joy light and full revelation this felicitates my every day let what will happen from without this supports me under every affliction and enables me to mentain a habit of satisfaction and joy in the general course of my life    went to the university in    0 the things of my childhood are not worth setting down and therefore i commence my life from the first month of the seventeenth year of my age when i was sent to the university and entered a pensioner though i had a larger yearly allowance than any fellowcommoner of my college i was resolved to read there and determined to improve my natural faculties to the utmost of my power nature i was sensible had bestowed no genius on me this and understanding are only the privilege of extraordinary persons who receive from heaven the happy conjunction of qualities that they may execute great and noble designs and acquire the highest pitch of excellence in the profession they turn to if they will take the pains to perfect the united qualities by art and carefully avoid running into caprice and paradox the rocks on which many a genius has split but then i had a tolerable share of natural understanding and from my infancy was teachable and always attentive to the directions of good sense this i knew might rise with some labor to a half merit though it could never gain immortality upon any account and this was enough for me i wanted only to acquire such degrees of perfections as lay within the small sphere nature had chalked out for me    a collegelife to this purpose i devoted my collegelife to books and for five years that i resided in the university conversed so much with the dead that i had very little intercourse with the living so totally had letters engaged my mind that i was but little affected toward most other things walking and music were my favorite recreations and almost the only ones i delighted in i had hardly a thought at that time of the foolish choises and pursuits of men those fatal choices and pursuits which are owing to false judgments and to a habit of acting precipitantly without examining the fancies and appetites and therefore very rarely went into the pleasures and diversions which men of fortune in a university too commonly indulge in my relaxation after study was my germanflute and the conversation of some ingenious sober friend generally my private tutor who was a bright and excellent man and if the weather permitted i walked out into the country several miles at this exercise i had often one or other with me but for the most part was obliged to go alone my dog and my gun however were diversion enough on the way and they frequently led me into scenes of entertainment which lasted longer than the day some of them you will find in this journal the history of the beautiful harriot noel you shall have by and by    a course of reading in a college at present my scheme requires me to set down the method i pursued in my readings and let my reader know the issue of my studies  my time i devoted to philosophy cosmography mathematics and the languages for four years and the fifth i gave to history  of mr lockes essay the first book i took into my hand after receiving my note of admission was the essay of that fine genius mr lock and i was so pleased with this clear and accurate writer that i looked into nothing else by reading it three times over i had made a thorough acquaintance with my own understanding he taught me to examine my abilities and enabled me to see what objects my mind was fitted to deal with he led me into the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance and showed me how greatly true knowledge depended on a right meaning of words and a just significancy of expression in sum from the essay my understanding received very great benefits and to it i owe what improvement i have made in the reason given me if i could i would persuade all young gentlemen to read it over and over with great attention and i am sure they would find themselves very richly rewarded for their pains in reading it they would acquire that justness and truth of understanding which is the great perfection of rational beings    natural philosophy when i had done for a time with this admirable essay i then began to study the first principles of things the structure of the universe the contexture of human bodies the properties of beasts the virtues of plants and the qualities of metals and was quite charmed with the contemplation of the beautiful order and wise final causes of nature in all her laws and productions the study had a delightful influence on the temper of my mind and inspired into it a love of order in my heart and in my outward manners it likewise led me to the great first cause and in repeated views of harmony wisdom and goodness in all the works of nature rivited upon my mind a fixed conviction that all is under the administration of a general mind as far remote from all malice as from all weakness whether in respect of understanding or of power this gave me a due affection toward the infinitely perfect parent of nature and as i contemplated his glorious works i was obliged in transports to confess that he deserved our love and admiration this did also satisfy me that whatever the order of the world produces is in the main both just and good and of consequence that we ought in the best manner to support whatever hardships are to be endured for virtues sake that acquiescence and complacency with respect to ill accidents ill men and injuries ought to be our part under a perfect administration and with benignity and constancy we must ever act if there be a settled persuasion that all things are framed and governed by a universal mind  such was the effect the study of natural philosophy had upon my soul it set beyond all doubt before me the moral perfection of the creator and governor of the universe and if this almighty god i said is perfect wisdom and virtue does it not follow that he must approve and love those who are at due pains to improve in wisdom  and what he loves and delights in must he not make happy this is an evident truth it renders the cause of virtue quite triumphant    moral philosophy but upon ethics or moral philosophy i dwelt the longest this is the proper food of the soul and what perfects her in all the virtues and qualifications of a gentleman this science i collected in the first place from the ancient sages and philosophers and studied all the moral writers of greece and rome with great pleasure i saw that these immortal authors had delineated as far as human reason can go that course of life which is most according to the intention of nature and most happy had shown that this universe and human nature in particular was formed by the wisdom and counsel of a deity and that from the constitution of our nature various duties arose  that since god is the original independent being complete in all possible perfection of boundless power wisdom and goodness the creator contriver and governor of this world to whom mankind are indebted for innumerable benefits most gratuitously bestowed we ought to manifest the most ardent love and veneration toward the deity and worship him with affections of soul suited to the preeminence and infinite grandeur of the original cause of all ought to obey him as far as human weakness can go and humbly submit and resign ourselves and all our interests to his will continually confide in his goodness and constantly imitate him as far as our weak nature is capable this is due to that original most gracious power who formed us and with a liberal hand supplies us with all things conducive to such pleasure and happiness as our nature can receive  that in respect of mankind our natural sense of right and wrong points out to us the duties to be performed toward others and the kind affections implanted by nature excites us to the discharge of them that by the law of our constitution and nature justice and benevolence are prescribed and aids and an intercourse of mutual offices required not only to secure our pleasure and happiness but to preserve ourselves in safety and in life that the law of nature or natural right forbids every instance of injustice a violation of life liberty health property and the exercise of our honorable kind powers are not only a spring of vigorous efforts to do good to others and thereby secure the common happiness but they really procure us a joy and peace an inward applause and external advantages while injustice and malice anger hatred envy and revenge are often matter of shame and remorse and contain nothing joyful nothing glorious in the greatest affluence the savage men are miserable  that as to ourselves the voice of reason declares that we ought to employ our abilities and opportunities in improving our minds to an extensive knowledge of nature in the sciences and by diligent meditation and observation acquire that prudence justice temperance and fortitude which should constantly govern our lives  that solid prudence which abhors rashness inconsiderateness a foolish selfconfidence and craft and under a high sense of moral excellence considers and does what is really advantageous in life  that justice which constantly regards the common interest and in subserviency to it gives to each one whatever is due to him upon any natural claim  that temperance which restrains and regulates the lower appetites and displays the grace and beauty of manners  and that fortitude which represses all vain and excessive fears gives us a superiority to all the external accidents of our mortal state and strengthens the soul against all toils or dangers we may be exposed to in discharge of our duty as an early and painful death with virtue and honor is highly preferable to the longest ignominious life and no advantages can be compared in point of happiness with the approbation of god and of our own hearts  that if in this manner we live prepared for any honorable services to god our fellows and ourselves and practice piety toward god good will toward men and immediately aim at our own perfection then we may expect notwithstanding our being involved in manifold weaknesses and disorders of soul that the divine goodness and clemency will have mercy on such as sincerely love him and desire to serve him with duty and gratitude will be propitious and placable to the penitents and all who exert their utmost endeavors in the pursuits of virtue and since the perfection of virtue must constitute the supreme felicity of man our efforts to attain it must be effectual in obtaining complete felicity or at least some lower degree of it    of revealed religion this beautiful moral philosophy i found scattered in the wtitings of the old theist philosophers and with great pains reduced the various lessons to a system of active and virtuous offices but this i knew was what the majority of mankind were incapable of doing and if they could do it i saw it was far inferior to revelation every sunday i appropriated to the study of reveled religion and perceived as i read the sacred records that the works of plato and cicero and epictetus and all the uninspired sages of antiquity were but weak rules in respect of the divine oracles it is the mercy and power of god in the triumphs of grace that restores mankind from the bondage and ignorance of idolatry to this the sinner owes the conversion of his soul it is the statutes of the lord that rejoice the heart and enlighten the eyes what are all the reasonings of the philosophers to the melody of that heavenly voice which cries continually come unto me all ye that travel and are heavy laden and i will refresh you  and what could their lessons avail without those express promises of grace and spiritual assistance which the blood of the new covenant confirms to mankind the philosophy of greece and rome was admirable for the times and men but it admits of no comparison with the divine lessons of our holy religion and the charter of gods pardon granted to us by his blessed son beside the philosophers were in some degree dark and doubtful in respect of death and futurity and in relation to this world there is not a power in their discourses to preserve us from being undone by allurements in the midst of plenty and to secure our peace against the casualties of fortune and the torments of disappointments to save us from the cares and sollicitudes which attend upon large possessions and give us a mind capable of relishing the good things before us to make us easy and satisfied as to the present and render us secure and void of fear as to the future these things we learn from revelation and are informed by the sacred records only that if we are placed here in the midst of many fears and sorrows and are often perplexed with evils in this world yet they are so many warnings not to set up our rest here but to keep a steadfast eye upon the things which god has prepared for those who love him it is the gospel informs us there is another scene prepared for the moral world and that justice only waits to see the full proof of the righteousness or unrighteousness of men that that scene will open with the judgment seat of christ and we shall either receive glory and immortality if we have obeyed the calls of grace to virtue and holiness  or be doomed to the most dreadful miseries if we reject the counsel of god and live quite thoughtless of the great concerns of eternity these considerations made me prefer reveled religion in the beginning of my rational life the morality of the ancient philosophers i admired with delight i studied their writings and received i gratefully confess much improvement from them but the religion of our blessed lord i declared for and look on the promised messiah as the most consummate blessing god could bestow or man receive god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning every one of you from your iniquities and would men but hear and obey this lifegiving redeemer his gospel would restore reason and religion to their rightful authority over mankind and make all virtue and true goodness flourish in the earth    of false religion but i must observe that by the religion of the new testament i do not mean any of those modern schemes of religion which discover the evident marks and signatures of superstition and enthusiasm or of knavery and imposture those systems which even miracles cannot prove to be true because the pieties are absurd inconsistent and contradictory the notions that are not characterized by the reason of things and the moral fitness of actions i considered as repugnant to the veracity wisdom and goodness of the almighty and concluded that that only could be christian religion which beared the visible marks and signatures of benevolence social happiness and moral fitness and was brought down from heaven to instruct mankind in the worship of one eternal mind and bring them to repentance and amendment of life this was the religion i found in my bible i saw with pleasure as i thoughtfully went through the divine pages that natural religion is the foundation and support of revelation  supplies the defects of nature but never attempts to overthrow the established principles of it  casts new light upon the dictates of reason but never overthrows them pure theism and christ the appointed mediator advocate and judge by a commission from god the father to me appeared to be the gospel  and the directions of the holy spirit to believe in one supreme independent first cause and worship in spirit and truth this one god and father of all in the name of christ jesus as the disciples of the messiah to copy after the life of our blessed savior and to the utmost of our abilities obey all his commands  this was the religion i found in the writings of the apostles and i then determined to regard only this gospeldoctrine    cosmography and mathematics the manner of my studying cosmography and mathematics is not worth setting down as there was nothing uncommon in it in the one i only learned to distinguish climates latitudes and the four divisions of the world the provinces nations kingdoms and republics comprised therein and to be able to discourse upon them  and in the other i went no further than to make myself a master of vulgar and decimal arithmetic the doctrine of infinite series and the application of algebra to the higher geometry of curves algebra i was charmed with and found so much pleasure in resolving its questions that i have often sat till morning at the engaging work without a notion of its being day till i opened the shutters of my closet i recommend this study in particular to young gentlemen and am satisfied if they would but take some pains at first to understand it they would have so great a relish for its operations as to prefer them many an evening to the clamorous pleasures or at least not be uneasy for being alone now and then since their algebra was with them   0 method of reading history in reading history my last years principal employment during my residence in college i began with the best writers of ancient history and ended with modern times epochs centuries ages the extent of empires kingdoms commonwealths their progress revolutions changes and declensions the number order and qualities of the princes that have reigned over those states and kingdoms their actions military and civil the characters and actions of the great men that flourished under them and the laws the arts learning and manners i carefully marked down and observed not only how the first governments were formed but what the progress was of industry and property which may be called the generative principle of empire  when i had done with ancient history i sat down to the best modern stories i could get and read of distant nations before i began to study my countrys constitution history and laws when i had finished the histories of france and spain and italy and germany and many more then i turned to great britain and in the first place took a view of the english constitution and government in the ancient books of the common law and some more modern writers who out of them have given an account of this government from thence i proceeded to our history and with it joined in every kings reign the laws then made this gave me an insight into the reason of our statutes and showed me the true ground upon which they came to be made and what weight they ought to have by this means i read the history of my country with intelligence and was able to examine into the excellence or defects of its government and to judge of the fitness or unfitness of its orders and laws by this method i did likewise know enough of the law for an english gentleman though quite ignorant of the chicane or wrangling and captious part of the law and was well acquainted with the true measure of right and wrong the arts how to avoid doing right and to secure ones self in doing wrong i never looked into     a reflection on history thus did i read history and many noble lessons i learned from it just notions of true worth true greatness and solid happiness it taught me to place merit where it only lies not in birth not in beauty not in riches not in external show and magnificence not in voluptuousness but in a firm adherence to truth and rectitude in an untainted heart that would not pollute or prostitute its integrity in any degree to gain the highest worldly honors or to ward off the greatest worldly misery this is true magnanimity and he alone can be truly happy as well as truly great who can look down with generous contempt upon every thing that would tempt him to recede in the smallest degree from the paths of rigid honesty candor and veracity  es modicus

your desires frugal and obliging to your friends do you know when to spare and when to be liberal as occasion requires and can you give a check to your avarice in spite of all temptations which are laid in your way can you refrain from being too greedy in your pursuits after riches when you can sincerely affirm that you are master of your self and of all these good qualities then you are free indeed and wise by the propitious power of jove and the praetor  but if you retain the old habits of a slave and harbor ill qualities under the hypocritical appearance of virtue you are as much a slave as ever while thus enslaved to your vices philosophy gives no indulgence to vice  makes no allowance for any crime if in wagging your finger you acted against reason you transgress though the thing be of so trifling a nature all the sacrifices you can offer will never pass for a dram of rectitude while your conduct is faulty wisdom is incompatible with folly  when to be bountiful and when to spare and never craving or oppressed with care the baits of gifts and money to despise and look on wealth with undesiring eyes when thou can truly call these virtues thine be wise and free by heavens consent and mine but thou who lately of the common strain were one of us if still thou do retain the same ill habits the same follies too glossd over only with a saintlike show then i resume the freedom which i gave still thou art bound to vice and still a slave thou can not wag thy finger or begin the least slight motion but it tends to sin how is this not wag my finger he replies no friend not fuming gums nor sacrifice can ever make a madman free or wise virtue and vice are never in one soul a man is wholly wise or wholly is a fool this is the great lesson that virtue alone is true honor true freedom and solid durable happiness it is indeed its own reward there are no satisfactions equal to or comparable with virtuous rational exercises nor can virtuous dispositions and well improved moral powers be rewarded or receive happiness suited to their nature but from their exercises and employments about proper objects and as virtue gives pleasure here in proportion to the improvements it makes far beyond all that mere sense can yield in the most advantageous circumstances of outward enjoyment so in a state to come it shall be so placed as its improvements require that is be placed in circumstances that shall afford it business or employment proportioned to its capacity and by means thereof the highest satisfaction  such a basis for building moral instructions upon we find in history we are warned in some pages to avoid the miseries and wretchedness which many have fallen into by departing from reason or virtue  and in others we meet with such virtuous characters and actions as set forth the charms of integrity in their full luster and prove that virtue is the supreme beauty the supreme charm that in keeping the precepts of moral rectitude we secure a present felicity and reward and have a presage of those higher rewards which await a steady course of right conduct in another world  glorious natural virtue would mankind but hearken to its voice and obey its dictates there would be no such beings as invaders delinquents and traitors in this lower world the social inclinations and dispositions would for ever prevail over the selfish appetites and passions the law of benevolence would be the rule of life the advancement of the common good would be the work of every man     a reflection on government and religion the case however is that the generality of mankind are too corrupt to be governed by the great universal law of social nature and to gratify ambition avarice and the like employ a cunning or power to seize the natural rights and properties of others and therefore to natural virtue grounded on the reason and fitness of things in themselves the first and principal mean of securing the peace and happiness of society it was necessary to add two other grand principles civil government and religion and so have three conducible means to social happiness these three are necessary to the being of a public and of them religion as i take it is of the first consequence for the choice few only mind a natural virtue or benevolence flowing from the reason nature and fitness of things and civil government cannot always secure the happiness of mankind in particular cases but religion rightly understood and fixed upon its true and proper foundation might do the work in conjunction with the other two principles and secure the happiness of society if mankind were brought to the belief and worship of one only true god and to a sincere obedience to his will as we have it discovered in revelation i think appetite and passion would cease to invade by violence or fraud or set up for private interest in opposition to the public stock or common good but alas religion is so far from being rightly understood that it is rendered by some explainers the most doubtful and disputable thing in the world they have given it more phases than the moon and made it every thing and nothing while they are screaming or forcing the people into their several factions this destroys the moment of religion and the multitude are thereby wandered into endless mazes and perplexities and rendered a hairing staring wrathful rabble instead of being transformed into such christians as filled the first church at jerusalem christians who acknowledged and worshipped god the father almighty in the name of christ that is under a belief of that authority and power which the father of the universe has for the good of mankind conferred upon him and in humility and meekness in mortification and selfdenial in a renunciation of the spirit wisdom and honors of this world in a love of god and desire of doing gods will and seeking only his honor were by the gospel made like unto christ golden religion golden age the doctrine of christianity was then a restoration of true religion the practice of christianity a restoration of human nature but now alas too many explainers are employed in darkening and making doubtful the reveled will of god and by paraphrases expositions commentaries notes and glosses have almost rendered revelation useless what do we see in the vast territories of popery but a perfect diabolism in the place of the religion of our lord doctrines the most impious and absurd the most inconsistent and contradictory in themselves the most hurtful and mischievous in their consequences the whole supported by persecution by the sophistry of learned knaves and the tricks of juggling priests and if we turn our eyes from these regions of imposture and cruelty to the realms of protestants do we not find some learned christian crities and expositors reducing the inspired writings to a dark science without regard to the nature and intrinsic character of their doctrines do they not advance notions as true and divine which have not one appearance of divine authority but on the contrary mililitate with the reason of things and the moral fitness of actions and are so far from being plain and clear free from all doubtfulness or ambiguity and suited to the understandings and capacity of men that the darkness of them renders such pretended revelations of little service and impeaches the veracity wisdom and goodness of god alas too many explainers are clamorous under the infallible strength of their own persuasions and exert every power to unman us into believers how the apostles argued for the great excellency and dignity of christianity is not with them the question so far as i am able to judge from their learned writings but the fathers and our spiritual superiors have put upon the sacred writings the proper explications and we must receive the truth as they dispense it to us this is not right in my conception i own it does not seem to answer the end of the messiahs coming which was to restore reason and religion to their rightful authority over mankind and to make all virtue and true goodness flourish in the earth the most perfect blessing to be sure that god could bestow on man or man receive from god this blessing we must miss if human authority is to pin us down to what it pleases to call sense of scripture and will set up the judgment of fallible men as the test of christianity the christian laity are miserable indeed if they be put under an obligation to find that to be truth which is taught by these leaders in truth we should be unhappy men with a revelation in our churches and our closets if the leaders had a right to make their own faith pass for the faith of the apostles or if we refused it might lance the weapons of this world at their people what must we do then as true christians i think for my self that we ought to form our judgment in matters of faith upon a strict serious and impartial examination of the holy scriptures without any regard to the judgment of others or human authority whatever that we ought to open the sacred records without minding any systems and from the reveled word of god learn that christianity does not consist in a jingle of unintelligible sounds and new fundamentals hewn out by craft enthusiasm or bigotry and maintained with an outrage of uncharitable zeal which delivers christians to the flames of an eternal hell but that the heavenly religion of our lord consists in looking on the promised messiah as the most consummate blessing god could bestow or man receive and that jesus is that messiah in acting according to the rules of the gospel and in studying to imitate god who is the most perfect understanding nature in all his moral perfections in becoming the children of god by being according to our capacity perfect as he is perfect and holy as he is holy and merciful as he is merciful and in our whole moral behavior as like to him as possible  in a word to flee injustice oppression intemperance impurity pride unmercifulness revenge  to practice justice piety temperance chastity humility beneficence placability  to turn from our iniquities to the practice of all virtue and through the alone mediation of the onlybegotten son of god believe in and worship the eternal mind the one supreme spirit in hope of a glorious immortality through the sanctification of the holy ghost  these are the things the lord came down to teach mankind for the new testament itself then we must declare and look upon it as the only guide or rule of faith it is now the only deliverer of the declarations of our lord and the rule in our enquiry is that every thing necessary to be believed by a christian is in those books not left to be gathered by consequences or implications but the things necessary to obtain the favor of god promised to christians are expressly declared if this was not the case  if things absolutely necessary were not expressly proclaimed to be so the gospel revelation would be no rule at all to the plain and satisfactory method of seeking for the faith in the sacred books there are many adversaries and many objections raised there are says a great man a very numerous body of christians who know no other guides but the living guides of the present church and acknowledge no other faith for the faith once delivered to the saints but that which is now delivered to them by their present rulers as such  to establish this point the greater part of these lay down the infallibility of the present church and of every man of the past ages through whose mouth or by whose hands the present traditions of faith have descended to them and this indeed would be a very good method if that single proof of infallibility could be proved but this is a point so gross and so utterly void of all proof that a great body of the christian world have broke loose from the power of this monster and declared for the new testament itself as the only guide or rule of faith the only deliverer of the faith to us of later ages  when this comes however to be put in practice too many of the same persons who set the scriptures up as the only guide turn round on a sudden and let us know that they mean by it not these sacred original writings themselves but the interpretations or sense put upon them by our spiritual superiors to which we are bound to submit and put under an obligation to find that to be the truth which is taught by these leaders  but to this we reply with reason that though we ought to pay a regard of serious attention to those whose business it is to find out and dispense the truth and show the respect of a due examination of what they affirm yet we must not yield the submission due only to infallibility it is our glory not to submit to the voice of any man we must reserve that regard for god and for christ in matters of faith once delivered to the saints  others again of the reformed tell us that the surer way of knowing what was delivered near eighteen hundred years ago is to take the original faith from the councils and fathers grave and good men who met and writ for the settling of the faith  and to this we answer that these wise and good men cannot give so good an account of the faith contained in the original books as the books themselves which contain it  to give an example to the purpose if we would know the doctrine of the church of england at the reformation it is not the writings of any particular divines many years after that period that we must consult or any assembly of them but the authentic acts and declarations and sermons made and recorded at the time for many of the doctrines thought essential at the reformation have been since changed by gradual alterations  by explainers using their own style and manner of expression and introducing their own scheme of philosophy and judgment in commenting into the scheme of doctrine to be explained this produces great variation from what was once settled what was once esteemed fundamental is thereby altered  let this be applied to the first christian writers after the apostles were departed and as their language and philosophy were various and they differed from one another great variations must creep into the doctrines delivered by them it follows then that nothing but what is recorded in the first original books themselves can be firm and stable to us in points of faith in the original books only we can find the faith without that confusion and darkness which human explications and additions have brought in by way of light        the story of harriot noel but it is time to tell my reader the story of the beautiful harriot noel which i promised in my third memorandum  on the glorious first of august before the beasts were roused from their lodges or the birds had soared upwards to pour forth their morning harmony while the mountains and the groves were overshadowed by a dun obscurity and the dawn still dappled the drowsy east with spots of gray in short before the sun was up or with his auspicious presence began to animate inferior nature i left my chamber and with my gun and dog went out to wander over a pleasant country the different aspects and the various points of view were charming as the light in fleecy rings increased and when the whole flood of day descended the imbellished early scene was a fine entertainment delighted with the beauties of this morning i climbed up the mountains and traveled through many a valley the game was plenty and for full five hours i journeyed onward without knowing where i was going or thinking of a return to college  about nine oclock however i began to grow very hungry and was looking round to see if i could discover any proper habitation to my purpose when i observed in a valley at some distance something that looked like a mansion that way therefore i moved and with no little difficulty as i had a precipice to descend or must go a mile round to arrive at the place i wanted down therefore i marched got a fall by the way that had like to have destroyed me and after all found it to be a shed for cattle the bottom however was very beautiful and the sides of the hills sweetly copsed with little woods the valley is so divided that the rising sun gilds it on the right hand and when declining warms it on the left   veniens dextrum latus aspiciat sol laevum discedens curru fugiente vaporet a pretty brook here likewise babbles along and even hebrus strays not round thrace with a purer and cooler stream  fons etiam rivo dare nomen idoneus ut nec frigidior thracam nec purior ambiat hebrus  a country seat in this sweet and delicious solitude i crept on for some time by the side of the murmuring stream and followed as it winded through the vale till i came to a little harmonick building that had every charm and proportion architecture could give it it was situated on a rising ground in a broad part of the fruitful valley and surrounded with a garden that invited a pensive wanderer to roam in its delightful retreats and walks amazingly beautiful every side of this fine spot was planted thick with underwood and kept so low as not to prevent a prospect to every pleasing remote object  finding one of the garden doors left open i entered immediately and to screen my self from the scorching beams of the sun got into an imbowered way that led me to a large fountain in a ring or circular opening and from thence by a gradual easy shady ascent to a semicircular amphitheatre of evergreens that was quite charming in this were several seats for ease repast or retirement and at either end of it a rotunda or temple of the ionick order one of them was converted into a grotto or shellhouse in which a politeness of fancy had produced and blended the greatest beauties of nature and decoration the other was a library filled with the finest books and a vast variety of mathematical instruments here i saw miss noel sitting and so intent at writing that she did not take any notice of me as i stood at the window in astonishment looking at the things before me and especially at the amazing beauties of her face and the splendour of her eyes as she raised them now and then from the paper she writ on to look into a hebrew bible that lay open upon a small desk before her the whole scene was so very uncommon and so vastly amazing that i thought my self for a while on some spot of magic ground and almost doubted the reality of what my eyes beheld till miss noel by accident looked full at me and then came forward to the open window to know who i wanted  before i could answer i found a venerable old gentleman standing by my side and he seemed much more surprised at the sight of me than his daughter was for as this young lady told me afterward she guessed at once the whole affair seeing me with my gun and dog in a shooting dress and knew it was a natural curiosity brought me into the garden and stoped me at the window when i saw her in such an attitude and in such a place  this i assured them was the truth of my case with this small addition however that i was ready to perish for want of something to eat having been from four in the morning at hard exercise and had not yet broke my fast  if this be the case says the good old man you are welcome sir to edenpark and you shall soon have the best breakfast our house affords  upon this mr noel brought me into his house and the lovely harriot made tea for me and had such plenty of fine cream and extraordinary bread and butter set before me that i breakfasted with uncommon pleasure the honor and happiness of her company rendered the repast quite delightful there was a civility so very great in her manner and a social goodness so charming in her talk and temper that it was unspeakable delight to sit at table with her she asked me a number of questions relating to things and books and people and there was so much good sense in every inquiry so much good humor in her reflections and replications that i was entirely charmed with her mind and lost in admiration when i contemplated the wonders of her face and the beauties of her person  when breakfast was over it was time for me to depart and i made half a dozen attempts to rise from my chair but without her laying a rosy finger on me this illustrious maid had so totally subdued my soul and deprived me of all motive power that i sat like the renowned prince of the massagetes who was stiffened by enchantment in the apartment of the princess phedima as we read in amadis de gaul this miss noel saw very plain and in compassion to my misfortune generously threw in a hint now and then for a little farther conversation to color my unreasonable delay but this could not have been of service much longer as the clock had struck twelve if the old gentleman her father had not returned to us and told me he insisted on my staying to dine with him for he loved to take a glass after dinner with a facetious companion and would be obliged to me for my company at present mr noel continued you will excuse me sir as business engages me till we dine but my daughter will chat the hours away with you and show you the curiosities of her library and grott harriot will supply my place  this was a delightful invitation indeed and after returning my hearty thanks to the old gentleman for the favor he did me i addressed my self to miss noel when her father was gone and we were walking back to the library in the garden and told her ingenuously that though i could not be positive as to the situation of my soul whether i was in love with her or not as i never had experienced the passion before nor knew what it was to admire a woman having lived till that morning in a state of indifference to her sex yet i found very strange emotions within me and i was sure i could not leave her without the most lively and afflicting inquietude you will pardon i hope madam this effusion of my heart and suffer me to demonstrate by a thousand and a thousand actions that i honor you in a manner unutterable and from this time can imagine no happiness but with you  a conversation with miss noel in relation to the language of adam and the primaevity of the hebrew tongue sir this inimitable maid replied you are an entire stranger to me and to declare a passion on a few hours acquaintance must be either to try my weakness or because you think a young woman is incapable of relishing any thing but such stuff when alone in conversation with a gentleman i beg then i may hear no more of this and as i am sure you can talk upon many more rational subjects request your favor to give me your opinion on some articles in this hebrew bible you see lying open on the table in this room my father sir among other things he has taken great pains to instruct me in for several years that i have lived with him in a kind of solitary state since the death of my mother whom i lost when i was very young has taught me to read and understand this inspired hebrew book and says we must ascribe primaevity and sacred prerogatives to this language for my part i have some doubts as to this matter which i dare not mention to my father tell me if you please what you think of the thing  miss noel i answered since it is your command that i should be silent as to that flame your glorious eyes and understanding have lighted up in my soul like some superior nature before whom i am nothing silent i will be and tell you what i fancy on a subject i am certain you understand much better than i do my knowledge of the hebrew is but small though i have learned to read and understand the old testament in the antebabel language  my opinion on your question is that the biblical hebrew was the language of paradise and continued to be spoken by all men down to and at the time of moses writing the pentateuch and long after abraham though bred in chaldea could converse freely with the egyptians the sodomites and the king of gerar nor do we find that any variety of speech interrupted the commerce of his son isaac with the several nations around or that it ever stopped jacob in his travels nay the israelites in their journey through the deserts of arabia after they had been some hundred years in egypt though joined by a mixed multitude and meeting with diverse kinds of people had not corrupted their language and were easily understood because it was then the universal one the simplicity and distinctness of the hebrew tongue preserved its purity so long and so universally it could not well be degenerate till the knowledge of nature was lost as its words consist but of two or three letters and are perfectly well suited to convey sensible and strong ideas it was at the captivity the captivity began at nebuzaradans taking and burning the city and temple of jerusalem and sending zedekiah the last king in chains to nebuchadnezzar who ordered his children to be butchered before his face his eyes to be put out and then thrown into a dungeon where he died this happened before our lord     years after the flood      of the world         in the space of seventy years that the jews by temporising with the ignorant victors so far neglected the usage of their own tongue that none but the scribes or learned men could understand mosess books  this i confess miss noel said is a plausible account of the primaevity and preeminence of the sacred hebrew but i think it is not necessary the account should be allowed as fact as to its being the language in paradise this is not very probable as a compass of   00 years must have changed the first language very greatly by an increase of words and new inflections applications and constructions of them the few first inhabitants of the earth were occupied in few things and wanted not a variety of words but when their descendants invented arts and improved sciences they were obliged to coin new words and technical terms and by extending and transferring their words to new subjects and using them figuratively were forced to multiply the senses of those already in use the language to be sure was thus gradually cultivated and every age improved it all living languages are liable to such change i therefore conclude that the language which served the first pair would not do for succeeding generations it became vastly more copious and extensive when the numbers of mankind were great and their language must serve conversation and the ends of life and answer all the purposes of intelligence and correspondence new words and new terms of speech from time to time were necessary to give true ideas of the things actions offices places and times peculiar to the hebrews even hutchinson allows there was some coinage some new words framed we find in the latter prophets words not to be met with in the pentateuch and from thence we may suppose that moses used words unknown to nimrod and heber and that the men at shinaar shinaar comprehends the plains of chaldea or babylonia in asia and the men of shinaar were the first colony that noah sent out from ararat the mountains of armenia where the ark rested after the flood to settle in the grand plains of babylonia   00 miles from ararat this was in the days of peleg   0 years after the flood when the eight had increased to sixty thousand which made a remove of part of them necessary   had words which the people before the flood were strangers to even in the seventeenth century there must have been a great alteration in the language of adam and when the venerable patriarch and his family came into a new world that was in a different state from the earth before the deluge and saw a vast variety of things without precedent in the old world the alterations in nature and diet must introduce a multitude of new terms in things of common experience and usage as after that amazing revolution in the natural world not only the clouds and meteors were different and the souls that were saved had a new and astonishing view of the ruin and repair of the system but noah did then begin to be an husbandman he planted a vineyard he invented wine and to him the first grant was given of eating flesh all these things required as it were a new language and the terms to be sure with mankind increased the noachical language must be quite another thing after the great events of the flood had methuselah who conversed many years with adam who received from his mouth the history of the creation and fall and who lived  00 years with noah to communicate to him all the knowledge he got from adam had this antediluvian wise man been raised from the dead to converse with the postdiluvian fathers or even with noah the year he died that is   0 years after the flood is it not credible from what i have said that he would have heard a language very different from that tongue he used in his conversations with adam even in the   0th year of the first man longevity of the antediluvians the extraordinary longevity of the antideluvians is accounted utterly incredible by many moderns but it did not appear so unnatural to the early ages of paganism  let no one says josephus upon comparing the lives of the ancients with our lives and with the few years which we now live think that what we have said of them is false i have for witness to what i have said all those who have written antiquities both among the greeks and barbarians for even manetho who wrote the egyptian history and berosus who collected the chaldean monuments and mochus and hostiaeus and besides these hieronymus the egyptian and those who composed the phoenician history agree to what i here say hesiod also and hecutaeus and hallanicus and acusilaus and besides these ephorus and nicolaus of damascus relate that the ancients lived  000 years  the ancient latin authors likewise confirm the sacred history in this branch and varro in particular made an enquiry what the reason was that the ancients lived a  000 years  see a continuation of this  th note in the appendix    i imagine methuselah would not have been able to have talked with noah at the time i have mentioned of the circumstances that then made the case of mankind and of the things of common experience and usage he must have been unable to converse at his first appearance  what you say madam i replied is not only very probable but affords a satisfaction unexpected in a subject on which we are obliged for want of data to use conjectures i offer up to your superior sense the notion that the scriptures were wrote in the language of paradise most certain it is that even in respect of our own language for example the subjects of henry the  st would find it as much out of their power to understand the english of george the  sts reign were they brought up again as the ordinary people of our time are at a loss to make any thing of the english written in the  st henrys reign but when i have granted this you will be pleased to inform me how abraham and his sons conversed and commerced with the nations if the hebrew was not the universal language in their time if the miracle at babel was a confusion of tongues as is generally supposed how did the holy family talk and act with such distant kings and people illuminate me thou glorious girl in this dark article and be my teacher in hebrew learning as i flatter my self you will be the guide and dirigent of all my notions and my days yes charming harriot my fate is in your hands dispose of it as you will and make me what you please  you force me to smile the illustrious miss noel replied and oblige me to call you an odd compound of a man pray sir let me have no more of those romantic flights and i will answer your question as well as i can but it must be at some other time there is more to be said on the miracle at babel and its effects than i could dispatch between this and our hour of dining and therefore the remainder of our leisure till dinner we will pass in a visit to my grotto and in walking round the garden to the parlour we came from to the grotto then we went and to the best of my power i will give my reader a description of this splendid room  a description of miss noels grotto in one of the fine rotundas i have mentioned at one end of the green amphitheatre very lately described the shining apartment was formed miss noels hand had covered the floor with the most beautiful mosaic my eyes have ever beheld and filled the arched roof with the richest fossil gems the mosaic painting on the ground was wrought with small colored stones or pebbles and sharp pointed bits of glass measured and proportioned together so as to imitate in their assemblage the strokes and color of the objects which they were intended to represent and they represented by this ladys art the temple of tranquillity described by volusenus in his dream  the temple of tranquillity and a remarkable inscription at some distance the fine temple looks like a beautiful painted picture as do the birds the beasts the trees in the fields about it and the river which murmurs at the bottom of the rising ground amnis lucidus and vadosus in quo cernere erat varii generis pisces colludere so wonderfully did this genius perform the piece that fishes of many kinds seem to take their passtime in the bright stream but above all is the image of the philosopher at the entrance of the temple vastly fine with pebbles and scraps of glass all the beauties and graces are expressed which the pencil of an able artist could bestow on the picture of democritus you see him as diogenes ldertius has drawn him with a philosophical joy in his countenance that shows him superior to all events summum bonorum finem statuit esse laetitiam non eam quae sit eadem voluptati sed eam per quam animus degit perturbationis expers and with a finger he points to the following golden inscription on the portico of the temple  flagrans sit studium been merendi de seipso et seipsum perficiendi that is by a rectitude of mind and life secure true happiness and the applause of your own heart and let it be the labor of your every day to come as near perfection as it is possible for human nature to get this mosaic piece of painting is indeed an admirable thing it has a fine effect in this grotto and is a noble monument of the masterly hand of miss noel  nor was her fine genius less visible in the striking appearance of the extremely beautiful shells and valuable curiosities all round the apartment her father spared no cost to procure her the finest things of the ocean and rivers from all parts of the world and pebbles stones and ores of the greatest curiosity and worth these were all disposed in such a manner as not only shed a glorious luster in the room but showed the understanding of this young lady in natural knowledge  in one part of the grot were collected and arranged the stony coverings of all the shellfish in the sea from the striated patella and its several species to the pholades in all their species and of those that live in the fresh streams from the suboval limpet or umbonated patella and its species to the triangular and deeply striated cardia even all the landshells were in this collection from the pomatia to the roundmouthed turbo the most beautiful genera of the seashells intermixed with fossil corals of all the kinds with animal substances become fossil and with copperores agates pebbles pieces of the finest marmora and alabastritae and the most elegant and beautiful marcasites and chrystals and spars these filled the greatest part of the walls and in classes here and there were scattered as foils to raise the luster of the others the inferior shells  among the simple seashells that is those of one shell without a hinge i saw several rare ones that were neither in mrs oharas nor in mrs craftons grottos in fingal as i observed to those ladies i had once a sweet little country house in the neighborhood of those ladies and used to be often at their gardens and grottos mrs crafton had the finest shells but her grott was dull and regular and had no appearance of nature in the formation she was a pious plain refined lady but had not a fancy equal to the operation required in a shellhouse  the excellent the polite the wellbred the good and unfortunate mrs ohara had a glorious fancy she was a genius and had an imagination that formed a grotto wild and charming as calypsos her fancy did likewise form the garden in which the grotto stood near the margin of a flood into a paradise of delights many a pleasing solitary hour have i passed in this charming place and all at last i saw in ruins the garden in disorder  and every fine shell torn from the grotto  such are the changes and chances of this first state changes wisely designed by providence as warnings not to set up our rest here that we may turn our hearts from this world and with all our might labor for that life which shall never perish  what ruined mrs oharas grotto deprived me of my little green and shady retreat charles ohara this ladys husband a strange man from whom i rented my pretty farm and to whom i had paid a fine to lower the rent had mortgaged it unknown to me to the famous damer and that powerful man swallowed all all i had there was seized for arrears of interest due of mr ohara and as i was ever liable to distraining i took my leave of fingall    the shells i mean are the following ones  fine shells   the sea trumpet the seatrumpet which is in its perfect state nine inches long an inch

concha of venus was the next shell in this young ladys collection that engaged my attention one of them was three inches long and two and a half in diameter the valves were unequal and in longitudinal

finely intermixed with white these lips do not unite in the middle but have slender and beautiful spines round about the truncated ends of the shell this shell of venus is an american and valued by the collectors at a high rate    the hammer oyster but of all the curious shells in this wonderful collection the hammer oyster was what i wondered at most it is the most extraordinary shell in the

diameter what answered to the head of the pickax was seven inches long and three quarters of an inch in diameter this head terminates at each end in a narrow obtuse point is uneven at the edges

color without is a fine mixture of brown and purple and within a pearly white with a tinge of purple this rare shell is an eastindian and whenever it appears at an auction is rated very high i have known ten guineas given for a perfect one   with a large quantity of these most beautiful shells which are rarely seen in any collections and with all the family of the pectens the cardiae the solens the cylindri the murexes the turbines the buccina and every species of the finest genera of shells miss noel formed a grotto that exceeded every thing of the kind i believe in the world all i am sure that i have seen except the late mrs harcourts in richmondshire which i shall give my reader a description of when i travel him up those english alps it was not only that miss noels happy fancy had blended all these things in the wildest and most beautiful disposition over the walls of the rotunda but her fine genius had produced a variety of grotts within her grotto and falling waters and points of view in one place was the famous atalanta and her delightful cave and in another part the goddess and ulyssess son appeared at the entrance of that grott which under the appearance of a rural plainness had every thing could charm the eye the roof was ornamented with shellwork the tapestry was a tender vine and limpid fountains sweetly purled round  an image of epictetus and a remarkable legend but what above all the finely fancyed works in miss noels grotto pleased me was a figure of the philosopher epictetus in the center of the grott he sat at the door of a cave by the side of a falling water and held a book of his philosophy in his hand that was written in the manner of the ancients that is on parchment rolled up close together he appeared in deep meditation and as part of the book had been unwrapped and gradually extended from his knee on the ground one could read very plain in large greek characters about fifty lines the english of the lesson was this  the master science all things have their nature their make and form by which they act and by which they suffer the vegetable proceeds with perfect insensibility the brute possesses a sense of what is pleasurable and painful but stops at mere sensation the rational like the brute has all the powers of mere sensation but enjoys a farther transcendent faculty to him is imparted the masterscience of what he is where he is and the end to which he is destined he is directed by the cannon of reason to reverence the dignity of his own superior character and never wretchedly degrade himself into natures to him subordinate the master science he is told consists in having just ideas of pleasures and pains true notions of the moments and consequences of different actions and pursuits whereby he may be able to measure direct or control his desires or aversions and never merge into miseries remember this arrianus then only you are qualified for life when you are able to oppose your appetites

piety that love that justice that veracity that gratitude that benevolence which are the glory of human kind whatever is fated in that order of incontroulable events by which the divine power

only end of your existence is the due performance of the part allotted you  old mr noels character such was miss noels grotto and with her if it had been in my power to choose i had rather have passed in it the day in talking of the various fine subjects it contained than go in to dinner which a servant informed us was serving up just as i had done reading the above recited philosophical lesson back then we returned to the parlour and there found the old gentleman we sat down immediately to two very good dishes and when that was over mr noel and i drank a bottle of old alicant though this gentleman was upwards of eighty yet years had not deprived him of reason and spirits he was lively and sensible and still a most agreeable companion he talked of greece and rome as if he had lived there before the era of christianity the court of augustus he was so far from being a stranger to that he described the principal persons in it their actions their pleasures and their caprices as if he had been their contemporary we talked of all these great characters we went into the the gallery of verres we looked over the ancient theaters several of the most beautiful passages in the roman poets this fine old man repeated and made very pleasant but moral remarks upon them  the cry said he still is as it was in the days of horace   o cives cives quaerenda pecunia primum virtus post nummos  unde habeas nemo quaerit sed oportet habere quorum animis a prima lanugine non insedit illud and what catullus told his lesbia is it not approved to this day by the largest part of the great female world  vivamus mea lesbia atque amemus rumoresque senium severiorum omnes unius aestimemus assis soles occidere et redire possunt nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux nox est perpetua una dormiendo haec discunt omnes ante alpha and beta puellae the girls all learns this lesson before their a b c and as to the opinion of the poet it shows how sadly the augustan age with all its learning and polite advantages was corrupted and as virgil makes a jest of his own fine description of a paradise or the elysian fields as is evident from his dismissing his hero out of the ivory gate which shows he was of the school of epicurus it is from these things manifest that we can never be thankful enough for the principles and dictates of reveled religion we can never sufficiently adore the goodness of the most glorious eternal for the gospel of jesus christ which opens the unbounded regions of eternal day to the virtuous and charitable and promises them a rest from labor and ever blooming joys while it condemns the wicked to the regions of horror and solid darkness that dreadful region from whence the cries of misery for ever ascend but can never reach the throne of mercy  o heavenly religion designed to make men good and for ever happy that preserves the dignity of human nature  guards and increases virtue  and brings us to the realms of perfect reason and excellent glory  but continued this fine old gentleman tibulius has ever pleased me in the description of his mistress illam quicquid agit quoquo vestigia flectit componit furtim subsequiturque decor seu solvit crines fusis decet esse capillis seu compsit comptis est veneranda comis urit seu tyria voluit procedere pulla urit seu nivea candida vest venit talis in aeterno felix vertumnus olympo mill habet ornatus mill decenter habet   these elegant lines contain an inimitably beautiful description of outward grace and its charming effects upon all who see it such a grace without thinking of it every one should strive to have whatever they are doing they should make it habitual to them quintilian seems to have had these fine lines in view in his description of outward behavior neque enim gestum componi ad similitudinem saltationis volo sed subesse aliquid in hac exercitatione puerili unde nos non id agentes furtim decor ille discentibus traditus subsequatur cap  0  i am not for having the mein of a gentleman the same with that of a dancing master but that a boy while young should enter upon this exercise that it may communicate a secret gracefulness to his manner ever after  in this manner did the old gentleman and i pass the time till the clock struck five when miss noel came into the parlour again and her father said he must retire to take his evening nap and would see me at supper for with him i must stay that night harriot make tea for the gentleman i am your servant sir and he withdrew to harriot then my life and my bliss i turned and over a pot of tea was as happy i am sure as ever with his statira sat the conqueror of the world i began to relate once more the story of a passion that was to form one day i hoped my sole felicity in this world and with vows and protestations affirmed that i loved from my soul charming angel i said the beauties of your mind have inspired me with a passion that must increase every time i behold the harmony of your face and by the powers divine i swear to love you so long as heaven shall permit me to breath the vital air bid me then either live or die and while i do live be assured that my life will be devoted to you only  but in vain was all this warmth miss noel sat as unmoved as erycina on a monument and only answered with a smile since your days sir are in my disposal i desire you will change to some other subject and some article that is rational and useful otherwise i must leave the room  a second conversation with miss noel relating to the miracle at babel and the confusion of tongues to leave me i replied would be insupportable and therefore at once i have done if you please then madam we will consider the miracle at babel and enquire into the language of the world at that time allowing as you have proved in our late conversation that the language after the flood was quite another thing from that used in paradise and of consequence that moses did not write in that tongue which adam and eve conversed in nor is hebrew of that primevity which some great men affirm yet if there was a confusion of tongues at babel and many languages were spoken in the earth in the days of abraham then how did he and his sons converse so easily with the various nations they passed through and had occasional connexions with for my part i think with mr hutchinson that the divine interposition at babel was for quite another end to wit to confound their confession and cast out of their minds the name or object of it that a man might not listen to the lip or confession of his neighbor they were made to lose their own lip and to differ about the words of their atheistical confession  as to a confusion of confessions miss noel replied it appears to me to be a notion without any foundation to rest on the argument of hutchinson that the word shephah the name for a lip when used for the voice or speech is never once in the bible used in any other sense than for confession is not good because though shephah is often generally used for religious discourse or confession yet the phrases other lips and other tongues are also used for other languages utterances pronunciations dialects st paul   cor        applys shephah to language or dialect in his quotation from the prophet isaiah chapter    ver       he says in the law it is written with the words men of are not in the greek men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that they will not hear me  and the words of the prophet are speaking of christ promised with stammering lips and another tongue will be speak to this people it is evident from this that the hebrew word shephah here signifies tongues or languages and not confessions or discourse so the apostle applies it and explains the prophet and by stammering lips isaiah means the uncouth pronunciations of barbarous dialects or languages of the nations which must produce in strangers to them ridiculous lips or mouths and in this he refers undoubtedly to the stammering and strange sounds at the babelconfusion when god by a miracle and visible exhibition distorted their organs of speech and gave them a trembling hesitation and precipitancy as to vocal and other powers in short the miraculous gift of tongues would in some measure affect the saints in respect of pronunciation as the miracle of babel did the people of that place to this stammering or uncouth pronunciation of barbarous dialects the prophet ezekiel refers     ye are made to come upon the lip of the tongues that is ye are become a byeword even in the heathen gabble among the babbling nations where ye are in captivity  the author of letter and spirit says the word barbarous used in so many languages with only their respective different determinations for persons of strange or foreign tongues is a monument of the great confusion at babel this word being a corruption of the reduplicate chaldee word balbel by changing the l in each place into r  some say the word in the other languages is derived from the arabic barbar to murmur like some beast  scaliger defines it pronunciatio vitiosa and insuavis literasque male exprimens blaesorum balborumque more which was hitting upon the truth as to part of the original manner of the confusion indeed bloesus and balbus in latin are both derived in like manner from bal and balbel  the welsh has preserved a noble word for this barbarism of confused language in their compounded term baldwridd which is a plain compound of the hebrew bal and dahar without any other deflection from the original hebrew than that of changing the b in the latter member of the word dabar into the welsh w a letter of the same organ moreover from their said baldwridd and das we again derive our balderdash which therefore signifies strictly  a heap of confused or barbarous words like those of the gabble of dialects originally gendered at babel see letter and spirit chapter    by mr holloway a hutchinsonian it is very remarkable that this learned gentleman says he had been long of hutchinsons mind as to a confusion of confessions and not of tongues but on weighing the matter is now of another opinion p     therefore hutchinson not infallible out for once and as dr sharp well observes this may be an earnest of deserting hutchinson in other points of his new hypothesis see dr sharps two discourses on the hebrew tongue and character against mr holloway  his two discourses on elohim and defense  and his three discourses on cherubim  the hutchinsonians lay the stress of their hypothesis on the biblical hebrew being the language of adam in paradise and if this be taken from them they are left in a poor way   nor is this the only place in scripture where shephah lip signifies language pronunciations and dialects and where there is reference to the confusion of tongues at babel isaiah speaking of the privileges of the godly says  thou shall not see a fierce people of a deeper speech than thou can perceive of a deeper lip than thou can bear heb of a stammering or ridiculous tongue that thou can not understand this is enough in answer to mr hutchinson and his fautors in respect of what they say on the confusion at babel this proves that the word shephah lip signifies language utterance dialect as well as confession or discourse and therefore moses in his account of the miracle at babel might have meant a confusion of languages that he did mean this is plane not only from a tradition gone out into all the earth which is a matter of greater regard than mr hutchinsons fancy but because the sacred oracles allude to this event beside st paul aforementioned the royal prophet in psalm    ver   refers to the means of the division of tongues and denounces a curse in terms taken from that inflicted at babel swallow up o lord and divide their tongues this seems to describe the manner of that confusion  that the substance of the one language was sunk or swallowed up in a vast chaos of universal babble and that out of that jargon it was again by another act divided or broken into many particular dissonant dialects or tongues  all this i said is very just and gives me delight and satisfaction i am now convinced not only that hebrew was not the language of paradise or that adam did not speak the tongue the old world used immediately before the confusion at babel but likewise that the division there was a division and confusion of the one language then spoken and not a confusion of confessions as mr hutchinson affirms inform me however if you please what you mean by that tradition you mentioned which declared the miracle of babel was a confusion of languages  the jews tradition replied miss noel is preserved in their targum and tells us that the whole earth after the flood was of one speech or sort of words and when at their first remove from ararat they came to shinar they consulted to build them a city and a tower for an house of adoration whose head might reach to or be toward the heavens and to place an image of the host of heaven for an object of worship on the top of it and to put a sword in his hand that he might make war for them against the divine armies to prevent their dispersion over the whole earth whereupon the word of the lord was reveled from heaven to execute vengeance upon them and the lord corrupted their tongue broke their speech into seventy languages and scattered them over the face of the whole earth no one knew what his fellow said and they slew one another and ceased from building the city therefore he called the name of it babel because there the lord mingled together the tongues of all the inhabitants of the other this you read in the targum that was written before the days of jesus christ as the jews affirm or if not so early yet it is a very ancient book and the doctor who composed it must certainly know the meaning of the word shephah better than mr hutchinson it appears upon the whole that the argument of this famous modern is without foundation  it is indeed i answered but then i am not able to conceive how abraham and his sons conversed with so many nations  or how the hebrew that moses writ in was preserved illuminate me in these things illustrious harriot and from your fine understanding let me have the honor and happiness of receiving true hebrew lessons proceed i beseech you and stop not till you have expounded to my understanding the true nature of cherubim what do you think of mr hutchinsons rub and rubbim and of his notions of ezekiels cherubic form  to talk of cherubim and elohim resumed miss noel and say all that ought to be said to speak to any purpose of the three heads and four visages the bull the man the lion and the eagle mentioned in the prophet requires more knowledge in hebrew learning than i pretend to be mistress of and must take up more time than there is now to spare i may hereafter however if you should chance to come again to our house let you know my fancys upon these grand subjects and why i cannot accord with mr hutchinson and my father in their notion of the cherubims signifying the unity of the essence the distinction of the persons and mans being taken into the essence by his personal union with the second person whose constant emblem was the lion this i confess appears to my plain understanding very miserable stuff i can see no text either in the old testament or in the new for a plurality of beings coordinate and independent the sacred pages declare there is one original perfect mind the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day there shall be one lord and his name one says the prophet zechariah speaking of the prodigious revolution in the gentile world whence in process of time by the gospel of jesus christ the worship of one true god shall prevail all over the earth as universally as polytheism had done before  this i dare not observe to my father as he is an admirer of mr hutchinson and will not bear any contradiction but my private judgment is that mr hutchinson on the cherubim and elohim or eloim is a mad commentator as i may show you if we ever happen to meet again  at present all i can do more on the hebrew subject is to observe that in respect of the preservation of the hebrew tongue i imagine the one prevailing language before the miracle at babel which one language was afterward called hebrew though divided and swallowed as it were at the tower was kept without change in the line of shem and continued their tongue this cannot be disputed i believe i likewise imagine it must be allowed that this hebrew continued the vernacular tongue of the old canaanites it is otherwise unaccountable how the hebrew was found to be the language of the canaanites when the family of abraham came among them again after an absence of more than  00 years if they had had another tongue at the confusion was it possible for abraham during his temporary sojournments among them and in the necessities of his peregrination to persuade so many tribes to quit their dialect and learn his language  or if his influence had been so amazing can it be supposed they would not return again to their old language after he had left them and his family was away from them more than  00 years no sir we cannot justly suppose such a thing the language of the old canaanites could not be a different one from the hebrew if you will look into bochart the great samuel bochart was born at rouen in      and died suddenly in the academy at caen monday the   th of may      aged    he was the minister of the reformed church in that town  his principal works are his phaleg and canaan works that show an amazing erudition and ought to be well read by every gentleman you should likewise have his hierozoicon or history of animals mentioned in the sacred books it is a good supplement to his scripture geography his sermons and dissertations are also very valuable brieux writ the following fine epitaph on him scilicet haec cuique est data sors aequissima talis ut sit mors qualis vita peracta fuit musarum in gremio teneris qui vixit ab annis musarum in gremio debuit ille mori     you will find this was his opinion that great man says the antebabel language escaped the confusion two ways viz by the canaanites through gods providence preserving it in their colonies for the future use of the hebrews who were to possess the land and by the patriarch heber as a sacred depositum for the use of his posterity and of abraham in particular  this being the case the phenician or canaanitish tongue being the same language that the line of heber spoke with this only difference that by the latter it was retained in greater purity being in the mouths of a few and transmitted by instruction it follows that abraham and his sons could talk with all these tribes and communities and as to the other nations he had communication with he might easily converse with them as he was a syrian by birth and to be sure could talk the aramitish dialect as well as laban his brother the aramitish was the customary language of the line of shem it was their vulgar tongue the language of the old world that was spoken immediately before the confusion and was called hebrew from heber they reserved for sacred uses  here miss noel ended and my amazement was so great and my passion had risen so high for such uncommon female intelligence that i could not help snatching this beauty to my arms and without thinking of what i did impressed on her balmy mouth half a dozen kisses this was wrong and gave very great offense but she was too good to be implacable and on my begging her pardon and protesting it was not a wilful rudeness but the magic of her glorious eyes and the bright powers of her mind that had transported me beside my self she was reconciled and asked me if i would play a game of cards with delight i replied and immediately a pack was brought in we sat down to cribbage and had played a few games when by accident miss noel saw the head of my german flute which i always brought out with me in my walks and carried in a long pocket within side my coat you play sir i suppose on that instrument this lady said and as of all sorts of music this pleases me most i request you will oblige me with any thing you please in a moment i answered and taking from my pocket book the following lines i reached them to her and told her i had the day before set them to one of lullis airs and instantly began to breathe the softest harmony i could make   a song i almighty loves resistless rage no force can quell no art assuage while wit and beauty both conspire to kindle in my breast the fire the matchless shape the charming grace the easy air and blooming face each charm that does in flavia shine to keep my captive heart combine ii i feel i feel the raging fire and my soul burns with fierce desire thy freedom reason i disown and beautys pleasing chains

with beautys charms and give me flavia to my arms as this song is a short imitation of the   th ode of the first book of horace it is worth your while reader to see how mr francis has done the whole i will here set down a few lines urit me glycerae nitor splendentis pario marmore purius urit grata protervitas et vultus nimium lubricus aspici which lines are imitated in the first verse of the above song and a part of the second and the ingenious mr francis renders them in the following manner  again for glycera i burn and all my long forgotten flames return as parian marble pure and bright the shining maid my bosom warms her face too dazzling for the sight her sweet coquetting  how it charms in me tota ruens venus cyprum deseruit  of which the third verse of the song is an imitation  mr francis translates in the following manner  whole venus rushing through my veins no longer in her favorite cyprus reigns and  hic vivum mihi cespitem hic verbenas pueri ponite thuraque bimi cum patera meri mactata veniet laenior hostia which lines are imitated in the fourth verse of the song  mr francis translates as follows  here let the living altar rise adorned with every herb and flower here flame the incense to the skies and purest wines libation pour due honors to the goddess paid soft sinks to willing love the yielding maid you see in this the difference between a translation and an imitation    just as i was finishing this piece of music old mr noel came into the parlour in his wonted good humor and seemed very greatly pleased with me and my instrument he told me i was the young man he wanted to be acquainted with and that if it was no detriment to me i should not leave him this month to come come sir continued this fine old gentleman let me hear another piece of your music  vocal or instrumental  as you will for i suppose you sing as well as you play both you shall have sir i replied to the best of my abilities and by way of change i will give you first a song called the solitude  a song called the solitude i ye lofty mountains whose eternal snows like atlas seem to prop the distant skies while sheltered by your high and ample brows all natures beauties feast my ravished eyes and far beneath me over the distant plain the thunders break and rattling tempests reign ii here when aurora with her cheerful beam and rosy blushes marks approaching day often do i walk along the purling stream and see the bleating flocks around me stray the woods the rocks each charm that strikes my sight fills my whole breast with innocent delight iii here gaily dancing on the flowery ground the cheerful shepherds join their flute and voice while through the groves the woodland songs resound and fill the untroubled mind with peaceful joys music and love inspire the vocal plain alone the turtle tunes her plaintive strain iv here the green turf invites my wearied head on natures lap to undisturbed repose here gently laid to rest  each care is fled peace and content my happy eyelids close ye golden flattering dreams of state adieu as bright my slumbers are more soft than you v here free from all the tempests of the great craft and ambition can deceive no more beneath these shades i find a blessed retreat from envys rage secure and fortunes power here call the actions of past ages over or truths immortal source alone explore vi here far from all the busy worlds alarms i prove in peace the muses sacred leisure no cares within no distant sound of arms break my repose or interrupt my pleasure fortune and fame deceitful forms adieu the worlds a trifle far beneath my view this song delighted the old gentleman to a great degree he told me he was charmed with it not only for the fine music i made of it but the morality of it and liked me so much that i was most heartily welcome to make his solitary retreat my home as often and as long as i pleased and indeed i did so and continued to behave in such a manner that in two months time i gained so entirely his affections and so totally the heart of his admirable daughter that i might have her in wedlock when i pleased after the expiration of that current year which was the young ladys request and be secured of his estate at his death beside a large fortune to be immediately paid down and this though my father should refuse to settle any thing on me or miss noel my wife this was generous and charming as my heart could desire i thought my self the happiest of men every week i went to edenpark one time or other to see my dear miss noel and pay my respects to her worthy father we were while i stayed a most happy family and enjoyed such satisfactions as few i believe have experienced in this tempestuous hemisphere mr noel was passionately fond of his daughter and he could not regard me more if i had been his own son i loved my harriot with a fondness beyond description and that glorious girl had all the esteem i could wish she had for me our mutual felicity could rise no higher till we gave our hands as we had already plighted our hearts  this world is a series of visionary scenes and contains so little solid lasting felicity as i have found it that i cannot call life more than a deception and as swift says it he is the happiest man who is best deceived when i thought myself within a fortnight of being married to miss noel and thereby made as completely happy in every respect as it was possible for a mortal man to be the small pox steps in and in seven days time reduced the finest human frame in the universe to the most hideous and offensive block the most amiable of human creatures mortifyed all over and became a spectacle the most hideous and unbearable  this broke her fathers heart in a months time and the paradise i had in view sunk into everlasting night  miss noels character my heart upon this sad accident bled and mourned to an extreme degree all the tender passions were up in my soul and with great difficulty could i keep my ruffled spirits in tolerable decorum i lost what i valued more than my life  more than repeated millions of worlds if it had been possible to get them in exchange this engaged beloved partner was an honor to her sex and an ornament to human kind she was one of the wisest and most agreeable of women and her life quite glorious for piety to god compassion to the necessitous and miserable benevolence and good will to all with every other grace and virtue these shined with a bright luster in her whole deportment and rendered her beloved and the delight of all that knew her sense and genius were in her united and by study reflection and application she improved the talents in the happiest manner she had acquired a superiority in thinking speaking writing and acting and in manners her behavior her language her design her understanding was inexpressibly charming miss noel died in the   th year of her age the   th of december in the year       a reflection on the death of miss noel this dismal occurrence sat powerfully on my spirits for some time and for near two months i scarcely spoke a word to any one i was silent but not sullen as my tears and lamentations could not save her so i knew they could not fetch her back again death and the grave have neither eyes nor ears the thing to be done upon so melancholy an occasion is to adore the lord of infinite wisdom as he has a right to strike our comforts dead and so improve the awful event by laboring to render our whole temper and deportment christian and divine that we may able to live while we do live superior to the strokes of fortune and the calamities of human life and when god bids us die in whatever manner and at whatever time it may be have nothing to do but to die and so go enter into our masters joy this is wisdom this good we may extract from such doleful things this was the effect my dear miss noels death had on me and when i saw myself deprived of so invaluable a thing in this world i determined to double my diligence in so acting my part in it that whenever i was to pass through the last extremity of nature i might be dismissed with a blessing to another world and by virtue of the sublime excellencies of our holy religion proceed to the abodes of immortality and immutable felicity  i wish i could persuade you reader to resolve in the same manner if you are young and have not yet experienced life believe me all is vanity disappointment weariness and dissatisfaction and in the midst of troubles and uncertainties we are hastening on to an unknown world from whence we shall never return again whether our dissolution be near we know not but this is certain that death that universal conqueror is making after us apace to seize us as his captives and therefore though a man live many years and rejoice in them all which is the case of very few yet let him remember the days of darkness  and when death does come our lot may be the most racking pains and distempers to fasten us down to our sickbeds till we resign our spirits to some strange region our breath to the common air and our bodies to the dust from whence they were taken dismal situation if in the days of our health we did not make our happiness and moral worth correspond  did not labor in the time of our strength to escape from wrong opinion and bad habit and to render our minds sincere and incorrupt if we did not worship and love the supreme mind and adore his divine administration and all the secrets of his providence if this was not our case before corruption begins to lay hold of us deplorable must we be when torments come upon us and we have only hopeless wishes that we had been wiser as we descend in agonies to our solitary retreat to proceed from thence to judgment language cannot paint the horrors of such a condition the anguish of mind and the torture of body are a scene of misery beyond description  or if without torment we lie down in silence and sink into the land of forgetfulness yet since the lord jesus is to raise us from the regions of darkness and bring us to the sessions of righteousness where all our actions are to be strictly tried and examined and every one shall be judged according to the deeds done in the body whether they have been good or evil what can screen us from the wrath of that mighty power which is to break off the strong fetters of death and to throw open the iron gates of the grave if injustice cruelty and oppression have been our practice in this world or if in the neglect of the distressed and hungry we have given up ourselves to chambering and wantonness to gluttony and volutuousness it is virtue and obedience acts of goodness and mercy that only can deliver us if we worship in spirit and in truth the most glorious of immortal beings that god who is omnipotent in wisdom and action and perform all the offices of love and friendship to every man then our lord will pronounce us the blessed of his father if we do evil we shall come forth unto the resurrection of damnation  this merits your attention reader and i hope you will immediately begin to ponder what it is to have a place assigned in inconceivable happiness or misery for ever     left the university and went down to see my father in the country and had a very miserable reception having thus lost miss noel and my good old friend her worthy father i left the university and went down to the country after five years and three months absence to see how things were posited at home and pay my respects to my father but i found them very little to my liking and in a short time returned to dublin again he had lately married in his old age a young wife who was one of the most artful false and insolent of women and to gratify her to the utmost of his power had not only brought her nephew into his house but was ridiculously fond of him and lavishly gratifyed all his desires whatever this little brute the son of a drunken beggar who had been a journeyman glover was pleased in wantonness to call for and that his years then sixteen could require my fathers fortune in an instant produced while scarcely one of my rational demands could be answered money clothes servants horses dogs and all things he could fansy were given him in abundance and to please the basest of women and the most cruel stepmother that ever the devil inspired to make the son of another woman miserable i was denied almost every thing the fine allowance i had at the university was taken from me even a horse to ride out to the neighboring gentlemen was refused me though my father had three stables of extraordinary cattle and till i purchased one was forced to walk it wherever i had a mind to visit what is still more incredible if any thing of severity can be so when a motherinlaw is sovereign i was not allowed to keep my horse even at grass on the land though five hundred acres of freehold estate surrounded the mansion but obliged to graze it at a neighboring farmers nor was this all the hard measure i received i was ordered by my father to become the young mans preceptor to spend my precious time in teaching this youngster and in laboring to make the little despicable dunce a scholar all this was more than i could bear my life became insupportable and i resolved to range even the wilds of africa if nothing better offered rather than live a miserable slave under the cruel tyranny of those unrelenting oppressors  my father however by the way was as fine a gentleman as ever lived a man of extraordinary understanding and a scholar likewise remarkably just and good to all the world except my self after i left the university and to do him all the justice in my power and vindicate him so far as i am able i must not conceal that great as the ascendant was which my motherinlaw had over him and as much as he was henpecked by that low woman who had been his servant maid yet it was not to her only that my sufferings were owing religion had a hand in my misery false religion was the spring of that paternal resentment i suffered under     a religious dispute with my father it was my fathers wont to have prayers read every night and morning in his family and the office was the litany of the common prayer book this work on my coming home was transferred from my sister to me and for about one week i performed to the old gentlemans satisfaction as my voice was good and my reading distinct and clear but this office was far from being grateful to me as i was become a strict unitarian by the lessons i had received from my private tutor in college and my own examinations of the vulgar faith it went against my conscience to use the tritheistic form of prayer and became at last so uneasy to me that i altered the prayers the first sunday morning and made them more agreeable to scripture as i conceived my father at this was very highly enraged and his passion arose to so great a height upon my defending my confession and refusing to read the established form that he called me the most impious and execrable of wretches and with violence drove me from his presence soon after however he sent me lord nottinghams letter to mr whiston and desired i would come to him when i had carefully read it over i did so and he asked me what i thought of the book i answered that i thought it a weak piece and if he would hear me with patience in relation to that in particular and to the case in general perhaps he might think my religion a little better than at present he supposed it to be i will hear you he said proceed  then i immediately began and for a full hour repeated an apology i had prepared the reader will find this apology in the appendix to this life by scripture and argument without any regard to the notions of the fathers i there endeavor to prove that god the father the beginning and cause of all things is one being infinite in such a manner that his infinity is an infinity of fullness as well as immensity and must be not only without limits but also without diversity defect or interruption and of consequence his unity so true and real that it will admit of no diversity or distinction of persons  that as to the lord jesus christ he was the servant chosen of this tremendous god to redeem mankind but his holy soul so far in perfection above adam or any of his posterity and possessed so much a greater share of the indwelling of the divine life and nature than any other creature that he might compared to us with a just figure of speech be called god    he did not interrupt me once and when i had done all he replied was i see you are to be placed among the incurables be gone he said with stern disdain and i resolved to obey indeed it was impossible for me to stay for my father took no farther notice of me and my motherinlaw and the boy did all they could invent to render my life miserable     may        i left my fathers house on the first day of may then early in the morning as the clock struck one i mounted my excellent mare and with my boy ofin began to journey as i had projected on seeing how things went i did not communicate my design to a soul nor take my leave of any one but in the true spirit of adventure abandoned my fathers dwelling and set out to try what fortune would produce in my favor i had the world before me and providence my guide as to my substance it consisted of a purse of gold that contained fifty spanish pistoles and half a score moidores and i had one bank note for five hundred pounds which my dear miss noel left me by her will the morning she sickened and it was all she had of her own to leave to any one with this i set forward and in five days time arrived from the western extremity of ireland at a village called ringsend that lies on the bay of dublin three days i rested there and at the connivinghouse the connivinghouse as the gentlemen of trinity called it in my time and long after was a little public house kept by jack macklean about a quarter of a mile beyond ringsend on the top of the beach within a few yards of the sea here we used to have the finest fish at all times and in the season green peace and all the most excellent vegetables the ale here was always extraordinary and every thing the best which with its delightful situation rendered it a delightful place of a summers evening many a delightful evening have i passed in this pretty thatched house with the famous larrey grogan who played on the bagpipes extreme well dear jack lattin matchless on the fiddle and the most agreeable of companions that ever charming young fellow jack wall the most worthy the most ingenious the most engaging of them the son of councellor maurice wall and many other delightful fellows who went in the days of their youth to the shades of eternity when i think of them and their evening songs  we will go to johnny mackleans  to try if his ale be good or not etc and that years and infirmities begin to oppress me  what is life    and then got my horses on board a ship that was ready to sail and bound for the land i was born in i mean old england     my departure from rings end and what happened at sea the wind in the afternoon seemed good and fair and we were in hopes of getting to chester the next day but at midnight a tempest arose which held in all the horrors of hurricane thunder and lightning for two nights and a day and left us no hope of escape it was a dreadful scene indeed and looked as if the last fatal assault was making on the globe as we had many passengers their cries were terrible and affected me more than the flashing fires and the winds for my part i was well reconciled to the great change but i confess that nature shrunk at the frightful manner of my going off which i expected every moment the second night at last however we got into whitehaven it pleased the great king of all the earth to bid the storm have done  four remarkable things i noticed while the tempest lasted the case of dean whaley one was that the dean of derry dr whaley whom we had on board who had nineteen hundred a year from the church for teaching the people to be christians was vastly more afraid than one young lady of the company who appeared quite serene the dean though a fine orator at land was ridiculous in his fears at sea he screamed as loud as any of the people but this young lady behaved like an angel in a storm she was calm and resigned and sat with the mate and me the second night discoursing of the divine power and the laws of nature in such uproars by the way neither mate nor master nor hand could keep the deck the ship was left to the mercy of the winds and waves the case of miss melnoth the second remarkable thing is that as this young lady went into naked bed in her cabin the first night before the tempest began to stir it was not many hours till a sea struck us upon the quarter and drove in one of our quarter and one of our stern dead lights where we shipped great quantities of water that put us under great apprehensions of foundering and filled so suddenly the close wooden bed in which miss melmoth lay that had not i chanced to be then leaning against the partition and snatched her out the moment i found my self all over wet and half covered with the breaking sea she must inevitably have perished i ran up on deck with her in my arms and laid her almost senseless and naked there and as there was no staying many minutes in that place i threw my great coat over her and then brought her down to my own birth which i gave her and got her dry clothes from her trunk and made her drink a large glass of brandy which saved her life she got no cold which i thought very strange but was hurt a little in the remove when all was over she protested she would never go into naked bed on board ship again the case of some officers in the storm the third particular is that there were some officers on board most monstrously wicked men and when we were given over by the captain and no hope he thought of being saved these warriors lamented like young children and were the most dismal disturbing howlers on board yet when we got on land they had done with o lord o lord and began again their obscene talk and to damn themselves at every word to the center of hell the cases of gavan and henley the fourth thing was this there was on board with us a young gentleman of my acquaintance one pierce gavan who had been a fellowcommoner in my time of trinity dublin the first day of the storm he was carried overboard by a rolling sea and fairly lodged in the ocean at above twenty yards distance from the ship but the next tumbling billow brought him back again he was laid on the deck without any hurt on the contrary one charles henley a young merchant was beat over and we never saw him more   henleys character henley was not only a man of sense and prudence who had an honest mind and a cultivated understanding but by search and enquiries into the doctrines institutions and motives of reveled religion had the highest regard for the truths of genuine christianity and chose the best means in his power to make himself acceptable to god  gavans character gavan on the contrary had no sense of religion nor did he ever think of the power and goodness of god he was a most profane swearer drank excessively and had the heart to debauch every pretty woman he saw if it had been possible for him to do so much mischief  yet this man who never reformed that i heard and whose impieties have shocked even young fellows who were no saints was astonishingly preserved and henley who had the justest natural notions and listened to revelation perished miserably how shall we account for such things by saying that the world that now is and the world that is to come are in the hands of god and every transaction in them is quite right though the reason of the procedure may be beyond our view we cannot judge certainly of the ends and purposes of providence and therefore to pass judgment on the ways of god is not only impious but ridiculous to the last degree this we know for certain that whenever or however a good man falls he falls into the hand of god and since we must all die the difference as to time and manner signifies very little when there is an infinite wisdom to distinguish every case and an infinite goodness to compensate all our miseries this is enough for a christian happy is the man and for ever safe let what will happen who acts a rational part and has the fear and love of god in his thoughts with pleasure he looks into all the scenes of futurity when storms and earthquakes threaten calamity distress and death he maintains an inward peace     the passengers land and divide into several companies may  0      when we had obtained the wished for shore the passengers all divided the dean and his lady and some other ladies went one way to an inn recommended to them by a gentleman on board the warriors and gavan marched to another house and the young lady whose life was by me preserved and i went to the talbot which the mate informed me had the best things and lodging though the smallest inn of the town this mate mr whitwell deserves to be particularly mentioned as he was remarkable for good breeding good sense and a considerable share of learning though a sailor as remarkable this way as the captain of the ship was the other way that is for being the roughest and most brutal old tar that ever commanded a vessel     the story of whitwell the mate of the skinner and jenkins whitwell the mate about thirtysix years of age at this time told me he was the son of a man who once had a great fortune and gave him a university education but left an estate so encumbered with debts and ruined with mortgages that its income was almost nothing and therefore the son sold the remains of it and went to sea with an east india captain in the   d year of his age and was so fortunate abroad that he not only acquired riches in four years time that he trafficked about between batavia and the gulf of persia but married a young indian lady the daughter of a rajah or petty prince in the mogul empire who was rich wise and beautiful and made his life so very happy for three years that she lived that his state was a mere paradise and he seemed a little sovereign but this fleeting scene was soon over and on his return to england with all his wealth their ship was taken by the pirates of madagascar who robbed him of all he had and made him a miserable slave for two years and upwards that he escaped from them to the tawny generation of arabs who lived on the mountains the other side of this african island and used him with great humanity their chief being very fond of him and entertaining him in his mudwall palace he married there a pretty little yellow creature niece to the poor ruler and for twelve months was very far from being miserable with this partner as they had a handsome cottage and some cattle and this wife was good humor itself very sensible and a religious woman her religion being half mahometanism and half judaism but she died at the years end and her uncle the chief not living a month after her whitwell came down from the mountains to the next sea coast under the conduct of one of the arabians his friend and meeting with a european ship there got at last to london a little money he had left behind him in england by way of reserve in case of accidents if he ever should return to his own country and with this he dressed himself got into business and came at last to be mate of the skinner and jenkins his destiny he added was untoward but as he had thought and read and seen enough in his wide travels to be convinced the world and every being and every atom of it were directed and governed by unerring wisdom he derived hopes and comforts from a due acknowledgment of god there are more born to misery than to happiness in this life but all may die to be for ever glorious and blessed if they please  this conclusion was just and beautiful and a life and sentiments so uncommon i thought deserved a memorial     an uncommon scene of life miss melmoth and i continued at the talbot for three weeks and during that time breakfasted dined and supped together except the hours of sleep we were rarely from each other we walked out together every day for hours conversed sometimes went to cards and often she sung delightfully sung while on my flute i played with the greatest civility and the most exact good manners we were as intimate as if we had been acquainted for ages and we found a satisfaction in each others company as great as lovers generally experience yet so much as one syllable of the passion was no mentioned not the least hint of love on either side was given while we stayed at whitehaven and i believe neither of us had a thought of it it was a friendship the most pure and exalted that commenced at my saving her life in the manner i have related and by some strange kind of magic our notions and inclinations tempers and sentiments had acquired such a sameness in a few days that we seemed as two spiritual socias or duplicates of each others mind body was quite out of the case though this lady had an extravagance of beauty my sole delight was that fine percepient which shed a luster on her outward charms how long this state would have lasted had we continued more time together and had the image of the late miss noel been more effaced or worn out of the sensory of my head i cannot say but while it did last there could be nothing more strange to see two young people of different sexes in the highest spirits and most confirmed health live together for twentyone days perfectly pleased with each other entirely at their own disposal and as to fortune having abundantly enough between them both for a comfortable life and yet never utter one word nor give a look that could be construed a declaration of the passion or a tendency toward a more intimate union  to complete that connection which nature and providence requires of beings circumstanced as we were  this was very odd till the clock struck twelve every night we sat up and talked of a vast variety of things from the bible down to the clouds of aristophanes and from the comedies and tragedies of greece and rome to the minerva of sanctius and hickess northern thesaurus instead of venus or any of her court our conversation would often be on the morals of cicero his academicks and de finibus on the english or the roman history shakespeares scenes of nature or maps of life whether the oedipus or the electra of sophocles was the best tragedy and the scenes in which plautus and terence most excelled like two critics or two grammarians antiquarians historians or philosophers would we pass the evening with the greatest cheerfulness and delight  miss melmoths character miss melmoth had a memory astonishing and talked on every subject extremely well she remembered all she had read her judgment was strong and her reflections ever good she told me her mother was another mrs dacier and as her father was killed in a duel when she was very young the widow melmoth instead of going into the world continued to live at her country seat and diverted herself with teaching her daughter the languages of greece and rome and in educating her heart and mind this made this young lady a master of the latin tongue and greek and enable her to acquire a knowledge so various and fine that it was surprising to hear her expatiate and explain she talked with so much ease and good humor and had a manner so cheerful and polite that her discourse was always entertaining even though the subject happened to be as it was one evening the paulo paulo post futurum of a greek verb these things however were not the only admirable ones in this character so happily had her good mother formed and instructed her mind that it appeared full of all the principles of rational honor and devoted to that truly godlike religion which exalts the soul to an affection rather than dread of the supreme lord of all things and to a conviction that his laws lead us both to happiness here and hereafter she thoroughly understood the use and excellence of revelation and had extracted from the inspired volumes everlasting comfort and security under the apprehensions of the divine power and majesty but she told me she could not think rites and outward performances were essential to real religion she considered what was just and beautiful in these things as useful and assisting only to the devout mind  in a word this young lady was wise and good humble and charitable i have seen but one of her sex superior to her in the powers of mind and the beauties of body that was miss noel very few have i know that were equal   0 miss melmoth and part june        the  d day of june miss melmoth and i left whitehaven and proceeded from thence to westmoreland we traveled for five days together till we came to brugh under stainmore where we stayed a night at lambs a house i recommend to the reader if ever he goes that way and the next morning we parted miss melmoth and her servants went right onwards to yorkshire and i turned to the left to look for one mr charles turner who had been my near friend in the university and lived in some part of the northeast extremity of westmoreland or yorkshire but before we separated on the edge of stainmore we stopped at the bell to breakfast which is a little lone house on a descent to a vast romantic glin and all the public house there is in this wild silent road till you come to jack railton the quakers house at bows we had a pot of coffee and toast and butter for breakfast and as usual we were very cheerful over it but when we had done and it was time to depart a melancholy like a black and dismal cloud began to overspread the charming face of charlotte and after some silence the tears burst from her eyes what is the matter miss melmoth i said  what makes this amazing change i will tell you sir this beauty replied to you i owe my life and for three weeks past have lived with you in so very happy a way that the end of such a scene and the probability of my never seeing you l ore is too much for me miss melmoth i answered you do me more honor than i deserve in shedding tears for me and since you can think me worth seeing again i promise you upon my sacred word that as soon as i have found a beloved friend of mine i am going up the hills to look for and have paid my respects to him for a while if he is to be found in this desolate part of the world i will travel with my face in the next place if it be possible toward the east riding of yorkshire and be at mrs asgils door where you say you are to be found this restored the glories to charlottes face again and for the first time i gave miss melmoth a kiss and bid her adieu     a journey among the hills in that part of stainmore which belongs to westmorland      june   having thus lost my charming companion i traveled into a vast valley enclosed by mountains whose tops were above the clouds and soon came into a country that is wilder than the campagna of rome or the uncultivated vales of the alps and apennines warm with a classical enthusiasm i journeyed on and with fancys eye beheld the rural divinities in those sacred woods and groves which shade the sides of many of the vast surrounding fells and the shores and promontories of many lovely lakes and bright running streams for several hours i traveled over mountains tremendous to behold and through vales the finest in the world not a man or house could i see in eight hours time but toward five in the afternoon there appeared at the foot of a hill a sweetly situated cottage that was half covered with trees and stood by the side of a large falling stream a vale extended to the south from the door that was terminated with rocks and precipices on precipices in an amazing point of view and through the flowery ground the water was beautifully seen as it winded to a deeper flood at the bottom of the vale half a dozen cows were grazing in view and a few flocks of feeding sheep added to the beauties of the scene  to this house i sent my boy to enquire who lived there and to know if for the night i could be entertained as i knew not where else to go of fin very quickly returned and informed me that one farmer price was the owner of the place but had gone in the morning to the next town and that his wife said i was welcome to what her house afforded in then i went and was most civilly received by an exceeding pretty woman who told me her husband would soon be at home and be glad she was sure to see me at their lone place for he was no stranger to gentlemen and the world though at present he rarely conversed with any one she told me their own supper would be ready an hour hence and in mean time would have me take a can of fine ale and a bit of bread she brought me a cup of extraordinary maultdrink and a crust and while i was eating my bread in came mr price     a surprising meeting the man seemed very greatly astonished at entering the room and after he had looked with great earnestness at me for a little while he cried out good heaven what do i see falstaff my classfellow and my second self my dear friend you are welcome thrice welcome to this part of the world all this surprised me not a little for i could not recollect at once a face that had been greatly altered by the smallpox and it was not till i reflected on the name price that i knew i was then in the house of one of my schoolfellows with whom i had been most intimate and had played the part of plump jack in henry the fourth when he did prince henry this was an unexpected meeting indeed and considering the place and all the circumstances belonging to the scene a thing more strange and affecting never came in my way our pleasure at this meeting was very great and when the most affectionate salutations were over my friend price proceeded in the following manner  often have i remembered you since we parted and exclusive of the greek and english plays we have acted together at sheridans school in which you acquired no small applause i have frequently thought of our frolicksome rambles in vacation time and the merry dancings we had at mother redcaps in backlane the hurling matches we have played at dolphinsbarn and the cakes and ale we used to have at the organhouse on arborhill these things have often occurred to my mind but little did i think we should ever meet again on stainmorehills what strange things does time produce it has taken me from a town life to live on the most solitary part of the globe  and it has brought you to journey where never man i believe ever thought of traveling before so it is i replied and stranger things dear jack may happen yet before our eyes are closed why i journey this untravelled way i will inform you by and by when you have told me by what strange means you came to dwell in this remote and silent vale that you shall know mr price said very soon as soon as we have eaten a morsel of something or other which my dear martha has prepared against my return here it comes a fowl bacon and greens and as fine i will answer as london market could yield let us sit down my friend and god bless us and our meat  down then we sat immediately to our dish and most excellent every thing was the social goodness of this fond couple added greatly to the pleasure of the meal and with mirth and friendship we eat up our capon our bacon and our greens when we had done price brought in pipes and tobacco and a fresh tankard of his admirable ale listen now he said to my story and then i will hearken to yours     the story of jack price when i left you at sheridans school my remove was from ireland to barbados to become a rich uncles heir and i got by my indian airing a hundred thousand pounds there i left the bones of my mothers brother after i had lived two years in that burning place and from thence proceeded to london to spend what an honest laborious man had long toiled to save but i had not been above three months in the capital of england when it came into my head to pass some time in france and with a girl i kept made have to the french metropolis there i lived at a grand rate and took from the french operahouse another where the gaul and the briton were both extreme fine girls and agreed so well together that i kept them both in one house i thought my self superlatively happy in having such a brace of females and spared no cost in procuring them all the finery and pleasures that paris and london could yield i had a furnished house in both these cities and with an expensive equipage went backwards and forwards in four years time i spent a great deal of money and as i had lost large sums at play and these two whores agreed in the end to rob me and retire with the money where i should never discover them i found my self in very midling circumstances and had not six hundred pounds left in the fourth year from my uncles death how to dispose of this and my self was now the question what shall i do was my deliberation to secure bread and quiet many a thoughtful hour this gave me and at length i determined to purchase a little annuity but before this could be effected i went down to westmoreland on an information i had received that my two ladies were at appleby with other names and on my money appeared as women of fortune but this journey was to no purpose and i was preparing to return to london when my wife you saw at the head of the table a while ago came by chance in my way and pleased me so well with her good understanding face and person that i resolved to marry her if she would have me and give her the management of my five hundred pounds on a farm as she was a farmers daughter and could manage one to good advantage her father was lately dead and this little mountain farm she continued to occupy therefore nothing could be more to my purpose if i could prevail on her to make me her husband and with some difficulty she did to my unspeakable felicity she had no money worth mentioning but her house was pretty and comfortable and her land had grain and cattle and as i threw into her lap my five hundred pounds a little before we were married to be by her disposed of and managed according to her pleasure she soon made some good improvements and additions and by her fine understanding sweet temper and every christian virtue continues to render my life so completely happy so joyous and delightful that i would not change my partner and condition for one of the first quality and greatest fortune in her i have every thing i could wish for in a wife and a woman and she makes it the sole study and pleasure of her life to crown my every day with the highest satisfactions and comforts two years have i lived with her on these wild mountains and in that time i have not had one dull or painful minute but in thinking that i may lose her and be the wretched survivor that thought does sometimes wound me  in sum my friend we are the happiest of wedded mortals and on this small remote farm live in a state of bliss to be envyed this proves that happiness does not flow from riches only but that where pure and perfect love strict virtue and unceasing industry are united in the conjugal state they can make the stainmore mountains a paradise to mortals in peace and little  but it is not only happiness in this world that i have acquired by this admirable woman but life eternal you remember my friend what a wild and wicked one i was when a schoolboy and as barbados of all parts of the globe is no place to improve a mans morals in i returned from thence to europe as debauched a scelerate as ever offended heaven by blasphemy and illegal gratifications even my losses and approaching poverty were not capable of making any great change in me when i was courting my wife she soon discerned my impiety and perceived that i had very little notion of hell and heaven death and judgment this she made a principal objection against being concerned with me and told me she could not venture into a married connection with a man who had no regard to the divine laws and therefore if she could not make me a christian in the true sense of the word she would never be mrs price  this from a plain country girl surprised me not a little and my astonishment arose very high when i heard her talk of religion and the great end of both a blessed life after this she soon convinced me that religion was the only means by which we can arrive at true happiness by which we can attain to the last perfection and dignity of our nature and that the authority and word of god is the surest foundation of religion the substance of what she said is as follows i shall never forget the lesson  the plain declarations of our master in the gospel restore the dictates of uncorrupted reason to their force and authority and give us just notions of god and of our selves they instruct us in the nature of the deity discover to us his unity holiness and purity and afford certain means of obtaining eternal life revelation commands us to worship one supreme god the supreme father of all things and to do his will by imitating his perfections and practicing every thing recommended by that law of reason which he sent the messiah to revive and enforce that by repentance and righteousness and acts of devotion we may obtain the divine favor and share in the glories of futurity for the supreme director whose goodness gives counsel to his power commanded us into existence to conduct us to everlasting happiness and therefore teaches us by his son to pray to praise and to repent that we may be entitled to a nobler inheritance than this world knows and obtain life and immortality and all the joys and blessings of the heavenly canaan this was the godlike design of our creator that superior agent who acts not by arbitrary will but by the maxims of unclouded reason when he made us and stationed us in this part of his creation had no glory of his own in view but what was perfectly consistent with a just regard to the felicity of his rational subjects  it was this made the apostle show felix the unalterable obligations to justice and equity to temperance or a command over the appetites and then by displaying the great and awful judgment to come urge him to the practice of these and all the other branches of morality that by using the means prescribed by god and acting up to the conditions of salvation he might escape that dreadful punishment which in the reason and nature of things is connected with vice and which the good government of the rational world requires should be inflicted on the wicked and might on the contrary by that mercy offered to the world through jesus christ secure those immense rewards which are promised to innocence and the testimony of an upright heart this faith in christ st paul placed before the roman governor in the best light he described the complexion and genius of the christian faith he represented it as reveling the wrath of god against all immorality and as joining with reason and uncorrupted nature enforcing the practice of every moral and social duty  what effect this discourse had on felix  martha continued in producing faith that is morality in an intelligent agent we are told by the apostle he trembled but iniquity and the world had taken such a hold of him that he dismissed the subject and turned from a present uneasiness to profit and the enjoyment of sin he had done with st paul and sacrificed the hopes of eternity to the world and its delights  but this concluded martha will not i hope be your case as a judgment to come is an awful subject you will ponder in time and look into your own mind as a man a reasonable and social creature designed for duty to a god above you and to a world of fellow creatures around you you will consider the rules of virtue and morality and be no longer numbered with those miserable mortals who are doomed to condemnation upon their disobedience those rules lie open in a perfect gospel and the wicked can have nothing to plead for their behavior they want no light to direct them they want no assistance to support them in doing their duty they have a gospel to bring them to life and salvation if they will but take notice of it and if they will not walk in the light of gods law this gospel must be their judgment and condemnation  say then sir  martha proceeded can you be prevailed on to think of religion in its native purity and simplicity and by the power of the gospel so act with regard to virtue and piety that when christ shall come not only in the power but in the wisdom and the justice of god to judge the world you may be secured from that misery and distress which is prepared for iniquity and enjoy that eternal life which is to be the portion of the righteous  in this extraordinary manner did martha harrington discourse me and the effect of it was jack price continued that i became a through reform from that hour my rational life from that happy day commenced and i entered seriously into my own breast to think in earnest of that solemn judgment to come what martha said was so clear and strong that i had not a thought of replying but truth at once entirely subdued my heart and i flew to the son of god to request his intercession with the father of the universe for the pardon of all my crimes the dignity and end of my being has since been the subject of my meditations and i live convinced that every thing is contemptible that is inconsistent with duty and morality this renders even my pleasures more agreeable this gives eternal peace to my mind     a conversation here price ended his remarkable story and according to our agreement i began to relate what happened to me from the time we parted at school and concluded with informing him that i was going in search of charles turner my near friend when fortune brought me to his house that this gentleman lived somewhere toward the confines of cumberland and the north riding of yorkshire but where the spot was i could not tell nor did i know well how to go on as the country before me seemed unpassable on account of its mountains precipices and floods i must try however what can be done not only in regard to this gentleman but because i have reason to think it may be very much to my advantage as he is very rich and the most generous of men if he is to be found i know i shall be welcome to share in his happiness as long as i please nor will it be any weight to him price to this replied that i was most heartily welcome to him as long as i pleased to stay and that though he was far from being a rich man yet he had every day enough for himself and one more and his martha he was sure would be as well pleased with my company as if i had been his own brother since she knew i was his esteemed friend  in respect of the way he said he would enable me to find mr turner if he could but the country was difficult to travel and he doubted very much if one could go to the extremity of cumberland or yorkshire over the hills but we would try however and if it was possible find out mr turners house yet solely with him i must not stay if he could be seen i must live between both till i got some northern girl and had a wife and habitation of my own and there is continued price not many miles from me a sweet pretty lass the daughter of a gentlemanfarmer who is a very good man and would i believe upon my recommendation give you his girl and a sum of money to sit down on those hills  this is vastly kind jack i answering said and what i shall gratefully remember so long as i live i may ride many a mile i am sure and be an adventurer many a long day before i meet with such offers again your sweetly situated house and good things with a fine northern girl and money down are benefits not to be met with every day  but at present the object i must pursue is my university friend charles turner and if you please to do me the great favor of guiding me so far as you can over this wild uninhabited land after i have stayed with you for the first time two or three days and promise to abide many more hereafter if it be in my power we will set out in quest of what i want as you will my friend price replied and for the present let us be gay here comes my beloved with a little bowl of punch and as she sings extremely well and you have not forgot i fansy our old song we will have it over our nectar you shall represent janus and momus and i will be chronos and mars and my wife diana and venus let

a new     an account of mrs price of stanemore in this happy manner did we pass the night in this wild and frightful part of the world and for three succeeding evenings and days enjoyed as much true satisfaction as it was possible for mortals to feel price was an ingenious cheerful entertaining man and his wife had not only sense more than ordinary but was one of the best of women i was prodigiously pleased with her conversation though she was no woman of letters nor had any books in her house except the bible barrows and wichcotts sermons howells history of the world and the history of england yet from these few a great memory and an extraordinary conception of things had collected a valuable knowledge and she talked with an ease and perspicuity that was wonderful on religious subjects she astonished me  the nature end and design of christianity considered in a conversation as sunday was one of the days i stayed there and price was obliged in the afternoon to be from home i passed it in conversation with his wife the day introduced religion and among other things i asked her which she thought the best evidences of christianity the prophecies or the miracles  neither mrs price replied the prophecies of the messiah recorded in the old testament are a good proof of the christian religion as it is plane from many instances in the new testament that the jewish converts of that generation understood them to relate to our lord which is a sufficient reason for our believing them since they knew the true intent and meaning of them and on account of their knowing it were converted the prophecies for this reason should by us be regarded as divine testimony in favor of christ jesus  then as to miracles they are to be sure a means of proving and spreading the christian religion as they show the divine mission of the messiah and rouse the mind to attend to the power by which these mighty works were wrought thus miracle and prophecy show the teacher came from god they contribute to the establishment of his kingdom and have a tendency to produce that faith which purifies the heart and brings forth the new birth  but the greater evidence for the truth of our holy religion appears to me to be that which converted the primitive christians to wit the powerful influence which the gospel has on the minds of those who study it with sincerity and the inward discoveries christ makes to the understanding of the faithful by his light and good spirit this exceeds the other evidences if the heart be honest the gospel is irresistible when the spirit of god moves upon the minds of christians when the divine power dispensed through christ assists and strengthens us to do good and to eschew evil then christianity appears a religion worthy of god and in itself the most reasonable the complete salvation deserves our ready acceptance that religion must charm a reasonable world which not only restores the worship of the one true god and exhibits in a perfect plan those rules of moral rectitude whereby the conduct of men should be governed and their future happiness secured but by its blessed spirit informs our judgments influences our wills rectifies and subdues our passions turns the biass of our minds from the objects and pleasures of sense and fixes them upon the supreme good most glorious surely is such a gospel  but does not this operation of the spirit i said which you make the principal evidence for christianity debase human nature and make man too weak too helpless and depending a being if voluntary good agency depends on supernatural influence and enlivening aid does not this make us mere patients and if we are not moral agents that is have not a power of choosing or refusing of doing or avoiding either good or evil can there be any human virtue can we in such case approve or disapprove ourselves to god to me it seems that man was created to perform things natural rational and spiritual and has an ability to act within the reach of his agency as his duty requires i think the moral fitness of things is a rule of action to conduct our actions by and that the great advantage of revelation consists in its heavenly moral lessons and the certainty of that future judgment and retribution which has a powerful influence upon a rational mind and strongly inclines a reasonable being to save his soul by so acting in this world as to avoid everlasting misery and ensure the favor of god and eternal happiness in another world this appears to me more consistent with the nature and the truth of things it is more to the honor of human nature if i mistake not and gives more glory to god  to this mrs price answered that as she was sensible of the shortness of her own understanding and believed the faculties of the human mind in general were weak and deficient she could not see any thing unreasonable in supposing the thing formed depended on and was subject to the creator that made it it cannot be absurd surely to say that so weak and helpless a being as a man depends entirely on god where in the nature of things can we fix a standard of certainty in understanding and stability in practice but in the fountain of truth and all perfection  but to our better comprehending this matter let us take a view of primitive christian religion  christianity is a divine institution by which god declares himself reconciled to mankind for the sake of his beloved son the lord jesus christ on condition of repentance amendment of life and perseverance in a state of holiness and that we might be able to perform the things required of us he offers the assistance of his good spirit this last offer in a proper sense is salvation for according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the holy ghost by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god we find then that there are two parts in the christian religion one external and historical the other internal and experimental the first comprehends what is no more to be repeated though the effects are lasting and permanent to wit the life and good works of jesus his miracles death and resurrection which declare him spotless virtue perfect obedience and the son of god with power  and in the second part we have that standing experience of a divine help which converts and supports a spiritual life it is true both the parts have a near relation and in conjunction produce the good ends of religion the second is the effect of the first redemption from the power of sin sanctification and justification are blessings wrought in us by the good spirit of him who without us did many glorious things that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works and that they who live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him that died for them and rose again but it is in the second part that the excellence of our holy religion consists we have no ability of ourselves to take off our minds from the things that are evil and engage them in the work of religion and godliness this is the gift of god it is a continued miracle that cleanses that polluted fountain the heart and therefore i call this experience the principal evidence of the christian religion it is the glory of christianity and renders it the perfection of all religions  that christianity i replied is the perfection of all religions is granted but that we have no ability to save our souls without a supernatural operation on them this is what i still have some doubt of a careful examination of the subject produces some hard objections and therefore madam i will lay my difficulties before you that your fine natural understanding may remove them if it be possible i will be short on the article for many words would only darken it  in the first place then as to mans inability to live a religious life and practice the precepts of the gospel it must be the effect of the human composition or the effect of the agency of the serpent if the former it is chargeable upon the author of the composition  if the latter upon the agent which acts upon it man could not be culpable i think for a bad life in either case  if my nature be weakness itself  or the serpent is superior to me  what good can be required of me can the supreme reason call for brick where there are no materials to make it with will you say yes because he gives supernatural ability to perform but then can this be called mans action it is the action of the author by his miserable creature man and in such case may we not say that though commands are given to man to obey revealed laws yet the obedience is performed by god  in the next place as man in his natural capacity and all his natural powers are the work of god and as truly derived from him as any supernatural powers can be it follows i imagine that a voluntary agents making a right use of the powers of his nature is as valuable as his being compelled to act well and wisely by a supernatural power to assert then such experiences or operations to me seems to misrepresent the nature of a being excellently constituted to answer the good purposes he was created for i am likewise at present of opinion that depretiating our natural abilities does not give so much glory to god as you imagine  to this mrs price replied that by the operation of the spirit she did not mean that man was purely passive and had no part in the working out his salvation but that god cooperates with man and without destroying the faculty of reason improves it by convincing and enlightening the understanding and by moving and inclining the will toward such objects as are acceptable to himself and from those that are contrary to his gospel the mind in this manner enlightened and affected begins to act and as the spirit moves upon the soul the quickened man under the divine direction does all the good the scripture commands him to do and eschews the evil he is ordered to avoid by god through christ he practices the excellent virtues recommended in the holy books and for this reason the righteousness which christians bring forth is called in scripture the righteousness of christ the righteousness of god and the righteousness of faith christ is the efficient we through him are made able to act notwithstanding the weakness and incapacity of our nature yet through faith in the power of god which is given to all who believe in him we are enabled to flee immorality and vice and by a life of virtue and piety to enjoy the pleasure of a sweet reflection and the praises of unpolluted reason  that this is the case of man the sacred writings declare in a thousand places and set forth the exceeding greatness of gods power in this respect the ministry of the gospel appears to have been ordained for this end and the perfection of the christian religion to rest on this particular thing the lord died for our sins and rose again for our justification that we through power received from him the power of his resurrection might be made righteous and the apostle adds i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believes to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith and that the promise of the holy ghost had reference not only to the great effusion of the spirit at pentecost which was a solemn confirmation of the new and spiritual dispensation of the gospel but also to that instruction which christians of every age were to receive from it continually if they attended to it is evident from the promise of christ  i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter the spirit of truth that he may abide with you for ever this spirit was to supply the place of his personal presence it was to become a teacher and comforter to his disciples and followers to the end of time  to enlighten and incline their minds to piety and virtue  to enable them to do all things appertaining to life and godliness and to have a faith in gods power and all sufficiency this is the glorious specific difference of christianity from all other religions we have an inward instructor and supporter always abiding with us and what can be a higher honor to mankind or an act of greater love in god than for him to interpose continually and by his holy spirit restore the teachable and attentive to that purity and uprightness in which he at first created man glorious dispensation here is a complete reparation of the loss sustained by transgression we are created anew in christ jesus and are made partakers of the divine nature surely this is the utmost that can be expected from religion in short continued mrs price it is to me a most amazing thing to see men of sense disclaim this help argue for selfsufficiency and independency and receive only the outward appearance of the son of god in a literal historical and formal profession of christianity this will never do the work the outward appearance of the son of god only puts us in a capacity of salvation it is the inward appearance by the power and virtue of the spirit that must save us the end of the gospel is repentance forgiveness of sins and amendment of manners and the means of obtaining that end is christianity in the life spirit and power of it  you talk extremely well madam i said upon this subject and have almost made me a convert to the notion of an inward appearance of the son of god but i must beg leave to observe to you that as to what you have added by way of explication and vindication of the operation of the spirit to wit that man has agency and god cooperates with it by which means the man is enabled to apply his agency to the performance of good this does not seem to me to make the matter quite plain the virtue or goodness of an agent must certainly arise from a right exercise of his own power and how then can gods cooperating with him make him a better man can such cooperation add any thing to my virtue if my goodness is to be rated in proportion to the exertion of my own will and agency if i am not able to save a man from drowning though i pity him and do my best to preserve his life but god gives me strength or cooperates with me and so the man is saved can this add any thing to my virtue or goodness it would be indeed an instance of gods goodness to the man but as to myself i did no more with the divine cooperation than i did without it i made all the use i could of what power i had this seems to me a strong objection against the inward appearance nor is it all there is to object if i see a man in a deep wet ditch in a dangerous and miserable way and am prompted by a natural affection and the fitness of relieving to exert a sufficient strength i have to take the man out of his distress and put him in a comfortable way which is a thing i really did once and thereby saved a useful life  in this case there was good done by an agent without any supernatural cooperation at all many more instances might be produced but from what has been said is it not plain that much good may be done without any interposition  and with it that no good can be added to the character of the agent  but you will say perhaps that the good disposition of the agent in such cases is supernatural operation and without such operation he could not make a right use of his ability to this we reply that if by disposition is meant a given power to distinguish betwixt motive and motive and so to judge of moral fitness and unfitness or a power to act from right motives when such are present to the mind  these cannot be given because they are the powers which constitute a man a moral agent and render him accountable for his actions without them he could not be a subject of moral government  and if you mean by the term disposition gods presenting such motives to the mind as are necessary to excite to right action the answer is that though god may kindly interpose and in many instances by supernatural operation present such motives to the mind yet such operation cannot be always necessary in order to our doing good  in many cases we see at once what good ought to be done and we do it instantly of ourselves unless the natural faculties be perverted by false principles if our fellow creature falls into the fire or has a fit while we are near him the fitness of relieving him and the natural compassion essential to our constitution will make us fly to his assistance without a supernatural operation we want no divine impulse to make us interpose without being reminded we will do our best to recover the man if superstition or passion has not misled the natural powers of the mind in a great variety of things the case is the same and when at a glance we see the fitness of action there is an immediate production of good  it is not just then to assert that the heart cannot be the spring of good actions without the actings of god it is the seat and source of both evil and good man is capable of giving glory to god and of doing the contrary he is constituted to answer all the purposes of social felicity and to act a part suitable to and becoming that reason and understanding which god has given him to guide his steps and he may on the contrary by abusing his liberty act an unsocial part in the creation and do great dishonor to his maker by the evil imaginations of his heart and the violence his hand commits this has been the state of human nature from the fall to the flood and from the flood to our time the human race have a natural ability for good or evil and are at liberty for the choice of either of these if thou do well cain who have power and is at liberty to do evil thou shall be accepted and if thou do not well who have power and is at liberty to do good sin lies at the door if this had not been the case of cain and of others since his days it seems to me at present that god would act an unequal part with his creatures can happiness or misery be called reward or punishment unless the creature can voluntarily choose or avoid the thing which renders him the object of infliction or glory i think not for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad the agency of a serpent will be no plea then for a cain i suppose nor will abels title to an inheritance depend only on the good brought forth in him by the lord  and as to a selfsufficiency or independency in all this as often charged i can see none for the reason already given to wit that my natural powers are as much the gift of god to me as supernatural powers can be and render me as dependent a being they are derived from him it is his given powers i use and if i make a right use of them to answer the great and wise purpose i was created for the good application must be as valuable as if i had applied supernatural powers to the same purpose  what you say sir mrs price answered has reason in it to be sure but it seems inconsistent with the language of the bible and takes away the grace of god entirely and the principal evidence of the christian religion as to the necessary guilt of mankind moses says  and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth etc and again  the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way on the earth and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord  the prophet jeremiah does likewise affirm the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and st paul declares from psalm    and    there is none righteous no not one there is none that understands there is none that seeks after god they are all gone out of the way they are altogether become unprofitable there is none that does good no not one their throat is an open sepulcher with their tongues have they used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace have they not known  then as to grace or the operation of the spirit to cure this miserable condition of mankind peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and your children and to all that are afar off this is a very extensive declaration both as to time and place after peter had told the people the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree him has god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance unto israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his witnesses of these things and so also is the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him the apostle adds then they the gentiles were filled with the holy ghost all who obeyed without distinction had the holy ghost given them and it was a witness to them of the truth of christs divine mission and the good effects of it according to the promise of the lord to wit he shall testify of me  st paul likewise tells us if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god  here we see the necessity of having the spirit of christ and that those who have it not do not belong to him they are none of his we may likewise observe that it mortifies the deeds of the body and quickens the soul to a life of holiness the passage likewise shows that the spirit bears witness with our spirits and by an evidence peculiar to itself gives us a certain sense or understanding of it  in short sir a great number of texts might be produced to show not only the work and effect of the divine spirit upon our minds but that it is an evidence the principal evidence and ground of certainty to believers respecting the truth of christianity i will mention however only two or three more and then shall be glad to hear what you say to those things  what man knows the spirit of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knows no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are freely given to us of god  ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things these things have i written to you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you and ye need not that any teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you ye shall abide in it  hereby we know that he abides in us by his spirit which he has given us hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit  what do you say to all this do not the sacred passages i have repeated seem to declare in the planest manner the necessary iniquity of man that this is to be cured only and his nature rectified by the operation of the divine spirit and that the effusion of the spirit both as to instruction and evidence was not peculiar to the infancy of christianity this appears to my understanding the very essence of the christian religion i think from these scriptures consists in the power and efficacy of the spiritual principle  the state of religion from the creation to this time what you have said madam i replied seems strong indeed in defense of the weakness of man and the operation of the spirit and i should be of your way of thinking as to the manifestation of it but that i imagine the thing may be explained in a different manner let us review our religion if you please and perhaps we may find that another account may be given of sanctification and the renewing the mind into a state of holiness  when god called this world into being his purpose was without all peradventure that his rational creatures might enjoy the noblest pleasures and by conforming their conduct to the fitness and relation of things from a due regard to the authority of the first cause by whom this fitness and relation were wisely constituted secure all the blessings of this life and honor and glory and immortality in some future state of existtence this i think was the case true religion was to form and fix every good principle in the human mind produce all righteousness in the conversation and thereby render mankind the blessed of the universal father they were to worship the one true god the possessor of all being and the fountain of all good to believe in him and have their trust and dependence always on him to be pure and peaceable gentle and full of mercy without partiality without hypocrisy and so devoted to holiness and obedience to every virtue and every good work which the law of reason can require from men that after a long life spent in acting a part the most honorable to god and the most advantageous to mankind in obeying the dictates of reason and thereby imitating the example of god they might be translated to the regions of immortality and day where the first and great original displays as it were face to face the perfections of the deity and from an allperfect and holy being receive the vast rewards he has prepared for those who in this first state have been to all the purposes of life and religion perfect as he is perfect for these reasons did the supreme director the greatest and the best being in the universe command the human race into existence he gave them faculties to conduct them here through various scenes of happiness to the realms of immortality and immutable felicity it was a godlike design  but it was not very long before this human race became corrupt and not only did evil in the sight of the lord but ceased to apprehend the first cause as one most perfect mind the natural notions of moral perfection which reason and the light of nature supply they no longer minded nor thought of what is fit and reasonable to be done in every case the passions began to influence and direct their lives just and pure ideas of the deity were lost false ones took place and the mischief and its fatal consequences became very great it was a melancholy scene the exalted notions of one glorious god and of that true religion which subsists in the expectation of a future state were no longer known nor did the race ever think of approving themselves in the eye of an all perfect and holy being superstition and iniquity prevailed and the spread of evil was wide  god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth  the thoughts of his heart evil continually etc as you have before quoted from the book of genesis and because the wickedness of the tenth generation was so great and men no longer endeavored after those perfections which are natural and proper to rational minds  no longer thought of conforming themselves to the divine nature or strove to imitate the excellencies of it though constituted to give glory to their maker and endued with a reason and understanding sufficient to teach them the rule of duty and guide their steps in the ways of true religion but against the light of their own minds acted the most impious and unsociable part therefore god repented that he had made them that is he did what is the product of repentance in men when they undo as far as it is in their power what they repent of and destroyed his own work by that desolating judgment the flood this seems to be the truth of the case the words of moses do not mean the state of human nature on account of the fall they express only the wickedness of the tenth generation as a reason for the deluge at that time there is not the least ground for asserting from this passage in the sacred historian that man was unable to do good by his natural powers and that his crimes were a resisting the actings of god upon his mind the impiety of this generation was a mere abuse of free will and acting against the plain dictates of their own minds therefore when wilful oppression and sensuality filled the earth god destroyed the world by an inundation noah only who was a just man and perfect in his generation with his family escaped  this terrible execution of an awful vengeance on the guilty race demonstrated to the survivors and to all the ages to come the great malignity of sin and the uncontrolable supremacy of the divine government as the venerable patriarch and his family failed over the bosom of the boundless ocean of waters and above the wrecks and ruins of this terrestrial world they adored to be sure with grateful hearts the almighty father of virtue and goodness who had so wonderfully preserved them and were convinced by the amazing striking evidence that sin is the greatest infamy and degradation of our reasonable nature that it has an insuperable repugnancy and irreversible contrariety to our true happiness and is infamous pernicious and ruinous by the sentence of the almighty the dreadful event unanswerably evinced his constant actual cognizance of enormous faith and manners and his unchangeable displeasure with them this truth which was learnt at first by the expulsion from paradise and the sad inheritance of mortality they saw again republished in the most awful manner this gave undoubtedly a very religious turn to their minds and they determined to be sure to adhere to those excellent principles and practices which had been through gods goodness their security in the general desolation and to flee the contrary malignant ones which had procured that desolation on the rest in a degree suitable to their nature and ability they resolved to imitate the perfections of god and to employ the powers and faculties of reason in endeavoring to be just and righteous and merciful and as the amazing operation of god in the deluge called for their wonder and praise we must think their hearts glowed with the sense of his goodness to them and that they extolled his mercy and power in the salvation they had received so we are told by an inspired writer noah restored the ancient rites of divine service and built an altar to the lord and the lord smelled a sweet savor and said never any more will i curse the ground for mans sake though the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth because he will not hearken to the voice of reason and with the greatest ardor and contention of mind labor to attain a conformity to the divine nature in the moral perfections of it which is the true dignity of man and the utmost excellence of human souls neither will i again smite any more every living creature as i have done while the earth remains seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease  thus did god enter into a covenant with noah and his sons and their seed and as the late amazing occurrences must incline the spectators of the flood to piety and goodness and the fathers of the postdiluvian world were careful to instruct their children in the several parts of the stupendous fact and from the whole inculcate the being and perfections of god his universal dominion and actual providence and government over all things his love of virtue and goodness and infinite detestation of all sin to which we may add that the imitation of god is not a new principle introduced into religion by revelation but has its foundation in the reason and nature of things  we may from hence conclude that the rising generation were persons of conspicuous devotion and followed after the moral virtues the holiness justice and mercy which the light of nature discovers they were i believe most excellent mortals for some time they obeyed to be sure every dictate of reason and adored and praised the invisible deity the supreme immutable mind  but this beautiful scene had an end and man once more forgot his maker and himself he prostituted the honor of both by robbing god of the obedience due to him and by submitting himself a slave to the elements of the world when he looked up to the heavens and saw the glory of the sun and stars instead of praising the lord of all he foolishly said these are thy gods o man a universal apostasy from the primitive religion prevailed they began with the heavenly bodies or sydereal gods and proceeded to heroes brutes and images till the world was overflowed with an inundation of idolatry and superstition even such superstition as nourished under the notion of religion and pleasing the gods the most bestial impurities the most inhuman and unnatural cruelties and the most unmanly and contemptible follies moral virtue and goodness were totally extinguished when men had lost the sense of the supreme being the creator governor and judge of the world they not only ceased to be righteous and holy but became necessarily vicious and corrupt in practice for iniquity flows from corrupt religion as the waters from the spring the principles and ceremonies of the established idolatries gave additional strength to mens natural inclinations to intemperance lust fraud violence and every kind of unrighteousness and debauchery long before the days of moses this was the general case idolatry had violated all the duties of true religion and the most abominable practices by constitution were authorized the phalli ex ea re tum privatim tum public lignea virilia thyrsis alligata per eam solemnitatem gestabant fuit enim phallus

virgins before marriage were to sacrifice their chastity to the honor of venus this is taken notice of by the prophet jeremiah  the women also with cords about them the ranges in the temple sitting in the ways burn bran for perfume but if any of them drawn by some that passes by lie with her she reproacheth her fellow that she was not thought as worthy as her self nor her cord broken baruch      herodotus explanes this passage of the prophet every woman at babylon says the historian was obliged once in her life to sit down openly in the temple of venus in order to prostitute her self to some stranger they enter into the temple and sit down crowned with garlands some continually going out and others coming in the galleries where they sit are built in a strait line and open on every side that all strangers may have a free passage to choose such women as they like best those women who excel in beauty and shape are soon dismissed but the deformed are sometimes necessitated to wait three or four years before they can satisfy the law the men declared their choice by throwing money into the lap of the woman they most admired which she was by no means to refuse but instantly retire with the man that accosted her and fulfill the law women of rank for none were dispensed with might sit in covered chariots for the purpose whilst their servants waited at a distance till they had done herodot l   c        and      strabo likewise gives us an account to the same purpose l    p      and justin gives this reason for this custom  lest venus alone should appear lascivious ne sola

pilgr l   c    p    confirms this notion having seen the thing practiced in his travels in the east but grotius on baruch says the meaning was the women had cords given them as a token that they were under the vow of prostitution which when they had performed the cord was properly said to be broken for every vow may be called vinculum or a cord as i take it the case was both as hyde and grotius relate it i was in company with a physician who had spent many years of his life in the east and he assured me he had seen both circumstances practiced in the kingdom of cranganor  as to the womans burning incense or bran for a perfume it was the custom before coition by way of charm and incentive when a babylonian and his wise had a mind to correspond they always first lit up the suming pan imagining it improved the passion so in the pharmaceutria of theocritus p    we see simoetha is using her incantation nunc furfures sacrificabo  the word made use of in jeremiahs epistle  and as if all this had not been lust enough in their religion it was farther declared in their ritual that those were best qualified for the sacerdotal function who were born of mothers who conceived them of their own sons  in respect of human sacrifices if you would have a full account of them consult the following autors and you will find that the canaanites were far from being the only pagans who were guilty of this unnatural barbarity  seldom de diis syris segort   c   and all the autors he quotes grotius on deuteronomy    isaac vos de orig idol l   c   dion vossius on maimon de idol c   lud vives notes on st aug de civit dei l   c     ouzelius and elmenhorstius notes on min foelix spencer de leg hebr l   c    and fabricius bibliographia c     men were offered upon the altars for sacrifices and children were burnt alive to moloch and adramalech in a word the most abominable immoralities universally prevailed with the encouragements of religion men were led into intemperance uncleanness murders and many vices inconsistent with the prosperity and peace of society as well as with the happiness of private persons and that such iniquities might have a perpetual source the most shameful idolatries were preserved in opposition to the knowledge and worship of the one true god so general was this corruption and idolatry that the infection seized the descendants of shem the pious race even terah the father of abram we find charged with it and abram himself was culpable i think in this respect as the word asebes imports it is rendered in our bible ungodly but it signifies more properly idolatry and that is what st paul in the  th chapter to the romans hints the apostle speaking of abraham says  but to him that works not but believes in him that justifies the ungodly that is an ungodly idolater who has no manner of claim to the blessings of god he must be justified upon the foot not of his own prior obedience but of gods mercy  in such a calamitous state a revelation to restore the law of nature and make it more fully and clearly known to enforce its observance to afford helps and motives to the better performance of what it enjoins and relieve the guilty mind against all its doubts would certainly be a merciful vouchsafement from god to mankind and be much for their advantage and happiness and therefore in the year from the flood     after the flood     bef chr    0 to provide for the restoration of the true religion and preserve the knowledge and worship of the one true god on earth in opposition to the prevailing idolatry and the gross immoralities that were the effects of idolatrous principles and practices jehovah commanded abraham to leave his country his kindred and his fathers house and proceed with his family to the land of canaan here god entered into covenants with abraham and his posterity bp sherlock on propheey well observes that two covenants were given to abraham one a temporal covenant to take place in the land of canaan  the other a covenant of better hope to be performed in a better country p     to be instruments in the hands of providence for bringing about great designs in the world  that he and his posterity were to be the church of god and depositaries of a hope that the covenant limited to abraham and his chosen seed was to grow in the fullness of time into a blessing upon all the nations of the earth abraham was at this time    years old and god added to the patriarchal worship the visible mark of circumcision as a seal of a covenant between himself and abraham  yet how fit soever such a visible mark might be to keep in remembrance the covenant between god and the family of abraham it was found in experience insufficient to preserve them from the idolatrous customs of their neighbors  some new laws some further constitutions of worship were to be added or as the family of abraham were situated in the midst of idolaters and unrighteous ones it was foreseen they would soon fall from the essentials of religion and instead of preserving a right knowledge of god of his being perfections and government a just sense of the reverence all men owe to him from a firm belief of his being power dominion justice and goodness and an hearty concern to obey the known will of god in all things doing what is pleasing in his sight seeking and hoping their perfection and happiness in the likeness and in the image of god they would on the contrary serve other gods and make their idolatry not a matter of harmless speculation but a fountain of the most dangerous immoralities and therefore as it was highly fit in it self and well becoming the wisdom of god he gave moses a christianity in hieroglyphics that is a tabernacle a shechinah a priesthood an altar sacrifices laws moral and ceremonial with every constituent part of the hebrew ritual being figures of a better shekinah temple priest altar sacrifice revelation and blessings  figurative representations of the more perfect constitutions in the days of messiah the king  this was in the year     after the flood and      before christ by a ritual so becoming the wisdom of god given for a preservative against idolatrous principles and as a dispensation preparatory to that future heavenly religion the hebrew nation were guarded against the surrounding corruptions of the world and raised up the defenders of true religion to preserve the knowledge and worship of the one true god  but as mankind would not follow the light of nature which is sufficient when attended to for a constant universal practice of piety and morality so neither would they be engaged by various reveled laws from time to time given and by the calls and lessons of many prophets to the practice of true religion and righteousness but as the heart is the seat and source of wickedness in man according to the prophet jeremiah so even the hearts of the jews became deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and the prophet goes on to show not the necessary inability of man without experiences or an operating spirit within as you suppose madam but that though men thus wickedly deceive one another yet they cannot possibly by such a wilful desperate piece of wickedness deceive their maker because to him the most secret recesses of their hearts lie open and consequently in the issue they deceive themselves seeing god who knows the deceit which is lodged in their hearts will render unto them according to their works and according to the fruit of their doings so that their hope and expectation will be disappointed even as a partridge is disappointed that sits on eggs and hatcheth them not  and as st paul says from the xiv and liii psalm there was none righteous no not one there is none that understands there is none that seeks after god and so on as you madam have quoted the verses in which the apostle did not intend to show the necessary pollution of man without the help of grace but the groundlessness of that opinion which the jews had gone into that they were the only people which pleased god for they were as guilty as the gentiles were in transgressing the law of nature neither of them had any legal title to justification they were all very great transgressors the throat of jew and gentile and open sepulcher their tongues deceit the poison of asps under their lips their mouths full of cursing and bitterness their feet swift to shed blood destruction and misery in their ways and the way of peace have they not known therefore the justification of the jew as well as the gentile must be of grace and not of debt  in this was manifested the inestimable love of god in the redemption of the world by jesus christ though jew and gentile were qualified to discern and do both good and evil and the jew had a written law as a further assistance but nevertheless they violated the plain dictates of natural reason and the divine precepts of the law and by unrighteousness and impurity rendered themselves objects of judgment and condemnation yet the father of the universe in compassion to mankind sent a divine teacher from heaven christ the true prophet that was to come into the world and by his divinely reveled testimony and authority attempts to abolish the superstition of men reclaim their wickedness and bring them back to the true spiritual worship of god and to that holiness of life and manners which is agreeable to the uncorrupted light and dictates of nature this was love the blessed god in compassion to human ignorance and wickedness contracted by mens own fault gives them an express revelation of his will and reestablishes the rule of pure incorrupt religion and morality he declares those terms of sinful mans reconcilement to him which he was pleased to accept grace is manifested in the gospel to turn men from their vanities or idol service unto the living god who made heaven and earth and by the doctrine and sacrifice of jesus christ to redeem us from all iniquity and purify to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works  that denying all ungodlyness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearance of the great god who will judge the world by that divine person and great temporary minister whom he sent before to destroy sin and the kingdom of satan and to bring mankind into a perfect obedience to the will of the supreme being this renders christianity a heavenly thing revelation thus explained is beautiful and useful to an extreme degree it does not contradict but strengthens the obligations of natural religion  your account sir mrs price answered of man and religion is different indeed from mine and i must allow your explications have reason in them but still they do not satisfy me nor can i part with my own opinion two things in particular to me appear very strange in your scheme it seems to take away the necessity of the christain revelation if natural religion duly attended to was perfect and sufficient for virtue and holiness and thereby to gain the favor of god if reason alone can do the work if men please then what need of the gospel  if men will consider and without consideration no scheme can be of service they may as well turn their thoughts to the law of nature as to the law of grace if there is no difference betwixt the rule of nature and the law of christ with regard to the knowledge of god the maker of heaven and earth and the worship due to him on that account and the practice of virtue and morality  in the next place if i understand you right the grace of god is of no use at all in religion as you account for salvation what is out of order within us in the mind and its faculties the will and its affections and wants to be set right in good thoughts and works our own reason in your notion of religion is sufficient to regulate and unassisted by the illumination of the holy spirit of god we may live in an uncorrupted state of piety and morality and so save our souls if we please this is what i cannot believe the grace of god in the gospel is the glory and comfort of the christian religion a divine operation that renews and sanctifies the mind is an invaluable blessing and in a manner inexpressibly charming satisfies me beyond hesitation that the christian religion is true while it puts me in the actual possession of the good effects of it the spirit of god discovers to me the state of my own mind in all the circumstances of a christian life sets my follies my neglects and my failings in order before me which is the first right step in order to the overcoming them and then observing the discoveries i was not able to make my self and having a strong faith in the divine power and sufficiency i am enabled to gain victories my insufficient reason could never obtain may this divine monitor then abide in my breast it is by the heavenly assistance of the holy spirit only as vouchsafed in the christian dispenation that i can secure for myself eternal life the wise and prudent of this world may think as they please of this matter and produce reasonings against it beyond my power to answer but for my part i must consider it as the principle of my salvation and think i cannot be thankful enough for the inestimable blessing it is to me a glorious instance of the great wisdom and goodness of god  madam i replied in relation to your first objection that i make no difference between reveled and natural religion for nature is as sufficient as grace in my account i assure you that i think the revelation of the gospel excels the best scheme of natural religion that could be proposed in declaring the terms of reconcilement in demonstrating the divine wrath against sin in the method of showing mercy by the death of gods beloved son and the promise of free pardon on the condition of repentance and newness of life this manner gives unspeakable comfort to repenting sinners it gives the greatest encouragement to engage them to the love of god and the practice of all his commandments an encouragement that reason could not discover to christianity therefore the true preference is due though philosophy or the doctrine of reason may reform men yet the christian religion is a clearer and more powerful guide it improves the light of reason by the supernatural evidence and declaration of gods will and the means of mans redemption is a more efficacious motive and obligation to universal obedience than nature could ever with certainty propose a revelation that has the clearest and strongest evidence of being the divine will must be the most easy and effectual method of instruction and be more noticed than the best human teaching and this will of god being truly and faithfully committed to writing and preserved incorrupt must always be the best and surest rule of faith and manners it is a rule absolutely free from all those errors and superstitions both of belief and practice which no human composure was ever before free from or probably would have been free from without the assistance of such a revelation nor is this all this is not the only superior excellence of our holy religion  a mediator and crucified redeemer brought into the christian revelation has a noble effect on a considering mind and shows the reasonableness of the gospel dispensation the wisest and most rational heathens ever were for sacrifices and mediators as the greatness of god was thereby declared and that not only sin deserved punishment but mens lives to be forfeited by their breach of the divine laws and when a divine person made man like unto us appears instead of all other mediators by whom as the instrument of the means of salvation we are to offer up our prayers to the only true god and his voluntary dying in testimony of the truth of his mission and doctrine is appointed to be instead of all other sacrifices and to remain a memorial that god requires no atonement of us but repentance and newness of life and the spotless virtues and obedience of this divine redeemer are to be a most perfect and moving example for us to imitate  this renders christianity worthy of god and makes it the perfection of religion great then are the advantages which the revelation of christ jesus has above mere reason darkened by the clouds of error and a general corruption it is the most perfect rule of life it is the most powerful means to promote a constant uniform practice of virtue and piety it advances human nature to its highest perfection fills it with all the fruits of righteousness and grants us privileges and blessings far superior to what we could attain any other way  with regard to the second objection that i take away the grace of god to preserve the dignity of human nature this is far from my intention i do indeed think that as the gospel was given for the noblest purpose to wit to call in an extraordinary manner upon mankind to forsake that vice and idolatry the corrupt creed of polytheism the guilt of superstition their great iniquities violent passions and worldly affections which are all contrary to reason and disgrace human nature and to practice that whole system of morality which they must know to be most useful to them  that they might turn to a religion which had but one object the great invisible being allknowing and allsufficient to whom all the intelligent world are to make their devout applications because he is an infinite independent sovereign mind who has created all things and absolutely rules and governs all possesses all natural perfections exists in all duration fills all space with his presence and is the omniscient witness of all their difficulties and wants  and that since they were bound by all the ties of moral duty to obey this one god and observe the rational institutions of religion therefore they should make it the labor of their whole lives to excel in holiness and righteousness and by virtue and piety unite themselves to god and entitle themselves to glory at the great day  that as this is the nature end and design of the christian revelation so i do think the gospel of our salvation the word of truth as an apostle calls it is sufficient for the purpose without immediate impulses as we have a reasonable intellectual nature there is no want of mechanical powers the words of christ which are the words of god are our life and will if attended to and powerfully enable us to practice good works and to excel and persevere therein i can do all these things through christ who strengthens me that is through the written directions of christ and through the arguments and motives of the christian doctrine to say otherwise of the gospel is in my opinion injurious to it  god may to be sure give special aids to men whenever he thinks fit he may by an extraordinary agency render our faculties more capable of apprehension where divine things are concerned  may awaken a dormant idea which lay neglected in the memory with unusual energy  may secretly attract the more attentive regard of the mind and give it an inclination and an ability of tracing its various relations with an unusual attention so that a luster before quite unknown shall be as it were poured upon it  the spirit of god may render the mind more susceptible and more tenacious of divine knowledge i believe he often does by interposition if in the spirit of christs doctrine we ask it of the great father of lights the author of all the understanding divided among the various ranks of created beings who as he first formed the minds of angels and men continues the exercise of their intellectual faculties and one way or another communicates to them all the knowledge of every kind which they possess in which view all our knowledge of every kind may be called a revelation from god and be ascribed as it is by elihu in job to the inspiration of the almighty this the holy spirit may do and dissipate a prejudice that opposes truth but this is not always necessary nor always to be expected it is evident from the gospel that our lord rather speaks of his word and doctrine as the aids to save mens souls than of himself or spirit personally considered abiding in him and he in them as necessary to their bearing fruit signifies a strict and steady regard to his word and the influence of that upon our minds if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you that is if you continue to believe in me and to pay a steady regard to my doctrine you will be highly acceptable to god  in short as no man can come unto me says our lord except the father which has sent me draw him that is no man will receive my pure sublime and spiritual doctrine unless he have first gained some just apprehensions concerning the general principles of religion but if he has a good notion of god and his perfections and desires to advance in virtue he will come unto me and hearken to that revelation which contains the best directions for the performance of all the duties and the greatest incitement to virtue piety and devotion  so no man can come to the father but by the son that is by obeying the written word and proceeding in that way in which the son has declared it to be the will of the father that men should come to him namely by keeping gods commandments and by repentance and amendment of life there being no other name or way given among men but this way given or declared by jesus christ by which they may be saved  in all this there is not a word of supernatural light or operation though such operation as before observed there may be there is not a hint of mans natural inability  to the glorious gospel then the gospel of our salvation the word of truth the word of life let us come and with diligence and impartiality study it let us follow the truth we there find in every page and it will enable us to triumph over the temptations of allurement and of terror we shall become the children of god by the spirit of adoption we shall be easy and happy in this life and glorious and ever blessed in that which is to come if we obey the gospel of the son of god and hearken to his word he will take us under his guardian care he descended from heaven to deliver us from everlasting ruin he purchased us with the price of his own blood and if we live up to the word of truth he will conduct us safely through life and death into the abode of holy and happy spirits and at length raise our bodies from the dust and fix our complete persons in a state of immortal glory and felicity  this is my sense of religion where i am wrong i shall ever be glad to be set right  mrs price made no reply and so ended this remarkable conversation on whose side the truth is the reader is to judge what she says for supernatural operation is strong and pious to be sure and considering mrs price had no learning and was almost without any reading i thought it very wonderful to hear her on this and many other subjects she was such another genius as chubb but on the other side of the question if she had been able to write as sensibly and correctly as she talked on several articles of religion she would have made a good author so much goodness and good sense i have not very often found in her kind they merit a memorial in a journal of the curious things that have occurred to me in my life time     my departure from lasco in stanemore a farther description of this wild and solitary part of the world the   th of june      i took my leave of my friend john price and his admirable wife promising to visit them again as soon as it was in my power and proceeded on my journey in quest of mr turner i would not let price go with me on second thoughts as many sad accidents might happen in this rough and desolate part of the world and no relief in such case to be found if i fell there was no one belonging to me to shed a tear for me but if a mischief should befall jack price his wife would be miserable indeed and i the maker of a breach in the sweetest system of felicity that love and good sense had ever formed this made me refuse his repeated offers to accompany me all i would have was a boy and horse of his to carry some provisions wet and dry as there was no public house to be found in ascending those tremendous hills or in the deep vales through which i must go nor any house that he knew of beyond his own  with the rising sun then i set out and was charmed for several hours with the air and views the mountains the rocky precipices the woods and the waters appeared in various striking situations every mile i traveled on and formed the most astonishing points of view sometimes i was above the clouds and then crept to enchanting valleys below here glins were seen that looked as if the mountains had been rent asunder to form the amazing scenes and there forests and falling streams covered the sides of the hills rivers in many places in the most beautiful cascades were tumbling along and cataracts from the tops of mountains came roaring down the whole was grand wonderful and fine on the top of one of the mountains i passed over at noon the air was piercing cold on account of its great height and so subtle that we breathed with difficulty and were a little sick from hence i saw several black subjacent clouds big with thunder and the lightning within them rolled backwards and forwards like shining bodies of the brightest luster one of them went off in the grandest horrors through the vale below and had no more to do with the pike i was on than if it had been a summit in another planet the scene was prodigious fine sub pedibus ventos and rauca tonitrua calcat  till the evening i rid and walked it and in numberless windings round unpassable hills and by the sides of rivers it was impossible to cross journeyed a great many miles but no human creature or any kind of house did i meet with in all the long way and as i arrived at last at a beautiful lake whose banks the hand of nature had adorned with vast old trees i sat down by this water in the shade to dine on a neats tongue i had got from good mrs price and was so delighted with the striking beauties and stillness of the place that i determined to pass the night in this sweet retreat nor was it one night only if i had my will that i would have rested there often did i wish for a convenient little lodge by this sweet water side and that with the numerous swans and other fowl that lived there i might have spent my time in peace below till i was removed to the established seat of happiness above     a reflection had this been possible i should have avoided many an affliction and had known but few of those expectations and disappointments which render life a scene of emptiness and bitterness itself my years would have rolled on in peace and wisdom in this sequestered delightful scene and my silent meditations had been productive of that good temper and good action which the resurrection of the dead the dissolution of the world the judgment day and the eternal state of men require us to have free from the various perplexities and troubles i have experienced by land and sea in different parts of the world i should have lived in this paradise of a place in the enjoyment of that fine happiness which easy country business and a studious life afford and might have made a better preparation for that hour which is to disunite me and let my invisible spirit depart to the shades of eternity happy they who in some such rural retirement can employ some useful hours every day in the management of a little comfortable farm and devote the greater portion of their time to sacred knowledge heavenly piety and angelick goodness which cannot be dissolved when the thinker goes nor be confined to the box of obscurity under the clods of the earth but will exist in our souls for ever and enable us to depart in peace to the happy regions this has ever made me prefer a retired country life when it was in my power to enjoy it but be it town or country the main business my good readers should be to secure an inheritance in that eternal world where the sanctified live with god and his christ getting keeping multiplying money dress pleasure entry are not only little things for such beings as we are they are indeed sad principal work for creatures that are passing away to an everlasting state there to lament their lost day and talents misapplied in dreadful agonies in the habitations of darkness  or to remain for ever in the habitations of light peace and joy if you have labored to obtain and improve in the graces and virtuous qualities which the gospel recommends these are the treasure and possession worth a christians acquiring these only are portable into the eternal world when the body that was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day is laid in a cold and narrow cave take my advice then reader be ready let us so think and act in this first state that in the next we may meet in the regions of purity and righteousness serenity and joy   0 an account of an extraordinary effusion of water from a mountain the lake i have mentioned was the largest i had seen in this wild part being above a mile in length and more than half a mile broad and the water that filled it burst with the greatest impetuosity from the inside of a rocky mountain that is very wonderful to behold it is a vast craggy precipice that ascends till it is almost out of sight and by its gloomy and tremendous air strikes the mind with a horror that has something pleasing in it this amazing cliff stands perpendicular at one end of the lake at the distance of a few yards and has an opening at the bottom that is wide enough for two coaches to enter at once if the place was dry in the middle of it there is a deep channel down which the water rushes with a mighty swiftness and force and on either side the stone rises a yard above the impetuous stream the ascent is easy flat and plane how far it goes i know not being afraid to ascend more than forty yards not only on account of the terrors common to the place from the fall of so much water with a strange kind of roar and the height of the arch which covers the torrent all the way but because as i went up there was of a sudden an increase of noise so very terrible that my heart failed me and a trembling almost disabled me the rock moved under me as the frightful sounds increased and as quick as it was possible for me i came into day again it was well i did for i had not been many minutes out before the water overflowed its channel and filled the whole opening in rushing to the lake the increase of the water and the violence of the discharge were an astonishing sight i had a great escape     the cause of the eruption of water from the inside of the mountain and its sudden increase as the rocky mountain i have mentioned is higher than either snowden in north wales or kedaridris in merionethshire which have been thought the highest mountains in this island that is it is full a mile and an half high from the basis as i found by ascending it with great toil on the side that was from the water and the top was a flat dry rock that had not the least spring or piece of water on it how shall we account for the rapid flood that proceeded from its inside where did this great water come from  i answer might it not flow from the great abyss  and the great increase of it and the fearful noise and the motion of the rock be owing to some violent commotion in the abyss occasioned by some natural or supernatural cause     the origin of earthquakes that there is such an abyss no one can doubt that believes revelation and from reason and history it is credible that there are violent concussions on this vast collection of water by the divine appointment and therefore i imagine it is from thence the water of this mountain proceeds and the great overflowing and terrifying sound at certain times to this motion of the abyss by the divine power exerted on it i ascribe the earthquakes and not to vapor or electricity as to electricity which dr stukeley makes the cause of the deplorable downfall of lisbon nov         in his book lately published called the philosophy of earthquakes there are many things to be objected against its being the origin of such calamities  one objection is and it is an insuperable one that electrical shocks are ever momentary by every experiment but earthquakes are felt for several minutes another is that many towns have been swallowed up in earthquakes though lisbon was only overthrown such was the case of the city of callao within two leagues of lima though lima was only tumbled into ruins october         yet callao sunk downright with all its inhabitants and an unfathomable sea now covers the finest port in peru as i have seen on the spot  in the earthquake at jamaica june        in which several thousands perished it is certain that not only many houses and a great number of people were entirely swallowed up but that at many of the gapings or openings of the earth torrents of water that formed great rivers issued forth this i had from a man of veracity then on the spot who was an eyewitness of these things and expected himself every minute to descend to the bowels of the earth which heaved and swelled like a rolling sea now to me the electrical stroke does not appear sufficient to produce these things the power of electricity to be sure is vast and amazing it may cause great tremors and undulations of the earth and bring down all the buildings of a great city but as to splitting the earth to great depths and forcing up torrents of water where there was no sign of the fluid element before i question much if the vehemence of the elemental electric fire does this  beside when mountains and cities sink into the earth and the deepest lakes are now seen to fill all the place where they once stood as has been the case in many countries where could these mighty waters come but from the abyss  the great lake oroquantur in pegu was once a vast city in jamaica there is a large deep lake where once a mountain stood  in an earthquake in china in the province of sanci deluges of water burst out of the earth feb        and inundated the country for   0 miles many more instances of this kind i might produce exclusive of sodom the ground of which was inundated by an irruption of waters from beneath which now forms the dead sea after the city was destroyed by fire from above that the land which had been defiled with the unnatural lusts of the inhabitants might be no more inhabited but remain a lasting monument of the divine vengeance on such crimes to the end of the world and the use i would make of those i have mentioned is to show that these mighty waters were from the furious concussion of the abyss that caused the earthquakes electricity i think can never make seas and vast lakes to be where there were none before locherne in the county of fermanagh in the province of ulster in ireland is thirty three miles long and fourteen broad and as the old irish chronicle informs us was once a place where large and populous towns appeared till for the great iniquity of the inhabitants the people and their fair habitations were destroyed in an earthquake and mighty waters from the earth covered the place and formed this lake could the electrical stroke produce this sea that was not to be found there before the destruction is it not more reasonable to suppose that such vast waters have been forced by a supernatural commotion from the great abyss in the earthquake that destroyed the towns which once stood in this place  to this then till i am better informed i must ascribe such earthquakes as produce great rivers and lakes and where no waters appear i believe the earthquakes are caused by the immediate finger of god either operating on the abyss though not so as to make the water break out on the earth or by directing the electrical violence or stroke or otherwise acting on the ruined cities and shattered places     a reflection on second causes and the deitys being not only at the head of nature but in every part of it for my part i think it is a grievous mistake in our philosophical enquiries to assign so much to second causes as the learned do the government of the universe is given to matter and motion and under pretense of extolling original contrivance the execution of all is left to dead substance it is just and reasonable even newton and maclaurin say to suppose that the whole chain of causes or the several series of them should center in him as their source and fountain and the whole system appear depending upon him the only independent cause now to me this supposition does not appear either just or reasonable i think the noble phoenomena of nature ought to be ascribed to the immediate operation of the deity without looking for a subtle elastic medium to produce gravity which medium sir isaac confesses he had no proof of nor is there in reality such a thing in the universe i imagine the divine newton would have done better if after establishing the true system of nature by demonstrating the law of gravity he had said this gravity was the constant and undeniable evidence of the immediate influence of the deity in the material universe a series of material causes betwixt deity and effect is in truth concealing him from the knowledge of mortals for ever in the moral government of the world second causes do because freeagents act a part but in the material universe to apply them to me seems improper as matter and motion only that is mechanism come in competition with the deity most certainly he constantly interposes the divine power is perpetually put forth throughout all nature every particle of matter must necessarily by its nature for ever go wrong without the continued act of deity his everlasting interposition only can cause a body moving in a circle to change the direction of its motion in every point nor is it possible for subtle matter the supposed cause of gravity to know to impel bodies to a center with quadruple force at half the distance  and as in gravity and in the cohesion of the parts of matter the deity is and acts in the motion of the celestial bodies and in the resistance the least particles make to any force that would separate them so is his immediate power i think for myself exerted not only in earthquakes and tides but in the circulations of the blood lymph and chyle in muscular motion and in various other phoenomena that might be named books i know have been written and ingenious books they are to show the causes of these things and trace the ways they are performed by the materials themselves but these explications never satisfied me i had as many questions to ask after reading these books as i had before i looked into them and could find no operator but infinite power conducted by infinite wisdom  the periodical motions of the waters of the sea owing to immaterial power as to the force of the moon in raising tides and that spring tides are produced by the sum of the actions of the two luminaries when the moon is in syzygy there is a deal of fine mathematical reasoning to prove it which the reader may find in dr halleys abstract of sir isaac newtons theory of the tides and in dr rutherforths system of natural philosophy but nevertheless the concomitance of water and luminary or the revolutions of ocean and moon answering one another so exactly that the flow always happens when the moon hangs over the ocean and the spring tides when it is nearer the earth which is supposed to be in the new and full moon  this does not prove to me that the periodical flux and reflux of the sea is derived from mechanism as we have two ebbs and two flows in twentyfour hours and the moon comes but once in that time to our meridian how can the second ebb and flow be ascribed to it and when beneath the horizon in the opposite hemisphere the moon crosses the meridian again is it credible that from the eastern and southern ocean round goodhope and capehorn it should as soon overflow our coasts as when it is vertical to the shores of guinea  if the moon in conjunction with the sun by pression and attraction was the principal cause of flux and reflux why is there no established tide on the mediterraneansea though of a vast breadth and two thousand miles in length from the streights of gibraltar to the coasts of syria and palestine but only some irregular and unaccountable swellings and falls in a few places of this sea to wit at tunis messina venice and negropont and these swellings as i have seen flowing sometimes         and   times in    hours in the most irregular manner against the fixed laws of pression and attraction ascribed to the moon and sun on a supposition of their causing the tides  if pression and the strong attractive power of the moon and the weaker influence of the sun forces the immense ocean twice a day from its natural quietus and rolls it in tides why has the caspian sea no tide no swelling or flow reregular or irregular excepting that sometimes in the space of    years and never sooner it rises many fathoms and drowns the adjacent country to the almostruin sometimes of astracan in asiatick russia as happened when i was there to embark for persia  if it be said that this is properly a lake having no communication with the ocean yet i answer that it is in every quality of saltness etc as much a sea as any other sea and large enough for the luminaries attraction and pression being  00 miles from north to south and near  00 miles in breadth from east to west i say large enough to avoid continuing necessarily in equilibrio as dr rutherforth says must be the case on account of the small extent of this sea  00 by  00 miles of sea does not require that such a sea should press equally or that the gravity of its water should be equally diminished in every part of it and so out of the powers addititious and ablatitious of the luminary that is the force with which the moon increases the waters gravity and the force with which the moon diminishes the waters gravity if the moon in zenith or nadir did the work the equilibrium of the the caspian might be destroyed as well as any other equilibrium of water by force addititious or ablatitious or by the sum of these forces therefore there might by this theory be tides in the caspian sea though not great ones there are small as well as great tides the tides of the atlantic ocean are inferior in every respect to those of the larger pacific ocean a quarter of a great circle of the earth that is an extent of ocean from east to west  0 is only required that the tides may have their full motion a tide of less motion may be in such an extent of sea as the caspian  in the last place how does the theory of tides account for the regular peculiarity of the flux and reflux of the atlantic different from all other tides while at bathsha in the kingdom of tunquin there never is more than one tide in    hours and some days no tide  for my part i resolve the whole into the immediate power of the deity this power is gravity attraction repulse the inactivity of matter requires the constancy and universality of divine power to support the material universe and move it as occasion requires that is as infinite wisdom sees most conducive to the benefit of his creation  earthquakes the effect of immaterial causes men of fine imagination may make a wonderful display of mathematical learning in accounts of gravity etc combined with the principles of mechanism and electricity which is called the immediate officer of god almighty but the truth is a constant repetition of divine acts in regular and irregular motions of the earth and the seas the finger of god moves the land and the waters  in the case of earthquakes as electricity or aerial power is insufficient to produce them in my opinion for two reasons before given to wit that the electrical stroke is ever single and momentary but the vibrations of the earth in a quake are often   and   minutes and have held to   minutes  and that besides the swelling and trembling of the earth it has so opened at those times as to swallow not only houses and people but even mountains and to send forth great rivers and vast waters and as subterranean fire and vapor i think can never do such work for many reasons that may be offered we must i think ascribe the earthquakes to the immediate impression of divine power by which a city is tumbled into ruins in three or four minutes in the sad manner lisbon was destroyed the first of november      or the water of the great abyss is with such violence moved that it shakes the arches of the earth and where infinite wisdom directs is enabled by almighty power to open the globe with tremendous noises and pour forth vast torrents of water to cover a land where once a flourishing city has stood the electric stroke cannot be more dreadful than such exertion of omnipotence the immediate action of the deity to destroy must be as efficacious surely as any subordinate agent or cause and it must be more terrible to the mind as there can be no supposition of accident in ruin this way but we see as it were the almighty arm exerting an irresistible force that could in the same few moments that a large town and its inhabitants are destroyed shake the whole world into one dreadful ruin or separate it into nothing to my apprehension the aerial power of electricity is not so fearfully striking as the creators appearing on the spot to shake terribly the earth and if we consider that it is on account of sin that god resigns his omnipotence to his wrath and commands his whole displeasure to arise must not this account of an earthquake have the greatest tendency to reform the manners of the surviving people  an account of muscular motion and that it is caused by a continued act of the deity as to muscular motion if it be rightly considered it appears very plainly to proceed from a living force impressed ab extra that mechanism does not act as cause in this affair but the divine power acts in the case as it does in many different places of the human body at once and with inexpressible variety  various are the accounts that learned men have given of muscular motion and ingenious are their reasonings on the subject but they are not satisfactory nor do they at all explain the thing and account for it what is a muscle  it is to be sure a bundle of small blood vessels consisting of arteries and their returning veins laid one upon another in their parallel plates running through the whole length of the muscle and at small intervals these blood vessels or longitudinal red and fleshy fibers are contorted and bound about with small transverse and spiral ramifications and twinings of the nerves this is a muscle it has two ends or tendons fastened to two bones one of which is fixed and the other moveable and by the contraction of the muscle the moveable bone is drawn upon its fulcrum toward a fixed point this is indisputable and it is likewise certain that the muscles are to be distinguished into those of voluntary and those of natural or necessary motion that the voluntary muscles have antagonists which act alternately in a contrary direction that is are contracted by the command of the will while the others are stretched and again are extended while the others are contracted but the necessary muscles have contracting and extending powers within themselves and need no antagonists  this being the true state of the muscles the question is what causes that elasticity spring or power of contraction and restoration which their nervous coats and fibers have to recover themselves against a given weight or force that stretches them the reply is that many unanswerable reasons can be given to prove that this contractive restitutive force does not depend on the mixture effervescence or rarefaction of any fluids humors or liquors within the body and there is one convincing experiment that shows it  lay open the thorax of a dog as i have often done and take a distinct view of that famous muscle the heart in its curious and wonderful motion while the animal is still alive in diastole the muscle is very red and florid soft and yielding to the touch and through it the vital fluid glows and shines it appears in this state fully replenished and distended with blood but in systole as soon as it begins to contract and the blood rushes out by the compression of the contracting fibers the heart loses its florid color and becomes pale and livid compact and solid and evinces that during this state of it the muscle contracts inwardly into its own dense substance and takes up less space than before till it returns to its diastole then the blood which flowed from it with velocity during systole through the coronary veins into the auricles rushes back into it through the coronary arteries restores the glowing florid color and inflates the muscle in order to strain the nerves for the next contraction it is plain from hence that the heart has less blood and fluid in time of contraction and that the contraction is not caused by the addition of another fluid from the nerves as the learned have asserted  and as to what they say of the longitudinal fibers being divided into innumerable little cells or bladders which have communications with the blood vessels and nerves and that in these vesicles the blood and nervous fluid mix ferment and by rarefaction and expansion swell and blow up the cells and thereby inflate and distend the muscle and increase its thickness while its length is shortened  this is so perplexed and unreasonable an hypothesis that i am astonished how men of sense ever came to think of such a doctrine there is no such nervous fluid to be found to cause this fermentation rarefaction etc and if there was expansive force must lengthen as well as thicken and the muscle could not be shortened in length and swelled in thickness the natural action of the fluids upon the solids is to increase dimensions proportionably every way that is in the direction of the axis and conjugate diameter equally beside if there was expansion circulation must stop the distention of the vesicles and the rapid exit of the rarifying fluid could not be at once  the plain account of the matter is then that muscular motion is performed by the elasticity of the nervous fibrillae contracting and restoring themselves against the stretching force of the circulating blood the contraction of the muscle straitens and compresses the bloodvessels and forces the blood with impetuosity through the heart and this squeezing or propelling force gives the fluid an impetus that makes it return with violence upon the muscle in the course of its circulation then by force and impulse it stretches the transverse and spiral nervous fibers and so extends the contracted muscle that drove it by contraction from itself upon this the bloodvessels having obtained their due extent and capacity the distending force of the blood of consequence ceases but the moment it does the contractive power of the nerves begins to act again and restores them to a contracted dense state by a force exactly equal to that which extended them till the returning propelled blood reenters the muscle and stretches it again as before described such are the two wonderful counterforces that produce the natural involuntary motion of the heart and carry on the circulation of the blood you see with your eyes in the opened live dog this alternate contraction and extension and as the stretching power is but a consequence of the contracting power contraction is the spring of this wonderful action in which our will or free agency has no concern and to what shall we ascribe this astonishing operation this amazing contractive power so exactly as to time and so constantly continued on the muscles of natural or necessary motion till the aequilibrium by some means or other be broken and the motion is preternaturally interrupted and suspended will the great mechanical reasoners say that matter does this wonder  matter that is blind and impotent stuff we must ascribe to a cause wise and powerful not only the original contrivance of the thing but the execution of this extraordinary scene while you gaze upon this noblest muscle of the dog you see the deity at work  and if we turn our eyes from the muscles of mere natural involuntary motion which performs by a contracting power acting within them to those muscles which move the bones and members of our bodies by the command of the will how adorable is the wisdom and goodness of the almighty author of nature not only in providing the animal machine with antagonistical muscles one of which is contracted while the other is extended but for stimulating contracting and compressing the nervous elastic cords and blood vessels as our minds command or determine there is no possibility of accounting for the directions at pleasure of the antagonistic muscles but by resolving them into the continual presence and action of the first cause he enforces and executes it is the active principle gives energy and motion both to voluntary and necessary muscles this i think is the truth of philosophy to suppose every thing to be effect without cause is to reduce religion and philosophy to the same desperate state it destroys all the principles of reason as well as of virtue and moral conduct  to say all that can be said in as few words as possible upon this article it is not only the muscular motion necessary and spontaneous that even spontaneous motion is performed by the divine power is proved in the first part of a most excellent book called an enquiry into the nature of the human soul  i shall only observe here that motion is spontaneous as it is begun and ended by the living being itself without physical necessity but it is above the power and knowledge of the spontaneous being as it is performed mechanically the motive power is immediately impressed by the creator who is the only mover as well as the first mover how adorable is this condescension the creator exerts his power in consequence of the sponteneity of his living creatures  but is not this low work for the supreme lord of heaven and earth says the mechanical reasoner no lowness of work is not applicable to the creator of all things he is as much the creator of the meanest insect as of the highest intelligence it is his perpetual power exerted in cohesion that keeps all the parts of matter in the bodies of living creatures together philosophy cannot be hurt by admitting his power his omnipotence is displayed to our senses in the most despicable weed of the field as well as in the bright rolling orbs of heaven in calling such things low work we forget what infinite power implies and what infinite goodness prompts    that is caused by the action of the deity but the constant motions in the stomach lungs intestines and other parts of the body are caused by an acting divine power it can be demonstrated that in the action of soft bodies upon soft bodies the motion is always diminished and of consequence it must be greatly lessened in the yielding softness of the flesh and fluids of animal bodies we see how soon water settles after motion impressed by the bare attrition of its parts on one another although it has no obstacles to encounter or narrow passages to move through what then can we think of motion in such narrow twining meanders as veins arteries intestines and lacteal vessels through which the fluids of animal bodies are conveyed to parts innumerable while the blood lymph and chyle creep through such narrow winding vessels the whole motion of those fluids must be consumed every instant by the attrition of their parts and the force of consequence be renewed every instant here is a perpetual miracle the divine power urges on these fluids ten thousand ways at once reason must confess a miraculous power indesinently and variously put forth in our bodies while ignorance and vanity in vain attempts to account mechanically for the circulation of those fluids we are not only fearfully and wonderfully formed in the womb but fearfully and wonderfully preserved every minute creating power never ceases if it should be asked  why was such an intricate structure of such materials employed or such a laborious method contrived by the organization of dead matter if it no way serves to produce motion but rather consumes the force impressed the answer is that this consuming mechanism is no inconvenience in nature if we consider who renews the motive power we are forced to be frugal of our little power but this is not applicable to the deity the governing power of the deity is creating power beings made up of matter and spirit require such a supplying power and in the various work god instructs his rational beings and displays his omnipotence in wisdom and action     the conclusion of the matter is that the plain argument for the existence of a deity obvious to all and carrying irresistible conviction with it is from the evident contrivance and fitness of things to one another which we meet with through all the parts of the universe there is no need of nice and subtle reasoning in this matter a manifest contrivance immediately suggests a contriver it strikes like a sensation and artful reasonings against it may puzzle us but it is without shaking our belief no person for example who knows the principles of optics and the struture of the eye can believe that it is formed without skill in that science or that the ear was formed without the knowledge of sounds  this is a just argument and forces our assent but the great maclaurin should not have stopped here the plain argument for the existence of a deity grows stronger when we add to it what is as evident as divine contrivance to wit the constant interposition of god to support and move his creatures original contrivance in the works of the creation is adorable we are certain demonstratively certain that the heavens the land and the waters and all the creatures in them contained are the works of the living god but it is the present performance that strikes us like a sensation with inexpressible pleasure we see creating power with our eyes which ever way we turn them we behold almighty power employed and continually acting under the direction of infinite knowledge  since things are so and all the works of nature in the common voice of reason declare the power and wisdom of the creator and speak his goodness in the innumerable mighty things he continually performs for our preservation and happiness the contemplation of them should warm our hearts with the glory of the almighty and make us continually praise and adore that almighty providence which formed and sustains not only the human race and this terrestrial globe but numberless other worlds and their inhabitants that hang in infinite space these mighty things displayed ought surely to produce the devoutest prayers and songs of praises in no common strain and especially if we add to those works of nature that second creation the still greater work of grace such omnipotence in wisdom and action and such amazing goodness as we see in the christian gospel should i think engage us to love and adore so great and good a being as our creator and induce us to devote our lives to him  for my part when i consider the mighty scene and prospect of nature and turn my thoughts from thence to gods word that heavenly law which directs our will and informs our reason and teaches us in all things how to pursue our own happiness i am so struck with a sense of infinite wisdom goodness and action that i cannot help extolling the king of the universe for the greatness of his power and mercy and am necessarily engaged in a scene of praise and devotion indeed the heart must be as hard and cold as marble that does not glow nor is inflamed with ravishing love to the great author of all things after viewing with attention even one particular only in the works of nature that material sun which now shines out with light and beauty to animate and refresh the world and in the creation of grace that sun of righteousness who sheds forth the choicest blessings of heaven upon the inhabitants of the earth can we be silent who behold and enjoy those things alas too many can neither the heavens which declare the glory of god nor the days of the gospel nor the righteousness of the new law are regarded by them but the wise will ever join with all their hearts in the most exalted prayer and praise and adore the giver of these good and perfect gifts for all his blessings vouchsafed us and especially for the charter of his pardon granted by his blessed son and the promises of everlasting happiness and glory in a life to come reason must declare it just to offer up religious praise and make the greatest mental and moral improvement we can in this first state     an extraordinary loch on the top of a high mountain another extraordinary thing i saw in the place i have mentioned was a water on the top of a hill which stood at the other end of the lake and was full as high as the mountain from the side of which the water poured into the lake this loch measured three quarters of a mile in length and half a mile over the water appeared as black as ink but in a glass it was clear as other water and bright in running down it tasted sweet and good at one end it runs over its rocky bank and in several noisy cascades falls down the face of the mountain to a deep bottom where a river is formed that is seen for a considerable way as it wanders along the whole is a striking scene the swarthy loch the noisy descending streams clumps of aged trees on the mountains side and the various shoars and valleys below afford an uncommon view it was a fine change of ground to ascend from the beautiful lake encompassed with mountains and adorned with trees into which was poured from a gaping precipice a torrent of streams and see from the reverse of an opposite hill an impetuous flood descending from the top to the finest points of view in the wildest glins below     the cause of an unfathomable loch on the top of the mountain what line i had with me for experiments on waters and holes i applied to this loch to discover the depth but with  00 yards of whipcord my lead could reach no ground and from thence and the blackness of the water and the great issuing stream i concluded justly i think that it went down to the great abyss the vast treasury of waters within the earth many such unfathomable lochs as this have i seen on the summits of mountains in various parts of the world and from them i suppose the greatest part of that deluge of waters came that drowned the old world this leads me to say something of the flood     remarks on the deluge many books have been written in relation to this affair and while some contend for the overflowing of the whole earth to a very great height of waters  and some for a partial deluge only  others will not allow there was any at all the divine authority of moses they disregard for my part i believe the flood was universal and that all the high hills and mountains under the whole heaven were covered the cause was forty days heavy rain and such an agitation of the abyss by the finger of god as not only broke up the great deep to pour out water at many places but forced it out of such bottomless lochs as this i am speaking of on the mountains top and from various swallows in many places this removes every objection from the case of the deluge and gives water enough in the space of   0 days or five months of  0 days each to overtop the highest mountains by    cubits the height designed the abyss in strong commotion or violent uproar by a power divine could shake the incumbent globe to pieces in a few minutes and bury the whole ruins in the deep to me then all the reasoning against the deluge or for a partial flood appear sad stuff were this one loch in stanemore to pour out torrents of water down every side for five months by a divine force on part of the abyss as it might very easily by such means do the inundation would cover a great part of this land and if from every loch of the kind on the summits of mountains the waters in like manner with the greatest violence flowed from every side out of the abyss and that exclusive of the heavy rains an earthquake should open some parts of the ground to let more water out of the great collection and the seas and oceans surpass their natural bounds by the winds forcing them over the earth then would a universal flood very soon prevail there is water enough for the purpose and as to the supernatural ascent of them natural and supernatural are nothing at all different with respect to god they are distinctions merely in our conceptions of things regularly to move the sun or earth and to stop its motion for a day  to make the waters that covered the whole earth at the creation descend into the several receptacles prepared for them and at the deluge to make them ascend again to cover the whole earth are the effect of one and the same almighty power though we call one natural and the other supernatural the one is the effect of no greater power than the other with respect to god one is not more or less natural or supernatural than the other  the means which drained off the waters of the deluge from the earth but how the waters of the deluge were drawn off at the end of the five months is another question among the learned the ingenious keile who writ against the two ingenious theorists says the thing is not at all accountable in any natural way the draining off and drying of the earth of such a huge column of waters could only be effected by the power of god natural causes both in decrease and the increase of the waters must have been vastly disproportionate to the effects and to miracles they must be ascribed  this i think is as far from the truth as the theorists ascribing both increase and decrease to natural causes god was the performer to be sure in the flood and the going off but he made use of natural causes in both that is of the things he had in the beginning created the natural causes he is the author of were at hand and with them he could do the work the sun evaporated the winds dried and the waters no longer forced upwards from the abyss subsided into the many swallows or swallowholes that are still to be seen in many places on mountains and in valleys those on the mountains being necessary to absorb that vast column of waters which rose    cubits above the highest hills  a swallow is such another opening in the ground as eldine hole in derbyshire eldinehole in derbyshire is a mile south of mamtorr and   miles east of buxton it is a perpendicular gulf or chasm which i tried to fathom more than once and found it by my line and by the measure of sound at the rate of    feet one twelfth in one second the measure dr halley allows near the earth for the descent of heavy bodies to be      feet or     yards down to the water but how deep the water is cannot be known i suppose it reaches to the abyss this chasm is forty yards long above ground and ten over at its broadest part but from the day there is a sloping descent of forty yards to the mouth of the horrible pit and this is only four yards long and one and a half broad two villains who were executed at derby not long ago confessed at the gallows that they threw a poor traveller into this dreadful gulf after they had robbed him    and in traveling from the peak to the northern extremity of northumberland i have seen many such holes in the earth both on the hills and in the vales i have likewise met with them in other countries by these swallows a vast quantity of the waters to be sure went down to the great receptacle all that was not exhaled or licked up by the winds or except what might be left to increase the former seas of the antediluvian world into those vast oceans which now encompasses the globe and partly to form those vast lakes that are in several parts of the world these things easily account for the removal of that vast mass of waters which covered the earth and was in a mighty column above the highest hills every difficulty disappears before evaporation the drying winds the swallows and perhaps the turning seas into oceans but the three first things now named were sufficient and the gentlemen who have reasoned so ingeniously against one another about the removal of the waters might have saved themselves a deal of trouble if they had reduced the operation to three simple things under the direction of the first cause the swallows especially must do great work in the case if we take into their number not only very many open gulphs or chasms the depth of which no line or sound can reach but likewise the communications of very many parts of the sea and of many great unfathomable lochs with the abyss these absorbers could easily receive what had before come out of them the sun by evaporation with the wind might take away what was raised there is nothing hard then in conceiving how the waters of the deluge were brought away  but as to the lake i have mentioned into which a rapid flood poured from the bowels of the mountain what became of this water the reader may inquire to be sure as it did not run off in any streams nor make the lake rise in the least degree there must have been a communication in some parts of its bottom between the water of it and the abyss as the loch on the top of the mountain i have described had no feeders yet emitted streams and therefore must be supported by the abyss so this lake with so powerful a feeder not running over or emitting water any way must discharge itself in the abyss below the case of it must be the same as that of the caspian sea into this sea many rivers pour and one in particular the volga i mean that is more than sufficient in the quantity of water it turns out in a year to drown the whole world yet the caspian remains in one state and does not overflow its banks excepting as before observed sometimes in the space of    years it must by passages communicate with the great deep it refunds the rivers into the great abyss the case of the mediterranean sea is the same for though a strong current from the atlantic continually sits through the strait of gibraltar yet these waters do not make it overflow the country round it and of consequence they must be carried off by a subterranean passage or passages to the abyss     the journey in stanemore continued an account of an assemblage of black columnar marble from the lake i proceeded the next morning june         toward the northeast end of westmorland having passed the night in a sound sleep under the trees by the water side but was forced by the precipices to shape my course from four in the morning till eight to the northwest and then the road turned eastnortheast till i came to a great glin where a river made a rumbling noise over rocks and inequalities of many kinds and formed a very wild wonderful scene the river was broad and deep and on an easy descent to it was an assemblage of stones that ran in length about  00 feet in breadth  0 feet and somewhat resembling the giants causeway in the county of antrim and province of ulster in ireland nine miles north east from the pretty town of colerain the giants causeway reader is a prodigious pile of rocks  0 feet broad  0 feet above the rest of the strand and that run from the bottom of a high hill above  00 yards into the ocean  the assemblage of stones i am speaking of are columns with several corners that rise three yards above the ground and are joined as if done by art the points being unequal and concave and thereby lying one in another these columns have five and six sides a few of them seven and a number of them nicely and exactly placed together make one large pillar from one foot to two in diameter they are so nicely joined that although they have five and six sides as i before said yet their contexture is so adapted as to leave no vacuity between them the prominent angles of one pillar fitting and falling exactly into the hollows left them between two others and the plain sides exactly answer to one another so that those hexagons and pentagons of columnar marble appear as if finished by the hands of the most masterly workmen all the pillars stood exactly perpendicular to the plane of the horizon  doctor foley in the philosophical transactions no     speaking of the giants causeway seems to think these wonderful pillars are composed of the common sort of craggy rock by the sea side and the authors of the complete system of geography are of opinion they resemble the lapis basaltes but some think they are a sort of marble now the truth is the basaltes of the ancients is a very elegant and beautiful marble of a fine deep glossy black like high polished steel and is always found erect in the form of regular angular columns composed of a number of joints fitted together and making pillars so that where such pillars are seen they are undoubtedly the columnar marble or touchstone of the ancients dr hill in his history of fossils gives a good account of the nature of this body and mentions several places it is to be found in but seems not to have heard there was any of it among the northern mountains of our country  this marble is one of the noblest productions of nature and of all the fossil kingdom the most astonishing body if art is requisite for the formation of many things we see daily done with elegance and beauty then certainly mind itself even the supreme mind must have caused such effects as these astonishing marble pillars which lie in vast compound perpendicular columns at great depths in the earth none in beds of strata like the other marbles and rise in such beautiful joints and angles well fitted together more than six and thirty foot above ground in some places no other way could those wonderful productions have come into being but by that intelligent active power who speaks intelligibly to every nation by his works to talk as some people do that necessity which destroys the very idea of intelligent and designing activity  or chance which is an utter absurdity  or the sea according to telliamed generated and formed this genus of marble and so wonderfully distinguished it from all the other marmora by making it into pentagon hexagon and septagon columns and rendering the points of the columns unequal and concave and so amazingly joining them together that the prominent angles of one pillar fall exactly into the hollow left beween two others and the plain sides exactly answer to one another as before observed while all of them stand up perpendicular contrary to the quality of all other marbles and some lie in beds of strata  to talk i say of the sea a chance a necessity doing this or any thing of so wonderful a kind is to produce schemes founded in ignorance and eversive of true knowledge instead of giving a rational intelligible account of the formation of the world its order and appearances in this wonderful production a due attention perceives infinite art and power did we want that variety of things which employ the consideration of rational men and force the tongues of thinking men to acknowledge creating power this marble alone would be sufficient to demonstrate equal power directed by infinite wisdom     an account f a burning spring another extraordinary thing i saw in a valley not far from that where the basalts stands it is a boisterous burning spring it rises with great noise and vibration and gushes out with a force sufficient to turn many mills the water is clear and cold but to the taste unpleasant being something like a bad egg i judged from the nature of its motion that the water would take fire and having lit my torch soon put it in a flame the fire was fierce and the water ran down the vale in a blaze it was a river of fire for a considerable way till it sunk under ground among some rocks and thereby disappeared after it had burnt some time i took some boughs from a tree and tying them together beat the surface of the well for a few minutes and the burning ceased the water was not hot as one might expect but cold as the coldest spring could be there are a great number of such springs in the world but this is the largest i have read of or seen it differs from that of broseley in shropshire within six miles of bridgenorth in this respect that broseley well will not continue to burn for any time unless the air be kept from it to which purpose they have enclosed it in an iron cistern with a cover to it and to experiment the boiling a piece of meat by the fire of this spring they clap the pot close down when they cover is taken up and then it burns as long as they will making the largest joint of meat fit to eat in half the time the strongest culinary fire could do the work as to the medicinal virtues of the spring in the mountains i can only say that as it has a copious sulphur and from thence flames like spirit of wine it is probable it might be as effectual in communicating sanity in various cases as the famous burning spring is in the palatinate of of cracow of the lesser poland mentioned in the leipsic acts an      p     and as to the extinguishing this fire by beating it with twigs it must to be sure be for the reason given by mr denis that as the inflammability of such springs is to be ascribed to sulphur and to its exhalations bursting out of the water so this floating flame which is too subtle to heat the water is stifled by involving these spirits in the aqueous particles by brushing the surface with brooms  conradus tells us concerning the polish spring that at one time when it was kindled by lightning the people neglected to put it out and the stream proceeded on fire for almost three years and reduced all the neighboring wood to ashes it is really a wonderful sight to see such a river of fire and adorable must be that power who has caused such things to say that matter and motion circumscribe and regulate such powers is idle to the last degree it is an inversion of reason the very existence of the water and sulphur of this spring must be by the power of the creator constantly put forth upon it which causes the parts to be what we call such things and the motion of both must be an impression for motion is not essential to matter nothing else could produce them and a cause there must be equal to the various and wonderful effects of both a cause that is infinite wise and powerful the deity is every where present and every where active his power is indesinently working gives existence to the various creatures and produces the most noble phenomenon in nature all we see all we feel fire and water the universal variety of inanimate and animate creatures are only the effects of his creating power constantly repeated the existence of the whole world is a continual new creation and therefore it becomes the bounden duty of all rational creatures to worship this almighty power as well for his works of creation as for the ways of his providence great and wonderful are thy works o lord god almighty and just and righteous are thy ways o king of saints who would not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name because thou only art holy     another loch on the top of a high mountain and a swallow in the bottom from the burning fountain we proceeded for half an hour in the same valley right onwards and then turned to the left in a course to the west for about a mile which brought us to the bottom of a steep mountain we must ascend or go no farther it was hard to get the horses over this and no less difficult to descend with them to a deep bottom on the other side of the hill but with great hazard to ourselves and the beasts we came down in safety on the top of this mountain i saw another large loch that was black as ink in appearance though bright when taken up in a glass which as before observed must be owing i suppose to its top communicating with the abyss below and in the bottom we descended to there was a swallow larger than the one i saw before i could make no discovery as to its depth either by line or sound nor did my lead touch any water on the sloping way from the first chasm in day to the gulf were several lateral chambers that descended one yard in six but though the bottom was hard the horrors of the places hindered me from going far i went to the end of the first which was    yards and having looked into the second to which a narrow short pass leads the inquirer i made what haste i could back for the opening discovers a space so vast dismal and frightful that it strikes one to the heart the bottom as far as my light could enable me to distinguish was a continuance of stone but neither top nor sides were to be seen it is a horrible place   0 an amazing arch through a mountain in a delightful spot of ground leaving this bottom we mounted another very high and dangerous hill and from the top of it descended into twenty acres of as rich and beautiful ground as my eyes had ever seen it was covered with flowers and aromatic herbs and had in the center of it a little grove of beautiful trees among which were fruits of several kinds a flowing spring of the purest water was in the middle of this sweet little wood and ran in pretty windings over the ground it refreshed and adorned the field and it was beautiful to see the deer from the hills and the goats come down from the cliffs to drink at these streams the whole was surrounded with precipices that ascended above the clouds and through one of these rocky mountains there was an opening that had a stupendous appearance  it was a vast amazing arch that had some resemblance of the gothic isle of a large cathedral church and terminated in a view of rocks hanging over rocks in a manner frightful to behold it measured an hundred yards in length  0 in breadth and i judged it to be fifty yards high the pending rocks in view enclosed a space of four acres as it appeared to me and the bottom was so very deep that it looked like night below what line i had could not reach it nor could i make any thing of the depth by sound it seemed to me to be a vast swallow that went down to the abyss the whole was a scene that harrowed the soul with horror     an extraordinary passage through the mountains by the spring in the little grove i have mentioned i sat down at   in the morning to breakfast on something that one of my squires produced from his store while the other was looking for a passage or way onwards between those vast precipices that surrounded us two hours he wasted in an enquiry and then returned to let me know there was no passage that he could find the enclosed rocks were one continued chain of unpassable mountains here then i thought was my ne plus ultra as the man affirmed there was no getting beyond the vast enclosing cliffs that walled in this charming spot of earth i imagined for some time that i must of necessity return and give over all thoughts of getting to the borders of cumberland or bishopric that way it seemed impossible to proceed and that was no small trouble to my mind it was a great journey round and if i did ride it i knew not where to turn in on the confines of the country my friend lived on for i had lost his directions and had only a small remembrance of his dwelling somewhere on the north edge of westmoreland or yorkshire or on the adjoining borders of cumberland or the county of durham what to do i could not for some time tell going back i did not at all like and therefore to avoid it if possible resolved to pass the day in trying if i could find any way out without climbing the mountain again that i had lately come down round then i walked once and to no manner of purpose for i did not see any kind of pass but the second time as i marched on observing the hill i took notice of a large clump of great trees in an angle or deep corner that seemed to stand very oddly and in the mountain above them there appeared as i thought a distance or space that looked like an opening i soon found it was so and that at the back of this little wood there lay a very narrow way only broad enough for two horses abreast that it extended due west for more than a mile and then westnorthwest for a quarter of a mile till it terminated in a plain that was several miles in circumference and entirely surrounded with hills this i discovered in walking the pass by myself      and then returned to bring the horses and men through this amazing way it was quite dark mere night all along and the bottom very bad it was likewise every dangerous it was evident from the ground that stones had fallen from the tops of the hills and should any descend from so vast a height on us though even small ones they would without all peradventure be immediate death     a reflection on the completion of every wish the moment it is formed the plain we came into from the defile was above a mile over to the opposite hills and across it was a walk of aged oaks that seemed in such a place as the avenue that leads to the fairy castle of wishes if such beings there are as dr fowler bishop of gloucester has in one of his books affirmed then here i said in this fine romantic region where all the charms of the field the forest the water and the mountains are united may be their favorite mansion and perhaps they will admit me into their fairy castle then commences their friendship and when they have all breathed on me it is but wishing for the future and the completion of every desire is granted the moment it is formed would not this be complete happiness what do you say reflection  no reflection answered as we rid up this avenue imagination may form fine pictures of felicity from an indulgence in every wish but so blind are mankind to their own real happiness that it is oftener to the gratification than to the disappointment of their wishes that all their misery is owing we often choose what is not consonant to the welfare of our nature and strive to avoid those incidents which are fated in the order of incontrolable events for our good frequently do we labor to secure the things that debase us into slaves and overwhelm us with calamity but seldom do we desire rarely do we strive to obtain those objects and acquire that station which are most likely to render humanity as perfect as it can be in this world rational and godlike and thereby crown our lives with true happiness many a man has pursued a venus an estate an honor with much toil and wonderful activity and when possessed of the fancyed blessing have been made very miserable mortals the wished for beauty has often made even the husband wretched an aching scar is often covered with the laurel and in respect of envied great fortunes gaudy is the thing without and within very often is mere bitterness the wisdom is as to this world not to get from the fairies a power of enjoying all that fancy may desire if that was possible but to act well and wisely in the most reasonable lovely and fair manner and propose nothing of ourselves but with a reserve that supreme wisdom permits it welcoming every event with cheerfulness and magnanimity as best upon the whole because ordained of infinite reason and acquiescing in every obstruction as ultimately reservable to divine providence this continued reflection in respect of this life were there no other is preferable to the castle of wishes if we could find it at the end of this avenue in the  d volume of familiar letters between the characters in david simple the reader will find an excellent story in relation to wishing which the ingenious female writer calls a fragment of a fairy tale p          and concludes it in the following sensible manner  the good fairy came often to visit me and confirmed me in my resolution never again to be so unreasonable as to desire to have all my wishes completed for she convinced me that the shortsighted eyes of mortals were not formed to see whether the event of any of their own wishes would produce most happiness or misery and that our greatest felicity often arises from the very disappointment of those desires the gratification of which at the first view seems to be necessary to our welfare     but if another life is taken into the question the argument grows stronger against a power of enjoying all we could wish for  as we are accountable creatures and are pouring fast out of time into eternity religion undoubtedly ought to be the main business of mortals  that religion which is a living principle spring or root of actions in the soul wrought there by the hand of him that made us and which requires us to honor and fear god as the supreme lord to esteem him as the chief good and to exercise and express that honor that fear and that esteem by all the means and in all the ways which reason and revelation appoint for such exercise and expression that we may gain the love of the almighty and obtain the established seat of happiness above but such force has the objects of sense upon the mind that it is more than probable they would outweigh the distant hopes of religion if wishing could bring in even a tenth part of what the vanity of man and his senses would call for it would be so far from being an advantage to mankind if they could wish and have vast fortunes all the pleasures the pomps and honors of the world that they would thereby be deprived of the rational joys of life and be influenced to think no more of the excellency and beauty of religion and the good consequences of serving god truly they would not even divide themselves between this world and the other the idol gods of this state would have all their service the wish then should be for daily bread and that the kingdom of god may come  his will be done in our souls in these are comprised the greatest and most valuable blessings and we are sure we can obtain them if we will add to asking an industry and prudence in acquiring and take care by culture to bring up the seeds of virtue and holiness this is enough to make us as happy here as reason can desire we have a sufficiency to go through this world to that other where we are to be stationed for ever and against the accidents of the way we have the supports which innocence and virtue to the good administer peace and tranquillity of mind here and hopes full of comfort with respect to hereafter are the ingredients of our happiness a happiness the greatest and we are certain that he upon whose mercy and goodness we confess we exist will in regard to our confidence and trust our faith and religion when this fleeting scene is over make us glorious and ever blessed in the kingdom he has prepared for those that rely on the divine goodness and do their best to advance the state of true virtue in the world let us not regret then the want of a castle of wishes let us not have a desire of that wealth dominion and splendour which lives in contempt of the prophets and riots in the heinous pleasures of irreligion  let our great masters will be made the rule of all our actions and let his interest be regarded as our interest let us consult his honor as our own honor and having food and raiment be content as we are hasting away with a never ceasing pace to the realms of eternity and unmixed bliss this is reason and light this only deserves our care there is nothing worth wishing for but the happiness of gods presence in our hearts and the more immediate communications of his love and favor in the regions of day     a description of a natural grotto in one of the mountains of stanemore june         thus did reflection entertain me as i rid up this grand shady walk which looked like the avenue i had read of in the tales of the fairies and brought me to a natural grotto more beautiful than aelians description of atalantas or that in homer where calypsos lived  it was a large cavern at the bottom of a marble mountain and without was covered round with ivy that clung about some aged oaks on either side the entrance that seemed coeval with the earth on which they grew abundance of large laurel trees in clumps adorned an extensive area before the door and saffron and hyacinths and flowers of many colors covered in confused spots the carpet green the beautiful ground refreshed the sight and purified the air and to enhance the beauties of the spot a clear and cold stream gushed from a neighboring rock which watered the trees and plants and seemed to combat with the earth whether of them most contributed to their growth and preservation it was a sweet rural scene for charms and solitude the place was equally to be admired  the inside of this grotto was a beautiful green marble extremely bright and even approaching to the appearance of the emerald it was thick set with shells and those not small ones but some of the largest and finest kinds many of them seemed as it were squeezed together by the marble so as to show the edges only but more were to be seen at large and filled with the purest spar the whole had a fine effect and as the cave had been divided by art into six fine apartments and had doors and chimnies most ingeniously contrived both the mansion and its situation charmed me in a high degree it was a beautiful habitation indeed on either side of it were many cottages pretty and clean and as sheep were feeding on the field some cows grazing and various kinds of tame fowl before the doors i concluded it was an inhabited place before i saw any one     the history of azora the first human being i beheld was an old woman who appeared at the grotto door and i requested her to inform me who lived in this delightful place  and which was my best way to cumberland or bishopric sir replied the good old woman you are welcome to burcottlodge women only are the inhabitants of this spot and over the hills before you you must go to get to the countries you mention we are an hundred souls in all that live here and our mistress superior and head is a young woman her name is azora yonder she comes goodness itself and as it is now seven in the evening too late to proceed any farther in this part of the world you had better walk up to her and pay her your respects great was my surprise at what i heard a little female republic among those hills was news indeed and when i came near azora my astonishment increased  the picture of azora she was attended by ten young women straight clean handsome girls and surpassed them in tallness her countenance was masculine but not austere her fine blue eyes discovered an excellence of temper while they showed the penetration of her mind her hair was brown bright and charming and nature had stamped upon her cheeks a color that exceeded the most beautiful red of the finest flower it was continually as the maiden blush of a modest innocence she was dressed in a fine woollen stuff made in the manner shepherdesses are painted and on her head had a band or fillet like what the ladies now wear with a bunch of artificial flowers in her hair she had a very small straw hat on  in her hand she held a long and pretty crook and as her coats were short her feet were seen in black silk shoes and the finest white stockings and appeared vastly pretty she struck me greatly she was a charming and uncommon figure when i came up to azora i could hardly forbear addressing her as the son of ulysses did the supernal  o vous qui que vous soiez mortelle ou deesse quoiqua vous voir on ne puisse vous prendre que pour une divinite seriezvous insensible au malheur dun fills qui  whoever you are a mortal or a goddess though sure your aspect speaks you all divine can you unmoved behold a hapless son by fate expelled and urged by unrelenting rage to wander through the world exposed to winds and seas and all the strokes of adverse fortune till he arrived in this land of felicity and peace  but on better thoughts i only said i am your most humble servant madam and told her i believed i had lost my way and knew not where to go  to which she replied you are welcome sir to our hamlet and to the best entertainment it affords only tell me she added with a smile what could induce you to travel this unbeaten road  and how did you pass the precipices and rivers you must have met with in the way  curiosity madam i answered was one cause that i might see a country no traveller had been in and my next inducement to find a valuable friend who lives somewhere upon the northern border of this county or yorkshire or on the adjoining limits of cumberland or durham but on which i know not and as i came from brugh under stanemore i judged it the shortest way by a great many miles and the likeliest to succeed in my enquiry after my friend  then as to hills and waters many dangerous ones i have gone over and with great toil and fatigue have got thus far  this azora said is a rational account of your journey and as there are many difficulties still before you you are welcome to rest with us till you are refreshed and able to proceed  by this time we reached the grotto door and upon entering the first apartment i saw another lady dressed in the same manner and seemed to be of the same age that is about six and twenty as i was told this was azoras companion and friend she was a very pretty woman though inferior to azora in charms but her mind was equally luminous and good neither she nor azora were learned women that is they understood no other language than the english tongue and in that they had but a small collection of the best books but those few they had read well and they had capacities to think in reason philosophy and mathematics they were excellent and in the most agreeable manner discovered in conversation the finest conceptions of the most excellent things azora of the two was by much the best speaker her voice was delightful and her pronunciation just strong clear and various with unspeakable pleasure did i listen to her during three days that i happily passed with her and her companion and received from both many valuable informations i thought i understood algebra very well but i was their inferior and they instructed me and on the fundamental points of religion they not only outtalked me but outreasoned me it is very strange i confess it is very true however  azora in particular had an amazing collection of the most rational philosophical ideas and she delivered them in the most pleasing dress with as much ease as she breathed she asked me after i had feasted on an excellent supper how religion went on in the world and what was the condition of that which came from supernatural communication as she phrased it and when i told her that our excellent divines did all that was possible for men to do to turn the world from superstition of every kind to that express revelation which restores the dictates of uncorrupted reason to their force and authority which teaches the knowledge of one supreme spirit or god and the nature of that worship which is due to a being not confined to or dependent upon particular places or circumstances but always and every where present with us she answered that such clergymen are glorious and cannot be enough admired and great is the unreasonableness of the men who opposed them and forced them into the field of disputation from their holy labor of instructing the people in penitential piety and sanctification i mean the infidels and the bigots  what can be more unjust and impious azora continued than for men to declame against a revelation which displays the paternal regard of god for his creatures by doing more than was strictly necessary for their happiness as they had his original law of reason before he gave them the gospel and which enables us to extend our knowledge even as to those things which we are by nature capable of knowing which awakens us to duty and advises us how to walk in the ways of prudence and safety to reject such an extraordinary method of saving us is senseless and culpable indeed surely when superstition and enthusiasm has led mankind into errors we ought to adore the divine goodness for recommunicating a knowledge of true religion of duty in this life and of what we are to expect in that which is to come we can never be thankful enough for a revelation that has a tendency to promote the happiness of mankind both here and hereafter the opposition in my opinion is without excuse as the external evidence of history miracles and prophecy for the gospel is incontestably strong when fairly examined must appear with force to a modest candid impartial inquirer and as the internal evidence for the sacred letters their usefulness and excellence must be obvious to every attentive capacity that delights in the pursuit of religion and virtue truth and candor then those infidels are strangers to they are not fair reasoners they are haughty overbearing declaimers  azoras notion of the incomprehensible and the law of reason nor can i think much better azora said of those great and reverend men who preach and write to prove the weakness of human reason and that the prime law of our creation the law of nature is imperfect insufficient and obscure and therefore supernatural communication was absolutely necessary who add to this things inconceivable and contradictory and insist upon our believing articles too hard for rational beings this is misrepresenting rationals if we believe the scriptures and is so far from being of service to the cause of christianity as in charity we must suppose those great men by such writeing and preaching do intend that it does on the contrary very greatly hurt reveled religion it is to such wrong defenses of revelation that antichristian deism owes its chief strength our holy religion wants not any real evidence that can be desired by the modest candid and impartial but if great and learned men will deny the perfection of the primary law of god and substitute in the place of recommunicated nature an invented gospel that swells with useless mysteries and hard doctrines great damage must fall upon the true gospel an unintelligible religion is no religion it can be of no concern with regard to rational creatures and strong minds will laugh at its pieties  objections but exclusive of invented mysteries i said which are to be sure sad stuff in the works of those great men and deplorably corrupt the simplicity of the gospel to me it is not so plane that mankind could by reason acquire just and adequate ideas of the existence and nature of the supreme being or know that they had immortal souls and would expose themselves to eternal unavoidable misery in a future state in proportion to the demerit of their thoughts and actions in this world but might secure everlasting felicity by worshipping one supreme universal omnipotent eternal omnipresent and intelligent spirit and doing all the good we have an opportunity and power to do in this life i question if reason can make us clear and certain on these articles the reason of the bulk of mankind cannot do it i think therefore the gospel was absolutely necessary for the salvation of men  continuation of azoras religious notions azora to this replied that faith in christ and all his own institutions were of high value indeed and beautiful his religion appears when it is fairly represented as an institution that has no other end than morality the most noble end and the most worthy of god and that declares the practice of all the moral offices to be superior to any inward accomplishment or outward christian institution but she could not allow that christianity was absolutely necessary for the common reason of men without launching out into the unfathomable ocean of metaphysical subtilties appears upon trial to be able to discover the fundamental points of religion and from the things that are made from our moral capacities and powers and from our relations to one another to know the supreme being his attributes and perfections and that we are accountable to our great creator  if men will think they must perceive without the reason of a newton or clarke the existence of a spiritual influence in all the parts of inanimated matter and the existence of their own spirits or souls to which ever part of matter we look we see a spirit employed an influencing being endued with the faculties of perception activity and volition is plane the accidental qualities of matter called attraction repulsion and communication of motion evince that material and vegetable nature and all the parts of inanimated matter are actuated by one supreme and universal spirit i say one spirit because it is evident from a sameness of volition that is from one and the same faculty of volition manifest throughout all nature that there are not several distinct independent spirits in attraction repulsion and communication of motion there appears no different faculty of volition but a different exercise of the same faculty of volition which for wise reasons makes some parts of matter cohere strongly as stone and metal  some weakly as earth etc some repel while others attract some elastic and others nonelastic in all these cases one spirit only is the actor that being who holds all perfection in himself and by an absolute command over all parts of matter forms and manages it as his wisdom sees best  just as his adorable providence governs us and disposes of us by such laws as reason consulting the good of the whole society declares it to be best for us to obey best most surely as it is the glory of the almighty to be constantly and without any deviation governed by the eternal and immutable laws of good and right just and equal all is the operation of one and the same universal spirit identity is visible the various kinds of attraction repulsion etc only show the unlimited power of the deity in actuating matter as his established rules require were several arbitrary supreme spirits to act over matter the consequence would be a breach of regularity uniformity and constancy in the laws of nature and that confusion would appear instead of beauty and order  continuation of azoras religious notions thus common reason confesses that there is one infinite universal supreme spirit who actuates and governs the universe and from the heavens the earth and ourselves we are as certain that there is a creator and lord of all the worlds who directs every atom of it and animates every material form as we are of any thing demonstrated to us and as he is not only the creator but the manager and preserver of every being there can be no power equal to him he must be omnipotent he must likewise be eternal and omnipresent for there was no superior power to receive existence from nor is there a superior power to confine it as to his infinite intelligence his being the author and preserver of all things demonstrates it  in respect of the human soul azora continued it is impossible for perception to proceed from the body or from any motion or modification of parts of the body and therefore there must be a mind in which our ideas must be produced and exist if the ideas of sensation may be supposed to be occasioned by the different motions of the constituent parts of the brain yet they cannot be those motions the motions can only enable a spiritual percipient to note them remember them etc and as to reflection the other part of the perceptive faculty attention and contemplation it is not possible they can proceed from the different motions into which the parts of the brain are put because they are employed solely about perceptions which were only in the mind the case is the same as to many other qualities or faculties  in the designing quality the inventing quality the judging quality the reasoning quality the compounding quality the abstracting quality the discerning quality the recollective quality the retentive quality the freedom of will the faculty of volition and especially the foreseeing faculty these cannot be the faculties of matter such qualities must exist ultimately and solely in mind can foresight for example be the work of matter when it is employed about things and actions which have not yet happened and for that reason cannot be the objects of the senses no surely it must be the spiritual part of the compound that acts upon the occasion in all the intelligent faculties which we comprehend under the complex idea of understanding spirit only can be the performer  continuation of azoras religious philosophy there is a soul or mind then in man and that it is immortal and accountable is as evident as that the retentive faculty that is retaining ideas received by reflection does not pertain to body but is a natural quality of the soul only and does not proceed from its union with the body for as perception and retention prove the human mind to be a distinct being and that it has qualities which cannot proceed from body therefore it must still continue a spirit unless annihilated by its creator and must after its separation be endued with the qualities which are the faculties of soul only the reason is plain these qualities cannot be destroyed without a cause but separation is no cause as the quality or qualities did not proceed from or depend on union therefore the soul is immortal unless we suppose what cannot be supposed that its creator puts an end to its being we must know after death that we exist we must remember a past existence and call to mind every idea we had formed in this life by reflection  continuation of azoras discourse as to our being accountable hereafter for the deeds we have done in this first state of existence this can admit of no speculation for as we have received from our creator the eternal law of reason which enables us to distinguish right and wrong and to govern the inferior powers and passions appetites and senses if we please  as we are endued with an understanding which can acquire large moral dominion and may if we oppose not sit as queen upon the throne over the whole corporeal system since the noble faculty of reason was given to rectify the soul and purify it from earthly affections to elevate it above the objects of sense to purge it from pride and vanity selfishness and hypocrisy and render it just pious and good  of consequence god has a right to call us to account for our conduct in this first state and will reward or punish in a most extraordinary manner as the principles and actions of man have been righteous or his life and character stained by unjust dispositions and filthy deeds this is plain to common reason every understanding must see this how wrong soever they wilfully act as god by his nature must abhor iniquity and love what is honest pure and good he must reward the piety and worthy behavior of those who act according to reason in this life and with views beyond the bounds of time endeavor to proceed each day to more exalted ideas of virtue but the mortals who deviate from rectitude and goodness and wilfully live workers of iniquity must expect that god the father of spirits the lover of truth and the patron of righteousness and virtue will proportion future punishments to present vices and banish them to the regions of eternal darkness from the natural lights of our understanding we have the highest reason to conclude this will be the case the truths are as evident to a reflection as that this world and we who inhabit it could not have had eternal existence nor be first formed by any natural cause but must have been originally produced as we are now constantly preserved by the supreme and universal spirit this is the excellent law of reason or nature there is a light sufficient in every human breast to conduct the soul to perfect day if men will follow it right onwards and not turn into the paths that lead to the dark night of hell  remarks on azoras discourse azoras religious notions amazed me and the more as they were uttered with a fluency and ease beyond any thing i had ever heard before in the softest sweetest voice she expressed herself and without the least appearance of labor her ideas seemed to flow from a vast fountain she was a master indeed in the doctrine of ideas her notion of them and their formation was just as possible and in a few minutes she settled every thing relating to them her ideas of activity and passivity afforded me much instruction as did her notions of space matter and spirit and what is still more extraordinary she had a fine conception of an electrical fluid which is thought to be a discovery made very lately and made use of it to prove not that it is the ultimate cause of effects but that every thing is caused and directed by an immaterial spirit an immaterial spirit was her favorite article and it was to me a fine entertainment to hear her on that subject from the one supreme spirit down to the spirit of brute animals  but to conclude our conversation on religion i observed to azora that if things were so and the law of reason was so perfect and sufficient then i could not see that there was any want at all of the religion of favor since that of nature was enough to confirm us in rectitude and holiness if we would obey its directions and to show us the way to the mansions of angels why the law of grace at so great an expense  if the rule of reason can make us good here and for ever happy hereafter  azoras notion of the usefulness and excellence of christianity azora replied that she had before answered this question by observing that excellent as the primary law of the creation was yet revelation was of the greatest use as it enables us to extend our knowledge even as to the things which we are by nature capable of knowing and as it restored to the world the law of reason that is true religion when superstition and enthusiasm had established false religion this renders christianity glorious were there nothing more to be said for it but this is not all we can say  azoras discourse on the usefulness of christianity the best of mortals are weak and the most of them are so fully employed about things temporal that it is impossible so much good should proceed from mere human reason as from a plain easy gospel that delineates duty in the most intelligible manner and contains the absolute command of the great god to renounce vicious habits impure desires worldly tempers and frame our souls to purity sincerity and devotion as the only means that can secure his felicitating presence and gain us admission to the delightful seats of separate souls made perfect in this the gospel is far preferable to reason  continuation of azoras discourse beside as wilful disobedience strikes at the being and government of god and devotedness to the lord of all the worlds in trust and resignation is the perfection of religion the example of the son of god in his humiliation his cross his death make an instance of resignation so consummate and instructive that we not only learn from it what reason cannot half so well instruct us in i mean the amiableness of virtue the excellency of holiness and the merit of absolute and unreserved obedience but we are roused to an imitation of this grand character both on account of its beauty and the promise of our sitting down with christ in his throne if according to our measure we work all righteousness and overcome our present temptations and trials even as he also overcame and is set down with his father in his throne reason is nothing compared to this the gospel dispensation by this means is fitted to render us virtuous holy and thoroughly good in a method the law of nature could never do  continuation of azoras discourse on the excellence of christianity and more than this when the god of heaven saw his creatures and children every where going wrong without any help amongst themselves and therefore sent his son to set them right to set before them the unchangeable rule of everlasting righteousness in its original purity and perfection and not only explain and enforce it by the most powerful considerations but apply the commands of supreme reason to the government of the thoughts and passions of the heart that duty and virtue in the principle and habit of universal rectitude toward both god and man might be the practice of all the earth and mankind become a people holy to the lord he the universal father the better to effect this blessed purpose added two things to religion which have a power that reason wants to make us conform to god and the eternal laws of righteousness in principle temper and life one is christs appearing to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself by his becoming a sinoffering the other is the assistance of the spirit of god the oblation of the son and the grace of the father have effects in religion in changing and sanctifying that reason is an utter stranger to  conclusion of azoras discourse on the excellence of the christian religion the sum of the whole is the gospel that word of truth and power enters the hearts and breaks the power of sin in the soul the holy life of christ sets us an example that we should walk in his steps and obey the will of the infinitely wise creator that like him we should accord by obedience with the harmony of gods moral government and rather die than break or obstruct it by any wilful sin and by his being a sinoffering he not only put an end to all sin offerings which both jews and gentiles were wont to offer when a plague afflicted the massilienses they fed a poor man deliciously and adorned him with sacred vestments then led him through the city and sacrificed him by throwing him headlong down from a steep rock after the people had poured their execrations upon him and prayed that all the calamities of their city might fall upon him  such practice shows that christ being offered for the sins of the whole world was in conformity to the ideas of mankind the jews had their devoted animal  and the gentiles had their sacrificed poor man and other ways   but by his being the most precious one in the universe showed gods great displeasure against sin and in his obedience to the father even unto death that we ought to cease from evil and by a righteous obedience render ourselves worthy of god the fathers love that we may do so we have the promise of the spirit to enable us to turn from sin and satan to the living god that by the acting principle of sanctification wrought within us by the hand of him that made us without the least force on our will we may perfect our souls in purity and holiness exercise acts of love and benevolence and worship the one true god in and through the one true mediator  reason alone excellent as it is cannot produce any thing like this  the religion of favor in these respects surpasses the law of nature by the first law of the creation reason we may acquire that righteousness which is an habitual rectitude of soul and right actions flowing from it but sanctification that influencing principle which adds holiness to righteousness belongs as i take it to the law of grace it is given to those who ask it not for the sake of but through christ  objections to azoras discourse all this i answered is just and fine and i have only to request for my farther instruction that you will be pleased madam to explain yourself a little more on the articles of a sinoffering and grace for i have always thought there was a darkness sat upon these parts of reveled religion and have often wished for what i have not yet found a head capable of giving me entire satisfaction on those points but from what i have heard you say i must now suppose that all my doubts relative to the two subjects you have the power to remove  my power azora returned is no more than a plain understanding that in this still and peaceful region has been at liberty to think without being corrupted by sophistry schoolnonsense or authority and as to giving satisfaction on the heads you mention or any other it is not what i pretend to but my opinion you shall have since you ask it and in the following manner azora proceeded  azoras account of christ being a sinoffering as to our lords becoming a sinoffering i conceive in the first place that god ordained it because he saw it needful and necessary to answer many and great ends it must be right and what in the reason and nature of things ought to be though we were not able to comprehend the reasons that made it needful it must have been the properest way to make up the breach between heaven and earth since infinite wisdom appointed it  in the next place as the death of this great person not only gave the highest attestation to the truth of his doctrine and confirmed every word he had preached to the encouragement of sinners to repent and the great consolation of saints but has afforded us such a noble pattern of obedience as must have an influence on intelligent beings and excite them to practice obedience to all the commands of god and perfect resignation to his will in every case which are some excellent reasons for christs dying so did almighty god make this farther use of it that he appointed the blood of christ which was shed to produce the essence of sanctification in the soul to wit devotedness trust and resignation to the almighty father of the universe to be the blood of anew covenant shed for many for the remission of sins this seems to me to take in the whole case christ by obedience to the death which happened in the natural course of things is held out to the world a pattern of selfsacrifice in the cause of truth and virtue  a sample of that perfect religion  not my will but thine be done the glorious gospel is thereby confirmed and our redemption is effected by the blood of the son of god as moses the mediator between god and israel repeated to the people the laws and judgments of god and received their consent to the divine commands entered this covenant in his book offered sacrifices of praise and friendship and then confirmed the covenant in the most solemn manner by dividing the blood of the sacrifices into parts one part of which he sprinkled on the altar to ratify gods part of the covenant and with the other part sprinkled the people that is the twelve princes the heads or the twelve pillars which represented the twelve tribes and then awfully cried out with a strong voice  behold the blood of the covenant jehovah has made with you so did the lord jesus christ the mediator between god and all mankind teach the people by his gospel to rectify their notions to regulate their affections to direct their worship with the judgments that were to be the consequence of disobedience the rewards prepared for those who obey and then declared in relation to his death this is my blood of the new covenant the blood i must shed on the cross will seal ratify and confirm a pardoning covenant and by virtue thereof upon repentance and conversion the world is washed clean through the blood of the lamb this i think for myself renders the thing very plain and easy the death of the son of god was taken into the plan of redemption not to pacify gods anger for god could be no otherwise pleased or delighted with the blood of his son than as his shedding it was an act of the highest obedience and a noble pattern to all the rational creation but his blood was made the seal of a pardoning and justifying covenant and by the death of christ the most powerful means to prevent sin and to draw sinners to obey the commands of heaven god demonstrated his love and mercy to mankind i fancy i am clear in this view of the matter i can see no difficulty in being justified freely by the grace of god through the redemption which is in christ jesus god is the sole original and fountain of redemption the son and his gospel are the great instruments lo i come to do thy will o my god the son declares and the blood he shed the better to bring the human race to wisdom rectitude and happiness is appointed by our merciful good and gracious father to be the seal and ratifcation of a new covenant moloch might want a cruel and bloody sacrifice to pacify him but the father of the universe sent his christ to deliver his commands and made the death which he foresaw would happen by his sons delivering such commands to impious men to be a covenant between jehovah and the people that jesus should be considered as a propitiation for our sins and his death be an eternal memorial of the almightys love and abhorrence of iniquity there can no objection lie against this to me this appears the most rational and beautiful scheme that infinite wisdom could contrive most glorious and good is our god most happy may mortals be if they please the virtuous obedience of our lord has obtained from god a right and power to abolish death his blood has confirmed the covenant of grace and his gospel has brought life immortal into light  azoras account of grace as to the influence of the spirit azora continued that there is such a living principle in the human soul cannot i think be denied if revelation is to be believed but the mode of influencing is not perhaps to be explained otherwise than by saying that our gracious and good father makes now and then some friendly impressions upon our minds and by representing in several lights the terrors and promises of the gospel excites our hopes and fears as i apprehend we can go very little further it is easy i think to prove from the scriptures that as the extraordinary assistance of the holy ghost was necessary for planting christianity at first so is a supernatural assistance of the holy ghost though not in so illustrious a manner still necessary to enable us to perform the conditions of the gospel though god has recalled the more visible signs of his presence yet to be sure he continues to influence some way or other i cannot suppose the holy ghost has wholly withdrawn himself from the church the renewing of the holy ghost st peter says was a promise made to them and to their children and to those that were afar off even as many as god should call and as human nature has the same weakness and passions and extravagancies of former ages there is as much need of a divine assistance now as in the time of the apostles nay more need i think at present as miracles are ceased there must be a weight of supernatural power to press within as there are now no flashings from the sky or extraordinary appearances without to prove the certainty of our religion and make us consider its promises threatenings and rules but the way this supernatural principle acts as before observed is hard to determine any more than what i have said and instead of wasting our time in enquiries how the thing is done our business is to render ourselves capable of so great a blessing by not grieving this holy spirit lest he depart from us and resolving with the psalmist to walk with a perfect heart and to set no wicked thing before our eyes we must strive to improve religious thoughts we must labor hard to obey the written rules god will then give us the grace sufficient for us to our considerable talent of natural power to do good our father will add the advantages of his his spirit if we desire to be good he will make us good in conjunction with our own application and pains by a gradual process and human methods if nature gives her utmost actings the author of nature will move and direct and assist her where she is weak both the grace and the providence of god may be likened to a little spring concealed within a great machine to the known given powers of the machine the operations of it are ascribed and all its events imputed yet it is the small secreted spring that directs draws checks and gives movement to every weight and wheel the case cannot be exactly alike as a compound of matter and spirit is different from a machine but it may suggest i imagine some imperfect idea of the affair a very imperfect one i confess for if we were thinking ever so long of the matter grace after all would be what the apostle calls it an unspeakable gift  a gift surmounting our apprehensions as well as it does our merit the theory of it may be perhaps too excellent for us and our part is not to determine how but with honest hearts to pray that a ray from heaven may open and shine upon our understanding clear it from prejudices and impostures and render it teachable considerative and firm may inspire good thoughts excite good purposes and suggest wholesome counsels and expedients this the divine power may easily do without depriving us of freewill or lessening our own moral agency that power may extinguish an imagination we strive to get rid of may remove an impediment we labor to be freed from may foil a temptation we do our best to resist if we do all we can and implore the divine aid there is no doubt but the almighty may give his free creatures such powers and dispositions as will carry them innocently and safely through the trial of this first state on such conditions god the father of spirits the friend of men the patron of righteousness and all virtue will without all peradventure distribute his grace to every mortal in proportion to the measures of necessary duty  a reflection on azoras discourse here azora ended and i sat for some minutes after in great admiration her fancy furnished ideas so very fast and speaking was so very easy to her without one pang in the delivery or the least hesitation for hours as she could if she pleased so long discourse her judgment was so strong and her words so proper and well placed that she appeared to me a prodigy in speaking and i could have listened to her with delight and amazement the whole night but exactly at ten oclock the old woman i mentioned before who first bid me welcome to burcot lodge came into the chamber with candles and azora told me gladuse the old woman conducts me to a bed in her cottage that if i would follow gladuse she would light me to bed i did immediately after wishing the ladies good night and my guide brought me to her own cottage which was next door to the grotto she showed me into a small clean room neatly and prettily furnished and there i found a good bed down i lay as soon as i could being much fatigued and as the sun was rising got up again to write what i could remember to have heard azora say my memory from my childhood has been very extraordinary i believe there are few living exceed me in this respect the greatest part of what i read and hear remains with me as if the book was still before me or the speaker going on this enables me to write down with much exactness what i care to note and i can do it for the most part in the relaters or talkers own words if i minute it in my short hand within twentyfour hours after reading or discoursing upon this account i can say that i lost very little of all that azora was pleased to let me hear or of the discourses i had with her ingenious companion antonia fletcher  the gardens of burcot lodge when i had done writing i went out to wait upon the ladies and found them in their fine gardens busily employed in the useful and innocent diversion which the cultivation of some of the greatest beauties of the creation affords they had every kind of fruit tree in their ground every plant and flower that grows and such a variety of exotic rarities from the hotter climates as engaged my admiration and finely entertained me for many an hour during my stay in this place they both understood gardening to perfection and continually lent their helping hands to the propagation of every thing the digging and laborious work was performed by many young women who did it with great activity and understanding and the nicer parts these ladies executed i was astonished and delighted with their operations of various kinds it was beautiful to see with what exquisite skill they used the knife managed graffs and cyons directed the branches and twigs in posture on espaliers and raised flowers they had every thing in perfection in their kitchen garden and physic garden their fruits roots and herbs for the table were most excellent their collection of herbs for medicine the most valuable and as the whole contrivance of the gardens was near nature and beautiful in grass gravel and variety of evergreens i was led with delight through the whole till i came into the greenhouse there i saw azora and antonia at work and paid them the compliments they deserved  a further account of azora immediately after my arrival breakfast was brought in there chocolate and toasts and the ladies were extremely pleasant over it they asked me a great many questions about the world and were so facetious in their remarks and pleased with my odd account of things that they laughed as heartily as i did and that was at no small rate this being done we walked over every part of the gardens and azora did me the honor not only to show me all the curiosities and improvements she had made in the management of seeds flowers plants and trees but lectured on various fine objects that appeared in our way with a volubility of tongue and a knowledge of the subjects that was amazing indeed were i to set down what she said even on sallads cucumbers colliflowers melons asparagus early cabbages strawberries rasberries currants goosberries apples pears plums cherries apricots etc and especially her propagation of mushrooms champignons and buttons this exclusive of exotics and flowers would make i believe an octavo and in relation to exotics and flowers i am sure she talked twice as much and of every thing extremely well i never did hear any thing like her the discourse cost her no more than the breath of her nostrils  azoras fish pond but at last we came to a fish pond that was an acre of water and i assure you reader that in half an hours time the illustrious azora not only talked more of fish and ponds than the ingenious and honorable roger north of rougham in norfolk has written on these subjects in his excellent discourse printed in      but mentioned many useful things relative to them which mr north was a stranger to she told me among other matters that there was only pike and perch in her pond and that the reason of it was because she loved pike above all fish and as the jacks were fish of prey no fish but the perch could live with them the perch on account of the thorny fins on its back escapes the pikes voracious appetite she farther informed me that the jacks in her pond were the finest in the world as i would see at dinner and that the reason of it was owing to the high feeding she took care they had every day beside the entrails of what fowl and sheep her people killed for her table and themselves the pike had blood and bran mixed in plenty and all the frogs she could get from a neighboring fen for of them the jacks are most fond this made the fish extraordinary and as the water was current through the pond and the bottom of various depths from one foot and two feet to six feet that the spawn may have shallow water to lie in and the fry shallow water to swim in as they both required this was the reason that one acre of water in such a manner produced double the quantity of fish to what a pond of still water and a bottom all of one depth could have see  azora continued what multitudes there are they know me as i feed them myself every day and tamely come up cruel tyrants as they are to get their meat here she called jack jack and throwing in a basket of unfortunate frogs it was wonderful to see how those devouring monsters appeared and voraciously swallowed the poor things  an account of the public worship at burcotlodge azora was going to proceed to another pond of carp and tench which she had at the other end of her gardens and let me know how that was ordered so as to produce the largest and finest fish but a bell rung for morning prayers at ten oclock and she immediately turned toward a chapel she asked me if i would attend divine service and upon my answering with pleasure desired me to come on in the church i saw every soul of the community assembled and while i chose to sit on one of the benches among the people at some distance that i might the better observe every thing done the ladies ascended by a few steps into a reading desk and azora began with great devotion to pray in the following manner  morning prayer o christ our blessed mediator pray for us that our faith fail not and through thy merits and intercession lord jesus let our prayer be set forth in the sight of almighty god as incense and the lifting up of our hands as a morning sacrifice  almighty and everlasting god thou pure and infinite spirit who art the great cause and author of nature and have established the world by thy wisdom and stretched out the heavens by thy discretion upon whom depends the existence of all things and by whose providence we have been preserved to this moment and enjoyed many blessings and undeserved advantages graciously accept we beseech thee our grateful sense and acknowledgements of all thy beneficence toward us accept o lord our most hearty and unfeigned thanks for all the instances of thy favor which we have experienced that we have the use of our reason and understanding in which many fail and have had refreshing sleep and quiet the past night for delivering us from evil and giving us our daily bread  for all the necessaries conveniences and comforts which thy liberal hand have provided for us to sweeten human life and render it more agreeable than otherwise it could be in this day of our exercise probation and trial while we live we will praise and magnify thy awful name and join in ascribing with the glorious and innumerable heavenly host honor power and thanksgiving to the eternal god who sits on the throne of supremacy unrivalled in majesty and power  but especially o great and blessed god adored be thy goodness for so loving the world as to give thy only begotten son to the end that all who believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life for his humbling himself even to the death upon the cross and shedding his blood for the remission of our sins great and mavelous are thy works of mercy o lord god almighty who can utter all thy praise praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him small and great amen allelujah blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sits upon the throne and to the lamb for ever and ever  o god and father of our lord jesus christ have mercy on us dust and sin weakness and imperfection and enter not into strict judgment with us thine unrighteous and unworthy servants we confess with shame and grief that we have violated thine holy laws and abused thy tender mercies that we have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts and in numberless instances have offended against a most righteous governor a most tender and compassionate father and a most kind and bounteous benefactor in thought word and deed many have been our offenses and many are still our imperfections we have sinned against heaven and before thee and have thereby deserved thy just displeasure but our hope and confidence is in thine infinite mercy o god and that according to thy promises declared unto mankind in christ jesus our lord thou will spare them who confess their faults and restore them that are penitent we do earnestly repent and are heartily sorry for all our misdoings through faith we offer up the lamb that was slain to the eternal god for the redemption of our souls believing the worthiness of our lord jesus christ to be a full perfect and sufficient sacrifice oblation and atonement for the sins of a repenting world and therefore resolving with all our strength to imitate his spotless virtue and perfect obedience pardon us then we beseech thee and blot out our iniquities deliver us we pray in the name of the lord jesus from the evil consequences of all our transgressions and follies and give us such powers and dispositions as will carry us innocently and safely through all future trials  create in us o god pure hearts and renew right spirits within us cast thy bright beams of light upon our souls and irradiate our understandings with the rays of that wisdom which sits on the right hand of thy throne let thy holy spirit enable us to act up to the dignity of our reasonable nature and suitably to the high character and glorious hopes of christians that we may subordinate the affairs and transactions of time to serve the interest of our souls in eternity that we may shake off this vain world and breathe after immortality and glory that we may live in perfect reconciliation with the law of everlasting righteousness truth and goodness and so comply with thy nature mind and will o eternal and sovereign spirit thou god most wonderful in all perfections that we may fully answer the relation we stand in to thee relieve and ease our consciences o blessed god by the blood of sprinkling according to our several conditions of body and mind and supply us with suitable grace and strength  we beseech thee in the next place almighty lord to take us into thy protection this day and suffer no being to injure us no misfotune to befall us nor us to hurt ourselves by any error or misconduct of our own give us o god a clear conception of things and in all dangers and distresses stretch forth the right hand of thy majesty to help and defend us from sickness and pain and from all evil and mischief good lord deliver us this day and be propitious unto us we beseech thee  and while we remain in this world o father lord of heaven and earth secure us from every thing that is terrible and hurtful and keep us in peace and safety from all sad accidents and calamitous events from all tormenting pains and grievous diseases good lord deliver us and bless us with so much health and prosperity as will enable us to pass our time here in contentment and tranquillity  and when the time of our dissolution comes by the appointment of thy adorable wisdom o father of mercies and the god of all comforts grant us a decent and happy exit without distraction of mind or torments of body let thy servants depart in peace and suddenly die in the lord  we pray likewise for the happiness of all mankind that they may all know and obey and worship thee o father in spirit and in truth and that all who name the name of christ may depart from iniquity and live as becomes his holy gospel we beseech thee to help and comfort all who are in danger necessity sickness and tribulation that it may please thee to sanctify their afflictions and in thy good time to deliver them out of all their distresses if we have any enemies o lord forgive them and turn their hearts  our father etc  when this extraordinary prayer was done which was prayed with a very uncommon devotion such as i never had seen before they all stood up and azora said let us sing the nineteenth psalm to the praise and glory of the most high god and immediately raised it then all the people joined and a psalm was sung to perfection indeed azora and antonia had delightful voices and as they understood music very well they had taught this congregation so much church harmony as enabled them to perform beyond any thing i have ever heard in any assembly of people  the whole scene was a strange and pleasing thing they met again at four in the afternoon and this is the work of their every day at ten and four they go to prayers and after it sing a psalm concludeing always in the following way  may the grace of our lord jesus christ procure us the love of god that the almighty father of the universe may bless us with the heavenly assistance of the holy ghost  as to the eveningoffice of devotion at this place it was exclusive of the first address and the concluding lords prayer quite different from that of the morning and because some readers may be pleased with a sight of another of azoras religious compositions i here set it down  evening prayer at burcot lodge o christ our blessed mediator pray for us that our faith fail not and through thy merits and intercession lord jesus let our prayer be set forth in the sight of almighty god as incense and the lifting up of our hands as an eveningsacrifice  o god who art the father and lord of all beings and the eternal and inexhaustible fountain of mercy we beseech thee to be merciful unto us and to blot out all our transgressions for we truly repent of our wilful imperfections our failings and neglects in every instance of thy law and our duty and through faith we offer up to thee the lamb that was slain for the redemption of our souls believing the worthiness of our lord jesus to be a full perfect and sufficient sacrifice oblation and atonement for the sins of a repenting world and therefore resolving with all our strength to imitate his spotless virtue and perfect obedience  remember not then o lord our iniquities neither take thou vengeance for our sins but as we sincerely believe thy holy gospel and are truly penitent as we entirely and willingly forgive all who have in any instance or in any degree offended or injured us and are truly disposed and ready to make all possible reparation if we have injured any one have mercy upon us miserable sinners and as thou have promised by thy son pardon and forgive us all our sins and restore us again to thy favor hear in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hear accept us to thy mercy o spare us whom thou have redeemed by thy sons most precious blood and make us partakers of that salvation which thou have appointed in christ jesus our lord and our souls shall bless thee to eternity  and that we may no more offend thee or transgress the rule of virtue or true religion but may hereafter truly please thee both in will and deed and faithfully observe the right statutes and all thy precepts endue us o lord with the grace of thy holy spirit that we may amend our lives according to thy holy word vouchsafe we beseech thee to direct sanctify and govern both our hearts and bodies in the ways of thy laws and in the works of thy commandments and so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom and mind those things which are in conjunction with our everlasting welfare  o let us be always under thy communication and influence and give that light to our minds that life to our souls that will raise us to a nearer resemblance of thee and enable us to ascend still higher toward the perfection of our nature let us be transformed by the working of thy grace and spirit into the image of thy son conform us to his likeness o blessed god and make us body and soul an habitation for thyself that in our hearts we may continually offer up to thee holy sublime and spiritual sacrifices  from all evil and mischief good god deliver us and defend us we beseech thee from every thing terrible and hurtful take us under thy protection the remaining part of this day and grant us a night of peace through jesus christ our lord  and forasmuch as our earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved and that in a few years at farthest it may be in a few minutes we must descend to the bed of darkness and acknowledge corruption to be our father and the worms our sister and mother grant o everlasting god that we may depart in peace and by an improved princiciple of divine life under the influence of the gospel be translated to that eternal world where god dwells where christ lives and sanctified souls enjoy endless life and the purest pleasures for evermore  that it may please thee most gracious and good god to have mercy on the whole race of mankind and to bless them with all things pertaining to life and godliness let the light of thy glorious gospel shine upon the nations darkened by superstition that they may worship thee who art god from everlasting to everlasting and cultivate and establish in their minds the most pure benevolent and godlike dispositions  we beseech thee for all christian churches that their behavior may by the influence of thy blessed spirit be suitable to their holy profession and their conversation upright and unblameable where any have departed from the purity and simplicity of the gospel lead them o god to the right practice and knowledge of their holy religion and grant that they may feel the comfortable and sanctifying effects of it and in their lives show forth its praise to others  we farther pray most merciful father for all that are destitute or afflicted either in body mind or estate that from heaven the habitation of thy glory and goodness thou may send them relief and if it be possible put an end to their present calamities and troubles o thou father of mercies and god of all consolation bind up the broken in heart and comfort those that mourn we have a real sense of the miseries of the distressed part of mankind and offer up for them our prayers to thee through jesus christ our lord  a thanksgiving o god the author of all good and fountain of all happiness we offer up our thanksgivings and praises unto thee for thy great goodness to us and to all mankind we praise and magnify thy holy name for all thy mercies for our existence and the use of our reasoning powers and faculties for the health and strength we enjoy and for all the comforts and conveniences of life for these thy gifts we adore thee o munificent parent of good and pray that a deep and efficacious sense of thy goodness may remain upon our hearts and be a principle of constant and cheerful obedience to thy holy laws  but especially we offer up the acknowledgements of our hearts and mouths for all that thy son jesus christ did and taught and suffered in this world to save us from our sins and to conduct us to true and everlasting happiness we bless thee for the glorious gospel and for bringing us more effectually by revelation to the knowledge of thee and the practice of our duty for this merciful appointment and for all thy mercies which respect another and a better life than the present for every instance of thy tender regards to us and for the manifold experiences which we have had of thy loving kindness we offer up the tribute of unfeigned thanks our souls do magnify thee o lord god most excellent and good and all the powers within us praise thy holy name to thee be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end to thee o thou god of love be rendered by all beings endued with reason all honor and obedience both now and for ever  almighty and everlasting god who have promised to hear the petitions of them that pray unto thee in thy sons name we beseech thee of thy great mercy to accept the sacrifice of prayer and praise which we have this evening offered up to thy divine majesty and for the relief of our wants and the manifestation of thy power and glory grant us those things which we have requested if thou see it consistent with our chief and eternal good in the name of thy son jesus christ and as his disciples we pray and in his words conclude the services of this day  our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name etc  after this they all stood up and as in the morning azora said let us sing to the praise and glory of god the    th psalm she sung the first verse alone and at the second they all joined and went through the whole in a fine and heavenly manner then the service concluded with this benediction  the benediction may the god of grace and peace be with us and bless us may his holy spirit keep us from falling and preserve us blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ  a reflection on the religion and piety of the inhabitants of burcothamlet thus ended the evening and morning offices of worship at burcotlodge and as i cannot sufficiently praise so i could not enough admire the religion and piety of this congregation the purity of their worship was charming and in the ladies and their people a devotion was manifest that looked more like that of heavenly spirits than of beings in an animal frame who are warped with the customs of the world and perplexed with difficulties which arise from sensible objects they appeared in high admiration of god endeared to his righteous government devoted to his holy laws and powerfully drawn to imitate him in all his imitable perfections not one idle word or careless look did i hear or see during the whole time of divine service but like creatures fixed unchangeably in the interest of religion and virtue and delighted with the joys of piety their hearts melted in every part of their devotions and their breasts were filled with the most grateful transporting adorations and affections so much beautiful religion i had not often seen in any assembly they had a true sense indeed of the love and goodness of god and of the grace and charity of jesus christ they had all been carefully instructed by a wise and excellent man who was not long since removed from them by death and his daughter the admirable azora in conjunction with his niece the amiable antonia took all possible pains since the decease of mr burcot to maintain the power of religion in their community and keep the people hearty and steady in the principles and practice of it this brings me again to the history of azora  continuation of the history of azora azora burcot was the daughter of a gentleman who was one possessed of a very great fortune but by a fatal passion for the grand operation and an opinion of the possibility of finding the philosophers stone he wasted immense sums in operations to discover that preparation which forces the faeces of infused metals to retire immediately on its approach and so turns the rest of the mass into pure gold communicating the malleability and great ductility of that metal and giving it true specific gravity that is to water as eighteen and one half is to one his love of that fine ancient art called chimistry brought him into this misfortune for improvement and pleasure he had been long engaged in various experiments and at last an adept came to his house who was a man of great skill in the labors and operations of spagyrists and persuaded him it was possible to find the stone for he the adept had seen it with a brother who had been so fortunate as to discover it after much labor and operation the color of it was a pale brimstone and transparent and the size that of a small walnut he affirmed that he had seen a little of this scraped into powder cast into some melted lead and turn it into the best and finest gold this had the effect the adept desired and from chemistry brought mr burcot to alchimy heaps of money he wasted in operations of the most noble elixir by mineral and salt but the stone after all he could not find and then by the adepts advice he proceeded in a second method by maturation to subtilize purify and digest quicksilver and thereby convert it into gold there is a third way to make gold to wit by separation for every metal contains some quantity of gold but the quantity is so small that it bears no proportion to the expense of getting it out this last way the spagyrists never attempt and as for the two other methods maturation and transmuting by the grand elixir the happy hour will never come though so many ingenious men have often thought it drawing nigh to console them for the loss of their fortunes they have had some comfortable moments of reflection that they have been within some minutes of success when crack all is gone and vanished on a sudden and they have nothing before them but cinders and broken crucibles it is very strange then that a man of dr dickensons great veracity and skill in chimistry should affirm the thing was actually done in his presence by an adept epistola ad mundanum de quintessentia philosophorum etc oxon      and the more so as his friend the great mr boil told him the thing was an impossibility dickensons words are nec potui sane quantacunque mihi fuerit opinio de ista re quin aliquoties animi penderem donec illustris ea demonstratio quam vestra excellentia biennio jam elapso coram exhibuit omnem ansam dubitandi mihi praecidisset  placuit dominationi vestrae claro experimento ante oculos facto animum meum ad opus accendere etiam quaestionum mearum solutiones quantum licerat promittere  this is very surprising and the more so as the greatest watchings and closest application in searching after the stone are all in vain unless the stars shed a propitious influence on the labors of the spagyrist the work must be begun and advance in proper planetary hours and depends as much on judicial astrology as on fire camphire salt labor and patience but judicial astrology is no science it is a mere farce i must conclude then that the hands of mundanus the adept were too quick for the doctors eyes and he deceived him by legerdemain that all the books on the subject are fraudulent descriptions to deceive the credulous  and what mundanus told dickinson of sir george ripley canon of bridlington in yorkshire in the reign of edward the fourth and of raymund lully was mere innovation he affirmed that ripley sent the knights of rhodes an hundred thousand pounds to support them in their wars against the turks and that lully assisted edward i king of england with six millions of gold toward carrying on the cruisade this piece of secret history he assures us he found in an ancient manuscript of indisputable authority quod inculpatae fidei registris innoteseit a m s that no one ever saw except mundanus penes me indeed it was to be found only in his own head  ripley is in great repute among the adepts to this day and his famous unintelligible and mysterious book is called a compound of alchymie contryning twelve gates he inscribed the manuscript to edward iv but the editor of it dedicated it to q elizabeth and says it contained the right method of making the philosophers stone and aurum potabile lully was a very learned man for the latter end of the   th century and writ several books in latin  generales artium libri  libri logicales philesophici et metaphisici  variarum artium libri  libri spirituales praedicabiles  and the vade mecum lulli which is a latin piece on the philosophers stone  as to the aurum potabile mentioned by ripley which then and long after was esteemed a panacea or universal medicine it is now a question if there can be a tincture of gold for if it be only a division of the lests or minims of gold by the spicula of aqua regia and these minims thrown into oil of rosemary where they swim it is no radical tincture of gold and the sole virtue lies in the oil of rosemary the oil may be evaporated the gold dust remains and that by melting is reduced to a lump of gold again this i have experimented but the alchymists say gold may be reduced into a gum of substance like honey without any corrosive and that gum steeped in spirit of wine acquires a ruby color an ounce of this is to be mixed with    ounces of another liquor and we have aurum potabile sovereign in all distempers this seems to me to be a second part of the romance the making of this golden gum is a secret we can no more come at than the philosophers stone the adepts however affirm it and assure us that moses could make aurum potabile as is evident from his pulverising the golden calf and giving it to the children of israel to drink this great man who wrote   0 years before homer  00 before sanchoniatho and   0 before the trojan war was as they inform us an adept   this likewise wise came to nothing and instead of the gold he expected he had only heaps of mercury fixed with verdegrease which gives it a yellow tinge and more deeply colored with turmeric gold it seemed but on trial in the coppel it flew away in fumes and the adept made off too late this good and learned man saw he had been imposed on and that the spagyrists are what dr dickenson calls them enigmatistinubivagi  chemistry reader is a fine and ancient art the analyzing of sensible bodies by fire to discover their real powers and virtues is highly praiseworthy and the surprising experiments we make fill the mind of an inquirer after truth with the greatest veneration for the wonderful author of nature but more than this is a sad romance that ends in empty pockets never think then of the hermetical banquet glaubers golden ass or the philosophers magical gold by the law of honest industry endeavor to be rich if you can for this sole reason that it is more blessed to give than to receive and if that lies not within your capacity or means be content with peace and little there is more true happiness in daily bread and the possession of the divine and social virtues than in tons of gold without holiness and a strong attachment to virtue  when mr burcot found he had almost ruined himself and that he was no longer able to live as he had done he laid his melancholy case before his daughter azora and asked her advice what he should do to retire immediately azora said to this part of stanemore which was an unvalued part of his estate and bring as many of his tenants as he could persuade to inhabit this fine tract of land  to sell what remained of his fortune and with the money procure as many of the necessaries or comforts of living as could be had to get in particular some young tradesmen and their wives by offered rewards in this place to build cottages for the people and render the fine caverns in the rock as habitable and pleasing for themselves as art could render them here azora told her father we shall live more happy than we could do if still possessed of a fortune to make an appearance in the world we shall enjoy by industry and prudence every good thing that rational life can require and live secured from the strokes of fortune and the worlds contempt strangers to vanity and the pleasures of high life in this delightful retreat we shall pass our happy days as in a region of goodness knowledge and joy and the predominant bent of our hearts will be to wisdom and virtue and to ascend into the realms of perfect day  happy advice the father of azora said and the thing was immediately done a colony was quickly established here and every thing was settled and ordered in the most advantageous manner cattle instruments and grain to sow the land were sent in clothes and every material the little republic could want were provided and every hand was as useful as we could wish for four years azora continued to inform me we lived in peace and tranquillity and never once regretted the loss of our fortunes we were happier far than when we had thousands industry knowledge and religion were our employment the night to come of pain and death gave us no uneasiness we lived as the christians of the two first centuries and rather longed for than feared that event which is to remove us to growing brightness for ever and ever but a fever came in among us and swept away my father and every man of our little republic several women likewise perished but a hundred souls remained ninetyeight women besides antonia and azora these loved me too well azora continued to abandon me and as they were happily situated and many of them had learned their husbands trades they agreed and swore to spend their lives with me here and be as serviceable as possible without admitting any men to live among us they are so in the highest degree they are all useful and pious as i could wish them and under the heavens there is not a happier society of mortal we have the best of every thing all we want and in reason could wish for  a farther account of azora here azora ended her relation and i wondered greatly at what i heard nor did my admiration lessen when i saw how she governed this community and they employed their time her great understanding enlightened and directed them in the execution of every thing serviceable and ingenious and she lived before their eyes an example of the greatest industry and the most exalted piety they on the other hand were as useful and religious as possible and so heartily and faithfully discharged social duties in every instance that they seemed as one great capacity and power at work to promote every convenience and good some of them as i have said were at work in the gardens others in the fields various trades and occupations were going on within doors and without and all were employed in ways that best subserved the general welfare in their behavior there was nothing wild insolent or arch to be seen no swellings of vanity and pride no passion to disoblige no intention to offend but every one discreet and calm goodhumoured and very civil worthily sustaining their various relations and each attentive to her own incumbent duty their labors were but a diversion to them and they lived in tranquillity and plenty their clothing was coarse but very good clean and handsome there was not one ragged or dirty person among them nor any with bad shoes and stockings in all respects they seemed a most happy community azora studied to the utmost degree the advantage and happiness of these people and they in return made their duty a vigorous and cheerful service most of the conveniences and comforts of life they had within their own little territory flesh and fish mutton kid and venison corn for bread every vegetable maltdrink mead and cider all in great plenty and most excellent wool and flax for clothing good candles and wood enough for firing what things they wanted two of them rid for to the nearest town and not only purchased such goods with the money they got by sale of several commodities especially knit thread stockings and gloves but always at such times brought in some cash to their mistress and she gave part of it among the people to buy them little things they fansied  ten extraordinary country girls as to the ten young women i mentioned who walked after azora when first i saw her they were the daughters of some widows in this little republic and by her chosen not only to be her attendants and upper servants and to look after her dairy her bees her poultry and her aviary which was the finest i have ever seen for the variety of birds and as it was turfed to avoid the appearance of foulness on the floor and so large as to give the birds some freedom of flight but on account of their good understanding in which they far excelled their fellows these girls were carefully instructed by azora and antonia and beside being taught the fine works of the needle learned music and the elements of the mathematics from the ladies the eldest of these girls was but twenty and the youngest eighteen and they all surprised me very greatly with their quickness in answering very hard arithmetical questions they could not only add subtract multiply divide find a fourth proportional and extract roots of every kind with exactness and readiness and apply them upon all common occasions but were perfect in fractions vulgar and decimal they had even gone as far in algebra as the resolution of simple equations  finding them one morning at figures i asked the youngest of them what was the number that of it with   over amounted to the same as     of it with   over she immediately translated the question from common language into algebra   x        x      and quickly discovered the unknown quantity x to be x 0 then she took it in sinthetically of  0   0            of  0             sinthetically is tracing property from number  analetically is tracing number from property this made me wonder very greatly i asked another of them if she bought  0 loaves for    pence all of them twopenny penny and farthing ones  how many would she have of each she answered   twopenny loaves   penny ones and    farthing loaves for the equations were x  y  z   0 and   x    y  z     from whence by subtraction   x    y     and of consequence y        x         x     x     i asked a third how many ways she could pay  0 l in pistoles guineas and moidores at    s    s and    s the pistole the guinea and the moidore  she replied in a very little time   ways to wit    pistoles   guineas and   moidores    pistoles   guinea   moidores    pistoles  0 guineas   moidores     pistoles   guineas   moidore    pistoles   guineas    moidores    pistoles    guineas   moidores    pistoles   guineas   moidores       0  and    pistoles 0 guineas   moidores this was a hard operation  i asked another of these young women if her lady gave her     guineas and     pistoles to pay   men a hundred pounds apiece in guineas and pistoles only as was agreed how could she contrive to pay them and dispatch the thing i will tell you sir she answered very soon x represents my guineas and y my pistoles and    x     y   000 of consequence x   000     y              y   etc and quickly discovered that the first man should have    guineas and   pistoles  the second man    guineas and    pistoles  the third    guineas    pistoles  the fourth    guineas and    pistoles  the fifth    guineas and    pistoles  and the sixth man   guineas and  0  pistoles this was admirable but is there no other way i said of paying  00 l in guineas and pistoles besides the six ways you have mentioned there is no other way the fine girl answered if a seventh man was to be paid  00 l in these two kinds of money he must be paid in one of these six methods this was true i was charmed with what i had heard  while i was thus engaged with the maids azora and antonia came into the room and finding how i had been employed they began to talk of problems theorems and equations and soon convinced me that i was not superior to them in this kind of knowledge though i had studied it for a much longer time and had taken more pains than ever they did their fine understandings saw at once the things that had made me sweat many an hour and in less time than i required for an operation they could answer the most difficult questions and do any thing in simple quadratic equations and in the composition and resolution of ratios this i thought very wonderful especially as they had been taught no longer than one year by mr burcot and that they had acquired the most abstruse part of their knowledge by their own application  i note the thing down as one of the strangest and most extraordinary cases that ever came in my way perhaps that ever was heard it is such a specimen of female understanding as must for ever knock up the positive assertions of some learned men who will not allow that women have as strong reasoning heads as the men  an observation relative to the understanding of women by the way i observe exclusive of these two ladies that i have seen many of the sex who were distinguished for accuracy and comprehensiveness not only in the science where known and required qualities are denoted by letters but in other fine parts of learning i have little right to pretend to any thing extraordinary in understanding as my genius is slow and such as is common in the lower classes of men of letters yet my application has been very great my whole life has been spent in reading and thinking and nevertheless i have met with many women in my time who with very little reading have been too hard for me on several subjects in justice i declare this and am very certain from what i have heard numbers of them say and seen some of them write that if they had the labored education the men have and applied to books with all possible attention for as many years as we do there would be found among them as great divines as episcopius limborch whichcote barrow tillotson and clarke and as great mathematicians as maclaurin saunderson and simpson the critics may laugh at this assertion i know they will and if they please they may doubt my veracity as to what i relate of the two ladies and the ten young women in burcothamlet but what i say is true notwithstanding facts are things too stubborn to be destroyed by laughing and doubting  as to the ladies i have mentioned they both did wonders in specious arithmetic but azora was the brightest of the two and in pure algebra had gone much farther than antonia with wonder i beheld her while she answered the most difficult questions as fast as fingers could move and in the solution of cubics and the resolution of equations both according to des carts laborious method and the better universal way by converging series work with a celerity and truth beyond what i have ever seen any man do nor was it only algebra independent of geometry that she understood she could apply its reasoning to geometrical figures and describe the loci of any equations by the mechanical motion of angles and lines she was in this respect the greatest prodigy i ever saw  but it was not on account of this excellence that i so much admired azora and honor her memory so greatly as i do nor because she talked so excellently on various subjects as i have related but for her knowledge of the truths of christianity and the habits of goodness she had wrought into her soul for the care she took of the people under her government by communicating every felicity in her power to their bodies and minds and the pure religion of christ jesus which she publicly maintained in all the beauty of holiness and in a just fervor of practice she was herself in her manners and piety a fine copy of those blessed women who conversed with our lord and his apostles and her society in innocence and goodness in usefulness and devotion seemed an epitome of the first christian church at jerusalem under a just impression of the most heavenly principles they all lived and strictly regarded their several offices as the gospel directs they worshipped a first cause the deity as the disciples of the christ of god our holy mediator and the authority of a being of infinite wisdom and unchangeable rectitude of nature had made such an impression upon their minds that they labored continually to acquire that consecration and sanctity of heart and manners which our divine religion requires excellent community happy would europe be if all her states were like this people a false religion would not then prevail nor would superstition be the idol to which the world bows down the evils which now dishonor human nature and infest society would not be seen among us nor those excesses of passion be known which are the parent of discord and calamity and render this lower world one scene of sin and sorrow but as revelation inculcates as reason suggests mankind would worship the almighty principle the one god the only true god with a worship suitable to the nature of a being who is not confined to or dependent upon particular places and circumstances who is always and every where present with us and like the ministers attending on the glorious throne of the monarch of the world they would according to their measure be pure benevolent mortals and as perfect in goodness as men can be within the degree and limit of their nature  in a word the supreme father of all things would then be the god of all christians and in doing his will in imitating his perfections and in practicing every thing recommended by the great and universal law of reason that law which god sent our lord to revive and enforce they would find the greatest pleasure such were the people of burcothamlet azora and antonia were indeed most glorious women azora burcot died in the year thirty two six years after i left them but antonia fletcher is still living in the same happy situation and by advising the young women to marry some young men of those mountains has made an alteration in the community for the better and increased the number of her people the settlement is now like to continue and they find many advantages from having men among them the rising generation thereby acquired now proves a blessing to the first colony whom years have rendered much weaker and dependent than when i first saw them azora a little before she died did intend to get in a recruit of female children for the support of the society but antonia judged it was much better to let the young girls of the community get honest youths for their spouses for by this means they can never want young people to assist and comfort them and to increase and perpetuate their happy republic for these reasons she sent for some young men to several neighboring villages in richmondshire to make several things wanting and to dig and work in the gardens for so much by the year certain and as they were smitten with the clean civil girls of burcothamlet several marriages soon ensued and infants were produced before the twelve months had expired more than half of the twenty women that married had twins the first year and all of them had strong healthy children the ten extraordinary girls i mentioned got very good husbands and as antonia was particularly kind to them on their marrying and gave to all the wedded folks great encouragement in profitable gardens and houses grain and cattle they and their spouses became rather more dutiful and useful to their mistress and ruler than otherwise and in gratitude and for the sake of their children did their best to please mrs fletcher and increase the common felicity in this condition i found them on my second arrival at burcothamlet they were a flourishing village and a most happy people my second visit was fourteen years after the first and i saw them a third time in the year fifty two they were then all well and enjoyed every comfort of life that can proceed from good and useful manners mrs fletcher though now in years has no sign of age in her constitution and still leads a most active and pious life she is a subaltern providence to them and with the tenderest care makes it the labor of her every day to secure and advance the temporal and eternal interest of the people but their souls is her main care she performs to them divine service twice every day as good azora was wont to do she reads the best sermons to the aged and constantly catechises the young ones she is a blessed woman  by the way reader i must observe to you that in traveling over that part of richmondshire which is called stanemore i found several small villages that are not mentioned in camden or the britannia antiqua et nova or in englands gazetteer and though not so pretty and happy as burcot in the northern end of the fells of westmorland yet in tolerable condition and remarkable on account of several things and people though they live entirely on what their spot affords and have little communication with their countrymen beyond the mountains that separate the inhabitants of stanemore from the rest of england i took notice in particular that although those poor remote people had not faculties adapted to large measures of knowledge nor have ministers to teach them or churches to pray in yet they were not alienated from the taste and feelings of humanity nor strangers to the momentous principles of true christianity they had the bible and could read it they instructed their children in virtue and religion and lived themselves as the intelligent subjects of an almighty governor in a firm belief that god will distinguish the virtue and the offense of mankind hereafter by suitable tokens of his favor or displeasure all this i saw in several villages of stanemoremountains i lived for some time among the poor people and i mention their case here that you may have the less reason to imagine there is any thing incredible in my account of the extraordinary state of burcothamlet  as to the stanemorepart of richmondshire camden and the authors of the other britannia and the tourmen etc never so much as saw this country at a diance i am very sure the very little they say of it is false and ridiculous camden places bows before gretabridge he says in this desolate and solitary this mountainous and vast tract called stanemore there is but one inn in the middle of it for the entertainment of travelers whereas in truth there is no inn at all in what is properly called stanemore this inn camden speaks of is the bell i mentioned before where i breakfasted with miss melmoth and lies on the left side of a fine turnpike road from bows to brugh in westmorland the highway to carlisle but though this road is a part of stanemore running in a direct line from gretabridge through bows to brugh    miles of delightful ground both on account of the excellence of the way and the fine views of mountains and vales on either hand for    miles from a beautiful ruin of a roman castle at the end of the town by the way i suspect from mr horsleys account of the roman castle or station that he never was on the spot but had his relation from the surveyor he sent out to find the length of this roman wall and take other dimensions and notes for his britannia i mean mr cay who published the late map of northumberland which mr horsley employed him to make he does not describe the fort and situation and the adjacent country as if he had been there himself nor can i think he ever rid from this castle to brugh or burgh under stanemore or from brugh the roman verterae to brovocum now brougham castle a great and curious roman ruin the finest things relating to them he has omitted and many antiquities that are to be found in offsets by the way i question likewise if he ever saw with his own eyes the eastern and western terminations of the roman wall if he was at newcastle and really did ride over lonsdale marsh to tunnocelum a marsh where i had like to have lost my life it is surprising that a man of his understanding and taste for antiquities should give no better account of these places for my part i could not see what he saw nor did he see what i saw at the end of the town of stanemore   yet this is but the southern beginning of stanemore that vast tract of mountains glins and valleys forest rock and water the most wonderful land in the world for  0 miles to the end of the country if it was possible to go straight on lies on the right hand of this road as you ride to brugh under stanemore or on your left as you come from westmorland to catarracton or catarriek  here by the way let me tell you reader lives ralph hawkwell who keeps an excellent house where you may get choice things after a ride of    miles if you come from boroughbridge to go the north or of    miles if from gretabridge for the south provided you have the rem and if you have not though you were an apostle of a man ralph would have very little regard for you indeed every where in the north where the best of things are to be had i have always found traveling there as expensive as near london many i know give a different account but the reason is either they never were there or they travel in a pilgrimlike manner you must take care then to have money enough if ever you undertake the northern expedition i have frequently gone upon and as it is not safe carrying much cash with you for there are rogues in that part of the world as well as in this they rob even on stanemoreroad and in riding over the great moor that lies between brugh and appleby there is a little alehouse to be seen at a good distance on the right hand at the entrance of a wood at the bottom of a range of vast fells where highwaymen sometimes resort i was pursued by two of them not long ago and to the excellence of my horse owed the saving of my purse and perhaps my life they were well mounted but i kept an hundred yards ahead of them for several miles while as fast as they could stretch away they chased me till near the town of brugh i was all alone my fellow having received a mischief and being obliged to stay a day behind and the rogues did swear and hoot most horribly and fired three shots at me but my horse was as good as ever spanked it along and i cut him up and pricked him over the turf like the wind away  i say then as it is not safe traveling with all the money necessary for such a long journey the best way is when cash runs low to lie by to rest for a week and put your notes in order in some town and by one of the dealers or manufacturers of the place draw on your friend or goldsmith in london for what you want and by the return of the post you will be paid the money where you are in this manner i did when i was at richmond last in the north riding of yorkshire being in want of money i asked a gentleman with whom i chanced to dine how i could supply myself with  0 l by draft on one in the capital and he directed me to his neighbor who let me have what i had occasion for at moderate exchange as soon as he heard from his friend in london i might have had any money i named in this way and so in other places of trade  i hope reader you will excuse this little digression because it is meant well and for the same reason i imagine you will pardon me for advising you in the next place should the fates ever bring you to catarractonium in order to proceed to the northern extremity of our country to go   miles out of your way to see richmond town before you set out for gretabridge to joseph marshalls the best house of the two inns there the delightful romantic situation of richmond and the fine curiosities about the town will afford you an agreeable entertainment for a couple of days and if you like going at night to a club of very worthy sensible men of this town who are very civil to strangers you may pass the evening in a very pleasing way or if you have a taste for dancing and prefer the conversation of a fine girl to a pipe and more serious discourse there is a small polite assembly of as pretty women as ever gladdened the heart of man my method while there was to smoke one night with the club and the next i devoted to the ladies we made up ten couple and had the hempdressers one night which is you know if you are a dancing reader the most difficult and laborious of all the country dances and no where have i seen the ground more actively beat or in juster measure life and truth and charms were in perfection in those richmond girls i was there in       and    and the sensible club and bright assembly were still in being but no more than three did i see of men or women in    that was there in    and in    they were all strangers to me some were married away some had removed and others were translated to the shades of eternity this was to me a moral lesson when i looked round the assembly room the last time i was there and found every glorious girl of my acquaintance was gone and that years had rendered me almost unfit to join with the ladies then present in the dancings of the night a philosophical sadness came powerfully upon my mind and i could not help sighing in the midst of harmony and a blaze of charms this life i saw was a fleeting scene indeed  and now reader as to stanemorecountry if it should ever come into your head to wander over this wild and romantic part of our world at the hazard of your neck and the danger of being starved your route is when you have passed the turnpike on stanemore in your way to brugh to turn off to the right beyond the publichouse and ascend a fine rising valley you will see between two mountains till you come to the top of the first hills then proceed if you can in the course i have described and wherever it is in your power tend to the north east for that is the way out this is one way into the heart of stanemore in richmondshire and will bring you by the way among the dreadful northern fells of westmorland a frightful country and a fatiguing march  another way to the stanemore alps is behind jack railtons the quakers house at bows hire a guide from him and his man will bring you as he did me once through a very surprising way of deep bottoms to a public house at eggleston on the border of richmondstanemore there rest that night and early the next morning proceed due north when you can with another guide and you will come to mountains upon mountains rapid rivers and headlong torrents that form amazing and tremendous scenes or as this way is neither comfortable nor very safe it is a better road to the confines or beginning of stanemore to ride from gretabridge to bernard castle and from bernard castle to eggleston about    miles as i judge for it is not measured and then set out for the mountains from eggleston as before directed  i have been told there is another way into stanemore through bishopric but as i am a stranger to it i can only say what i have heard that it is worse than the bottoms i went through from the quakers house this is enough reader to show you how to get into stanemore if you have the curiosity and heart to visit that very wild and wonderful land        july         we depart from burcothamlet and arrive at a burning valley the   th of june      i took my leave of mrs burcot and mrs fletcher for so they would be called as they informed me after i had once used the word miss and from this fine place proceeded on my journey by a paper of written directions had received from them as there was a pretty good though a long and tedious way out of the mountains if a traveller knew the passes and turnings but otherwise it was either impossible to go on or a man must journey at the hazard of his life a thousand times a day in crossing waters and precipices  our first labor was to ascend a very narrow steep way in the side of a mountain which went up due north for a full mile and brought us to another large standing black and unfathomable water on the top of this high hill there was no appearance of any feeders to supply this frightful lake and therefore and on account of its blackness the surface must communicate with the abyss from this water we rid due east for half an hour and then descended to a sandy valley where flames were rising from the ground the fire came up without noise smoke or smell and appeared to me very wonderful but such things are common in many parts of the world in the side of one of the apennines i have seen a large blazing vale the learned tell us this is owing to rich veins of bitumen which crops in such places and the heat of the air between the hills in shallow valleys causes it to burn this crop of bitumen and accension by the agitation of a hot air is well fancied i own but it does not give me full satisfaction i think of this and many other natural things as mr moyle does of the aurora borealis  that these uncommon appearances should be looked on with wonder and admiration and raise in us a due reverence of their great author who has shown his almighty power and wisdom in forming such an infinite variety of productions in all parts of the universe philosophy undertakes to account for every thing i am sure it is in many cases mistaken     an account of a waterfall at stanemore having passed the burning valley we rid over a river that was up to the horses bellies very rapid and a bad bottom and then proceeded along a steep hill side the course n w till we came to a rich low land that was covered with flowers and aromatic shrubs and adorned with several clumps of oak chestnut and white walnut trees this plain is about twenty five acres surrounded with stony mountains some of which are very high and steep and from the top of one of the lowest of them a cataract descends like the fall of the river niagara in canada or new france in north america swifter than an arrow from a bow the rapid water comes headlong down in a fall of   0 feet which is   feet more than the descent of niagara the river here to be sure is not half so large as that which comes from the vast lakes of canada but it is a great and prodigious cadence of water and tumbles perpendicular in as surprising a manner from as horrible a precipice and in this very nearly resembles the niagarafall that as you stand below as near the fall as it is safe to go you see the river come down a sloping mountain for a great way as if it descended from the clouds it is a grand and amazing scene the water issues from a great lake on the top of a mountain that i found very hard to ascend and the lake has many visible feeders from hills upon hills above it which it is impossible to climb   0 july         a dinner by a cataract and a wonderful fall of o fin the boy it was    oclock by the time we arrived at this waterfall and therefore i sat down by the side of it to dine before i attempted to get up to the top of the precipice and see from whence this water came while my eyes were entertained with the descending scene i feasted on a piece of venison pasty and some fine ale which among other provisions mrs burcot had ordered her servants to put up for me but as i was thus happily engaged my lad o fin had climbed up to the top of the waterfall and was going to land from a tree that grew out of the rocky mountain near the summit of the hill when his foot slipped and he came tumbling down in a miserable way i expected him in pieces on the ground as i had him full in my view there seemed no possibility of an escape and yet he received no harm in the middle of the descent he stuck in another projecting thick tree and from it came safely down this was a deliverance providence often saves us in a wonderful manner till the work appointed to be finished is done or the limited time of our trial over in relation to such escapes i could give myself as an instance many a time and will here mention one extraordinary case     a great deliverance as i traveled once in the county of kerry in ireland with the white knight and the knight of the glin such knights were honorable creations made by the irish kings we have an account of them in the psalter of tarah before the reigns of conaire the great a m    0 ante christum    cormac ulfadda a d   0 and the glorious brien boiromhe a d  0   the three greatest monarchs that ever ireland had fitzgerald the first knight of glin was so made by the immortal brien boiroimhe who fell in the bloody fight a d      that was sought by him with maolmorda king of lcimsier who joined with the danes the king of ireland and the king of leinster slew each other and with brien boiroimhe set the glory of ireland the states from this time began to decay and roderick o connor who came to the crown a d   0  was the last king of ireland our henry the second got the kingdom a d      by two means one of which was a grant the pope made of it to him who was allowed by the natives to be supreme lord of the island in temporals and the nobility had by commission resigned it to him after the death of brien boiroimhe  the other mean and what effectually did the work was the king of leinsters joining with strangwell who was at the head of the english forces and had married that kings daughter an old chronicle says she was the most beautiful woman upon earth of her time and very learned but inferior nevertheless in beauty and learning to the six princesses we read of in the psalter of tarah who were fair beyond all mortals that ever lived and wonderful in the extent of their knowledge to wit the princess mac diarmuid the princess mac reagien the princess mac faolain the princess mac kennedy the princess o heyn the princess o flaherty these six were druidesses says the psalter of tarah  by the way reader let me tell you that from this same psalter of tarah i writ out one of the finest and most improving love stories that ever i read it is called the adventure of teriagh mac shain and the beautiful gara o mulduin which happened in the reign of cormac ulfada king of ireland in the year of salvation     that faon maccumhail commonly called fian maccul the mighty champion beat the picts and brought off among other prisoners the beautiful ciarnuit daughter to the king of the picts whom cormac ulfada took for his concubine this story is likewise more shortly told in the red book of mac eogane a very valuable old irish manuscript and from both those books i will give my reader the best part of this adventure as soon as i can see a proper place to bring it in    we called at terelah o crohanes an old irish gentleman our common friend who kept up the hospitality of his ancestors and showed how they lived when cormac mac cuillenan the generous from whose house he descended was king of munster and archbishop of cashel in the year     this cormac cuillenan writ the famous psalter of cashel a very extraordinary and valuable book which he composed from ancient poems of the bards who thus writ their history and from venerable records as this king and prelate declares in his will the clause is this  my psalter which preserves the ancient records and monuments of my native country which are transcribed with great fidelity i leave to ronal cashel to be preserved to aftertimes and ages yet to come  there is another remarkable clause in this great mans will to wit  my soul for mercy i commit to heaven my body leave to dust and rottenness there is not a word of any saint in it and of consequence there was no saintworship then in ireland  cormac writ his will the day before he fought the bloody battle of maghailbe with the king of leinster and therein fell it begins in this manner  summoned away by death which i perceive approaches for by prophetic skill i find that short will be my life and reign i solemnly appoint that my affairs shall thus be settled after i am dead and thus i constitute my latest will my royal robe embroidered over with gold and sparkling with the rays of costly jewels well suited to a state of majesty i do bequeath etc  my coat of mail of bright and polished steel will well become the martial king of ulster to whom i give it and my golden chain shall the most pious muchuda enjoy as a reward etc  my golden vestment for most sacred use and my royal wardrobe i hereby give to etc    now from this antique piece verbally translated i think it is evident that the kings of the four provinces of ireland were not such poor and ignorant chiefs as they are generally imagined to be and of consequence that one of the four to whom the other three did homage and who was therefore called the king of ireland was always a potent prince and could do great matters when they were all united this consideration i fansy and the address let me add of anselm archbishop of canterbury and of lanfranc archbishop of the same see to mortogh o brien king of ireland and terlah o brien king of ireland moriardacho glorioso and teraeluacho magnifico to the most magnificent terlagh o brien king of ireland our benediction etc as you may read them at large in ushers primordia these letters were written by the english archbishops to the irish kings turlogh and murtogh in the years  0   and    0  ought to give some credit to o fluhertys ogygia keatings history and mac curtius annals which those writers really took from very ancient records and principally from the very valuable manuscripts called the psalters of cashel and tarah  what the psalter of cashel was i have told you reader and as to the psalter of tarah the history of it is this  on a tract of land called tarah that was taken from the province of leimster and added to the county of mead stood the largest of the four vast palaces of the kings of ireland and at that grand fabric there was a triennial meeting of the states of the kingdom called the royal assembly of tarah there they enacted laws examined the ancient chronicles and records and purged them from all false and spurious relations settled genealogies and considered noble exploits all the things that received the assemblys approbation were registered and transcribed into the royal records and they called this journal the psalter of tarah   there was no end of eating and drinking there and the famous down falvey played on the harp for a day and a night we sat to it by candlelight without shirts or clothes on naked excepting that we had our breeches and shoes and stockings on and i drank so much burgundy in that time that the sweat ran of a red color down my body and my senses were so disordered that when we agreed to ride out for a couple of hours to take a little air i leaped my horse into a dreadful quarry and in the descent was thrown into a large deep water that was in a part of the frightful bottom and by that means saved my life when i came above water i swam very easily out of the pit and walked up the low side of the quarry as sober as if i had not drank a glass this is a fact whatever the critics may say of the thing all i can say to it is my hour was not come          june    the journey continued having dined and shot a bustard that weighed forty pounds i went on again the course northwest for half a mile and then to my astonishment it trended to the south for more than an hour which was going back again but at last it turned about and for half an hour we went to the northwest again and then due east for a long time till we came to hills upon hills that were very difficult to pass we were obliged to alight at many of them and walk them up and down which was a delay of many hours but we did it at last and came into a large sandy opening that had a number of rapid streams breaking over it that fell from the mountains and with the forest on the surrounding hills formed a very wild and pleasing scene over this we went for half a mile and then came to a long glin so very deep and narrow that it was quite night when we got to the bottom of it though the sun was not yet down and it brought to my remembrance anchisess son the wandering prince of troy when he descended to the shades below it had the appearance indeed of some such pass and was a frightful way as hills like caucasus and atlas were close on either hand of us and a river roared through the bottom of the steep descent which we were obliged to walk down on foot this could not be the right road i was certain azora and antonia could never pass this deep and rapid flood it was too much for any man to venture into without knowing where the torrent went or how the channel of the river was formed  up then i came again to the day and resolved to pass the night at the foot of one of the woody hills on the margin of the streams that sounded sweetly over the shoars but how to proceed the next morning i knew not as my paper of directions did not mention the dark steep descent we had been down but a little valley that lay due east through which we were to go no such vale could we see and of consequence in some turning of the road we had gone wrong  when i came among the trees on the side of one of the mountains i began to look for some convenient resting place while my two boys were picking the bustard and preparing a fire to roast it for supper and wandered a good way till i saw a pretty hermitage in an open plain like a ring and going up to it found the skeleton of a man he lay on a couch in an inward room without any covering and the bones were as clean and white as if they had come from the surgeons hands the pismires to be sure had eaten off the flesh who the man was a paper lying on the table in a strong box informed me it was called the case of john orton   0 the case of john orton i was twenty years old when charles the second was restored and being master of large fortunes and educated in an aversion to puritans and republican principles went into all the licentiousness and impieties which overspread and corrupted this nation when that profligate prince ascended the throne i drank up to the excess of the times i debauched every woman i could get within my power by gold treachery or force maid wife and widow i murdered several men in duels and blasphemed the god of heaven continually the devil was my first and last toast and in a club i belonged to i proceeded to such scarce credible wickedness as to perform the part of the priest in our infernal sodality and after using the words of consecration over the elements gave the profane bread and wine in the most horrible manner i was the most abominable of mortals contrary to all the dictates and principles of wisdom virtue and honor i acted bound myself in bondage to satan and lived the most execrable slave to the vilest inclinations and most heinous habits scratch was the name i had for the evil one and upon all occasions i invoked him the last words i said every night after lying down were  scratch tuck me in  in this diabolical manner did i pass my life away till i was forty and in twenty years time committed every evil that can dishonor human manners and infest society i was a disgrace to my species and unworthy of the name of man  but as i went on in this manner and gloried only in outdoing the greatest scelerates in impiety and debauchery  in being the chief instrument of satan and striving to bring every soul i got acquainted with in subjection to the flesh and the devil maliciously committing all manner of sin and with greediness executing the suggestions of a defiled imagination and the purposes of the most corrupt heart i was struck one night with the most excruciating torments of body and had at the same time such unspeakable horrors upon my mind that i believe my condition resembled the state of the damned the tortures all over my frame were beyond the pains any rack could cause but were less afflicting than the panick fear that harrowed my soul under a lively sense of eternal vengeance for the crying enormities and impurities of my life all my crimson crimes were held as in a mirror before me the most diabolical impieties against heaven and the most shocking cruelties to men the numbers i had drank to death and secured in the service of hell the men i had sent to the other world by combat at pistol and sword and the women i had ruined not only in this life but perhaps for evermore the miseries i had brought upon families and the manifold afflictions i had been the author of for years after years by night and by day  all these offenses i saw like the handwriting on the wall and in a horror and consternation of mind that words cannot describe lay a miserable spectacle for two nights and two days tormented perplexed and confounded i rolled from side to side and condemned myself and my folly in the most doleful complaints but dared not look up to a just judge and offended god no slumber for this time did approach my eyes but in agonies i shook with a frightful violence and thought every moment that the demons my fancy had in view were going to force my miserable soul away to everlasting inflictions in the most dismal cavern of hell spent however at last i fell into a short sleep i had half an hours rest and in that slumber imagined i heard a small voice say  as i live says the lord i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel rent your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repents him of the evil  upon this i awaked and found my pains were gone to heaven i lift my eyes and as the tears poured down my face cried out to god for mercy o god be merciful to me a sinner have mercy on me dust and sin the vilest of all sinful creatures to me belongs nothing but shame and confusion of face eternally my portion should in justice be the lake of everlasting fire and brimstone but o lord god most mighty o holy and most merciful father to thee belongs infinite goodness and forgiveness o remember not my sins and transgressions  my great and numberless provocations and my trespasses that are grown up even unto heaven have mercy upon me o god after thy great goodness and according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offenses i have a hearty sense and detestation of all my abominations and with a true contrition of heart i repent of all my iniquities wash me then i beseech thee o father of mercies wash my polluted soul in the blood of the holy jesus and forgive me all my sins as i offer up a troubled spirit and a broken and contrite heart which thou have promised not to despise  and grant o lord god my father that i may from this hour by the guidance and direction of thy sanctifying spirit bid a final adieu to all ungodliness and iniquity and consecrate myself entirely to thee to serve thee with humility love and devotion and for the remainder of my life give thee the sacrifices of righteousness through jesus christ our lord  when i had thus implored the mercy of the almighty in a torrent of tears with strong cryings i found my heart quite easy and my mind so filled with delights and comforts that i cannot describe the strange happiness of my condition but how to secure this felicity was the question i was afraid of the world and trembled when i thought of its temptations beside the great wickedness of my past life made it necessary that i should live in an extraordinary state of penitence and by great mortification and piety make what amends i could for sinning against heaven in the most atrocious manner and wilfully for a long series of years breaking every law of the just and holy governor of the world a change of mind and common piety were not enough for such a wretch as i had been i was unworthy of the innocent comforts of life i ought to breathe in sighs and speak in groans i resolved then to be a reform indeed and in this part of stanemore mountains which i was well acquainted with spend the remainder of my days in the labors of a penitential piety  as i had no relations living i sold what estates i had left and gave almost the whole money among the poor with the little i kept i bought what necessary things i should want in my solitude and with tools and seeds some clothes and linen a few books and other little matters retired to this spot in the year      i had some working men from the next village to build me the little hut i live in to sow my garden with every vegetable and put some fruit trees in the ground to cut me a pile of firing from the woody hills and make my place as convenient as my intended life could require all this was soon done and then i was left alone in the possession of every thing i had a wish for in this world it is now twenty years since my arrival here and in all the time i have not had one sick or dismal hour my garden and my cottage employ me in agreeable labors to furnish my table with roots and fruits which is what i mostly live on having nothing more but goats milk and now and then a seabiscuit my drink being water and sometimes a cup of mead of my own making  when i am weary of working i sit down to study my bible and in that most perfect treasure of saving knowledge i find such joys and satisfactions as make my life a scene of heavenly happiness and charm me into raptures the nearer i approach to the hour of my dissolution that will be a blessed hour by the amazing mercy of god vouchsafed through the lord jesus my crimson sins are pardoned and when the voice of the son of god the thunder of the dreadful trumpet will awake all the dead i shall have my part in the first resurrection and ascend with the blessed to the eternal mansions of the sky  adored be thy goodness most glorious eternal inestimable is thy love in the redemption of sinners by the gospel and the sacrifice of the holy jesus  fellow mortal whoever thou art into whose hands this paper comes take my advice and remember thy latter end if like me thou have been betrayed by the demons into great impieties and presumptuous sins an have been persuaded to abdicate heaven and its eternal hopes in exchange for illicit gratifications of every kind and the pleasures of this world then like me repent and in tears and mortification implore the mercy of heaven turn to the everlasting father of mercies and the god of all comforts after his own manner with humility sorrow and resolutions of amendment and in the name of the lord jesus christ implore his compassion and forgiveness and he will repent and turn unto thee he will wash you in the blood of jesus and make you whiter than snow when he sees the sinner a great way off in tears fasting and prayer he will run unto him and fall upon his neck and kiss him you will become the beloved of the father and be reinstated in the favor of the greatest and most glorious of immortal beings he will bless you here with that peace that passes all understanding he will bless you for ever hereafter with glory and honor in the kingdom he has prepared for the benevolent the pure and the honest but if you continue to offend your creator and violate the laws of the god of heaven then will you live exposed to judgments in this world and most certainly will depart in confusion and misery the demons you obeyed will gather round the pale the guilty the affrighted ghost of you eager to involve your wretched spirit in their own horrors and will drag it to their dismal regions and when all the monuments of human power wealth and pride shall be overthrown the earth itself be in a blaze and the sea turned into vapors at the descent of the son of god to judge the vast congregation of the sons of men the amazing assembly of mortals unheard of generations raised from the grave to have all their actions tried every condition everlastingly determined then will you be placed in that division which will call upon the rocks to hide them and the hills to cover them from the face of the judge but in vain attempt to secret themselves from an infinite eye and an almighty power then will the terrors of the gospel stand in full force against thee and in the dreadful sentence pronounced against the guilty you must share  depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire o dreadful doom what a tremendous day to sinners and to see the righteous acquitted and before your eyes ascend in triumph and splendour into the mansions of glory to live the happy favorites of god and christ for neverending ages while you are driven forward to the infernal prison and shut up in the habitations of eternal darkness and torments  the very thought of it if you will think seriously of it is enough to curdle the blood and wither in a moment every unlawful joy that sin can produce in bloom and glory the despair the sighs the groans the doleful shrieks when the wicked are driven off to the regions of blackness and darkness for ever are inexpressible think then think in time my fellow mortal and profit by the blood of a savior study his gospel hear his ministers regard the alarms of conscience and submit to the influence of the holy spirit  and if your are not that monster of iniquity i once was before i obtained the divine mercy by a timely and severe repentance yet as in heaven so in hell there are many mansions and if you do not work out your salvation according to the terms of the gospel and make every law of christ the rules of your behavior  if you do not act continually as related to god to each other and to another world and seek first the kingdom of god and the righteousness thereof you will utterly disqualify yourself for the rewards and happiness of heaven though your conduct may be far from meriting the most dreadful inflictions in another world the gains of unrighteousness or meddling with any forbidden fruit is a violation of the laws of god that must ruin you for ever though the punishment for so doing cannot be equal to the torments prepared for the tyrant and oppressor the murderer the adulterer the drunkard and offenders in the highest crimes we must cease to do evil and learn to do well in order to be saved not according to promises and prayers at last not according to legacies to be paid to the poor when we are dead shall we be judged but as we have rectified the judgment and the will made virtue the governor of the heart and in all things sought gods glory not our own this do and you will live  john orton may     0     a reflection on the bones of john orton this extraordinary paper surprised me very greatly and when from reading it i turned my eyes to the bones of john orton i could not help breaking out in the following reflection  and is this the once lively gallant drinking jack orton who thought for forty years that he was made for no higher end than to gratify every appetite and pass away time in a continual circle of vanity and pleasure poor skeleton what a miserable spectacle art thou not the least remain of activity and joy of that sprightliness and levity of mind that jocund humor and frolic which rendered thee the delight of the wild societies of thy youthful time grim stiff and horrid is the appearance now vain mirth and luxury licentious plays and sports can have no connection with these dry bones  o death what a change do thou make the bulk of mankind are averse to serious thought and hearken to the passions more than to the dictates of reason and religion to kill time and banish reflection they indulge in a round of dissipations and revel in the freedom of vicious excesses their attention is engrossed by spectacle and entertainments and fixed to follies and trifles giddy and unthinking loose and voluptuous they spend their precious hours in the gay scenes of diversions pomp and luxury and as if the grave and a judgment to come were a romance of former times or things from which they are secured never think of these important and momentous subjects with minds bewitched by exorbitant pleasure and faculties enervated and broken by idle mirth and vanity they pass their every day away without any of that consideration which becomes reasonable beings and creatures designed for a state of immortality bu at last you appear and in a moment turn delight and admiration into aversion and horror strength wealth and charms you instantly reduce to weakness poverty and deformity in the first place and then to a skeleton like the bones before me  nor is this the worst of the great revolution when death approaches the amusements of sense immediately fail and past transactions in every circumstance of aggravation crowd into the mind conscience reproaches loudly the heart condemns and the sick tremble at the apprehensions of a vengeance they laughed at in the days of diversion and the midnight hours of the ball as they come near the black valley they see the realities of a future state and agonies convulse their souls terrors till then unknown enter their breasts and in anxieties that are incapable of being uttered and expectations the most torturing on a review of life they pass from the plains of time into the ocean of eternity here lies the frame like the dry bones before me but the soul is gone to the sessions of righteousness and perhaps the dreadful sentence of the divine justice is pronounced on it this is a tremendous affair that calls for timely and serious consideration eternity eternal misery they that have done evil to come forth unto the resurrection of damnation  i will take thy advice then thou glorious penitent john orton and since it is in my power to come forth unto the resurrection of life and obtain immortality honor and glory with the righteous in the kingdom of their father i will open the reforming gospel night and morning and by its heavenly directions regulate my conduct i am determined to make a wise and serious preparation for death and judgment to the best of my power i will provide for that day when the prayers and charities of the righteous will be brought forth as their memorials before the tribunal of jesus christ  this  this is the thing to be minded the brightest scenes of worldly prosperity and grandeur are contemptible when they do not accord with virtue and piety death in a few years blends the prince and the meanest subject the conqueror and the slave the statesman the warrior and the most insignificant in one promiscuous ruin and the schemes the competitions and the interests which have engaged the chief attention of the world are brought to nothing and appear too often ridiculous but righteousness is unchangeably glorious and in the universal ruin receives no detriment when all human power and policy will be extinct concealed piety and persecuted virtue will again appear and be owned as his by the lord of hosts in that day when he makes up his jewels  i will love thee therefore o lord my strength yea i will love thee and it ever shall be my hearts desire that my soul may behold by faith in its self as in a glass the glory of the lord able and ready to change it into the same image from glory to glory reflected upon and conveyed to it by the spirit of the lord may my portion here be this blessed transforming union that i may be made partaker of the divine nature by impressions from it the expression  partaker of the divine nature by impressions from it may perhaps be thought by some readers to approach to vision and to contradict my own opinion before delivered in relation to this subject let me observe then that by impression i here mean no more than bright beams of light cast upon the soul by the present deity as he sits all power all knowledge in the heart and dispenses such rays of wisdom to the pious petitioner as are sufficient to procure a lasting sense of spiritual heavenly things god is not only in heaven he dwells indeed in the heaven of heavens after the most glorious manner as the high and lofty one and by some splendid appearance manifests a presence to the senses of the blessed spirits as to the expression just now used to wit that this infinite spirit manifests himself to the senses of his blessed subjects  it may be asked how this can be  can the eye behold what is infinite and invisible  the answer is this that although gods essence be invisible yet there is a glory the train and attendance of his essence which exhibits a bodily and sensible vision of god he decketh himself with light as with a garment this is the dwelling of his essence he dwells in light that is unapproachable  we must distinguish then between the essential and the majestatic presence of god the majcstatic presence is the discovery of his essential presence in a determinate place by a magnificent luminous appearance and this the apostle calls the excellent glory  megaloprepous doxes this glory appeared on mount sinai six days together it rested and dwelt in the sanctuary it filled the house moses saw its back parts that is a small measure and scantling of it in proportion to the weakness of his mortal eyes but in the other world when mortals shall have put on immortality and our bodies shall be invested with the new powers of spirituality and incorruption then face to face we shall be able to see the whole luster of divine majesty as familiarly as one man beholds the face of another as grateful objects of sense make up a great part of human delectation may we not suppose that this glory of god accommodated to our senses will produce a more ravishing and transcendent delight than all the objects in nature are capable of producing     there are two ways then as an excellent one observes of seeing god to wit by intelligence and in some manner by sense but we must not imagine that these two make up the beatific vision there is a cause of more importance to beatitude the sight and contemplation of the divine glories is our act but the act of god is the communication of them this makes the saints perfectly blessed by the communication of the divine glories we come to be not bare spectators but theias koinonoi phuseos partakers of the divine nature  as we are more obliged says the writer i have mentioned to the sun who is the cheer and vigor of nature and the very life of all animal and vegetable beings for his influences than for his sight  so are the heavenly inhabitants much more obliged to god for their receptions from him as the sountain of life and wisdom than for the sight and contemplation of him as the subject of perfection this illustrates the matter and we may say there is a third way of seeing god to wit in the enjoyment of him the beamings of his favor and the effusions of his love passing through the whole man and producing an intimate sensation of him both in body and soul and filling both with an unconceivable and endless delectation this is seeing god as he is    but as he is an infinite spirit diffused through all things filling as well as containing them seeing and knowing all even the most secret things for his eyes to speak after a popular manner are ten thousand times brighter than the sun beholding all the ways of men and considering the most secret paths knowing all things ere ever they were created and looking upon all things after they were perfected it follows that since nothing can exclude the presence of this infinite spirit then in him we live move and have our being he is not far from any of us but although he is above all yet he is through all and in us all within us as well as without us and therefore in the hearts of the faithful he must be considered as an immense intellectual pure light ready to enlighten and enliven them and to shed forth the bright beams of his love upon them i imagine this illustrates the thing to me it seems reason   i shall then have all i wish and all i want with a settled indifference i shall then look upon the highest advantages of this world i shall have nothing to hope or to fear the will of god will be to me unmixed felicity     a meditation in a closet such was the soliloquy i spoke as i gazed on the skeleton of john orton and just as i had ended the boys brought in the wild turkey which they had very ingeniously roasted and with some of mrs burcots fine ale and bread i had an excellent supper the bones of the penitent orton i removed to a hole i had ordered my lad to dig for them the skull excepted which i kept and still keep on my table for a memento mori and that i may never forget the good lesson which the percipient who once resided in it had given it is often the subject of my meditation when i am alone of an evening in my closet which is often my case i have the skull of john orton before me and as i smoke a philosophic pipe with my eyes fastened on it i learn more from the solemn object than i could from the most philosophical and labored speculations what a wild and hot head once how cold and still now poor skull i say and what was the end of all thy daring frolics and gambols  thy licentiousness and impiety  a severe and bitter repentance in piety and goodness john orton found at last that happiness the world could not give him there is no real felicity for man but in reforming all his errors and vices and entering upon a strict and constant course of virtue this only makes life comfortable renders death serene and peaceful and secures eternal joy and blessedness hereafter such are the lessons i extract from the skull of john orton     an inventory of the goods of john orton when i had supped i went about to see what things mr orton had left behind him in his little cottage and i found a field bedstead large enough for two with a mattrass silk blankets quilt and cotton curtains two oak stools and a strong square table of the same wood an oak settee on which his bones lay a silver lamp to burn oil in a tinderbox and matches a case of razors six handsome knives and forks in a case half a dozen china plates two china dishes and two pint mugs of the same ware half a dozen drinkingglasses a large copper kettle a brass skillet two silver spoons and a silver ladle in a chest were clothes and linen shoes and stockings and various useful matters there were pens ink and paper in a writingdesk and half a score guineas and on a shelf over it a dozen good books three of which were a large english bible thomas a kempis and sir walter raleighs history of the world under the shelf hung a plain gold watch and a large ring sundial in a dark closet i found a box of seabiskets many flasks of oil for eating and jars of it for the lamp honey salt and vinegar four dozen of quart bottles of mead and two stone bottles that held three gallons each full of brandy this i suppose was against the days of weakness or sickness he had not used a pint of this liquor  having found these things within doors i proceeded from the house to the garden which lay at a small distance from the little thatched mansion and contained about four acres it had been very beautifully laid out and filled with the best fruit trees and all the vegetables but it was run to ruin and high weeds and showed that its owner had been long dead i suppose he died soon after the date of his paper for i observed that many prior dates had been struck out and had he lived after the year   0  he would in all probability have razed that likewise and set down   0  some sudden sickness must have seized him and perhaps when he found himself sinking he laid himself out naked on the wooden couch where i found his skeleton i can no otherwise account for his having no kind of covering over him as to his bones being so clean that to be sure was performed by the ants i took notice of many nests here of the larger ants in holes under the roots of great trees  that the pismires are the best preparers of a skeleton is not only certain from the account the missionaries give of the coming on of the ants in pegu when in one nights time the vast swarms of them that approach reduce every human creature they can fasten on to clean bones which makes the people set fire to their habitations when they have notice given them by a kind of small monkey they keep for the purpose of the motion of this terrible enemy but it is plain from what i have often experimented  when i want to make a skeleton of any small animal i put the dead creature in a box with holes in it among the ants in their habitations or nests or in such parts of the house as a whole tribe will often march to through several rooms in one track or certain road to eat sugar or sweatmeats they have discovered and then in two or three days they will perform what the finest knife cannot execute the big ants which are larger than a common house fly and are seldom less than six thousand in a nest will clear the bones of a rat in half a nights time  there was a pretty little wooden summer house in the center of the garden and in it had been in pots some curious plants and flowers here were various tools and many instruments of gardening it appeared from them and the great variety of things in the ground that mr orton must have used himself to hard labor and found great pleasure in his improvements and productions there was a deal of art and ingenuity to be traced in the wild wilderness the garden was grown into it was plain from a book called the carthusian gardener which lay on a table in the summer house that he had made that business his study round this summer house were the remains of many hives on benches but the bees were all gone and the stock ruined     a scheme all these things and the place set me a thinking and soon suggested to my fancy that in my condition i could not do better than succeed mr orton on the premises but without turning hermit here is i said a pretty small thatched mansion that might easily be enlarged if more rooms were wanting and a garden which labor would soon restore to its usefulness and beauty and make it produce the best vegetables in plenty here is fish in the waters fowl of every kind and deer on the mountains here are goats in great herds for milk for kids and when cut for excellent venison here is the finest water and by getting bees as mr orton had mead may be made that will be equal to the best foreign wine as to the situation it is most delightful nothing can be more charming than these shores and breaking waters the rocky precipices and the woody hills which surround this little region what then should hinder but that i here sit down and put an end to my adventures as the few things that are wanting may be had at the next town and a stock for years be in a few days secured the man i am looking for may never be found and if i should meet with him his circumstances and temper may be changed then as to the world i know not how to deal in any kind of business and to live on the small fortune in my possession must reduce me to poverty very soon here then it is good for me to reside and make myself as happy as i can if it be not in my power to be as happy as i would i have two lads with me who are active useful young men willing to work and pleased to stay wherever i am and if i can commence a matrimonial relation with some sensible goodhumoured dear delightful girl of the mountains and persuade her to be the cheerful partner of my still life nature and reason will create the highest scenes of felicity and we shall live as it were in the suburbs of heaven my lads too may pick up among the hills upon scripture principles two bouncing females and a state will in a little time be formed this is fine for once in my life i am fortunate and suppose this partner i want in my solitude could be miss melmoth one of the wisest and most discreet of women a thinking bloom and good humor itself in a human figure then indeed i must be happy in this silent romantic station this spot of earth would then have all the felicities  resolved conclusum est contra manicheos said the great st austin and with a thump of his fist he cracked the table     a fine rural scene thus was my head employed while i smoaked a pipe after supper and i determined to return to ortons mansion after i had found a way out of stanemore but the previous question was how i should get out of the place i was in without going back as there appeared no passage onwards i tried every angle the next morning to no purpose and in vain attempted some hills that were too steep for the horses down then again i went to the bottom of the black and narrow glin aforementioned and with lights observed the rumbling deep river it appeared more frightful than the first time i saw it and there was no venturing into it this troubled me not a little as the water was not above eight yards broad and there was an ascending glin on the other side of it that appeared to rise into a fine woody country it was not half the length of that we had descended nor near so steep it began to widen at the distance of a hundred yards from the water so as to show at the summit a fine plain encompassed with a sweep of forest we could see the sun shining there the view in contrast was quite charming  for some time i stood in this perplexed condition by the waterside and could not tell what to do when one of the lads came running to me to let me know that as he carefully examined the sides of the glin we came down he discovered to the left about fourscore yards above the river a pass wide enough for one horse to go through and he believed it was a way out this was reviving news and upon going into it i found that it went straight on among the mountains like a rent or open crack for three hundred yards and then turned to the left for about fifty more when it winded a little and began to extend wider and wider every yard till it brought us by several turnings to the beginning of a fine valley where we again found the river we had seen in the bottom of the deep glin and perceived that it ended in a great water and went off in some subterranean way the mountains were almost close to this fine water on either hand for near half a mile and made a delightful rural scene we could see the river as we looked up it come tumbling on for a great way between the steep rocky precipices and the broad bright lake it formed between vast frowning mountains with wood and lawns in it at the end of the vale were altogether a view most charming this made me more highly value ortonlodge     a description of an extraordinary cave in stanemore there is a cave there likewise that adds great beauty to the place and in charms and wonders exceeds the grot of tunis a few miles east of carthage directly under capebonn formerly called the promontory of mercury where aeneas sheltered after the storm dr shaw in his travels shows that the cave near cape bonn was the grot which virgil describes in the following manner  defessi aeneadae quae proxima litora cursu contendunt petere et lybiae vertuntur ad oras est in secessu longo locus insula portum efficit objectu laterum quibus omnis ab alto frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductos hinc atque hinc vastae rupes geminique minantur in coelum scopuli quorum sub vertice late aequora tuta silent tum sylvis scena coruscis desuper horrentique atrum nemus imminet umbra front sub adversa scopulis pendentibus antrum intus aquae dulces vivoque sedilia saxo nympharum domos  the weary trojans ply their shattered oars to nearest land and make the lybian shores the trojans wearied with the storms explore the nearest land and reach the lybian shore within a long recess there lies a bay an island shades it from the rolling sea and forms a port secure for ships to ride broke by the jutting land on either side in double streams the briny waters glide far in a deep recess her jutting sides an isle projects to break the rolling tides and forms a port where curling from the sea the waves steal back and wind into a bay betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene appears above and groves for ever green on either side sublime in air arise two towering rocks whose summits brave the skies low at their feet the sleeping ocean lies crowned with a gloomy shade of waving woods their awful brows hang nodding over the floods a grot is formed beneath with mossy seats to rest the nereids and exclude the heats down through the crannies of the living walls the crystal streams descend in murmuring falls opposed to these a secret grotto stands the haunt of nereids framed by natures hands where polished seats appear of living stone and limpid rills that tinkle as they run there lies a harbor far within the land commodious formed by an opposing isle which breaking as a mound the furious waves they run divided calmer then unite on each side rocks and two with steepy height aspiring touch the clouds safe at whose feet the waters far and near pacific sleep distant from these a sylvan scene beyond to bound the prospect woods with horrent shade opening to view beneath the hanging rocks a cave within a fountain pure and seats formed from the living stone the cool recess of nymphs    this grot within a mountain overshaded with trees and lying open to the sea with a cliff on each side and not far from carthage answers so well to the nympharum domus of virgil the kingdom of tunis in the west of barbary in asric was once the celebrated republic of carthage the city of carthage was about   miles from the spot the city of tunis now stands on many ruins of it are still remaining this glorious city that was    miles round and built near  00 years before rome was taken and utterly rased by young africanus that is scipio aemilianus before christ     years it had disputed with rome for the empire of the world for the space of     years the most beautiful village in the world called marsa now stands in the western point of ancient carthage and from thence it is a fine walk to didos cave under capebonn    that i think we need not doubt of its being the cave into which the gallant aeneas led the gracious queen but that it ever was a quarry and that pillars were made by the workmen to support the roof as dr shaw says does not seem to be the case the whole grot which goes in    fathoms under the hill its arches and pillars were undoubtedly by the hand of nature like many others i have seen so it appeared to me i could not see the least sign of a laboring hand in this cave    and st donats cave in glamorganshire which is much more beautiful than the african grot described in the first aeneid st donats cave by the vulgar called reynards church in glamorganshire is   0 feet in length the breadth    and the height    every spring tide fills it with water and has smoothed it to perfection at the upper end of it there is a grand seat arched into the stone and near it a fallingspring of fresh water drops into a cistern it has made the rushing tides have made good seats in the sides of the rock and from them you have a view of the channel which is seven leagues every ship that sail to and from bristol is seen and the mountains of somersetshire bound the prospect that way the cliff over the cave is almost double the height of the grot and to the very edge of the precipice the cattle come to graze to avoid the insects who will not approach the seabreezes the whole is a charming scene     the cave in stanemore is in the bottom of a perpendicular mountain of a vast height the east side of the lake and four yards from the shore the entrance is a grand sweep high and broad as the grot that is in breadth    feet in height    it is an hundred and forty seven feet long the stone of it is extremely beautiful of a yellow and reddish color bright and glittering and beautifully variegated with arched and undulated veins of various tinges i broke off a piece of it and found it a congeries of plates of spar stained with a fine mixture of colors it is a species of the alabaster called marmor onychites on account of its tabulated zones resembling those of the onyx and is very little inferior to the egyptian alabaster this stanemore stone is far beyond the cornish and derbyshire alabaster the caverns there are but incrusted with a sparry substance as i have found upon various examinations and as is evident to every eye that sees the workmen making the elegant vases and chimneycolumns we have of the alabaster of those counties whereas in stanemore this alabaster consists of strata of sparry substance though somewhat coarser than this kind of egyptian stone  the top of the cave is a bold arch finished beyond all that art could do and the floor as smooth as it is possible to make the stone at the far end of the grot there are a dozen rows of seats like benches that rise one above another the uppermost will hold but two people on each of the others a dozen may sit with ease they make the place look as if it was the assembly room or council chamber of the waternymphs there was no water dropping from the roof of this cave but in a thousand places where moss had agreeably covered the walls it crept through the sides and formed streams that ran sofyly over the ground and weared it smooth it brought to my remembrance some very poetical lines in lucretius   noctivagi sylvestria templa tenebant nympharum quibus exibant humore fluenta lubrica proluvie larga lavere humida saxa humida saxa super viridi stillantia musco et partim plano scatere atque erumpere campo and then by night they took their rest in caves where little streams roll on with silent waves they bubble through the stones and softly creep as fearful to disturb the nymphs that sleep the moss spread over the marbles seems to weep this was exactly the case of the water in this fine cave in the lowest harmony it gently fell over the slanting floor and as oldham has it   away the streams did with such softness creep as twere by their own murmurs lulled asleep    a description of a fine seat in yorkshirestanemore which belongs to a society of philosophers such was the delightful spot i at last discovered when i thought i was come to the ne plus ultra that is had gone on till i could go no farther and now seeing how my way lay i departed from ortonlodge betimes the next morning leaving my lad o fin to keep possession of the place till i returned      june    the  th day since i left jack price and with the other boy went through the lawns in the wood i have mentioned at the end of the vale this brought me to a range of mountains most frightful to behold and to the top of them with great toil we made a shift to climb and from thence descended through many perils to a bottom between the hills we had come down and some mountains that stood at a small distance from them this low ground trended north and northwest for an hour and then turned northeast for three hours more a very bad way stony and wet and some stiff pieces of road but the bottoms brought us at last into a large and spacious plain that was surrounded with hills whose tops and sides were covered with ancient trees and lofty groves and some mountains whose heads were above the clouds flowers and clover and other herbs adorned the ground and it was watered with many neverdrying streams the plain seemed a vast amphitheatre by nature formed and variety and disposition refreshed the eyes whatever way they turned  in the very center of this ground i found a house and gardens that charmed me very much the mansion had a rusticity and wildness in its aspect beyond any thing i had seen and looked like a mass of materials jumbled together without order or design there was no appearance of rule in any part and where a kind of proportion was to be seen it seemed as a start into truth by the inadvertent head of blind chance it was the most gothic whimsical fourfronted thing without that ever my eyes beheld and within the most convenient comfortable dwelling i have seen  the gardens of ulubrae this edifice which looks more like a small gothic cathedral than a house stands in the middle of large gardens which are not only very fine but uncommon and different from all the gardens i have been in there is no more rule observed in them than in the house but the plantations of trees and plots of flowers the raised hills the artificial valleys the streams that water these vales and the large pieces of water and lakes they have brought in and formed are inexpressibly charming and fine wild and natural they seem and are a beautiful imitation of the most beautiful scenes of nature the wilderness the openings the parterres the gardens the streams the lakes the cascades the valleys and the rising grounds in the most various disposition and as if art had little or no hand in the designs have an admirable effect upon the eye  the passages from valley to valley between the hills they have made are not by formal straight walks but by windings in various ways which are decorated with little grottosand diversified in the manner of laying out the ground the streams and canals sometimes serpent and sometimes spread away rocks artfully placed seem to push the waters off and on the banks are seeming wild productions of flowers as the hills and risings are sprinkled with flowery trees so are these banks with all the sweets that grow small boats are on the running streams and over them in many places are winding bridges of wood most ingeniously and finely made these streams which they have from the mountains supply the larger pieces of water and in the largest of those lakes they had raised a rock in the most natural manner on this is a summer house of great beauty it is the reverse of the mansion and has every charm that pure architecture could give it it is large enough for a small family     an account of the philosophers of stanemore      june     th day when i came up to this seat which the owners of it call ulubrae some gentlemen who were in the gardens saw me and saved me the trouble of asking admission by inviting me in with the greatest civility but they seemed under a vast surprise at my arrival and much more so when i gave them an account of the way i had traveled it appeared almost incredible they had not a notion of such a journey they told me i was in yorkshire now and had been so when i ascended the high mountains that are some miles behind the hills that surround their house but they did not imagine there was any traveling over those mountains and the alps upon alps beyond them to brugh under stanemore the way they said was very bad from their house to eggleston or bows on account of hills waters and wet bottoms it was worse to travel northward to bishopric and scarce passable to the north east to cumberland  what then must it be to journey as i had done over the northern fells of westmorland and the bad part of yorkshirestanemore i had passed  it was a terrible way i replied and what i often despaired of coming through even at the hazard of my life frequently we were locked in by chains of precipices and thought we should never find a pass some of the mountains were so steep that it was with the greatest difficulty we could lead the horses up and down them and many rivers were so rapid and rocky at bottom that we were often in danger of being lost beside if fortune had not conducted us to the habitations of people we little expected to find we might have perished for want of food as my servant could not bring from brugh provisions sufficient for so long and uncertain a way all these difficulties i saw very soon in less than a days ride to the north from the bell on the southernedge of stanemore a little lone publichouse that lies half way the turnpikeroad on the left hand as the traveller goes from bows to brugh penrith and carlisle but friendship and curiosity were too many for all the obstacles in the way and in hopes of finding a beloved friend who lives somewhere toward the northern edge of yorkshire or westmorland or on the neighboring confines of bishopric or cumberland and that i might see a part of england which even the borderers on it are strangers to and of which camden had not an idea i observed before that camden and every other describer of england had not the least notion of stanemore that is the north fells of westmorland and the northern mountains of richmondshire and as to the people who live on the borders of stanemore i could not find so much as one man in richmond gretabridge bows and brugh that had been any length of way up the mountains when i asked railton the quaker a very knowing man who keeps the george at bows what sort of a country stanemore was he answered it is after a few miles riding more wild and mountainy than the highlands of scotland and unpassable nay my landlord at eggleston some miles within stanemore knew nothing of the mountains upon mountains that are far beyond his house    i went on and have had success thus far the journey has been worth my pains i have beheld the most delightful scenes and met with very extraordinary things and should i find my friend at last my labors will be highly rewarded indeed  the gentlemen i was talking to seemed to wonder very much at me and my discourse and as the rest of the society by this time came into the parlour they introduced me to them and then related what i had said they all allowed it was very extraordinary and requested i would oblige them with some particulars that occurred i did immediately i told them among other things of my reception at burcotlodge  and the skeleton of john orton which i found in the cottage on the side of a woody hill i let them know the goods and conveniences i saw there and that i was so pleased with the beauties of the place the little mansion the once fine gardens and the useful things on the premises that i intended to return to it and make it my summer retreat that i had left a man there to that purpose who was at work in the garden and expected to be back in a months time with such things as were wanting to make it an agreeable and comfortable little country house  the philosophers wondered not a little at what they heard if they were surprised at seeing me as a traveller in such a place they were much more astonished at my relation they could not enough admire mrs burcot and mrs fletcher the history of the penitent orton they thought very strange they told me they were glad i had a thought of making ortonlodge a summer retreat and hoped it would occasion my calling upon them many times that i should always be heartily welcome to their house and might with less difficulty go backwards and forwards as their lodge was at my service whenever i was pleased to do them the favor to call this was civil and i returned them the thanks they deserved  here dinner was brought in and with these gentlemen i sat down to several excellent dishes there was the best of every kind of meat and drink and it was served up in the most elegant manner their wine in particular was old and generous and they gave it freely we took a cheerful glass after dinner and laughed a couple of hours away in a delightful manner they were quite polite friendly and obliging and i soon found in conversing with them that they were men of great reading and greater abilities philosophy had not saddened their tempers they were as lively companions as they were wise and learned men  these gentlemen are twenty in number men of fortune who had agreed to live together on the plan of a college described by mr evelyn in his letter to mr boil you will find this curious letter in biograph britan    but with this difference that they have no chaplain may rise when they please go and come as they think fit and are not obliged to cultivate every one his garden every member lays down a hundred pounds on the first day of the year and out of that fund they live pay their servants keep their horses and purchase every thing the society requires what is wanting at home this stoek produces and is to be expended only at ulubrae for every thing necessary and comfortable except raiment and horses when they are abroad it is at a plusexpence  i call these gentlemen philosophers because exclusive of their good morals they devote the principal part of their time to natural philosophy and mathematics and had when i first saw them made a great number of fine experiments and observations in the works of nature though they had not been a society for more than four years they make records of every thing extraordinary which come within their cognizance and register every experiment and observation i saw several fine things in their transactions and among them a most ingenious and new method of determining expeditiously the tangents of curve lines which you know mathematical reader is a very prolix calculus in the common way and as the determination of the tangents of curves is of the greatest use because such determinations exhibit the quadratures of curvilinear spaces an easy method in doing the thing is a promotion of geometry in the best manner the rule is this     a rule to determine expeditiously the tangents of curve lines suppose b d e the curve b c the abcissa  x c d the ordinate  y a b the tangent line  t and the nature of the curve be such that the greatest power of y ordinate be on one side of the equation then y    x   xxy  xyy  a   aay  aax  axx  ayy but if the greatest power of y be wanting the terms must be put  0  graph of curve  then make a fraction and numerator the numerator by taking all the terms wherein the known quantity is with all their signs and if the known quantity be of one dimension to prefix unity and of two   if of three   and you will have    a     aay    aax  axx  ayy  the fraction by assuming the terms wherein the abscissa x occurs and retaining the signs and if the quantity x be of one dimension to prefix unity as above etc etc and then it will be    x     xxy  xyy  aax    axx then diminish each of these by x and the denominator will be    xx    xy  yy  aa    ax  this fraction is equal to a b and therefore t is     a     aay    aax  axx  ayy   xx    xy  yy  aa    ax in this easy way may the tangents of all geometrical curves be exhibited and i add by the same method if you are skilful may the tangents of infinite mechanical curves be determined  many other fine things in the mathematical way i looked over in the journal of these gentlemen i likewise saw them perform several extraordinary experiments   0 microscopical observations made at ulubrae they make all the mathematical instruments they use and have brought the microscope in particular to greater perfection than i have elsewhere seen it they have them of all kinds of one and more hemispherules and from the invented spherule of cardinal de medicis not exceeding the smallest pearl placed in a tube to the largest that can be used they had improved the double reflecting microscope much farther than marshals is by culpepper and scarlet and made several good alterations in the solar or camera obscura microscope and in the catoptric microscope which is made on the model of the newtonian telescope     colors in the microscope in one of their best double reflecting optical instruments i had a better view of the variety and true mixture of colors than ever i saw before the origins and mixtures were finely visible in a common green ribbon the yellow the light red and a blue appeared distinct and very plain the lively green was a yellow and blue in a sea green more blue than yellow the yellow was a light red and a pellucid white all the phoenomena of colors were here to be found out     works of art in the microscope in this instrument the finest point of a needle appeared more blunt and unequal and more like a broken nail than i had before seen it  the finest edge of a razor was like the back of a dog with the hair up  the finest paper was great hairs cavities and inequalities  and the smoothest plate of glass was very rough full of cracks fissures and inequalities very different indeed are the things finished by human art from the things finished by the hand of nature the points the edges the polish the angles every thing that nature produces appear in the instrument in a perfection that astonishes the beholder     the vegetable kingdom in a microscope in the views i here took of the vegetable world with my eye thus armed i saw many extraordinary things i had never observed before i took notice in particular that a sage leaf is covered with a kind of cobweb in which swarms of little active creatures with terrible horns and piercing eyes are busily employed a mulberry leaf was an amazing flexus or network we can see but   ribs on the sigillum solomonis whereas my armed eye perceived here    in a nettle i observed its whole surface covered over with needles of the most perfect polish an account of a nettle in the double reflecting microscope every one of which had three points points very different from our finest points not flat but to perfection sharp and that these needles rested on a base which was a bag of a flexible substance in form of a wild cucumber and filled with a sharp poisonous liquor this is discharged at the extremity of every point of the needles that cover the surface of the nettle from a hole visible in every point the poison is thrown out and excites a sense of pain and a heat arises as the blood flows more copiously to the wounded part by pressing with my finger the extremity of the prickles the bag of poison fell and on taking off the finger it swelled again  what a piece of workmanship is here in a nettle wonderful are thy works o lord god almighty  a sorrel leaf and buds of french bean and almond in a microscope a leaf of sorrel in this microscope exhibited to my eye oblong rough and straight atoms sharp as needles and from thence the tongue is twinged in a bud cut away with a fine needle from a steeped seed of a french bean i saw the entire plant and in an almond so cut away the perfect tree many other wonderful things i observed of the vegetable kingdom in the microscopes of these gentlemen     a louse and flea in a microscope as to the animal kingdom my observations on it in the optical instruments at ulubrae were so many that i could fill a volume with the things i saw but as i have little room or time to spare i shall only mention two or three  in the double reflecting telescope a louse and a flea were put which are creatures that hate each other as much as spiders do and fight to death when they meet the flea appeared first in the box a description of a flea and as he was magnified very greatly he looked like a locust without wings with a roundish body that is obtuse at the end and the breast covered with an armature of a triangular figure the head small in proportion to its body but the eyes large red and very fierce his six legs were long robust and made for leaping the antennae short but firm and sharp its tail was scaly and full of stings and its mouth pointed into active pincers his color was a deep purple  the louse the louse in white was next brought on and had a wellshaped oblong indented body his six legs were short made for walking and running and each of them armed at the extremity with two terrible claws the head was large and the eyes very small and black its horns were short and jointed and could be thrust forward with a spring its snout was pointed and opened contracted and penetrated in a wonderful manner     a battle in a microscope between a louse and a flea the first that was brought on the stage was the flea and to show us what an active one he was he sprung and bounced at a strange rate the velocity of his motions in leaping were astonishing and sometimes he would tumble over and over in a wanton way but the moment the louse appeared he stood stock still gathered himself up and fixed his flashing eyes on his foe the gallant louse did with a frown for some time behold him and then crouching down began very softly to move toward him when the flea gave a leap on his enemy and with his dangerous tail and pinching mouth began the battle with great fury but the louse soon made him quit his hold by hurting him with his claws and wounding him with his sharp snout this made the flea skip to the other side of the box and they both kept at a distance for near a minute looking with great indignation at each other and offering several times to advance the louse did it at last in a race and then the flea flew at him which produced a battle as terrible as ever was fought by two wild beasts every part of their bodies were in most violent motion and sometimes the flea was uppermost but more frequently the louse they did bite and thrust and claw one another most furiously and the consequence of the dreadful engagement was that the flea expired and the louse remained victor in the box but he was so much wounded that he could scarce walk  this battle was to me a very surprising thing as each of them was magnified to the size of two feet but considering what specs or atoms of animated matter they were it was astonishing to reflection to behold the amazing mechanism of these two minute things which appeared in their exertions during the fray it was still more strange to see the aversion these small creatures had to each other the passions that worked in their little breasts and the judgment they showed in their endeavors to destroy one another it is indeed a wonderful affair nor was it the least part of my admiration to see through the extraordinary transparencies of the louse the violent circulation of the blood in its heart this was as plane to my eye as red liquor forced by a pump in several experiments through circulating glass pipes  as to the dead flea it was opened and by the camera obscura or solar microscope which magnifies the picture of such a body as a flea to eight feet though the image of a flea may be magnified to eight feet by removing farther off the white paper screen on which the picture of the object is thrown very beautifully from the object posited in a single pocket microscope that is fastened to a tube to the solar microscope yet the image or picture is more distinct and exact when not enlarged to more than three feet on the opposite side of the darkened room  by the way reader the solar microscope is the most entertaining of all the microscopes and by it without any skill in drawing you may easily make an exact picture of any animal or object you can put into the fastened pocket microscope the object is so intensely illuminated by the sun beams collected by a unequal lens that are thrown on it by a lookingglass that its picture is most perfectly and planely represented on the white screen you may have a mite or one of the imperceptible animals of rotten wood so truly and greatly magnified as easily to sketch out the exact image of it in all its wonderful parts with a pencil or a pin and in this amusing work and in transferring the objects from the solar to the double reflecting microscope the catoptric microscope and the microscope for opake objects how usefully and delightfully might a young man of fortune employ many hours that are miserably sauntered away or consumed in senseless and illicit delights   we saw the intestines distinguished and arranged in a manner that cannot be enough admired it was full of eggs and in every egg were many halfformed young ones     spiders in the great double microscope the water aranea or great water spider was next put in and made a wonderful appearance in his greatly magnified state it is the largest of the spider kind except the native of apulia called the tarantula and is furnished at the head with a hard black forceps which resembles that of the apulian araneus the color of its oval body is a blueish black and has a transverse line and two spots hollowed in it its eight legs are very long the joints large and the little bones of the feet have different articulations it was armed with bristles like a boar and had claws very black not unlike an eagle it had eight eyes and six of them were disposed in form of a half moon on the forehead the other two were on the crown of the head one to the left the other to the right this disposition affords light to the whole body and as these eyes are well furnished with crystalline humors they are sharpsighted beyond all creatures and so nimbly hunt down flies the mouth was full of teeth and they looked like short thick hairs  in opposition to this amphibious creature which walks on the mud at the bottom of standing waters as well as on the banks the silverygreen bodied spider was put into the box which is one of the class that lives in the woods where it squats down on the branches of trees and throws four of its legs forward and four backward extending them straight along the bough but the great water aranea with his terrible weapon the black forceps in a minute destroyed it and we took the dead body out to put in its place the red and yellow spider which is a larger and stronger kind this made a battle for two minutes and hurt his foe but he could not stand it longer he expired at the victors feet  a reflection on the works of nature as seen in the microscope these things were a fine entertainment to me as i had not before seen a solar catoptric or improved doublereflecting microscope i had now a nearer view of the skilful works of the supreme artificer with admiration i beheld the magnified objects  the wonderful arrangement of the intestines of a flea  the motion and ebullition of the blood of a louse  their forms  the various spiders so astonishingly framed  the gnat that elephant in so small a miniature  the amazing form of the ant  the astonishing claws and beautiful wings of a fly the bones nerves arteries veins and moving blood in this very minute animal  the wonderful be its claws its colors and distinct rows of teeth with which it sips the flowers and carries the honey home in its stomach but brings the wax externally on its thighs  and a thousand other things which manifest a creator in every object i viewed in the optical instruments my eyes beheld one wise being and supreme cause of all things every insect herb and spire of grass declare eternal power and godhead not only the speech and language of the heavens but of all the works and parts of nature is gone out into all the earth and to the ends of the world loudly proclaiming that thou o god art lord alone thou have made heaven the heaven of heavens and all their hosts the earth and all things that are therein therefore be thou our lord god for ever and ever     the library at ulubrae the library belonging to these gentlemen is a very fine one and contains many thousand volumes but is much more valuable for the intrinsic merit than the number of the books and as to ancient manuscripts there is a large store of great value they had likewise many other curious monuments of antiquity statues paintings medals and coins silver gold and brass to describe those fine things would require a volume among the books i saw the editions of the old authors by the famous printers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries editions greatly prized and sought after by most of the learned but these gentlemen did not value them so much as the editions of the classicks that have been published within this last century especially the quarto editions done in holland they showed me many errors in the greek authors by the stephens and as to plantin exclusive of his negligence in several places his italic character they thought far inferior to the roman in respect of beauty all this was true and it is most certain that the best corrected books are the best editions of the classicks they are the best helps for our understanding them there is no reason then for laying out so much money for the old editions when in reality the modern ones are better     an account of the bock called vindiciae contra tyrannes one of the books in this library which i chanced to take into my hand was the famous vindiciae contra tyrannos which came out in latin and french in      under the name of stephanus junius brutus and is a defense of liberty against tyrants  this treatise proves in the first place that subjects are not bound to obey princes if they command that which is against the law of god as the worship of a consecrated wafer and the theology of st athanasius marionalatry the demonalatry and all the diabolism of popery   dly that it is lawful to resist a prince who like james the second endeavors to ruin the true church and make the superstition of rome the religion of the land   dly that it is lawful to resist a prince when he oppresses and strives to ruin a state as when charles the first would exercise a power contrary to the interest of his people contrary likewise to that of the protestant religion many instances can be produced of charles the first exerting a power contrary to the interest of the protestant religion and a capital one is this kings express and strict orders signed with his own hand to captain john pennington to deliver and he did in obedience thereto deliver a squadron of the naval forces of england consisting of eight men of war into the hands and absolute power of the french king and charles directed that in case of disobedience in the english captains to that order pennington was to sink them these naval forces enabled the gaulish king to break and suppress the power of the rochelle protestants this was an unjustifiable step indeed in charless reign and if to this we add a thousand acts of this said sovereign lord that were the cause of all the disagreements differences and contentions between his majesty and his people that happened in his reign and the sources of public calamity it is certainly most amazing to see the memory of this prince treated equally if not superior to the most celebrated martyrs torrents of tears have i seen pour from the eyes of our mourning theologers on the  0th of january i remember one time when dr warren preached the commemoration sermon at st margarets westminster that he wept and sobbed so bitterly and calamitously that he could hardly get out the following concluding words of his fine discourse  the roy  royal ma  martyr  the  holy martyr  the  the  blessed martyr  nor can i forget the learned author of the life of david this gentleman preached before the late duke of devonshire in christchurch monday jan  0      on these words  take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer  take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness prove     in this fine sermon the dr gave us the picture of a man as like charles the  st as phalaris was to the apostle st john he then deprecated the murder which are his own words and in the most piteous manner with tears informed us that god gave us this prince in his mercy and took him away in his indignation a prince says the doctor who was a true lover of his people compassionate of their errors and misfortunes and religiously tender of their wellbeing he equally understood and practiced religion in its purity and he died defending it king charles the first of blessed memory  here the preacher wept and then proceeded to abuse the opposers of this royal contender for absolute prerogatives as absolute as those the eastern or civil law potentates claim and then to make and apply observations and inferences to the persons and characters of the present times he told the lord lieutenant and the house of lords among other admirable things that they should remember how the lay lords had consented to deprive the bishops of their seats in parliament and rob the spiritual lords of their rights and privileges which drew down a just judgment upon themselves for they the said lay lords were soon after voted useless have a care then lay lords how you act for the future against the spiritual lords maintain for the time to come a strict and inviolable regard to the rights privileges and properties of the spiritual lords  this advice by the way appeared to me very singular and i think on the contrary that it would be well for our church if our bishops were obliged to leave the court the parliament and their politics and then spend their lives in laboring in the vineyard of christ in their several dioceses what have priests to do with baronies and acts of state men that ought above all other men to be content with food and raiment and to withdraw themselves from the world that by their continued conversation with god and attention only to the sacred prescriptions of the gospel they might appear replenished with that divine power and virtue which by prayer and all the exercises of piety and penitence they had implored and by their examples and instructions brighten and inflame the people with the love of god and improve the good in goodness and correct and reform the wicked this would be acting like bishops indeed the holiness of our prelates lives and their fervor in teaching mankind the truths of jesus christ would soon advance the cause of their master they would bring the people to conform to the will of the lord and cause the learned to purify the defilements of genius that pride and vanity that curiosity and selflove which are incompatible with an accomplished purity of heart but as to charles the first of blessed memory certain i am that whatever dean delany may think of him this prince did really contend for the cardinal maxims of the civil law and died not for true religion as this doctor says but to advance the civil laws above the constitution and laws of britain and thereby acquire an absolute dominion quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem it appears from matters of fact that his pleasure was to be the law in him was to reside the sole power of imposing taxes on the people this power and other powers contrary to the fundamental form of this government this king of blessed memory assumed and challenged as rights under the name of his undoubted prerogatives and grasped the pretense so hard as never to part with it till he wanted strength to hold it this is the martyr his reign was a provoking violation of parliamentary rights and a cruel oppression of the subjects  instead then of the fine labored reasons offered by dr delaney to the lord lieutenant of ireland to account for the way of providence in the tragical death of this king he might have said  that whereas this prince had departed from the known laws of the land to an arbitrary power and not only the pressures and sufferings of the people under this method of governing were innumerable but the fundamental form and original constitution of britain on which the protestant religion and the liberty of europe depend was in danger of being subverted and for ever destroyed therefore did providence deliver up this king into the hands of wicked men who had usurped the administration of affairs that the mortification in the constitution might be cured by the death of this destroying prince and the violence of his exit remain a monument in terrorem to all future kings of england to have a care how they offer to make any alteration or change in the original form of government for violations of the constitution had brought charles the first to the block this had been a reasonable account of that sad affair it is supported by matters of fact  n b the contentions between his majesty and the house of commons began about the following essential points    a power the king assumed and challenged as a right to impose taxes levy moneys and impose duties on merchandises without a previous grant thereof in parliament   that the commons were obliged to observe and obey the kings messages in giving precedence to the matter of supplies preferable to the redress of grievances and to depend on royal promises for time and opportunity to dispatch other business   that the commons had no right and power of enquiring into the demeanor of the kings ministers and nearest servants and impeaching them for misdemeanors   that the king could in his courts below take cognizance of and censure the debates of the commons   that the king could by warrants signed with his own hand arrest and imprison his subjects and especially the members of parliament for what they said and did in parliament   these illegal and destructive acts of power king charles the first claimed as his prerogatives and exercised them as long as he was able with great rigor and extraordinary circumstances and how such a general oppression and rendering the two estates of lords and commons of no signification can make the memory of this prince blessed  or how his suffering in the manner he did in defense of such absolute lawgiving power that was inconsistent with the constitution and with the reasons upon which it is founded can render him a holy and blessed martyr is past my comprehension i should rather choose to say that since charles would not act for the protection happiness and safety of his people but by a continued exertion of sovereign power endeavored to oppress and ruin them and change the form of government his arbitrary principles brought him to a dismal extremity this as before observed is the truth of the case may his death be a warning to future english kings that they may like his majesty king george the second govern with parliaments and exert their power for the protection safety and happiness of the people    and when james the second began his tyranny by dispensing with the penal statute of    car   in the case of sir edward hales notwithstanding the true religion the honor of almighty god the sasety of the government and the public good and peace of the nation depend upon this act of    car    and  thly that neighbor princes or states may be or are bound by law to give succors to the subjects of other princes afflicted for the cause of true religion or oppressed by manifest tyranny these truths are finely proved in this extraordinary book the excellent author evinces that justice requires that tyrants and destroyers of the commonwealth be compelled to reason charity challenges the right of relieving and restoring the oppressed those that make no account of these things do as much as in them lies to drive piety justice and charity out of this world that they may never more be heard of  who was the author of the vindiciae contra tyrannos i asked one of these gentlemen if he knew who was the author of this book for it was ascribed to various men  he told me that the learned hubert languet was the reputed author as we find in de la mares elogium upon him but de la mare was misinformed by legoux the great du plessis account of du plessis mornay the great du plessis mornay was born the  th of november      and died at his baronie la foret in poitou the   th of november      aged    having retired to his country seat after louis the thirteenth had taken from him the government of saumur he writ several excellent books and one that is invaluable called mornay on the eucharist against the papists which was published in       this book produced the famous conference between du plessis mornay and cardinal perron at fontainbleau in the year   00 the victory at this conference is by the papists ascribed to perron but the protestants with more justice affirm that du plessis was victor at fontainbleau jacques davy du perron at the time bishop of evreux published a book on this conference in which he gives a pretended true account of it and illustrates and defends his cause but to this the great mornay replied and made a poor devil of perron see those pieces reader and you will be finely entertained for perron though a papist was a great man  an account of cardinal perron sept   n b cardinal perron was born in the year      nov    and died at paris a d      aged    he had been trained up in the reformed religion with great care but went off to popery on the preferments offered him by henry iii  as on the contrary du plessis mornay had been educated a papist but became a protestant to the loss of the greatest preferments  it was du perron that converted to popery the famous henri sponde bishop of pamiers and abridger of the annals of baronius dedicated to perron  and in conjunction with cardinal dossat he made a papist of henri le grand henry the fourth of france it was owing to the management of this cardinal de st agnes in the conclave and to dossat that that wicked fellow poul v so marbais a doctor of divinity who knew this pope well assures us nic de marbais request a lempereur p     leyde        was created pope and cardinal baronius lost the popedom bellarmine however who was likewise one of the    cardinals in that conclave might have had it but he refused it  those things we find in guy pattins letters tom    godeau melanges critiques apud antillon  and hist des conclaves  borghese alias paul v who succeeded that fine character leo xi leo xi reigned but twentyfive days in the year   0  in the   d year of his age died the   th of january      aged     and had for his successor ludovisio called gregory the xvth  an account of cardinal dossat n b dossat was born august         and died at rome march      0  aged    his five volumes of letters are a masterpiece in politics and next to father pauls history of the council of trent are the best books you can look into reader for an exact and full description of the artifices of the court of rome  remarkable was the saying of this cardinal when henry the fourth of france was stabbed  if there was the least pretext for such assassinations they ought to be contrived and executed by the heretics whom the king separated from and abandoned and thereby gave them reason to be afraid of him but they never made the least attempt of this kind neither against him nor the five kings his predecessors though their majestys made the most cruel butcheries of the huguenots  account of cardinal baronius n b baronius was born october  0 in the year      and died the  0th of june   0  aged    his twelve tomes in folio of ecclesiastical annals containing the history of the church for twelve centuries ending at the year      have been well called the twelve labors of the roman hercules it is a prodigious work the reading the erudition the judgment the order and method of the author are amazing but an unhappy prejudice for papal rights and romish pieties attaches him continually to the roman cause without the least regard to truth in a thousand and a thousand articles and makes it plain that he was not assisted from above in this work as he affirms himself the most judicious of the roman catholic writers say  il seroit a souhaiter quil eut ete exempt des preventions que son education and son pais lui avoient inspirees  n b isaac casaubon in his fine exercitations says with great justice of this great man  qui denique merita sua in ecclesiam si immoderato partium studio non corrupisset dignus erat sine controversia cui omnes et veteres et recentiores qui illam eruditionis partem attigerunt assurgerent et fasces submitterent sed vir eruditissimus quando ad scriptionem se accingebat de approbanda fide sua ex aequo omnibus sicuti par erat fidelem historicum adeo nihil cogitavit ut contra id summo studio videatur egisse ne qui in negotio religionis alia sequebantur castra ullum usquam aequitatis vestigium in suis scriptis reperirent adeo in defensione illarum partium quas probabat totus est ubique historiam professus non solum theologum sed etiam persaepe disputatorem e schola agit locos communes a narratione historica digrediens saepissime contexit protestants passim nullo discrimine convitiis maledictis et infandis calumniis incessit jura principum quae a paucis seculis obtentu religionis imminui ceperunt ita cupide quoties datur occasio contrahit arrodit evertit ut natum in regno noscere nequeas educatum altum et auctum romae facile agnoscas denique ita se gessit baronius totis    suorum annalium tomis ut qui dubitari nollet praecipium sibi scopum fuisse papalem monarchiam stabilire amplificare et ad coelum usque evehere this is a just character of the annals of baronius the best edition of this work is the english translation of it by hall doctor of the sorbonne it is not only preferable to the french italian and every other translation but far better than the original latin on account of halls corrections and most learned notes and dissertations  account of the centuries of magdebourg n b after all however the centuries of magdebourg which were published in      and    0 are the valuable body of ecclesiastical history baronius who pretended to answer them by his annals is undoubtedly the finest writer but the ministers matthias flaccius jean vigand matthew le judin basil faber nicholas gallus and andrew corvin are the learned men to whom we are indebted for the noblest collection of historical truths in ecclesiastical affairs that ever appeared in the world they are honest writers indeed every page of their work discovers a zeal for truth and the glory of christ while baronius sadly labors for a pontifex maximus and the cheats of rome the work of the centuriators extends to the   th century and every century contains    chapters the  st is a summary of the things to be recited then the  d treats of the place and extent of the church   of persecution and peace   of doctrine   of heresies   of ceremonies and rites   of polity and government   of schism   of synods  0 of bishops    of heretics    of martyrs    of miracles    of the jews    of religions separated from the church and    of broils and political changes in this clear and distinct manner are the things of every age treated  n b baronius ascribes the guidance and success of his pen in writing his annals to the favor of the most holy mary the mother of god to her from whom i acknowledge the whole to be received i offer these annals etc to her by whom the whole of this gift comes to us from god to the most holy virgin the most safe ark in which our labors may be kept and in safe custody protected we offer these annals that she may sanctify them with her blessing etc etc  for the intireness of his net after his having cast it so often and the continuance of his strength fresh and green in his old age all was from the grace of abisag their shunamite cherishing his aged bones the most holy and pure virgin favoring the work begun and taking care of and happily promoting all his affairs etc etc  what must a true christian say to this  many are the abridgments of the annals but the best is that of henri sponde the apostate aforementioned it is well done  account of cardinal bellarmine n b bellarmine was born the  th of october      and died september         aged     he was a man of great learning in the works of the fathers councils canon law and church history and writ several labored things but his chief performance is his body of controversy in   volumes folio which the catholics think very fine they show indeed great reading but ignorance of the sense of scripture and are quite void of argument there is not one article of popery tolerably well defended in the   volumes every exposition and vindication are senseless and ridiculous  account of isaac casaubon n b isaac casaubon who writ the exercitations on baronius and lies in westminster abbey was born feb         and died in the   th year of his age a d       besides his exercitations he published several learned works and animadversions and commentaries on persius polybius athenaeus strabo suetonius and diogenes laertius it was he first published in greek polyoenuss stratagems of the ancients in war in the year      having purchased the m s at a great price but the latin version he added to it was done by justus vulteius and we have since had a more correct edition of polyoenus by pancratius in the year    0 the epistolae casauboni are likewise valuable things but of most merit are his exercitations and his persius his commentary on persius is admirable not only for a just explication of his incomparable author but for a deal of fine classical learning he has scattered through it and for his exercitations against baronius the friend of truth must be for ever charmed with them it is to be lamented that we have but    of them they go no farther than to the   th year of jesus christ and relate principally to baroniuss bad explication of scripture  two jesuits boullenger and jean lheureux writ against the exercitations but endemen jean the name lheureux went by his defense of baronius is very weak as you will soon see reader on turning him over and as to julius caesar boullenger the other monk when you have read his dissertation against casoubon and bishop montaigues animadversions on that dissertation you will perceive he was a poor creature  it is remarkable that isaac casaubons two sons henry and merric both went off to popery and died in france apostate priests in the romish church though their father had fled from that country for the sake of the protestant religion and was one of the best defenders of the reformed faith he was one of the judges at the famous conference between du plessis and perron and by the way i think it equally remarkable that the grandson of the great primate usher and the only remaining person of the archbishops family should be the most violent papist i ever saw i knew the man in dublin and have never heard so outrageous a catholic as he was he said to my astonishment that his grandfather was a great light but burnt with his head downwards in this world till he dropped into hell in the next  as to the conference between du plessis and perron about the eucharist and other matters besides the two pieces i have mentioned to wit perrons account of it and mornays answer to the account you will find a good relation of it in lhistoire de ledit de nantes tom   p     and suiv and see on this article sullys memoirs  n b the ingenious and excellent miss mornay of shelfordpark is descended from the great philip mornay du plessis and the last of the house of du plessis now living her grandfather jacques de mornay was great grandson to du plessis mornay and came over to england on the revocation of the edict of nantes in the year       of the edict of nantz n b lewis the   th with the same hand that signed the edict of revocation likewise signed an order for eighty thousand merciless dragoons and other troops to march against his protestant subjects and force them by plundering and torturing to turn papists  i say with the same hand because the   th article of the edict signed by this cruel and perfidious prince in the   d year of his reign is as follows     and furthermore those of the said pretended reformed religion till such time as it shall please god to illuminate them may abide in the towns and places of our kingdom countries and lands of our dominion and continue their traffic and enjoy their goods without being molested or hindered on account of the said pretended reformed religion provided they do not assemble to exercise it etc  this was a monstrous cheat and perfidiousness to deceive and ensnare his poor subjects something might be said for the edict of revocation if lewis had declared that to quell the agitations of his conscience he must revoke the edict of nantes though he had sworn to the observation of it but he allowed a certain time to his protestant subjects after which they must either turn catholics or quit the kingdom with their families and effects or else they should be exposed to such and such treatment  this had been plain and honest dealing though an arbitrary proceeding but to give it under his hand to his subjects that they might stay and continue their traffic enjoy their goods without being molested or hindered on account of their religion and at the same time leave them to the mercy of the dragoons  was not this an heinous act had he been guilty of this single one only says laval in his excellent history of the reformation of france vol   it would have imprinted such a spot on his reputation that all the waters of the seine were not sufficient to wash it away  the edict of nantz was granted to the reformed by henry the  th in the  th year of his reign of grace        was the author daubigne theodore agrippa aubigne the favorite of henry the  th was born in the year    0 and died      aged  0 he writ several curious things but his great and principal work is his universal history in   toms folio containing the transactions from    0 to   0   this is a very extraordinary history and contains many curious relations that are no where else to be found  he was obliged to fly france on account of this history and died at geneva  his two satyrs called la confession de sancy  and le baron de foeneste are fine things  the avantures of the baron de foeneste du chats edition are likewise well worth reading the best edition is a cologne        vols in   mo  it is a very curious thing  whose word is sterling affirms it see here mr seymour said the  d volume of daubignes history book

dits que m du plessis lui a avoue quil en estoit lauteur     account of the author of the famous book de libe tate ecclesiastica another extraordinary book i saw in this library was the famous piece de liberate ecclesiastica written against the papal usurpations at the time his holiness camille borghense commonly called paul v had the memorable contest with the venetians and upon enquiring who was the author of this scarce and valuable work that was superior even to father pauls book upon the same subject in defense of the liberties of mankind mr trenchard the president of the society showed me cappels assertion of the true faith against rosweius the jesuit and in it the following passage page     in ecclesiastica antiquitate quam non esset tyro casaubonus docuit a d   0  libro singulari de liberate ecclesiastica cujus jam paginae     typis erant editae cum rex henricus iv compositis jam venetorum cum pontifice romano controversiis vetuit ultra progredi et hoc ipsum quod fuerat inchoatum supprimi voluit ut ejus pauca nunc extent exemplaria  and in the same book i saw some manuscript references to casaubons lettres p         and     edit hag  and to one place in scaligers letters p     ed       several places i turned to and saw that casaubon hinted to his friends that he was the author of the book de ecclesiastica antiquitate and that scaliger affirmed it the great joseph scaliger was born aug        and died at leyden the   st of january in the   th year of his age a d   0  his father julius caesar scaliger died in the   th year of his age october          his father was a papist the son a protestant they were both great men in the republic of letters and both writ many books but the son was by far the greatest man  what i like best of the fathers works are his poeticks  his account of the latin tongue  and his exercitations against cardan these are fine pieces his prohlems on aulus gellius is likewise a good thing  the works of joseph the son

scaligera  these are the works of joseph scaliger and in them one meets with so various and fine an erudition and so much valuable criticism that if the reader of fortune will take my advice he will get them all into his closet as soon as possible and at the same time the four excellent pieces i have mentioned of julius caesar scaliger the father of joseph  n b the great lewis cappel author of the assertion of the true faith was a protestant minister at saumur he was born october         and died at saumur the   th of june      aged    he was likewise the author of that excellent book called arcanum punctuationis revelatum and of another very valuable thing called critica sacra  his son jean cappel turned papist and died a despicable apostate in the romish church  n b there were two other cappels protestant ministers both jacques who died in       and      and were the authors of several controversial writings against popery but they were weak writers in respect of the learned louis cappel    the words  vetuit ultra progredi et hos ipsum quod fuerat inchoatum supprimi voluit  accounts for this being published imperfect which all that see it wonder at   0 many other extraordinary books and manuscripts i saw in this library and a great number of fine curiosities but i can only mention one particular more engraven on a beautiful cornelian i saw the roman god of bounds with these words concedo nulli and one of the gentlemen asked me what i supposed the meaning of this design the emblem i answered was a very just one and in my opinion meant that truth must never be given up that it was replied was not the meaning of it though my thought was not unjust the design is to put one in mind of death of which terminus is the justest emblem and he says concedo nulli i favor none i suffer none to pass the limit there is continued the gentleman a little curious history depends on this here is a gold medallion on one side of which you see the image of the great erasmus and on the other this fancy which he always wore in a ring and from thence i had the medallion struck erasmus asked the famous carvajal the spanish cordelier just as i did you what the meaning of this ring was carvajal who had had some contests with erasmus and hated him greatly said it owed its being without all peradventure to the pride of erasmus and meant that he would never yield right or wrong to any one in the republic of letters erasmus answered that his explication was quite wrong and that on the contrary he used the device to kill his pride and put him in mind of death which suffers not the greatest men to pass the short limit of time allotted them this pleased me much and i resolved to get the fancy on a cornelian for a seal     an account of several subterranean chambers and an ascent in the inside of a mountain from the bottom to the top another extraordinary thing these gentlemen showed me was a hole leading to some wonderful caverns in the side of a mountain about a mile to the north of their house it resembles at the entrance penparkhole in gloucestershire in penparkhole you are let down by ropes fixed at the top of the pit four fathom perpendicular and then descend three fathom more in an oblique way between two rocks which brings you to a perpendicular tunnel    yards down into which you descend by ropes and land in a spacious chamber that is    yards in length    in breadth and    yards high from the margin of a great water at the north end of it to the roof this water is    yards in length    in breadth and generally    deep it is sweet bright and good drink it rises sometimes several feet and at other times sinks two feet below its usual depth the torches always burn clear in this chamber nor is the air in the least offensive though    yards from the surface of the earth and separated from the day by such deep tunnels and an oblique descent between them the great tunnel is about   yards wide and in the south side of it  0 yards down   yards before you come to the opening of the chamber or cavity below is a passage    yards in length   and a half high and   yards broad it is the habitation of bats and toward the end of it a sloping hole goes to some other place this passage and the tunnels and the chamber below is all irregular work    within three miles of bristol but with this difference that penparkhole was once a lead ore pit and one is let down by ropes through two tunnels to the chamber whereas the entrance of the place i am speaking of is the work of nature a steep and narrow descent of twentythree yards which i went down by having a rope under my arm and setting my hands and feet against the sides of the passage till i came to a flat rough rock which opened   yards and a half one way and   yards the other way this little cavern was two yards high we went from it into a more easy sloping way which brought us downward for thirteen yards till we came to another cavern that was six yards long and four and a half broad here we found a perpendicular tunnel two yards wide and sixtyseven yards deep but where it went to and what caused the noise below the gentlemen who came thus far with me could not tell for they had never ventured into it nor could they persuade any of their people to be let down to the bottom though they had found by the lead that there was hard ground below i will then i said explore this subterranean realm if you will let me and my lad down with proper conveniences for an enquiry of the kind and i dare say i will give you a good account of the region below this they answered was not safe for me to do i might perish many ways the damps and vapors might kill me at once or my lights by them might be put out or kindle the vapor of the place below but to this i said that i was sure the noise we heard at the bottom was some running water and wherever that was in the caverns of the earth the air must be pure and good so mr boil says in his general history of the air and so i have often found it in my descents to the deepest mines  as you please then the gentlemen replied you shall have every thing you can desire and be let down very safely however you may fare when you get to the ground and when you want to come up pull the packthread you have in your hand that will be tied to a bell at the top of the tunnel and you shall be immediately drawn up again these things being agreed they let me down in a proper basket the next morning at eight oclock with a lighted torch in my hand and soon after my man ralph followed with every thing i had required i was more than half an hour going down for the rope was given like a jack line from the engine it came from i saw several dismal lateral holes by the way but no mischief or inconvenience did i meet with in my passage to the ground  when i came to the bottom      june  0  th day from my leaving jack prices i found i was in a chamber of a great extent and though  0  yards from the day breathed as free as if i had been above ground a little river made a noise in its fall from a high rock within four yards of the spot i landed on and ran with impetuosity in a rough channel i knew not where the water was not deep as we found with our poles and but three yards broad and therefore we crossed it at  00 yards from the fall to get into a cavern that had an arched entrance on the other side within two yards of the stream our course to the crossing was due west and then we went to the north on passing the water and walking up the second cave  in it we ascended for    yards an easy rising way and then came to a swallow into which a river that ran toward us fell our course to this place was due north but as the flood came from the west we turned next to that point and by the side of this water marched  0 yards the cavern was so wide we could not see the walls and the roof was of a vast height  at the end of the  0 yards the river appeared due north again and by its side we went for  0 more till we came to another vast cavern that was a steep ascending opening down which the river very musically came this place was so like poolshole that i might think myself in the peak it was just such another grand opening up the inside of a mountain and had not only the descending flood but as many beautiful stalactical concretions on the rising way which formed the most beautiful pillars walls and figures of the finest carved work but in this it differed from poolshole that the ascending opening in richmondshire is much wider the rough open steep much higher to the roof and this steep reaches to the summit of the vast hills and ends in an opening in day we came out this way on the top of an exceeding high mountain after we had climbed from the bottom to the upper end     yards poolshole a little mile west of buxtonwells in derbyshire is in the whole length from the entrance to the farthest ascent but   0 yards the account of this in camden is very imperfect and next to nothing and what the authors of the tour through great britain say of it even in their  th edition in the year      only shows to one who has been there and carefully examined it that neither daniel defoe nor those since concerned in improving and correcting the four volumes of the tour ever were in the inside of poolshole their description of this like a thousand other places in those volumes is mere imagination with some things from cottons false account and the fancy not only wrong but very bad  i would describe it here but that the reader will find me in derbyshire before i take my leave of him if death does not prevent and i shall then give a full and true history of this high and rough country its waters curiosities and antiquities  at present i shall only observe to abate the wonder of my passing from the bottom of the inside of one of the richmond mountains to the plain on the top of it that the hill in which is poolshole is open within side in the ascent so far that   yards more of aperture would bring one to the outside of the top and i believe it is very possible for art to make an entrance that way as nature has done at the bottom    add to this     yards the way we had come from the bottom of the tunnel to the beginning of the watery steep and our march through the mountain from the time we parted with the gentlemen to our getting out at the top of it was  0  yards  this was a laborious route and at the hazard of our lives many times performed once in particular my lad ralph fell into the river with his torch in the great ascent and in striving to save his life i lost the other light i carried in my hand this reduced us to a state of the blackest darkness and in that condition we could not stir it was a horrible scene it chilled my blood and curdled it in my veins but i had a tinderbox matches and waxcandle in my pocket and soon recovered the desirable light at which we lit other torches and proceeded to ascend the rough and rocky steep till we came to the fountain that made the descending flood the opening upwards from that became very narrow and the slant so great that it was extremely difficult to go on but as i could see the day at the end of it i resolved to strive hard and mount if possible these remaining  0 yards in short we did the work as before related we came out this way and from the dismal caverns of night ascended to a delightful plain from which we again beheld the glorious sun and had the finest points of view it was by this time noon and under the shade of some aged trees that grew on the banks of a great lake on the summit of this vast hill i sat down to some bread and wine i had brought with me for relief never was repast more sweet i was not only fatigued very much but had been in fear as to my ever climbing up and knew not how to get down when i had mounted two thirds of the way the descent was a thousand times more dangerous than the going toward the top     we descended from the top of the mountain we had traveled through and arrive at mr harcourts house when i had done i walked about to see if there was any way down the mountains sides to go to ulubrae from whence i came but for miles it was a frightful perpendicular rock next that place and impossible for a goat to descend and on the side that faced bishopric and a fine country house and gardens about a quarter of a mile off in a delightful valley that extended with all the beauties of wood and lawn meadow and water from the foot of the mountain i was on the precipice here was a terrible way for a man to venture down but it was possible to do it with a long pole at the hazard of his life as the rocks projected in many places and the side went sloping off and therefore i resolved to descend i could not think of going back the way i came since i had got safe into day again i thought it better to risk my limbs in the face of the sun than perish as i might do in the black and dismal inside of those tremendous hills besides the house in my view might be perhaps the one i wanted it was possible my friend turner might live there  with art and caution then i began to descend and so happily took every offered advantage of jutting rock and path in my way that without any accident i got in safety down though the perils were so great that often i could not reach from rock to rock with my pole in this case i aimed the point of my pole at the spot i intended to light on and clapped my feet close to it when i went off in the air from the rock the pole coming first to the place broke the fall and then sliding gently down by it i pitched on the spot i designed to go to though six seven or eight fathom off and the part of the rock below not more than a yard broad it is a frightful piece of activity to a bystander but the youths on the mountains of ireland make nothing of it they are as expert at this work as the teneriff men from them i learned it and made ralph so perfect in the action while he traveled with me that he could go from rock to rock like a bird  my reception at mr harcourts house when we came to the ground i sent my man before me to the house with my humble service to mr harcourt the master of it and to let him know that i had traveled through the inside of one of the high mountains that surrounded his house and on coming out of the top of it had made the precipice next him my road to the valley he lived in that i knew not which way to turn next in order to go to cumberland and begged leave to dine with him and receive his information  this strange message delivered by ralph with much comic gravity that gentleman could not tell what to make of as i had ordered my young man not to explain himself but still say that we had traveled the inside of the mountain and came down the precipice this was so surprising a thing to mr harcourt and his daughter that they walked out with some impatience to see this extraordinary traveller and expressed no little amazement when they came near me after a salute mr harcourt told me he did not understand what my servant had said to him nor could he comprehend how i arrived in this valley as there was but one passage into it at the front of his house and my being on foot too increased the wonder of my appearing in the place but whatever way i came i was welcome to his house and he would show me the way in  my arrival here sir i replied is to be sure very strange and would be almost incredible to hear told by another person of one that journeyed     yards deep to the foundation of this alp on the other side of it then ascended a hollow way till he got out at the top and came down a high and frightful precipice to the vale below but here i am a proof of the fact i will explain how it was done and i began to relate every particular at large  but tell me sir miss harcourt said if you please why did you not return the way you came since the other side of the mountain is impossible to descend as you inform us on account of its being a perpendicular steep and that you must have hazarded your life a thousand times in coming down the way you did with the pole i tremble as i look at the place and only with fancys eye see you on the descent beside the gentlemen you left on the other side of the hill will conclude you lost and be very greatly troubled on the account  my reason madam i answering said for coming down this very dangerous way was because i thought it with all its perils much safer than the inside road i had come my activity i had reason to think was superior to the difficulties of the outward way and if i should fall it would be in the light of heaven with a human habitation in view that might afford me some relief if i only broke my bones but if in descending the very steep and horrible caverns of the hill which with the greatest difficulty i climbed up i should happen to get a fall as in all human probability i would and break a limb in these most dismal cavities of eternal night i must have perished in the most miserable manner without a possibility of obtaining any relief nor is this all madam the thing that brought me here among the mountains of richmondshire was to find a gentleman of my acquaintance and when i saw your house from the top of the mountain i did not know but it might be his i fansied it was as the situation answered my friends description of the spot he lived on  and if it had been his madam it would have put an end to all my toils for i am a wanderer upon the face of the earth through the cruelty of a motherinlaw and the unreasonableness of a rich father who has forsaken me because i will not submit to the declarations and decisions of weak and fallible men in matters of pure revelation and divine faith and own the infallibility of the orthodox system because the assent of my mind could not go beyond the perception of my understanding and i would not allow that the popular confession is the faith once delivered to the saints therefore i was thrown off and obliged to become the pilgrim you see before you  this history of a forlorn seemed stranger to the young lady and her father than even the account of my journey through the inside of a mountain and down a precipice that a goat would scarce venture they were both very greatly amazed at my relation and mr harcourt was going to ask me some questions when one of his servants came to let him know that dinner was serving up and by this put an end to our conversation the master of the house brought me into a fine room and i saw on the table an elegant dinner there was likewise a grand sideboard and several men servants attending miss harcourt sat at the head of the table and at her right hand two young ladies vastly handsome whom i shall have occasion to mention hereafter in this journal two ladies more were on the other side of her pretty women but no beauties and next them sat three gentlemen sensible wellbehaved men one of them a master of music the other a master languages and the third a great painter who were kept in the house on large salaries to teach the young lady these things mr harcourt placed me by himself and was not only extremely civil but manifested a kind of fondness as if he was well pleased with my arrival he and his daughter took great care of me and treated me as if i had been a man of distinction rather than the poor pilgrim they saw me with my staff in my hand the young lady talked to me in a very pleasant manner and as i saw the whole company were inclined to be very cheerful i clubbed as much as i could to promote good humor and increase the festivity of the table we laughed the afternoon away in a charming manner and when we had done we all went to walk in the gardens here the company soon separated as the various beauties of the place inclined various minds to different things and parts some pensive roamed in shady walks some sat by playing fountains and others went to gather fruits and flowers i had the honor to walk with miss harcourt to a canal at some distance and as we went this young lady told me she did not well understand me as to what i had said of religion being concerned in my becoming a traveller and desired me to be a little more particular that i will and immediately proceeded in the following manner     a discourse with miss harcourt in relation to my religion my father madam is a man of great learning virtue and knowledge but orthodox to the last degree and sent me to the university on purpose to make me a theologer that i might be an able defender of the creed of st athanasius and convince the poor people of the country he lived in and in good time he fondly hoped the inhabitants of many other countries that notwithstanding the symbol i have mentioned is what no human apprehension can comprehend and the judgment has nothing to act on in the consideration of it  that there is nothing to be understood in that symbol nor can a man form any determination of the matter therein contained  yet they must believe this great and awful mystery that three persons and gods are only one person and god and on peril of eternal misery they must confess that father son and holy ghost though three beings as distinct as any three things in the universe yet are only one being this mystery i was to preach up in his church a church in a field near his house to which he had the right of presenting and inflame the people against reason that traitor to god and religion which our adversaries the christian deists would make lord and king in opposition to faith i was to tell my beloved that reason is a carnal sensual devil and that instead of hearkening to this tempter they must assent to those heavenly propositions which give wisdom without ideas and certainty without knowledge you must believe my beloved that none is before or after the other  none is greater or less than another the infidels call this an unintelligible piece of nonsense but it is my beloved a very transcendent mystery it does we must own stagger and astonish us being a thing beyond our reach to comprehend but it must be believed on peril of eternal misery as i before observed and it is easy to be believed for this plain reason given by a very learned and pious bishop of our church to wit that it is too high to be by us comprehended this was the opinion of that great prelate dr beveridge in his private thoughts p    to which book i refer you my beloved for more of his admirable reasoning on this capital article and farther observe to you that not only this most pious bishop and many other most excellent prelates were of this way of thinking but all the most admirable divines have declared in their sermons and other matchless writings that the more incredible the athanasian creed is and the fuller of contradictions the more honor we do to our god in believing it it is the glory of orthodox christians that their faith is not only contrary to the carnal mind but even to the most exalted reason in matters of faith we must renounce our reason even though it be the only thing that distinguishes us from the beasts and makes us capable of any religion at all no human arguments are to interfere in this victorious principle the catholic faith is the reverse of rational religion and except a man believe it faithfully he must go into everlasting fire and brimstone little did i think when i talked in such a manner to miss harcourt against the famous symbol that i should ever find in the book of a most learned man an excellent divine the same kind of arguments seriously produced in favor of the creed of st athanasius yet this strange thing has time brought on and thereby convinced the world that the greatest learning and the most exalted piety employed in the cause of mystery can become so extravagant and erring as to mentain that a thing incomprehensible to human reason can be revealed and that the more incomprehensible it is to human reason and the more senseless it appears to human understanding the more glorious is the object of faith and the more worthy to be believed by a christian this deplorable argument for the truth of christianity i met with in a book lately published by an admirable man dr joseph smith provost of queenscollege oxon in his third section of a clear and comprehensive view of the being nature and attributes of god from p    to p    the reader may see this plea for darkness confusion and implicit faith he will find an answer to it in the appendix to this journal no       in this manner madam like a mad bigot a flaming zealot and a sublime believer was i to preach to the people of ireland and be an apostle for that faith which is an obedience to unreasonable commands but unfortunately for my fathers design and fortunately for my soul i was on entering the university put into the hands of a gentleman who abhorred modern orthodoxy and made the essential constitutive happiness and perfection of every intelligent being consist in the conformity of our mind to the moral rectitude of the divine nature this excellent man convinced my understanding that even faith in christ is of an inferior nature to this it is only the means to obtain it such a conformity and obedience of the heart and conscience to the will of god ought to be my religion as it was the religion of our savior himself  thus madam was i instructed by a master of arts my private tutor and when to his lessons i added my own careful examinations of the vulgar faith and the mind of our lord as i found it in the books i was thoroughly satisfied that an act of faith is an act of reason and an act of reason an act of faith in religious matters  that our lord was not the great god nor a part of that compound called the triunegod the miserable invention of divines but a more extraordinary messenger than the prophets under the law chosen by the divine wisdom to publish the will of god to mankind and sent under the character of his son and spiritual heir of his inheritance the church to new form the ages and fix such good principes in the minds of men as would be productive of all righteousness in the conversation that he was sent to destroy sin and the kingdom of satan and to bring the human race to a perfect obedience to the will of the supreme being  all this madam was as plain to me as the sun in summers bright day and therefore instead of laying aside my understanding and believing things without any rational ground or evidence at all  instead of going into order to draw revealed conclusions from revealed propositions and by a deep logic make scripture consequences that have no meaning in the words for the faith of the people i was so free and ingenuous as to let my father know that of all things in the world i never would be a parson since the character obliged me to swear and subscribe to articles i could not find in my bible nor would i as a layman ever read or join in the service of reading the tritheistic liturgy and offices he used in his family i was determined though i lost his favor and large fortune by the resolution to live and die a christian deist confessing before men the personal unity and perfections of the true god and the personal mediatorial office of jesus christ as st paul mentained the personal unity and absolute supremacy of the true god and in his description of the deity did not tell the athenians that he was a triune being to be considered under the notion of three persons of three understandings and wills in a coordinate triplicity of all divine attributes and perfections but one individual personal agent  one great spirit or mind selfexistent and omnipotent in wisdom and action  one supreme almighty creator and governor of the world  the god and father of jesus christ i shall therefore in obedience to the apostle and to the other inspired writers believe in an worship the same god the one god the only true god as our lord says in matthew and mark  through the alone mediation and intercession of jesus christ our redeemer and only begotten son of god  depending upon the effectual aid and assistance of the blessed spirit in hope of a glorious immortality this is  this shall be my religion whatever i may feel from an antichristian tyranny on account of the confession  though an outrage of uncharitable zeal should strip me of every worldly comfort and reduce me to a want of bread  if i should become a spectacle to men and angels by this faith yet i will believe as jesus christ and his apostles have ordered the world to believe  no unintelligible cant or scholastic jargon for me the holy ghost has in scripture expressed it sufficiently and unexceptionably clear  that there is one supreme independent firstcause of all things a spirit that is one spirit one god i am god and there is none like me i am god and there is none else beside me with me none but me  thus does the holy ghost declare and what signify the despicable heretical declarations of the doctors in respect of this  then as a test of christianity the same blessed spirit adds  that jesus is the true messiah was sent from god to reveal his will for the salvation of man and is the only mediator betwixt god and man thus has the holy ghost regulated our faith and practice and i think it incumbent on me to mind what he says and flee the invented pieties of our theologers  i did so and disobliged my father i lost his favor entirely he would take no farther notice of me and i became as you see a wanderer  this discourse delivered with my fire and action amazed miss harcourt so greatly that for some time after i had done she could not speak but continued looking with great earnestness at me at last however she said i am glad sir it has been my fate to meet with you and must when there is more time converse with you on this subject my father and i have had some doubts as to the truth of the athanasian creed but he told me he did not choose to examine the thing as it had the sanction of ages and was believed by the greatest divines in all nations if it be wrong let the churchmen answer for it but this does not satisfy me and since i have seen one that has forsaken all rather than live a disciple of athanasius after a thorough examination of the system and that you have now said some things against it that show the folly of believing it and make it a faith the most preposterous and unreasonable i am determined to enquire into the merit of it and see if christians ought to acknowledge the supreme dominion and authority of god the father  that the father is absolutely god the great god in the absolute supreme sense by nature and the son only a god by communication of divinity from the father that is by having received from the father the supreme cause his being attributes and power over the whole creation  or if they ought to ascribe supreme authority and original independent absolute dominion to god the father god the son and god the holy ghost three distinct supreme gods and yet but one supreme god as the church informs us in her famous creed and thereby makes us swallow a contradiciton as i have often thought and a doctrine against which a great number of texts can be produced this i will examine my reason shall be no longer silent in so important a case if a trinity in unity of equal minds or gods is not to be proved by the inspired writings the doctors preaching it and by creed requiring it will be no justifiable plea or excuse for me i am sensible in the great rising day i had better in such case leave all as you have bravely done were my father so orthodox and furious a bigot as to force me to be a religionist against my conscience what i have to beg of you sir miss harcourt continued is that you will tomorrow oblige me with your thoughts on the texts i have marked as produced by orthodox divines for their mysterious religion if you make me sensible that those texts do not prove the doctrine they are brought for and of consequence that the doctrine of the trinity as by them taught is the work of uninspired writers i shall renounce it to be sure i will no longer mistake contradictions for mysteries the schemes and inventions of men shall not pass with me for the revelations of god the texts produced by miss harcourt the next day in a sheet of paper she gave me and my written explication of them in answer the reader will find in the appendix to this journal no   i satisfied her that the letter of scripture was not full in favor of contradiction and that where it had any appearance of being so reason allowed the purest modesty to use some freedom in interpreting and take the texts in a lower meaning  such a liberty as protestants take with the words this is my body when they reject the doctrine of transubstantiation by this means i made a convert of her this lady became a strict christiandeist        mr harcourts observation on our discourse and generous offer to me here mr harcourt came up to us and desired to know if it was a fair question what we two had been talking so earnestly on for it seemed at a distance to be something more than ordinary i will tell you sir his daughter replied and immediately began to relate the whole conference and her resolution your resolution the father said is excellent you have not only my consent but i recommend it to you as the noblest work you can employ any time on for my part sir mr harcourt continued turning himself to me i never liked this part of our protestant religion and have often wished our public prayers had been more conformable to the simplicity of the gospel that we had been contented with what our master and the holy spirit delivered and not made human compositions the standard of salvation but since the church in her wisdom has thought it should be otherwise i have submitted to her authority and been silent on the doctrines she claims a right to determine though some of them to me appear doubtful and others repugnant to scripture beside my studies have been in other fields than that of controversy mathematics and antiquities have employed my time and i have neither taste nor capacity for that criticism which is necessary for the examination of such points greatly however do i honor those who have the ability and patience to go through the work as i must own it is of the most importance and that the orthodox faith is a sad thing if the truth be after all our athanasian believing that christ is no more than gods instrument as st peter and st paul name him a succesful teacher of wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption and that god is to be owned and praised as the true chief and original cause of all spiritual blessings according to the counsel of his own will his own good pleasure purpose etc without partner or second person to entreat and satisfy for us if this be the case may the lord have mercy on our poor orthodox souls and as it may be so i honor you for enquiring into the matter and especially for your good spirit in prefering the things that are eternal when what you thought truth could not be held with things temporal i have mr harcourt continued a very great esteem for you on this account and if i can be of service to you i will he imagined i might want money and if i did he would lend me a hundred guineas without interest payable on my note of hand when i could he immediately took out of his pocketbook a bank note for that sum and pressed me to accept it he likewise invited me to stay at his house while he continued in the country which would be for a month longer he assured me also that i might make it my residence after he left it if i pleased there would be two servants to attend me and there was excellent mutton and other things for my table nor is this all you shall have the key of my study  these offers astonished me and i said most generous sir i return you the thanks of a grateful heart and will ever remember your goodness to me with that sense such uncommon kindness deserves though i cannot enjoy the benefits you would make me happy with as to money i do not want any yet and when i do it will be time enough for me to borrow if i should find any one like you so benevolently disposed as to lend me cash without security and interest and as to staying at your house that offer i cannot accept as i am engaged to a near and rich friend who will be to me a subaltern providence if he can be found and secure me from the evils my attachment to truth has exposed me to one week however i will stay with you since you are so good as to invite me in this kind manner  here then i stayed a week and passed it in a most happy way mr harcourt was fond of me and did every thing in his power to render the place agreeable his lovely daughter was not only as civil as it was possible to be but did me the honor to commence a friendship with me which lasted from that time till death destroyed the golden thread that linked it     an account of harriot eusebia harcourt reader this young lady harriot eusebia harcourt was the foundress of a religious house of protestant recluses who are still a society in that part of richmondshire where first i saw her and her father they are under no vow but while they please to continue members live as they do in nunneries and in piety and in all the parts of the christian temper endeavor a resemblance of their divine lord and master with this distinction however that to the plan of the regards due from man by the divine law to god to his fellow creatures and to himself they add music and painting for their diversion and unbend their minds in these delightful arts for a few hours every day this makes them excel in these particulars they are great masters in all kinds of music and do wonders with the pencil  eusebia was but just turned of twenty when i first saw her in the year      and then her musical performances were admirable  her pictures had the ordonnance coloring and expression of a great master she was born with a picturesque genius and a capacity to give measure and movement to compositions of harmony her music at the time i am speaking of had a most surprising power and in painting long before this time she astonished when she was a child nine years old and had no master she would sketch with a black lead pencil on a sheet of paper the pictures of various kinds that came in her way and make such imitations as deserved the attention of judges this made her father get her an eminent master and she had not been long under his direction when she was able to infuse a soul into her figures and motion into her compositions she not only drew landskips and low subjects with a success great as teniers but evinced by her paintings that she brought into the world with her an aptitude for works of a superior class her pictures show that she was not the last among the painters of history they are as valuable for the merit of the execution as for the merit of the subjects     an account of mrs harcourts pictures of the revelations of s john her histories of the revelations of st john which she finished a little before her death from the first vision to the last demonstrate a genius very wonderful and that her hand was perfected at the same time with her imagination if this series of pictures is not in every respect equal to giottos on the same subject which i have seen in the cloister of st clare at naples yet these paintings are treated with greater truth and show that the imagination of the painter had a hand and eye at its disposal to display the finest and compleatest ideas the great artist is obvious in them  pictures the first picture of this series is a representation of the inside of the glorious temple that was made the grand scene of all the things st john saw in the spirit the goldenlampsconce called the seven candlesticks which afforded the sanctuary all its light and the august personage who appears in refulgent brightness in the vision in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks the majestic and godlike form which the apostle beheld is wonderfully painted he is represented with more than human majesty like raphael in his picture of the eternal father in one of the vatican chapels she does not inspire us merely with veneration she strikes us even with an awful terror elle ninspire pas une simple veneration elleimprime une terreur respectueuse in his right hand this grand person holds the main shaft that supports the six branches of the six lighted lamps and the seventh lamp at the top of the main trunk which gleam like a rod of seven stars as it is written having in his hand seven stars and in this attitude with his face to the apostle he appears in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks the emblems of the churches walking or attending to trim them the churches with a sharp twoedged sword that is the powerful word of god as aaron walked to trim the real lamps with the golden snuffers st john is seen on the floor he is looking in great surprise at the whole appearance and as with amazement he beholds the divine person in the vision he seems struck with dread and going to faint away as he says in the apocalypse  when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead  picture   the next picture in this series is a continuation of or another representation of the inside of the temple the golden lampsconce of seven golden candlesticks and the august personage in refulgent brightness and splendors transcendently glorious but with this difference that in this piece the divine personage does not hold the main shaft of the branches of lights in his right hand or stand in the midst of the candlesticks but notwithstanding his sublime dignity is painted with a godlike compassion in his face and manner and with the greatest tenderness raises and supports the apostle you see him as st john describes him  he laid his right hand upon me the hand which before held the seven stars or lighted golden lamps that exhibited an appearance not unlike a constellation of stars saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that lives even though i was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and i have the keys of hell and of death  one almost hears these words from the lips of the august form so wonderfully is the figure painted  so happily has the pencil counterfeited nature and the apostle appears to revive in transports as he knows from the words that it is his lord and master is speaking to him it is a fine picture  picture   the third painting in this series is the subsequent vision in the  th and  th chapters of the revelation of john the divine  in a part of the heavens that are opened the throne of god is represented by a crystal seat or glory and from it proceed flashings of a bright flame like lightning and thunder to represent the awful majesty of the one and one only true god the supreme lord of all things seven lamps of fire are burning before this throne as emblems of the seven spirits or principal servants of god to show with what purity constancy and zeal the spirits of the just made perfect serve god in the heavenly church and next them appears a crystal sea of great brightness and beauty much more glorious than the brazen sea in the temple which held the water for the use of the priests this sea alludes to that purity that is required in all persons who have the honor and happiness of a near approach to god as he manifests himself on the throne of inaccessible light or in the moral shechinah in this lower world as the first notion of gods glory in the scripture is a physical notion and signifies the manifestation of god by fire light clouds brightness and other meteorous symbols such as the marching pillars of fire and cloud that went before the israelites and the shechinah in the holy of holies which the jews called the visible presence so is there a glory of god in a moral signification there is a shechinah in a physical sense by fire light and refracted colors and there is a moral shechinah or glory when men live in obedience to all the divine laws and walk as children of light this shows the special presence of god in the righteous as much as the cloud of glory did manifest him in the temple the power and wisdom and goodness of god are displayed in the holy lives of men like the heavens they declare his glory and are the visible epistle of christ to the world written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that his spirit dwells in you   the next figures are the four living creatures or cherubim of ezekiel which our english translation very badly renders four beasts and they are placed in the middle of each side of the throne in he whole circle round about full of eyes not only before but behind so as to have a direct and full view every way withoutside them on seats are the four and twenty elders placed in white and shining garments with crowns of gold upon their heads the person who sits on the throne appears in great majesty and glory and round about his throne the most beautiful rainbow is seen to express the glory of god and his faithfulness to his covenant and promise the four living creatures next the throne who represent the angels attendant on the shechinah and have the appearance of a lion a calf a man and an eagle full of eyes and with six wings to express the great understanding and power of the angels their activity constancy and good will  they are drawn in the act of adoring and praising the eternal living god and are answered by the four and twenty elders the representatives of the people the churches so inimitably are all these things painted that the faces of the cherubim and the four and twenty elders seem to move in worship and thanksgiving one acquainted with the divine songs cannot help fansying that he hears the four living creatures saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come who for ever wast and for ever wilt be the one true god the everlasting lord and that the elders that is the christian people reply thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou have created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created  the apostle st john appears in great admiration on account of the things before him but seems more particularly affected by a book sealed with seven seals which the person who sits on the throne holds in his right hand  an angel who is painted in the act of proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof  and a lamb with seven horns and eyes standing just before the throne within the circles of the cherubim and elders this lamb represented as a sacrifice and with seven horns and eyes to show the power wisdom and goodness of our lord in the work of redemption and the accomplishment of all gods designs of wisdom and grace engages the attention and wonder of the apostle and as this lamb of god receives the book from the person on the throne a rising joy appears through the astonishment of st john and seems to be increasing as he hears the living creatures and the elders sing a new song or hymn of a new composition which expresses the peculiar honor of the son of god and our peculiar engagements to him in these words  thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and have redeemed us unto god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation  worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing  blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sits upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever  and as the angels conclude this solemn act of worship by saying amen and the people by worshipping him that lives for ever and ever the true god who lives and reigns from everlasting to everlasting and having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning every one of you from his iniquities the apostle seems in pleasure to join them and shows a sensibility and action that is very wonderful it is a charming picture the divine artist has treated the whole subject with the most elaborate and beautiful expression and with a delightful richness of local colors this painting gives the beholder a full and fine idea of the vision as mrs harcourts pencil has illustrated the revelation of st john in a more satisfactory way than i have seen in any commentator and gives in particular a striking view of popery in her pictures i shall give the reader an account of the other pieces in another place you will find them among other curious things in the appendix to this journal        miss harcourts character but it was not only in painting and in music that miss harcourt excelled she had when i first saw her made great progress in her studies and discovered in her conversation extraordinary abilities she talked wisely and learnedly on many subjects and in so charming a manner that she entered into the possession of the heart and the admiration of all that heard her nor was it only in pure italian spanish and other languages that she could express her notions but in he correctest latin she often spoke to me and for an hour would discourse in the roman tongue with as great ease as if she had been talking english she spoke it without any manner of difficulty which was more than i could do i was slow and paused sometimes but this young lady went on with that volubility of tongue the women are born with the language being latin was no check to her natural fluency of speech  to all this let me add and with truth i can add it that eusebia from the time i was first acquainted with her to her death walked in the fear of the lord and of consequence in the comforts of the holy ghost religion from her infancy as her stated and ordinary business and her sole concern to know and do her duty to god and men the proverbs of solomon and the pattern of christ were her study when a very young girl and from both she acquired a conduct so prudent and evangelical that she seemed at the greatest heights of grace and goodness which a mortal can reach and appeared as one that had made a prodigious proficiency in divine knowledge and in every virtue yet there was nothing gloomy or even formal in her behavior she was good humor itself frank and free quite easy and for ever cheerful  her picture miss harcourt at the time i am speaking of that is in the one and twentieth year of her age had all the qualities that constitute a beauty she was tall and graceful and in every action and her whole behavior to the last degree charming her eyes were vastly fine large and long even with her face black as night and had a sparkling brightness as great as could appear from the refraction of diamonds her hair was as the polished jet deep and glossy and yet her complexion fresh as the glories of the spring and her lips like a beautiful flower  this lady was nine years abroad with her father who died of the plague at constantinople in      and in the course of her travels did me the honor to write me many fine letters in which she obliged me with her remarks on the things and people they saw in many countries we held a correspondence together for a considerable part of the time and in return for her valuable favors i sent her the best account i could give of the matters that came in my way these letters may perhaps appear some day  in the year    mrs harcourt returned to england and brought over with her some ladies who became constituents of her claustral house they formed the most rational and happy society that ever united and during the life of the foundress resided sometimes in one of the western islands but for the most part in richmondshire since her death which happend in the year    they have lived entirely in the north of england separated from all the world by the most dreadful mountains they were but twelve in number for several years but in the sixth year of the instituto mrs harcourt increased it to twentyfour members by taking in twelve eleves or disciples the twelve seniors govern a year about in their turns unless it be the request of the house that the superior for the year past should continue in the office another year this and their easy circumstances secure their peace and as they are ever wise to that which is good and simple concerning evil they lead most happy lives nor can it be otherwise with mortals who cultivate the grace of humility the want of which lies at the bottom of all contentions and by a christian prudence make it their main work to facilitate the practice of piety and to promote the pleasure and the luster of it glorious women to letters arts and piety they devote those hours which others waste in vanities the most senseless and despicable and pursuant to the advice and according to the rule drawn up by their illustrious foundress live as beings that have souls designed for eternity they act continually upon a future prospect and give all diligence in making constant advances toward the perfect day mrs harcourt showed them what an uninspired mortal could do by the means of grace that it was possible for assisted human nature feeble as flesh and blood is to resist temptations the most violent and by the supreme motives of our religion acquit ourselves like christians if there be a devil to assault a corrupt heart to oppose and many difficulties to be encountered yet her conduct was a demonstration that those who are heirs of the heavenly country may choose and prosecute their best interests and improve the divine life to a high degree let us she used to say make salvation not only a concern on the bye but the governing aim through the present life and we shall not only live like the primitive christians but die for our holy faith with more resolution than the worthies of greece and rome though death should appear in all his array of terrors neither adversity nor prosperity could then tempt us to drop a grain of incense before any idol or commit any action that dishonored the gospel let what will happen in all events we should secure the future happiness of our souls and thereby provide for the everlasting glory and felicity of our bodies too in the morning of the resurrection          our return to ulubrae by a dangerous way the twentyfifth day of june i took my leave of miss harcourt and her father and the rest of the good company and on horses i borrowed we returned to the philosophers at ulubrae it was nineteen miles round of most terrible road a great part of it being deep and swampy bottom with holes up to the horses shoulders in some places and for several miles we were obliged to ride on the sides of very steep and craggy mountains in a path so very narrow that we risked life and passed in terror a wrong step would have been destruction beyond recovery it was likewise no small perplexity to find that i was going back again the course being south and southwest and that there was no other way of journeying from mr harcourts to ulubrae but through the pass i first traveled from westmorland unless i rid from mr harcourts into cumberland and then round through bishopric to the valley the gentlemen lived in on then i went at all hazards and in a tedious manner was forced to creep the way but to make some amends the prospects from the hills were fine and things very curious occurred groupes of crests of mountains appeared here and there like large cities with towers and old gothic edifices and from caverns in their sides torrents of water streamed out and tumbled in various courses to the most delightful vales below in some of the vast hills there were openings quite through so as to see the sun at the end of three or four thousand yards and in many of them were sloping caverns very wonderful to behold     a fine chamber in a mountain and a passage from the room to a valley on the other side of the vast precipice i found in one of them near the top of a very high mountain a descent like steps of stairs that was in breadth and height like the isle of a church for  00 yards and then ended at a kind of door or small arched opening that was high enough for a tall man to walk into a grand room which it led to this chamber was a square of    yards and had an arched roof about  0 high the stone of it was a green marble not earthy and opake but pure and crystalline which made it appear very beautiful as the walls were as smooth as if the best polish had made them so there was another opening or door at the other side of this chamber and from it likewise went a descent like steps but the downward passage here was much steeper than the other i had come to and the opening not more than one third as wide and high narrowing gradually to the bottom of the sloping road till it ended in a round hole a yard and a quarter every way i could see the day at the opening below though it seemed at a great distance from me and as it was not dangerous to descend i determined to go down  the descent was     yards in a straight line and opened in a view of meadows scattered trees and streams that were enchantingly fine there appeared to be about four and twenty acres of fine land quite surrounded with the most frightful precipices in the world and in the center of it a neat and pretty little country house on an easy rising ground i could discover with my long glass a young and handsome woman sitting at the door engaged in needle work of some kind and on the margin of a brook hard by another charmer stood angling for fish of some sort a garden appeared near the mansion that was well improved and in the fields were sheep and goats horses and cows cocks and hens ducks and geese were walking about the ground and i could perceive a college of bees the whole formed a charming scene   0 an account of the inhabitants of the valley i came into pleased with the view and impatient to know who the two charmers were i quite forgot the poor situation in which i left tim holding the horses at the mouth of the cavern on the dangerous side of so high a hill and proceeded immediately to the house as soon as i had recovered myself from a fall my foot slipped in the passage about six yards from the day and i came rolling out of the mountain in a violent and surprising manner it was just midday when i came up to the ladies and as they did not see me till they chanced to turn round they were so amazed at my appearing they changed color and one of them shrieked aloud but this fright was soon over on my assuring them that i was their most humble servant and had against my will tumbled out of the hole that was at the bottom of that vast mountain before them this i explained and protested that i had not a thought of paying them a visit when curiosity led me into an opening near the top of the hill as i was traveling on but that when i did get through so wonderful a passage and saw what was still more strange when i arrived in the vale to wit two ladies in so wild and silent a place i judged it my duty to pay my respects and ask if you had any commands that i could execute in the world this was polite they said and gave me thanks but told me they had no favor to ask than that i would dine with them and inform them how it happened that i was obliged to travel over these scarce passable mountains where there was no society nor support to be had beside if in riding here you should receive a mischief there was not a possibility of getting any relief there must be something very extraordinary surely that could cause you to journey over such frightful hills and through the deep bottoms at the foot of them  ladies i replied necessity and curiosity united are the spring that move me over these mountains and enable me to bear the hardships i meet with in these ways forced from home by the cruelties of a stepmother and forsaken by my father on her account i am wandering about the precipices of richmondshire in search of a gentleman my friend to whose hospitable house and generous breast i should be welcome if i could find out where he lives in some part of this remote and desolate region and as my curiosity is more than ordinary and i love to contemplate the works of nature which are very grand and astonishing in this part of the world i have gone many a mile out of my way while i have been looking for several days past for my friend and have ventured into places where very few i believe would go it was this taste for natural knowledge that traveled me down the inside of the mountain i am just come out of if i had not had it i should never have known there was so delightful a little country here as what i now see nor should i have had the honor and happiness of being known to you  but tell me sir one of these beauties said how have you lived for several days among these rocks and desert places as there are no inns in this country nor a house except this here that we know are you the favorite of the fairies and genies  or does the wise man of the hills bring you every night in a cloud to his home  it looks something like it madam i answering said and the thing to be sure must appear very strange but it is like other strange things when the nature of them is known they appear easy and plain this country i find consists for the most part of ranges and groups of mountains horrible to behold and of bogs deep swampy narrow bottoms and waters that fall and run innumerable ways but this is not always the case like the charming plain i am now on there are many flowery and delicious extensive pieces of ground enclosed by vast surrounding hills  the finest intervals betwixt the mountains the sweetest interchange between hill and valley i believe in all the world is to be found in richmondshire and in several of those delightful vales i discovered inhabitants as in this place but the houses are so separated by fells scarce passable and torrents of water that those who live in the center of one group of mountains know not any thing of agreeable inhabitants that may dwell on the other side of the hills in an adjacent vale if there had been a fine spot at the bottom of the precipice i found the opening in and people living there as might have been the case you ladies who live here could have no notion of them as you knew nothing of a passage from the foot to the summit of yonder mountain within side of the vast hill and if you did would never venture to visit that way and as there is not a pass in this chain of hills to ride or walk through to the other side of them but the way out of this valley we are now in as i judge from the trending of the mountains all round us must be an opening into some part of cumberland for this reason stanemore hills may have several families among them though you have never heard of them and i will now give you an account of some who behaved in the most kind and generous manner to me here i began to relate some particulars concerning my friend price and his excellent wife the admirable mrs burcot and mrs fletcher the philosophers who lived at ulubrae to whom i was returning and the generous mr harcourt and his excellent daughter whom i left in the morning and at whose house i arrived by traveling up the dark bowels of a tremendous mountain as on the contrary i arrived at theirs by a descent through yonder frightful hill till i came rolling out by a fall within in a very surprising and comical way a way that would have made you laugh ladies or in a fright cry out if you had happened to be walking near the hole or opening in the bottom of that hill when by a slip of my foot in descending a few yards from the day i tumbled over and over not only down what remained of the dark steep within but the high sloping bank that reaches from the the outside of the opening to the first flat part of the vale there is nothing wonderful then in my living in this lone country for so many days the only strange thing is considering the waters and swamps that i was not drowned or an account of the precipices and descents i have been engaged on that i did not break my neck or my bones but so long we are to live as providence has appointed for the accomplishment of the grand divine scheme till the part allotted us is acted we are secure when it is done we must go and leave the stage for other players to come on  the ladies seemed greatly entertained with my histories and especially with my tumbling out of the mountain into their vale they laughed very heartily but told me if they had happened to be sitting near the hole in the bottom of that tremendous rocky mountain as they sometimes did and often wondered where the opening went to and that i had come rolling down upon them they would have been frightened out of their senses for they must have thought it a very strange appearance without hearing the history of it they must think it a prodigious occurrence or exception from the constant affairs of nature  this might be ladies i answered but from seeing me before your eyes you must own that many things may be fact which at first may seem to exceed the common limits of truth impossible or supernatural some people conclude many cases to be that have not the least difficulty in them but happen to be made of occurrences and places they have not seen nor heard the like of before things thought prodigious or incredible by ignorance and weakness will appear to right knowledge and a due judgment very natural and accountable to the thoughts  here a footman came up to us to let his mistress know that dinner was on the table and we immediately went in to an excellent one the ladies were very civil to me and exerted a good humor to show me i suppose that my arrival was not disagreeable to them though i tumbled upon their habitation like the genie of the caverns from the hollows of the mountains they talked in an easy rational manner and asked me many questions that showed they were no strangers to books and men and things but at last it came to pass that the eldest of those ladies who acted as mistress of the house and seemed to be about one or two and twenty desired to know the name of the gentleman i was looking for among these hills and called my friend my reason sir for asking is that you answer so exactly in face and person to a description of a gentleman i heard not very long ago that i imagine it may be in my power to direct you right  madam i replied the gentleman i am in search of is charles turner who was my schoolfellow and my senior by a year in the university which he left two years before i did and went from dublin to the north of england to inherit a paternal estate on the decease of his father there was an uncommon friendship between this excellent young man and me and he made me promise him in a solemn manner to call upon him as soon as it was in my power assuring me at the same time that if by any changes and chances in this lower hemisphere i was ever brought into any perplexities and he alive i should be welcome to him and what he had and share in his happiness in this world while i pleased this is the man i want a man for his years one of the wisest and best of the race his honest heart had no design in words he ever spoke what he meant and therefore i am sure he is my friend  to this the lady answered sir since charles turner is the man you want your enquiry is at an end for you are now at his house and i who am his sister bid you welcome to skelsmorevale in his name he has been for a year and a half last past in italy and a little before he went gave me such a description of you as enabled me to guess who you were after i had looked a while at you and he added to his description a request to me that if you should chance to call here while i happened to be in the country that i would receive you as if you were himself and when i removed if i could not or did not choose to stay longer in the country that i would make you an offer of the house and give you up all the keys of it to make use of it and his servants and the best things the place affords till his return which is to be he says in less than a year now sir in regard to my brother and his friend i not only offer you what he desired i should but i will stay a month here longer than i intended for this lady my cousin martha jacquelot and i had determined to go to scarborough next week and from thence to london nor is this all as i know i shall the more oblige my brother the civiller i am to you i will when the scarborough season is over if you choose to spend the winter here come back to skelsmorevale and stay till mr turner returns  this discourse astonished me to the last degree  to hear that i was at my friend turners house  he abroad and to be so for another year the possession of his seat offered me and his charming sister so very civil and good as to assure me she would return from the spaw and stay with me till her brother came home these were things so unexpected and extraordinary that i was for some time silent and at a loss what to say i paused for some minutes with my eyes fastened on this beauty and then said  miss turner the account you have given of your brother and the information that i am now at his house  his friendly offers to me by you and your prodigious civility in resolving to return from scarborough to stay with me here till your brother arrives are things so strange so uncommon and exceedingly generous and kind that i am quite amazed at what i hear and want words to express my obligations and the grateful sense i have of such favors accept my thanks and be assured that while i live i shall properly remember the civility and benevolence of this day and be ever ready if occasion offered and the fates should put it in my power to make a due return your offer madam in particular is so high an honor done me and shows a spirit so humane as i told you i was an unfortunate one that i shall ever think of it with pleasure and mention it as a rare instance of female worth but as to accepting these most kind offers i cannot do it since mr turner is from home i will go and visit another friend i have in this country to whom i shall be welcome i believe till your brother returns to live by myself here at my friends expense would not be right nor agreeable to me and as to confining you madam in staying with me i would not do it for the world sir miss turner replied in respect of my staying here it will be no confinement to me i assure you my heart is not set upon going to london it was only want of company made miss jacquelot and me think of it and if you will stay with us we will not even go to scarborough this season  this was goodness indeed but against staying longer than two or three days i had many good reasons that made it necessary for me to depart beside the unreasonableness of my being an expense to mr turner in his absence or confining his sister to the country there was ortonlodge where i had left o fin my lad at work to which i could not avoid going again and there was miss melmoth on whom i had promised to wait and did intend to ask her if she would give me her hand as i liked her and her circumstances and fansied she would live with me in any retreat i pleased to name which was a thing that would be most pleasing to my mind it is true if charles turner had come home while i stayed at his house it was possible i might have got his sister who was a very great fortune but this was an uncertainty however and in his absence i could not in honor make my addresses to her if it should be against his mind it would be acting a false part while i was eating his bread miss turner to be sure had fifty thousand pounds at her own disposal and so far as i could judge of her mind during the three days that i stayed with her at skelsmorevale i had some reason to imagine her heart might be gained but for a man worth nothing to do this in her brothers house without his leave was a part i could not act though by missing her i had been brought to beg my bread three days then only i could be prevailed on to stay and the time indeed was happily spent  miss turners character miss turner was goodhumoured sensible and discreet as one could wish a woman to be talked pleasantly upon common subjects and was well acquainted with the three noblest branches of polite learning antiquity history and geography it was a fine entertainment to hear her she likewise understood music and sung and played well on the small harpsichord but her moral character was what shed the brightest luster on her soul her thoughts and words were ever employed in promoting gods glory her neighbors benefit and her own true welfare and her hand very often in giving to the poor one third of her fine income she devoted to the miserable and was in every respect so charitable that she never indulged the least intemperance in speaking she detested that calumny and reproach which assassinates a credit as much as she abhorred the shedding a mans blood the goodness of her heart was great indeed the integrity of her life was glorious she was perfection so far as the thing is consistent with the nature and state of man here  as it was possible for a mortal to be exempt from blame in life and blemish of soul an absolute exemption from faults cannot be the condition of any one in this world but to the ladies i now speak you may like miss turner be eminently good if you will do your best to be perfect in such a kind and degree as human frailty does admit     miss jacquelots character miss jacquelot was by the head lower than miss turner and her hair the very reverse of my friends sister that is black as the raven but she had a most charming little person and a mind adorned with the finest qualifications reason never lost the command in her nor ceased to have an influence upon whatever she did it secured her mind from being ever discomposed and disengaged her life from the inconveniences which a disregard to reason exposes us to by a management it dictated she enjoyed perpetual innocence and peace she never uttered a word that entrenched upon piety infringed charity or disturbed the happiness of any one nor at any time showed the least sign of a vain and light spirit yet she had a sportfulness of wit and fancy that was delightful when she could handsomely and innocently use it and loved to exert the sallies of wit in a lepid way when they had no tendency to defile or discompose her mind to wrong or harm the hearer or her neighbor or to violate any of the grand duties incumbent on us piety charity justice and sobriety every thing that reason made unfit to be expressed in relation to these virtues she always carefully avoided but otherwise such things excepted would enliven and instruct by good sense in jocular expression in a way the most charming and pleasing she was very wise agreeable and happy she was very good and worthy  this young lady was a great master on the fiddle and very knowing in connoissance she painted well and talked in an astonishing manner for a woman and for her years of pictures sculpture and medals she was indeed a fine creature in soul and body     my departure from skelsmorevale with these ladies i spent three days in skelsmorevale and the time we talked walked played and laughed away sometimes we rambled about the hills and low adown the dales sometimes we sat to serious ombre and often went to music by the fallingstreams miss turner sung miss jacquelot played the fiddle and on my german flute i breathed the softest airs we were a happy three and parted with regret on every side fain would they have had me stay and scarborough and london should be thought of no more but the reason of things was against it and the   th day of june i took my leave through the mountain i had descended i went up again to tim and my horses who were stabled in the mouth of the cavern above and had got provender from the vale below     a morning reflection on the rising sun and the great spirit who created it the sun was rising as we mounted the horses and struck me so powerfully with the surpassing splendour and majesty of its appearance so cheared me by the gladsome influences and intimate refreshment of its allenlivening beams that i was contriving as i rid on an apology for the first adorers of the solar orb and imagined they intended nothing more than the worship of the transcendent majesty of the invisible creator under the symbol of his most excellent and nearly resembling creature and this according to some imperfect tradition that man as a compound being had in the beginning a visible glorious presence of jehovah elohim  a visible exhibition of a more distinguished presence by an inexpressible brightness or glory this is some excuse for the first worshippers of the solar orb and when the thing consecrated to the imagery and representation of its maker became the rival of his honors and from being a help to devotion was advanced into the supreme object of it yet considering the prodigious glory of this moving orb and that all animated nature depends upon its auspicious presence we cannot wonder that the egyptian ruralists without a creed and without a philosophy should be tempted to some warmer emotion than a merely speculative admiration and inclined to something of immediate devotion that universal chorus of joy that is manifested at the illustrious solemnities of opening sunshine might tempt the weak to join in a seemingly religious acclamation at least i am sure there is much more to be said for this species of idolatry than for the papists worshipping dead men stocks bones and clouts they have not only revelation expressly against them  thou shall worship the lord thy god and him only shall thou serve matt iv  0  neither shall thou set up any image or pillar deuteronomy xvi    but downright reason demonstrates that the things are useless to the preservers and offensive to god whereas on the contrary when the eye beholds that glorious and important luminary of heaven and considers the benefits dispensed to mankind by the means of its most beautiful and invigorating beams it might strike not only an unpractised thinker and cause the vulgar who are not able of themselves to raise their thoughts above their senses and frame a notion of an invisible deity to acknowledge the blessings they received by a devotion to this fansied visible exhibition of divinity but even some of the wise ones who were a degree above the absurdity of popular thinking might be led to address themselves to the golden sun in splendour likest heaven they might ascribe the origin of their own existence and the worlds to this seemingly adequate cause and genial power of the system when they beheld him returning again in the east as i now see him after the gloom and sadness of the night again the restorer of light and comfort and the renewer of the world regent of the day and all thhorizon round invested with bright rays that all inferior nature the earths own form and the supports of its animated inhabitants seem to depend on his dispensing authority and to be the effects of his prolific virtue and secret operation they might suppose in the corruption of tradition or when the reveled truth and direction was lost and reason not as now in its maturity of age and observation that some kind of glory should be given to the subordinate divinity as they fansied of this heavenly body and that some homage was due to the fountain of so much warmth and beneficence this i imagine may account for the earliest kind of idolatry the worship paid to the sun the effects of his presence are so great and his splendor so overpowering and astonishing that veneration and gratitude united might seduce those ignorant mortals to deify so glorious an object when they had lost the guard of traditionary revelation the weakness of tradition when the tribes went off from noah in pelegs days in the era of the deluge   0 that is so many years after the flood we must in reason suppose that they had from the venerable patriarch a final and farewell relation of the creation and the state of innocence and the fall the institution of worship and the hope of acceptance and the promised seed we may believe they had at going off a distinct repetition of all the capital articles of their faith they received to be sure a clear review of the facts and revelations which adam and noah had the knowledge of and in a compend of every doctrine and duty speculative and practical especially the doctrine of the being of a god his unity and perfections had a sufficient fund of useful knowledge to set up with in the new world this is natural behavior in all good parents and we may conclude that the pious patriarch acted in this manner when he sent his relations away but this oral tradition was liable to a gradual declension and sunk at last into a state of evanescence doctrines deduced from facts long since past and known by tradition only become precarious the tradition is rendered obscure and dubious it might remain pretty perfect while peleg reu serug nabor and terah lived as they had their informations from noah and were thoroughly advised to make god the object of their supreme love and fear and trust and worship and to practice all virtue and righteousness toward each other as the great instruments and means of a general happiness with an earnest tenderness these things were recomended to them but as the people who came after them never saw noah and their information depended on relators who had it from relators a dimness prevailed upon the ancient facts and distance and other objects overshadowed them a depravation of tradition might likewise arise from relators forgetting material circumstances and from a misapprehension of ancient facts there might likewise be many that designedly corrupted these facts and out of a dislike to truth and a distaste to virtue did their best to weaken the principles of religion ingenious bad men there were among mankind then as well as in our time and as there was no written system and history to go by they might give the ancient story a turn more favorable to sinners by this means contradiction and obscurity came on endless fables were introduced and truth was disguised corrupted and lost  in respect however of an infinite mind the author of the universe it must be confessed that those men could not have lost a right notion of him if they had been faithful to themselves for the works of nature still remained in all their wondrous beauty and useful order and furnished daily evidence that neither chance nor undesigning necessity could produce the beautiful and harmonious the regular and convenient the amiable and good which their eyes beheld whatever way they turned not only the heavens the air the earth the sea demonstrated the wisdom and goodness of god but every beast every fowl every fish they could take every plant and tree showed an exact proportion of parts and discovered design in the whole of its constitution their own intelligence ought likewise to have led them to the great original it was formed by an uncreated mind there must be a divine understanding or there never could be pure intellection in man it is impossible to solve the phenomenon of moral entities without the being of god if it were possible for atoms rencountring in an infinite void to produce by collision and undirected impulse the corporeal systems and the various beauteous forms which we see yet the wild and senseless hypothesis could not be applied by atheism itself to the production of ideas entirely independent of matter and all its properties and powers we must have them from an intelligent cause the human mind is so framed that we may surely infer the cause of the constitution was ntelligent so that god did not in any age leave himself without witness or evidence of his own being and perfection we have full proof of creating ruling intelligence all the works of nature proclaim it and especially the human soul  but through negligence and false notions of religion brought in by impious men corrupt customs and prejudices of education we find that not only virtue was lost soon after the dispersion but even the notion of god idolatry and wickedness prevailed for the greatest part of the grand period of tradition from the dispersion to the imparting the knowledge of letters by moses this shows the folly vanity and inconsistency of all tradition and that for the support of virtue and true religion in the world a written word is necessary in the early ages of the postdiluvian world religious knowledge was decayed and we can trace the origin and beginning of idolatry very high even in serugs time who had received a compend of religion from noah when he became infirm by years and was no longer able to inspect the manners of his colony and go about to take cognizance of their irregularities we find the innovation had begun we read in the books that terah the father of abraham was an idolater in the   0th year of his age which was the year that serug died and to be sure that was not the first year of his false religion and it is not to be supposed that when he went forth a worshiper of false gods from ur of the chaldees with abraham his son and lot etc that the young people were safe from the infection it prevailed before abraham was warned to withdraw and of consequence he was one of the ungodly that is an idolater to me it is plain st paul says so they all served other gods in all probability that was beginning to be the case when abraham was born which was in the year after the flood     and as he was forty years old when his father marched him from ur we may think he was then a settled idolater and if it had not been that the divine mercy called him by revelation to truereligion he and the whole world might have remained in their gross innovation eternal strangers to the original truths the free grace of the universal father took him and his posterity into covenant and used them as a mean to restore true piety and virtue to the world till such time as he was pleased to show his astonishing mercy and inestimable love in christ jesus the creator and governor of gentiles as well as jews in his infinite wisdom proceeded in this manner first selecting one nation to be a beacon upon a hill a public voucher of the being and providence of god and in the fullness of time blessing the human race with a gospel and redeemer adored be his goodness then for the written word this only can preserve the doctrine of religion free from corruption the miserable papists may trust to their traditions and wander where no covenant is to be found but the religion of protestants must be the gospel of christ the written doctrine of the apostles let us receive the unwritten word of rome let us despise there is no security in tradition it is insufficient for the preservation of truth and for that reason god gave us the writings of inspired men    and wanted those helps to judgment which are derived from the experience observation and reasoning of past times the specious idolatry might have been introduced and something tolerably plausible perhaps was pleaded by the better heads of those times exclusive of an imperfect notion of the deitys appearing by shechinah and that the sun might be the visible exhibition as observed they might in the next place conclude from the extraordinary motion of the luminary that he was an animated being and noble intelligence placed in the highest post of honor and usefulness and employed by god as his first minister and servant for which reason they thought it their duty to magnify and venerate the sun whom the creator had exalted so high as the chief ministers of kings are had in honor which is reflected back on their royal masters thus might the novel impiety come on they might in the beginning worship the sun as the shechinah appearing by a glorious light or in a celestial train attending the presence which at so great a distance must appear in an indistinct luminous vision but more generally as the minister of god an animated being who had a principle of consciousness put into it as the human body has seated in it a human soul and that this glorious creature was enabled to perform the etherial journeys by its own understanding and will and to make all lower nature happy by his benign and diffusive influence could see as far as he is seen and every way was fitted for the noble work he had to execute thus did the sun commence a god he must they thought from every appearance in his wondrous useful course have the most exalted powers be wise and benevolent great and good and when the worship of this luminary was once established it could not be long before the moon was deified and then the stars became conservators of the universe from thence idolatry went on and added to the heavenly bodies the emblematic doctrine and animal apotheosis artificial fire was consecrated and made the symbol of sidereal splendors deity was exhibited to the multitude in the forms of its effects and innumerable orders of inferior divinities by degrees sprang up successive enlargements of the system of natural apotheosis prevailed and at last the world which ought only to have been regarded as the magnificent theater of divine perfections was itself blasphemously adored as the independent proprietor of them  it is evident from hence that a reveled rule was wanting or man had need of physics to suppress the rising transports of a too eager gratitude and guard against the inclination to worship this rising lucid being now so glorious before me whose motion is so steady and uniform swift regular and useful that it seems to manifest itself a wise and intelligent being without the lights of philosophers or the supernatural assistance of religion it was hard for recent and wondering mortals to refrain from worshipping that beautiful body as they saw it proceeded with the greatest harmony and shed innumerable blessings on them but pure reveled religion diffuses such a light as manifests the error and a correct and philosophic reasoning in this improved age the safe guide and proper arbitrator of religion not only refuses to address itself to that god of the ancient popular theology but proves the worship impious and absurd  right reason and revelation demonstrate from the matchless graces and glories of nature which occur in great variety and without number wherever we turn our eyes that there is a creator of infinite power wisdom and goodness who beautifully provides for the uses and occasions of human life and produces repeated millions of objects that bear the stamp of omnipotence and remain perpetual monuments of the divine benevolence manifold are thy works o lord in wisdom have thou made them all  and especially when from the earth i lift up my eyes to the heavens and behold among the wonders of the firmament that vast and magnificent orb the sun now rising before me brightning by degrees the horizon and pouring the whole flood of day upon us the wonderful and grand scene strikes powerfully on my mind and causes an awful impression with sentiments of the greatest admiration i consider the illustrious object and feel the kindly heat of that bright luminary inspiring me with more than usual gladness and what power is it that supplies this fountain of light and heat with his genial and inexhausted treasure  who dispenses it with such munificent yet wise profusion it must be some almighty being it must be the work of the deity that is the powerful wise and good parent of mankind the maker preserver and ruler of the world for his perfections are stamped upon the work the evidence of reason declares it chance or necessity cannot form or guide an active understanding only and intending cause can produce and direct and this cause must be allruling wisdom and unlimited power in conjunction with the most amiable goodness this is plain to a thorough and rational examination a supreme being an eternal selfexistent mind who comprehends and presides over all must impart the benefits of that glorious creature before me using it as an inanimate unconscious instrument of conveying light heat and prolific influences to the earth which by infinite power is rendered as much active in sending the vegete juices through the vessels of all plants as the sun is in diffusing its rays upon the surface of the globe we inhabit the sun and moon and stars are but instruments in his hand for bringing about mechanically whatever good effects he has created them to produce our holy religion and philosophic reasoning evince this truth this glorious sun bears the signatures of its author and the finger of god is discernible every where the wisdom and loving kindness of the lord are visible whatever way we turn his bounty appears by its constant yet voluntary communication and is the more to be admired as it is a neverfailing principle this rising luminary that visits our earth is in particular a daily fresh instance of the divine favor and did not gods goodness only prevent its suspension we should be involved in the utmost horror nay inevitable ruin and when in the evening it leaves us overspread by the darkness to visit others with its benign influences the change is charming for night gives man a necessary vacation from the labors of the day in sleep he takes the sweetest refreshment till this rising sun by the beneficent direction of its great author again appears in grace and splendour and displays the face of nature in unspeakable beauties every where the bounty of the supreme spirit i see diffused through air through earth and in the waters no place is without witnesses of his liberality and life is the care of his providence  of him then should our songs be and our talking of all his wonderful works we should join in adoring him and acknowledge him worthy to receive glory and honor and power who has created all things and for his pleasure they are and were created and it follows that we should likewise absolutely submit to this sovereign being and ever resign ourselves to his direction and disposal where can ignorance and impotence find so safe and sure a refuge as in infinite wisdom and almighty power     a delightful landscape betwixt the mountains in this manner were my thoughts employed as we rid over the brows of many high hills with the rising sun before me till we descended to a narrow wet bottom which trended due west for an hour and brought us to the foot of another high mountain this we ascended with the horses as far as it was possible to bring them and from thence i climbed up to the top by a steep craggy way near  00 yards this was very difficult and dangerous but i had an enchanting prospect when i gained the summit of the hill a valley near a mile in breadth appeared betwixt the opposite mountains and that on which i stood and a river was running through it that spread sometimes into little lakes and sometimes fell headlong from the rocks in sounding cascades the finest meadows and little thickets bordered those waters on every side and beyond them the vast hills had a fine effect in the view some were covered with forest and some with precipitating streams i was charmed with this assemblage of the beauties of nature it is a more delightful landscape than art has been able to form in the finest gardens of the world     a pretty country seat the descent was easy to this beautiful vale and after i had feasted my eyes with the prospect of the place i went down to see who lived in a house covered with creeping greens that stood by a sonorous waterfall some wise one perhaps i said who scorns the character of the libertine or the sot and to the pursuits of avarice and ambition leaves the world to enjoy in this fine retreat the true happiness of man by embracing that wisdom which is from above and aspiring to an equality with saints and angels happy man if such a man be here or it may be some happy pair possess this charming spot of earth and in discharging all the duties of the matrimonial relation enjoy that fullness of satisfactions and felicities which the divine institution was designed to produce happy pair indeed if such a pair be here     a strange meeting but when i came near the mansion no human creature could i see nor for some time could i find an entrance any way the gate of the garden in which the house stood was fast and so was every window and door but as the gardens were in fine order and full of fruits vegetables and flowers i knew it must be an inhabited place though its people were from home with my pole therefore i leaped a deep moat which surrounded the garden and for half an hour continued walking about it pulling some things and looking at others in hopes that some one might be seen no soul however appeared and i was going to return to my horses when by accident i came to a descent of stairs that was planted round with shade of laurel evergreen and branching palm down i went immediately i walked through a long arched passage in which two lamps were burning and at the end of it came to an open door that admitted me into an entry which led to a flight of stairs should i go any farther was the question if any one within i might greatly offend and if it was the habitation of rogues i might find myself in a pound what shall i do then go on says curiosity and bravely finish the adventure  softly then i ascended listening by the way if i could hear any voice and proceeded upwards to the first floor a door was there open and on my tiptoes i went to look in but all i could see was a room well furnished and through it i passed to another which was likewise full of fine things and had a door unlocked that opened into a large library the books were all bound in vellum in an extraordinary manner the collection valuable and most judiciously ordered mathematical instruments of all sorts were on a table and every thing looked as belonging to a scholar and man of fortune great was my amazement as i saw no living creature i knew not what to think of all these things nor did my astonishment diminish when i went from the library into two very handsome bedchambers and saw in one of them the apparel of a woman in the other the dress of a man  musing on these matters and looking over the books i continued near an hour when i turned round to depart and saw at the door of the library i was in a gentleman and two young ladies in ridingdresses who seemed more than amazed at the sight of me the mans face i knew very well and soon remembered he was one of the company that came over with me from ireland in the skinner and jenkins and a person i had thought a very odd man for he never stirred out of his birth all the while he was on board nor spoke a syllable to any one except myself and that only for a couple of hours after we landed when he was pleased to single me out and requested we might dine together to which i said with pleasure sir and he came with miss melmoth and me to our inn with us he sat for the time i have said and talked like a man of sense and virtue he was but three or four years older than i was and yet so very grave that in respect of temper he was fit for the bench he told me he lived in too remote a place ever to expect to see me in the country but he had a house in london where he was every winter if not hindered by sickness and to a part of it i should be welcome if it was agreeable to me to improve our acquaintance many other civil things he said and showed a regard for me that i little expected and could not but wonder at all this made me as well known to him as he was remembered by me but he looked as it were scared at the sight of me in the place i now appeared in where i stood leaning on my long pole when he came to the closet door and was reading out the following lines in a book i chanced to take into my hand to which i added a few reflections     a passage i chanced to turn to in a greek author  est ut dicis vera praedicas vir sapiens quae ad deos spectant pulcherrimum sacrificium et cultum esse maximum ducito si teipsum quam optimum et justissimum praebeas  praebere se quam optimum ac justissimum pluris apud deos quam multae victimae sperandum est enim tales potius quam qui victimas multas prosternunt quidpiam boni a diis immortalibus accepturos quam optimum cor ac justissimum ad aras feramus and bonum a numine semper lucrabimus  true most excellent sage rectitude and benevolence are the perfection of rational nature and when by philosophy we acquire a temper disposition and action that are conformable to the truth of things and continually display strict justice and universal charity we offer the noblest sacrifice to heaven and are consimilated with the deity by this divine affection or order and goodness we manifest a continual use and employment of ourselves for the glory of the supreme virtue and may by this means expect to obtain the infinite mercy of god when slaughtered hecatombs are despised and the creeds of incomprehensible mysteries and the external modes and forms of churchism may be considered only as the weakness and blindness of reverend heads thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of oil speculative faith rites and ceremonies are nothing abstracted from that temper and affection which unites us to the deity and to the whole system of rationals virtue and charity is religion     mr berrisforts kind reception of me this passage and reflection pronounced very loud with an enthusiasm that seizes me when i take a classic in my hand added greatly to the astonishment of finding me in the closet and for some time the gentleman was not able to speak or come forward but at last moving toward me as i did to him the moment i saw him he said by what strange chance have i the favor of seeing you here inform me i beseech you in the name of friendship what surprising accident has thrown you on this solitude without horse or servant  and how did you get over the broad moat of water as the two garden gates were locked  mr berrisfort i answered you may well wonder at seeing me in this remote and silent part of the world and especially at my being in your study without either horse or attendant in waiting that you could find on coming home but the thing was all natural in the common course of events as you shall hear  three weeks after you left me at whitehaven i set out from that place for brugh under stanemore and went from thence up the northern mountains in search of a gentleman i had some business with who lives but a few miles beyond you and on my return from his house as the road lay very high on the side of yonder vast hill i quitted my horse out of curiosity to climb up to the top of the mountain and see what kind of country lay on the other side of this long range of high hills it was with great difficulty i got up to the pike and few perhaps but myself would attempt it i was rewarded however by the fine prospect and seeing the descent on this side easy and a house and large gardens before me i could not refrain from going down to the bottom i marched on to take a view of the mansion and improvements and as i saw some ver fine things in the gardens and no sign of any living creature the gates shut and every place to appearance fastened i leaped the moat with this pole and after i had wandered about the ground by accident came to the shady enclosure in which i found the descending stairs from the garden and seeing the lamps burning in the passage could not avoid going down and proceeded till i arrived at this fine library my admiration was great you may be sure and the books too strong a temptation for me not to mind them with great pleasure i looked into many of them and at last opened the greek writer i was reading out when you came to the door of your study such were the causes that brought me where you find me  mr berrisfort replied sir i am glad there was any thing in the force and operation of casualties that could bring you to my house and i assure you upon my word that you are most heartily welcome as i lay in my cabin on shipboard i conceived a great regard for you on account of many things i heard you say and particularly for your lively arguments with dr whaley before the storm began in defense of the divine unity and against that miserable theology which the monks have invented and continue to support though it militates with the reveled truths of god and the reason and fitness of things i was greatly pleased with your different definitions of churchism and religion and honored you not a little for what you said in opposition to unintelligible mystery and the glare of ceremony at the same time that you contended for the worship of the universal father and that sober righteous and godly life which springs from the love of truth virtue and moral rectitude once more then i assure you sir i am most heartily glad to see you and i shall take it as a great favor if you will pass the summer with me in this wild country place every thing shall be made as agreeable as possible and exclusive of this closet of books which you shall possess while you stay here we will hunt and set and shoot and enjoy all the pleasures of the field but in the mean time as it is now ten oclock we ought to think of breakfast and he desired his sister a most charming creature to call for it immediately and i soon saw several servants bring in every thing that was elegant and excellent he told me i need be under no uneasiness about my mare and horses for there was a steep narrow way for them to come down to his stables about half a mile from the place i left them and he would immediately send one of his servants to bring them  this was vastly civil and affectionate and i told mr berrisfort that i was under great obligations to him for his goodness which i should ever have an extreme sense of but i was obliged to go on upon business a few days however i would enjoy the happiness he offered me and we passed them in a very delightful manner     manner of living at yeoveringreen early in the morning we went out with the hounds and for half a dozen hours had the dogs in full cry before us we had hawks and pointers in the afternoon and enjoyed abroad all the sports of the field within when our labors were over we had the most elegant dinners and suppers every thing of meat and drink that the best taste could desire and the conversation was excellent after the repasts   0 characters of mr berrisfort his sister and miss fox mr berrisfort was a man of letters and breeding and the ladies had sense and were no strangers to the best english books they understood no other language than their mother tongue but the choicest authors of every kind that our country has produced they had read with great care the master of yeoveringreen was a learned worthy polite man free in discourse if he knew his company and liked them but otherwise quite mute and he was instructive in every thing he said his sister and cousin were very good discreet in their behavior temperate in their discourse and easy in their manner they had no learning they pretended to no criticism but talked without vanity of the best things and what they did say they expressed in a most agreeable way there was no being dull with such people in such a place i have seen very few young ladies in my time that i liked better than those girls they both charmed me with their persons their faces their good manners and their chat but i could not enough admire miss berrisfort for one particular in which she not only excelled miss fox but all the women that i have ever seen this was in hunting in the field she seemed the silvershafted queen     the daring spirit of miss berrisfort in hunting mr berrisfort and miss fox followed the dogs with caution and never attempted any thing that could hazard their necks or their bones but the charming juliet berrisfort had so violent a passion for the diversion of the field that she was seized with a kind of enthusiasm when she heard the cry of the hounds and as if she had been the goddess of the silver bow or one of her immortal train went on without a thought of her having brittle limbs she leaped every thing to keep in with the dogs fivebar gates the most dangerous ditches and pales and drove fullspeed down the steepest hills if it was possible for a horse to keep his feet on them she frightened me the first morning i was out with her she made my heart bounce a thousand times i expected every now and then that she would break her neck that neck where lillies grew i was reckoned a very desperate rider by all that knew me and yet with this young lady i paused several times at some leaps when she did not hesitate at all over she went in a moment without thinking of the perils in her way and then if i broke my neck i could not but pursue  when glory called and beauty led the way what man could think of life and poorly stay    an account of two falls in the field it was not in my complexion to stay and by that means i got a terrible fall the second day whether by my own fault or my horses i cannot tell but as no bone was broke and i had received no other mischief than a black eye a bruise in my side and a torn face i was soon on my mare again and by miss berrisforts side she laughed immoderately at me while the dogs were at fault as my bones were safe and advised me with a humorous tenderness to ride with her brother and miss fox it was not however very long before i had more satisfaction than i desired for in half an hours time we came to some pales which the stag went over and i leaped first but miss berrisforts horse though one of the best in the world unfortunately struck and cleared them in such a manner that the lovely juliet came over his head she fell very safely in high grass where i waited for her for fear of an accident of any kind and did not receive the least hurt but in the violence of the motion and the way she came down the curtain was thrown on her breast and she lay for some moments stunned upon the ground in a minute however i snatched her up and set her on her feet she came to herself immediately and thanked me for my care of her but was vexed to the heart at what had happened she requested i would not mention the thing to her brother or miss fox and hoped i would be so generous as not to speak of it to any one  miss berrisfort i said it is not in my soul to extract a mirth from the bad fortune of any one and much less is it in my power to ridicule or laugh at a woman of distinction for an accident like this you may believe me when i promise you upon my word and swear it by every sacred thing that i will not so much as hint it to any mortal while you remain in this world this gave her some relief and by her foot in my hands i lifted her into her saddle again  two benefits were from this mischance derived one was that for the future this lady hunted with a little more caution and did not take the leaps she was wont to do  the other that it gained me her heart though i did not know it for many months and thereby secured for me the greatest happiness against a day of distress from the most trivial things the most important do often spring but i proceed     a religious conversation between bob berrisfort and jack buncle vexatious as the fall was to this young lady it was i however that had all the pain by the mischief i received when my horse threw me my eye was in a sad black way my side troubled me and the skin was off half my face yet i did not much mind it as the diversion was good and that immediately after the death of the stag we hastened back to an excellent dinner and some flasks of old generous wine to which bob berrisfort and i sat for two or three hours the ladies had left us to change their dress and walk in the gardens and we fell into very serious chat  i am thinking mr berrisfort said after a considerable pause as we sat smoking a pipe over against each other that the cause you gave dr whaley on shipboard for the decay of christianity was the best i have heard i remember you told this divine that it was not a want of faith in the present generation that made so many renounce christianity for the world were no enemies to a republication of the law of nature by the man christ jesus but the thing that makes infidels and supports infidelity is the extravagant doctrines which the theologers have obtruded upon the church as essential parts of christianity enthusiasm absurdity and error and the blind and bloody scenes of cruelty and superstition have been the great stumbling blocks to mankind and given the most sad severe and lasting stabs to the interests and success of the pure and peaceable gospel of christ this is just but exclusive of this may we not say that there are so many seeming contradictions and a multiplicity of obscure passages in it that it looks as if it could not be in its present condition a rule of faith and that christians differ so much about the meaning of the texts of their bible that reason knows not what to say to a religion so variously represented it is not only the two great camps papist against protestant and protestant against papist who make the religion as different as black and white that the reformed mission at malabar tell the indians they must not hearken to the jesuits if they expect salvation and the monks at coromandel declare on the contrary to those indians that they will be damned to eternity if they are converted to what the danish ministers call christianity which made the famous bramin padmanaba say that it was impossible for him to become a christian till the learned christian priests had agreed among themselves what christianity was for he had not erudition and judgment enough to decide in the intricate controversy but exclusive of this protestants are so divided among themselves even the church of england against the church of england  dissenters against dissenters  and give such different accounts of the reveled system that it requires more understanding and strict serious enquiry than the generality of people have or can spare to be able to determine in what party of the celebrated critics and expositors true religion is to be found and when the controversy is so dark and various and the authorized professors can never agree among themselves what can a man of a plain understanding say to it this makes many i imagine turn from the scriptures to study nature and the general laws which are established among the several gradations ranks and classes of beings so far as they are connected with intelligent moral agency in the natural agreeable pages of that infinite volume we see and perceive beauty and order art wisdom and goodness and are thereby led to the creator and governor of the world the universal cause preserver and director of nature we discover his providence measures and benevolence the rules and principles of eternal immutable wisdom and reason and by them are compelled to confess a universal intelligent efficient one infinite eternal omnipotent wise good being from whom all others derive and on whom all others necessarily depend and that continually in short by studying nature we discover a god of truth order and rectitude and as we find perfect universal truth and moral rectitude to be the highest perfection in the deity our reason informs us that we ought to show our love of god by a love of these and that a regular uniform pursuit of them must be the only true and rational pursuit of human happiness here is a plain and good religion can we wonder then that many study and follow nature and disregard those interested commentators who like opposite counsel at the bar multiply and make void the law by different and contradictory pleadings on it  here bob ended and lit his pipe again while jack laid his down and went on in the following manner  an apology for true christianity as christianity was instituted by its great author and publisher for the benefit of mankind it is to be lamented that the divines should so differ concerning what genuine reveled religion is as to cause many to renounce this standing and perpetual rule of faith and manners but as to contradictions and inconsistencies in the apostles writings i have read them over several times and never could find such things in them obscure passages there are a few at first sight but a little consideration can explain them by other scriptures if we do no like some commentators endeavor by forced constructions to adapt the sense of them to a system this is what ruins christianity the monks shut out the light of reason which is to explain scripture by scripture and in the dark fansy a metaphysical theology they speculate a tritheistic mystery original sin divine sovereignty election reprobation with many other pieties and call the things revelation which are in reality an artificial invented corruption of the gospel the majority of the doctors insist upon it that their reverend notions are reveled religion and where they have a power wattle the people into them but men who will use the human understanding their creator has given them and employ the reason of men in the choice of their religion very easily perceive that unnatural representation could never come down from heaven and that whatever the declaimers on human nature may say in praise of their gospel it is impossible it should be inspiration when the propositions rather merit laughter and contempt than the attention of rational creatures this makes the indians of any understanding flee christianity this causes men of sense in a free country to declare against reveled religion the principal offense must remain while the majority of the clergy continue to blind the human understanding and instead of couching the cataract darken the souls of the people with a suffusion of mystery to which i may add and obstinately refuse to make use of unexceptionable scriptural forms of expression in divine public service though an alteration might be made without any possible danger or injury to the church and continue to use in our liturgy unscriptural phrases and metaphysical notions the imaginations of weak men while this is done the christian religion must suffer and of consequence the divines who contend for mystery and labor to destroy human reason and the powers thereof to stifle and extinguish our common notions of things and preclude all reasoning whatsoever upon the subject of religion must have the blood of more souls to answer for in the approaching day of calamity than they now seem to imagine while great preferments blind their understanding and render them insolent and positive all this however has nothing to do with the true gospel if men would read the historical and the argumentative parts of the sacred writings with honesty and explain them as right reason and true criticism directs if they would study them with that true zeal which is guided by a good light in the head and which consists of good and innocent affections in the heart and have at the same time a knowledge of the customs which prevailed and the notions that were commonly received in those distant ages and countries they would find no inconsistencies and contradictions in the scriptures even the difficulties would soon disappear the sacred writings would appear to be what they are  a system of religion that answers to all our wishes and desires  that requires of us that obedience to which as rational beings we are antecedently bound and offers us rewards for obeying more than nature could ever claim in the gospel we have the religion of nature in perfection and with it a certainty of mercy and unutterable blessings but in natural religion as the reason and understanding of men can collect it our hopes of pardon and glory have but uncertain foundation without revelation our hopes are liable to be disturbed and shaken by frequent doubts and misgivings of mind but in reveled religion that is the moral law republished by inspired men the promises of the gospel take in all the wishes of nature and establish all her hopes blessed be god then for sending his wellbeloved son into the world from him we have a law that is holy and the commandment holy and just and good and by a dutiful submission to this plain and perfect law in which there is no mystery no inconsistency no contradiction we are delivered from condemnation by the grace of god through christ here is reason for adoring the divine goodness the gospel gives a better evidence for the truth and certainty of life and immortality than nature before had given and thereby displays the love that god has for the children of men  to this mr berrisfort said that he thought my plea for original christianity was good and allowed it was not the gospel that was faulty in mystery and obscurity contradiction and inconsistency but human ignorance and human vanity which have loaded it with absurdities while they excluded reasoning about it and warped its fair and heavenly maxims to the interests of systems and temporalities however bob continued you will allow i believe that the sacred writers had not perpetually the aid of an unerring spirit and therefore are sometimes inconsistent in their accounts that as they were sometimes destitute of divine assistance they were liable to error when guided only by the human spirit and did act like common men upon several occasions this seems to be evident from the relations and the human sentiments of the apostles the evangelists speak of the same facts differently and in citing prophecy while one adapts a fact to the letter of the prophecy another accommodates the letter of the prophecy to the letter of the fact i mean here the ass and colt in matthew and the colt only in john and their citing zechariah ix   differently and as to the other sacred writers does not the dispute between paul and peter show a subjection sometimes to ignorance and error does not the quarrel between barnabas and paul let us see that one of them was mistaken and both of them to be blamed tell me likewise what you think of mark and johns different accounts of the time of the crucifixion  and does not matthew contradict mark in his relation of the resurrection of jesus  jack buncle to this replied that however some zealots may contend for the perpetual inspiration of the sacred writers yet he could not think such doctrine necessary to the creed of a christian jesus only is called the truth and was incapable of error christ only in all his actions was directed by a prophetic spirit all other men prophets and apostles were sometimes left to the guidance of their own spirit and therefore all things which they have signified to us by their words or deeds are not to be considered as divine oracles nec adeo omnia quaecunque dictis significarunt aut factis ea pro divinis oraculis habenda nullus excepto domino fuit unquam prpheta qui omnia egerit spiritu prophetico so limborch dodwell and baxter say and of the same opinion were grotius and erasmus erasmus grotius limborch baxter and dodwell were great and excellent men and their lives and writings very highly merit the consideration of gentlemen  erasmus was born at rotterdam october    in the year      and died of a bloody flux at basil the   th of july in the year      aged  0  joh manlius in locorum communium

was with erasmus in his last hour  froben published an edition of all the works of erasmus at bale in nine volumes in folio in    0 the first second and fourth contain his philosophical rhetorical and grammatical pieces his colloquies and praise of folly the third his epistles which are very fine and many of them relate to the affairs of the church the fifth his books of piety the sixth his version of the new testament with notes the seventh his paraphrases on the new testament the eighth his translations of some greek fathers the ninth which is the largest his apologies his new testament letters and colloquies are the most valuable of his works the preface to his paraphrase on the gospel of st matthew is an admirable thing an english translation of it with notes and a good preliminary discourse addressed to the catholics was printed for cooper in paternoster row       bail says of erasmus that he was one of those witnesses for the truth who were wishing for a reformation in thechuch but who did not think it was to be procured by erecting another society to be supported by leagues and that should pass immediately a verbis ad verbera from words to blows  erasmus speaking of his contemporary luther says  had all that he wrote been good his seditious freedom would still have been disagreeable to me i would rather submit to some errors than raise a civil war and put the whole world in an uproar for the sake of truth  but in vain did erasmus live and die in the romish communion and undergo many reflection from some zealot protestants he was not the less ill treated both during his life and after his death by several catholic writers for though taking all things together erasmus was what they called a catholic yet his colloquies show his hatred of the monks and it was plain from his writings and behavior that he did not see without joy the first steps of luther  his inscription at rotterdam is this  desiderio erasmo magno scientiarum atque literaturae

the son of jean de groot was born at delft in holland the  0th of april      and died at rostock in mecklenbourgh sept        aged     he writ the following books   annotationes in totam scripturam

and truth of the christian religion cannot be sufficiently praised nor enough admired  a late writer of this great mans life de burigny a bigoted papist says grotius died a member of the church of rome and in a sad and ridiculous manner strains some lines of this excellent writer to prove it  he was to be sure one of those moderate protestants who wished there could be a reconciliation between rome and us  and the very hard measure he had from the protestant government of his country while he was treated by the romish princes with the highest honors and encouragements were great temptations to leave the reformed but he never did turn popist whatever this hot romish biographer may affirm vossius and reigersberg his brotherinlaw writ to him upon the subject and he answered them in the following manner  puisque jai eu assez de courage pour souffrir la prison je spporterai aussi lexil la pauvrete and le mepris a limitation de celui qui aima mieux souffrin avec le peuple de dieu

turn and for farther satisfaction see g brandt hist de la reformation tom   p  0   what epithet then does that papist de burigny deserve  the great and good r baxter was a nonconformist divine who suffered much by the severity of that cruel monster of a man lord chief justice jefferies in a prosecution in easter term      on account of some passages in his paraphrase on the new testament he was confined in the kings bench prison from the beginning of the year      to the   th of november      when by the mediation of lord powis he obtained a pardon from king james and was discharged out of prison  the passages picked out by sir roger lestrange were his explications of matthew v     mark ix     mark xi     mark xii        0  luke x    john xi    and act xv    dr south likewise as i have heard put into his enemies hands some accusations out of romans xiii the charge was that his paraphrase on these places reflected on the prelates of the church of england and so he was guilty of sedition but equity at this day can find no such reflection or sedition in the passages  mr baxter was born november         at rowton in south bradford and died at his house in charterhouseyard the  th of december      aged    he was an author    years and in that time writ     distinct treatises whereof four were folios    quartos    octavos and    in twelves and twentyfours besides single sheets separate sermons and prefaces before other mens writings he began with aphorisms of justification in      in his   th year and ended with the certainty of the world of spirits in      the year he died  few can be persuaded i imagine in these days of pleasure in this age of vauxhalls and ranelaghs a remark on our little vauxhalls beside the two grand seats of pleasure which are filled every evening with coaches full of love and laughter and cupersgardens there are several little vauxhalls and dancingrooms in the gardens where people of both sexes of low and middling condition assemble together to their destruction in all respects here the ruin of many an honest tradesmans daughter commences and from being men of pleasure at these places idle young fellows come by degrees to the gallows their morals are here corrupted their time is wasted and money must be got some way or other to answer the expenses what must become of us when high and low rich and poor fly from themselves and laugh at every thing serious run into every extravagance and vanity a word of advice to the rich and gay   and wanton life away in dissipations and diversions for shame rationals stop consider what ye are you are beings endued with reason to the end you may pursue the true happiness of rational nature and by a truth and rectitude of life unite yourselves to the supreme inexhaustible fountain of all rational intellectual and durable good you are likewise accountable creatures standing on the brink of death resurrection and judgment and when this fleeting scene of vanity is over moral impotence or natural weakness as they are now called will not be accepted as a plea for the offender against nature and reason for let reason be heard and spend some hours of your every day in reading good books and in the closet in prayer with a resolution to do your best to live as you pray and that power which darkens the understanding enslaves the will and obstructs the operations of conscience you may easily remove you will despise every gratification against truth and delight in being useful and pious here that you may secure eternal happiness in some future world ponder then rationals in time as you are placed here in a mutable condition capable of bliss and misery  to be made confirmed blessed spirits above when the time of probation is over if you have kept the commandments of god  or to live with lucifer and the apostates for ever in darkness and woe if you have not fought the good fight and kept the faith  therefore do all that piety and goodness can do in this life resolve by the advice of the gospel and let nothing in nature be able to divert the execution but a countermand from the same authority  i speak to the rich and gay that frequent vauxhall and ranelagh for as to the people who resort to the sixpenny gardens they are incapable of being advised the women there are for the most part street whores and the greatest part of the men pickpockets and gamblers nor do they keep themselves sober for the last time i looked into one of their dancingrooms to see how it was with my kind at   oclock at night as i was walking home i saw some of the men suddled  fighting for the women and several unhappy girls so drunk they could not stand the whole was a sad scene  but you who are great honorable and rational may be called on i suppose to stop every wandering or illicit thought every inconsiderate word and to bring every intended action before the supreme bar of righteous and impartial reason you may perhaps remember what i beg leave to tell you that you live under a threefold duty to god to your neighbors and to yourselves and of consequence that you must flee all those pleasures diversions and alienations of mind which usually obstruct the love of god his fear and honor  that you must have no immoderate desires which may tempt you to violate the laws of justice and charity  and in the regimen of yourselves that you must observe a strict moderation and temperance and make your whole life an oblation and submission to the will of god this advice i humbly offer to those spiritual intelligent immortal beings who waste their precious hours at ranelagh and vauxhall and in routs and spectacles and every species of plays and sports frolic it all the long day    to sit down to read all that baxter writ but most certainly the following books in english of his composing are very good ones  the saints everlasting rest a call to the unconverted  dying thoughts  certainty of the world of spirits and his paraphrase on the new testament  his latin pieces are these de catechisatione domestica  aphorismi de justificatione et foederibus  apologia  libellus rationum pro religione christiana contra

greatly obliged to this learned and excellent man for the following fine books by him written   systeme complet de la theology that is a body of divinity which has been translated into english   collatio amica de veritate religionis christianae cum erudito judaeo  at the end of this is an account of uriel acosta a portuguese deist who had been a jew and limborchs defense of christianity against acostas objections this remarkable life and defense of reveled religion were translated into english in the year    0 and makes a shilling pamphlet which you may get at mr whistons shop but the collatio has not been published in english by any one at least i never saw such a thing and for this reason i have begun a translation of it and intend to finish it with many notes on the arguments of the two disputants if death or sickness does not hinder   lhistoire de ce terrible tribunal linquisition that is mr chandlers translation of limborchs history of the inquisition the history of the inquisition this was translated into english by mr samuel chandler a dissenting minister who prefixed in an introduction a history of persecution that cannot be sufficiently praised or enough admired the history and introduction were published in a large quarto london      and the introduction was afterward printed in octavo   account of some other pieces written by mr chandler this gentleman is still living and greatly to be honored on account of several other excellent writings in defense of the true gospel of christ and true piety his vindication of the history of the old testament against dr morgan  his discourse of the nature and use of miracles and answer to mr collinss grounds  his reexamination of the witnesses of the resurrection reader on the subject called the resurrection of jesus read first bishop sherlocks trial of the witnesses and tippings defense of the trial then take up mr chandlers piece and when you have seriously read it see what the bishop of rochester dr pearce says on this subject in the first part of his four discourses on the miracles add to them groves sermon on the resurrection and i imagine these fine little pieces will give you satisfaction if a doubt should still remain open mr wests fine book on the article and i think you will be easy as to this point reduce the strength of what they all say to a few written arguments and keep them for use   his commentary on joel  his two sermons called the notes of the church in the second volume of the saltershall sermons against popery  his sermon on superstition and two funeral sermons one on the death of dr hadfield for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord romans vi     the other on the death of mr smyth who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself phil iii     these are fine pieces well written with a sense and spirit that renders all mr chandlers performances very valuable and therefore they highly merit the attentive reading of every gentleman some other things written by this minister i mentioned in my memoirs of several ladies of great britain p    to which i refer you reader   commentarius in acta apostolorum at in epistolas ad romanos et hebraeos folio   this is one of the most valuable books in christian learning  strong and beautiful just and rational let it stand next your bible in your study and when you sit down to the acts of the apostles and the epistles to the romans and hebrews let limborchs commentary be open before you and you will be improved and charmed  of dr sykess writings let me likewise advise you reader to open at the same time dr sykes on the hebrews a glorious performance and his most excellent book on redemption these two have been published very lately dr sykes is a divine by the way his essay upon the truth of thechristian religion is one of the best if not the best of all the good things that have been published for revelation and his connection and discourse on the miracles are admirable  see likewise his essay on sacrifices  his true foundations of natural and reveled religion  his two defenses of clarkes exposition of the catechism  his phlegon  his two previous questions  and defense of the two questions of dr middleton against dr chapman dr church and mr dodwell these and all his pieces are delightful useful learning they illustrate revelation and give a just and charming account of the christian religion  limborch writ some other small things as letters prefaces and essays and among his letters those to mr lock are excellent that on liberty or power was too much even for lock but the best letter he writ to mr lock has not yet been published to wit a letter that gives the history of his arguments used in bringing back an ingenious lady to christianity who had been converted to judaism it has been seen by several but what is become of it no one can tell  of courcelles and episcopius in      limborch published the valuable works of his master etienne de courcelles an arminian divine  and in      the sermons of the great episcopius in a large folio to which he prefixed not only a fine preface but a long and curious history of the life of episcopius the life was afterward translated into latin and may be had in octavo it is an admirable thing  courcelles was born in the year      and died the   th of may      aged    he succeeded simon episcopius as pastor to the church of the remonstrants in holland and was succeeded in that charge by arnold poelemburg who writ his life this life is an excellent thing but is only to be found at the beginning of his works published as before said by limborch in       the best thing of courcelles is his quaternio dissertationum theologicarum in which he treats as an able rational divine of the trinity original sin the knowledge of jesus christ and justification  the next in value to this are his institutiones religionis christianae  diatribe de esu sanguinis  vindiciae contra amyraldum and avis dun personnage desinteresse in which he acted the mediator between the calvinists and arminians but without success it is a vain attempt to unite parties every party is a church and infallible in its own conceit happy they that are of no party but devoted to jesus christ only and his plane gospel doing their best to be pure and good even as the lord jesus christ was pure and good  and worshipping god the father almighty in the name of jesus as his disciples without speculating inventing or perplexing ourselves with imaginations this was our lords direction when you pray say our father  whatever ye ask in my name  without holiness no man shall see the lord here it is gentlemen of the laity as the doctors call us and will have us to be an inferior tribe to them adhere to these few plain things and you will be for ever happy though the church damns you by bell book and candlelight  simon episcopius a remonstrant minister at rotterdam a glorious man was born in the year      and died of a retention of urine the  th of april      aged  0 his excellent works are three large volumes in folio two in the purest latin published by stephanus curcellaeus whom i have given an account of in the preceding article  and by arnoldus poelenburgh his successor  and the third containing his sermons and life by limborch as i have said before  arnoldus poelenburgh died in the year      and limborch succeeded him in the pastoral care of his church  arnold was a learned eloquent and pious man his dissertatio epistolaris contra hoornbeekium  and his examen thesium spanhemii are fine things his preface to the second volume of episcopiuss theological works is excellent and in a valuable book called epistolae praestantium virorum you will find many letters by poelenburgh that are extremely beautiful in respect of the charms of his style and his judicious manner of treating his subjects  of dodwell and his writings and now as to the learned and pious henry dodwell some time fellow of trinitycollege dublin and camden professor of history in oxon till he lost it for refusing to take the oaths to king william he was born at dublin october      and died at shottesbrooke the  th of june      aged  0 his works are the following

considerations of present concernment how far the romanists may be trusted by princes of another persuasion    an account of the fundamental principle of popery and an answer to six queries proposed

two dissertations on the age of phalaris and pythagoras     an admonition to foreigners concerning schism     an epistolary discourse to prove the soul a principle naturally mortal but immortalized by its union with the divine baptismal spirit  that the bishops only can give this immortalizing spirit and that sacerdotal absolution is necessary for the remission of sins     three treatises in defense of the epistolary discourse  these are the works of the learned dodwell some of the pieces are very valuable  many of them good for nothing and all of them written with great perplexity without any beauty of style or any order dodwells learning was very great but beside the singularity of his notions which he affected his learning lay like a lump of puzzeled silk in his head and he could draw few useful threads in the  d volume of this journal and in the  d volume of the memoirs of some ladies of great britain the reader will find several remarks on dodwells pieces  note in the   d year of mr dodwells age he married a very young girl the daughter of a gentleman in whose house he boarded in the country having been her preceptor for five years from a regard to her fine understanding and by her had ten children two sons and four daughters survived him and one of the sons is the present rector of shottesbrook well known by the title of orthodox dodwell on account of his writings for the fathers against dr middleton and to distinguish him from the author of a bad book finely written called christianity not founded on argument   they assert that the apostles on ordinary occasions were ordinary men all true christian critics must allow this and grant that the universal inspiration of the sacred penmen is a notion founded in the prejudices of pious men and their mistaken sense of scripture such infallible authority they think the best way to silence all objections and weakly embrace the hypothesis to advance the honor of religion  but our allowing this and that there are some disagreements and variations in the evangelists cannot hurt the gospel st paul might reprove st peter and speak himself sometimes after the manner of men yet we see where they had the divine assistance in their explications and the power of working miracles to confirm their doctrine and there as rational and thinking men we must allow the authority of the sacred books the few places that have the marks of weakness only serve to convince us that the divine writers of the books made not the least pretension to perpetual inspiration in suo sensu abundat  aliquid humanae fragilitatis dissentio habet says jerome human frailty and their own sense honestly appear when there was not an occasion for infallibility and miracle but whenever the preachers of the new testament were wanted for the extraordinary purposes of divine providence they were made superior to the infirmities of nature their understandings were enlarged and enlightened and an inspired knowledge rendered them incapable of error this in my judgment is so far from ruining the authority of scipture that it is the greatest confirmation of its truth it shows the honesty of the preachers of the new testament in owning they were only occasionally inspired and when the incredulous see the ingenuous acknowledgment of what is human in the inspired writings the truth of our religion must be more conspicuous to their eyes whereas the truths of the testament are hid from them by making god the dictator of the whole because they think that impossible and therefore conclude the christian religion has no better foundation in short there is no reason to believe that the apostles were extraordinarily inspired when they say it not and when their discourses have in them no mark of such like inspiration it is sufficient says le clerc if we believe that no prophet of the new testament has said any thing in the name of god or by his order which god has not effectually ordered him to say nor has undertaken to foretell any thing which god had not indeed truly reveled to him  that every matter of fact related in the books is true and the records in general the truest and most holy history that ever was published amongst men notwithstanding the writers may be mistaken in some slight circumstances  that all the doctrines proposed are really and truly divine doctrines and there is no sort of reasoning in the dogmatical places of the holy scriptures that can lead us into error or into the belief of any thing that is false or contrary to piety  that jesus christ was absolutely infallible as well as free from all sin because of the godhead that was always united to him and which perpetually inspired him insomuch that all he taught is as certain as if god himself had pronounced  and in the last place that god did often dictate to the apostles the very words which they should use these five heads are enough to believe we allow in these things the authority of the holy scriptures and they who affirm more are deceived let me recommend to you reader two large volumes written in an epistolary form the first is sentimens de quelques theologiens de hollande sur lhistoire critique du vieux testament et de nouveau testament par p r simon and defense des sentimens contre bolville these are fine books my reason for mentioning them here is that the   th and   th letters in the first volume called sentimens etc is on the inspiration of the sacred writers  and the  0th and   th letters of the second volume called a defense etc is a continuation of the subject in a very extraordinary manner that is by giving a solid demonstration of the truth of our religion without interesting it in this controversy that is that the christian religion is true though the apostles had not been continually inspired  note reader these five letters were translated into english in    0 and make a very little   ves that sells for five shillings  the two first letters that is the   th and   th of sentimens were printed lately in a new translation i think for cooper a shilling pamphlet le clerc was the author of these two books i gave an account of him and his writings in my memoirs of some ladies of great britain etc p           note reader the famous father richard simon a priest of the oratory who writ lhistoire critique was born at dieppe the   th of may      and died at the same place april        he was the author of many other learned works which a general reader ought to be no stranger to but i can only recommend to a friend the lettres choises de m simon  his bibliotheque critique  nouvelle bibliotheque choisie there is a great deal of curious learning in these pieces mixed with a great deal of prejudice simon was a great man and bad in respect of the design as his histoire critique is it is a most learned work and of great use to those who have heads fit to use it note herman witsius mentioned in my memoirs of the ladies p     who defended simon in his miscellanea sacra by abusing le clerc was a doctor of divinity and professor of the faculty at franeker natus feb         denatus october      0  aged     beside his miscellanea sacra he published oeconomia foederum etc  exercitationes sacrae in orationem dominicum  and aegyptiaca if like me reader you have nothing else to do but to read i advise you to read them as curious things there is learning though not much good in them see m marks funeral oration on witsius simons eloge you will find in journal litter tom   p      and if you have a critical head i recommend to you father simons dissertation critique against du pins nouvelle bibliotheque des quteurs ecclesiastiques it is an arch piece of criticism though it does not hurt du pins bibliotheque  note the learned and excellent louis ellies du pin author of the valuable bibliotheque ecclesiastique was born june         and died at paris june         aged    he writ many other excellent works but this bibliotheque nouvelle des auteurs ecclesiastique from jesus christ to the year    0 in    volumes in   vo is the principal labor of his life  the best edition in english of this fine work is that of grierson in dublin in folio  the other works of du pin are these  dissertation preliminaire ou prolegomenes sur la bible en trois volumes in   vo  de antiqua ecclesiae disciplina in seven dissertations  de la puissance ecclesiastique et temporelle  la doctrine chretienne et orthodoxe  notes on the pentateuch  les pseaumes en latin et des notes in   vo  version francois des psaumes avec

very curious thing and the sacred geography of africa  a new edition of gersons works in five tomes folio to which he joined a work of his own called gersoniana a very curious and valuable thing which contains the life of gerson the history of his times and the doctrines and lives of contemporary authors  critique sur lhistoire d apollonius de tyranne  une lettre sur lancienne discipline touchant

differentes matieres curieuses  une histoire du xvii siecle  un traite de lamour de dieu  bibliotheque des historiens profanes but of this last work he never published more than two volumes which have been translated into english and so far as he did go is so well done that it is to be lamented he did not finsh his noble design  as to his edition of basnages histoire des juifs without mentioning the name of basnage and his making many alterations in it contrary to its authors mind it brought on him a severe castigation from basnage as i mentioned in my account of basnages writings in my first volume of the memoirs of several ladies of great britain p   0 where i referred the reader to a fine piece called histoire des juifs reclame par jacqueus basnages  note next to the bibliotheque des auteurs ecclesiastiques the best books of du pin are his seven dissertations de antiqua disciplina ecclesiae which is one latin volume in  to  and his puissance ecclesiastique et temporelle one volume in  vo in these volumes he works the pope in a fine manner as to supremacy and infallibility     the case is the same as to differences want of exactness and small mistakes we may justly celebrate the harmony or agreement of the sacred writers with regard to the principal transactions by them mentioned as a strong proof of the integrity of the evangelists and of the certainty of the fact this evinces the truth of christianity but in matters of very small moment we must allow a want of accuracy or slips of memory or different informations this cannot hurt the authority of the gospels as it proves the honesty of the writers by showing they did not compose by compact and i think that some of the evangelists having been eyewitnesses of and actors in the facts of the several gospels and others having written from the information of those who had got a perfect information of all things from the very beginning is an argument solid and rational for the credibility of the evangelical history it is sufficient i am sure it is better to allow this than to say the writers of the four gospels were mere organs when the little omissions and inaccuracies observable in their records cannot be accounted for if we suppose that god conveyed the facts and truths through them as pipes to the world it must needs be a perfect work which the spirit of god directs  no contradiction in st marks and st johns account of the crucifixion as to st mark and st johns accounts i see no contradiction in the relations st john says reckoning as the romans did as he was then in asia and jerusalem destroyed that at the sixth hour that is six oclock in the morning he brought jesus out to them again the last time and strove to mitigate the rage of the jews and save the life of christ but as this was what he could not do he washed his hands before them all to let them know he was not the author of the innocent mans death and after that delivered him up to the soldiers to be crucified when they had scourged him  when all this was done says st mark reckoning in the jewish manner it was the third hour that is nine oclock in the morning and they crucified him this perfectly reconciles the two evangelists there is no sign of a contradiction in the places  the testimony of st matthew and st marks accounts of the resurrection of jesus as to st matthew and st marks accounts of the resurrection of jesus they are not so free from obscurity but i can see no inconsistency in them if st matthew says the lord appeared to mary magdalene and the other mary that might be without a contradiction though st mark says he appeared first to mary magdalene the case to me appears to be this mary magdalene mary the mother of james and the other women went with spices and ointments to embalm the body sunday the   th of april early in the morning about six and thirty hours after it had been laid in the sepulcher and when they arrived at the place found not the body but two angels as young men in white apparel who told them jesus of nazareth was risen to life again as he himself foretold and therefore they must make haste to his apostles to acquaint them with the news and let them know that they would see him in galilee according to his prediction with these joyful tidings the women hastened away to the eleven disciples and related to them what they had heard and seen the apostles looked upon this account as a dream or vision but however on mary magdalenes assuring peter and john apart that she had really been in the tomb and found it empty from whence it was most certain that either jesus was risen or they had removed his body these apostles ran both to the sepulcher and mary magdalene went with them peter and john then saw that it was as she had affirmed and after they had viewed the tomb the clothes and the napkin returned from the sepulcher greatly wondering what was become of their masters body but mary continued at the monument lamenting very greatly that she could not see jesus either alive or dead and while she thus bemoaned herself the lord appeared to her as st mark says jesus appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast out seven devils and after she had reverenced her dear lord and master he bid her go immediately to his disciples and tell them she had seen him let them also know that i have assured thee i shall quickly leave this world and ascend to the god and father of us all my father and your father my god and your god unto those happy mansions where he manifests his presence in a most especial manner there to receive full power over all things both in heaven and earth and to prepare a place for you that where i am there ye may be also mary accordingly departed she told the apostles that jesus had appeared to her and acquainted them with the joyful message  as to the other women it is evident that they likewise went a second time to the sepulcher to look for the body of their master and having in vain searched for it were returning to the apostles to let them know they had enquired to no purpose when jesus himself met them saying all hail does not this reconcile marks account with matthews i think so to me it is so very plain from what all the sacred relators have declared of the matter that i am astonished how jerome could be so perplexed with the two accounts as to say that marks account the last twelve verses of his gospel might be rejected here as spurious because it was found only in a few copies of that gospel and contradicted the other evangelists non recipimus marci testimonium quod in raris fertur evangeliis  praesertim cum diversa atque contraria evangelistis ceteris narrare videatur  in the next place if the account i have given was liable to any objection and you could show me that it was not the truth of the case which at present i think impossible if it was evident from the gospels that the women were not a second time at the tomb but that jesus appeared to mary magdalene and the other women the first time they were all there together yet this may be as i apprehend without marks contradicting matthew the meaning of the words of mark  he appeared first to mary magdalene  might be that as she and the women were returning from the monument to tell the news to the apostles jesus appeared to them and in particular addressed himself to mary magdalene directing his discourse to her and speaking familiarly and affectionately to her to distinguish her as his constant follower in his lifetime and one on whom he had worked a great miracle of healing this i imagine might very justly be termed  he appeared first to mary magdalene  to appear first to any one of a company as i take it is to come up to or stand before some particular person in order to speak to such person this in my imagination removes the difficulty and reconciles mark to matthew but to this explication i prefer the womens being at second times at the sepulcher that is mary magdalene a second time when peter and john went to the tomb on what she had earnestly told them apart and afterward the other mary salome joanna etc a second time the gospels in my opinion make this very plain long since my conversation with mr berrisfort i have seen an excellent book written by the learned minister of maybole in which he labors through several  to pages from p     to reconcile mark and matthew by virtue of a second visit to the monument by mary magdalene when the lord appeared first to her  and a second visit to the sepulcher by the other women when jesus appeared next to those women and in my opinion he has proved it beyond a possibility of rational reply see mr macknights harmony le clerc in his harmony does likewise evince the thing     what has been said mr berrisfort told me seems plausible nd ought to satisfy every honest man it gives me content but there is one thing still that perplexes me and that is the various lections of the new testament do they not hurt the book  no jack buncle replied notwithstanding the cry of infidels and that some learned men of the church of rome have endeavored to shake the credit of the two testaments and to bring the people to the papal chair to know the truth on account of the various readings yet nevertheless they are rather an advantage and security to the sacred text than a detriment to the written word they corroborate the authority of the sacred book and give it additional advantages  it is a truth that there are many various readings in terence livy virgil caesar thucydides homer plutarch etc and yet who denies the genuineness and great use of those noble authors of sense and politeness who is so hardy as to question whether the works universally ascribed to them be their own and the product of those immortal wits on the contrary men of thought and clear heads conversant in those studies will agree that those authors of antiquity of which there are the most various readings are rendered the most pure and correct and why should not the various readings of the bible rather lead men of sound learning and judgment to the true meaning of the divine writers than endanger their mistaking their genuine language and sense  where there are several readings it is highly probable one of them is the original and it is easier by their help to rectify the mistakes of some copies for when we have only one manuscript there may be scope for fancy but none for judicious comparison and wellgrounded criticism  style and language may be distinguished by a happy genius of natural sagacity improved by true learning and proper application as well as statues pictures and medals no age can counterfeit cicero terence st mark st john st paul no more than a counterfeit picture medal etc can be imposed on and deceive the complete masters and judges of those ingenious professions and sciences  secondly there is nothing in the various lections that affects the essentials of religion or can imply a considerable depravation of the copies that alters or weakens one moral contained in the divine books and therefore though it cannot with reason be supposed that god almighty should work perpetual miracles to prevent the mistakes and blunders of every careless or corrupt hand of those numerous transcribers of those sacred volumes no more than by a resistless power and restraint to prevent all the errors and villanis committed by free and accountable creatures yet the argument receives strength that notwithstanding the innumerable variations mistakes and contradictions in small matters the allseeing eye of providence has so watched his own blessed and glorious revelations to mankind that all the transcripts of that divine volume agree in the essential doctrine and grand design of christianity this is a truth that infidels and papists cannot disprove  i observe in the last place that exclusive of the care of providence there could not possibly happen any detriment to our sacred records by various readings for though in an innumerable number of copies of the gospel that were made before printing was known and in the many translations of it into several languages where the idioms are different and the phrase may be mistaken it was almost impossible there should not be various lections and slips of amanuenses yet the sacred volumes in the early ages of christianity were disposed into innumerable hands translated into so many languages kept in so many libraries churches and in private families of believers and so carefully preserved and revered as the authentic deeds and charters of eternal happiness that they were not capable of being falsified  nor could those inestimable copies scattered as they were over the then discovered world and in the noble language so universally known and acceptable be liable to hazards by sudden revolutions and public disasters because those convulsions and surprising calamities could not happen alike in every country at one time  neither could a general corruption of manners a spirit of profuseness or superstition nor the wicked example and strong influence of tyrannical princes of an apostate clergy and atheistical ministers of state prevail over many distant and independent nations to endeavor to corrupt and destroy their sacred book  on the contrary we are to consider that christianity was the ecclesiastical law of all christian nations under the sun the great law which assured to them their religious right and properties their claims and titles to immortality to the inheritance of the saints in light an inheritance incorruptible undefiled that fades not away reserved for them in the heavens which to every one that deserves the name of man and christian must be infinitely more dear than titles to lands on this earth for men are naturally more watchful in a matter so dear to them and every believer would think himself concerned no more to let a change of consequence to pass uncorrected than the children of this world who are wisest in their generation would overlook a flaw in deeds of sale or contract which would assert their title and evacuate the main intention of making such indentures  the primitive christians must be supposed to be exceeding watchful and jealous that no corruption or abuses should be put on that sacred book more dear and valuable to them than all other interests and treasures when these brave champions of the cross were brought to the tribunals of the heathen persecutors and were commanded to deliver their bible to the flames they most courageously refused it and gave their bodies to be burnt rather than the divine book  in short it is easier to suppose a new bible or a new statute book might be imposed at this time of day upon this nation without discovery than to suppose a forged gospel a new testament corrupted so far as to be insufficient for the good ends providence designed by it could be imposed on the universal christian world it is easier to suppose that any forgery might creep into the municipal law of any particular nation than that all the nations whither christianity is spread should conspire in the corruption of the gospel which most sacred institution is to all christians of infinitely greater concern and value than their temporal laws and all the secular immunities and privileges which they secure to them  and without such a wicked consert or such an astonishing carelessness and negligence in all christian people and nations supposed which would be a monstrous supposition no such forgery no such alteration of essentials could pass undiscovered in the gospel which was spread in the hands hearts and memories of myriads of rational devout christians of all ranks qualities and sex was constantly read in private families frequently explained in schools and daily used in public divine offices it was impossible then in the nature of things that there could be any such alterations or corruptions introduced into the sacred text as would affect its doctrines morals or truth of its historical relations or defeat the blessed end and design of the gospel revelation in any period of time from the beginning of christianity to this present age for further satisfaction on this article and to be convinced that the books of the new testament as we now have them are the word of god see reader the sacred classics  and joness method of settling the canonical authority of the testament by the way if jacob ilive who stood in the pillory the  0th of june      for writing and publishing a thing called modest remarks on the bishop of londons sermons dr sherlock in a letter to his lordship price   s   d had read with attention the books i have mentioned and dr lardners credibility of the gospelhistory he would not i imagine have composed a pamphlet that manifests not only an impious licentiousness but an ignorance the greatest and most despicable in relation to the subjects he pretended to write on  the reader will find in my appendix to this journal among other curious things some strictures on mr ilives letter     and if from this unanswerable way of reasoning in defense of the genuine purity of the sacred scriptures we look next upon the providence of the great god in this important case is it not consonant to sound sense and the notions that rational creatures must have of the supreme and allperfect being firmly to believe that the same goodness and providence which took care for the writing would likewise take care for preserving these inestimable books so free at least from corruption that they might be sufficient for the gracious ends for which they were written and be able to make us wise to salvation i think so to me it is evident that since infinite goodness was pleased to reveal a religion that teaches men to know jehovah to be the true god and to know jesus christ whom he has sent his providence must not only preserve the book on which the doctrine depends but so secure it from corruption as to render it a plain rule to mankind while there is a providence the holy scriptures will remain the sacred and unalterable standard of true religion  what you say mr berrisfort replied seems to me to be true i have nothing to object but once more  let me ask you in respect of the ascension which followed the resurrection of jesus is it not very strange that this is not mentioned by any of the apostles who are said to have been eyewitnesses of the fact but luke and mark only are the relators of the thing who were not apostles and had all they writ from the information of the apostles if the apostles matthew and john did really see with their eyes the lord jesus taken up from them into heaven might we not expect that they would write the history of that still more wonderful transaction as well as they had so exactly related the resurrection of jesus for the men who stood gazing up into heaven after the lord was carried up in a cloud as luke says they did not to mention so very wonderful and interesting an affair in their gospels  and men who did not see the thing to relate it as part of the history they had received from the apostles  this is what astonishes me if it was a truth surely so important a one ought not to be omitted by those who saw it since matthew and john did write histories of christ why should they be silent on this grand article and take no notice of it in their records what do you say to this  i will tell you i replied in the first place nostrum non est providentiae divinae rations reddere placuit spiritui sancto ita dirigere calamos matthaei et joannis ut narratione resurrectionis dominicae evangelia sua concluderent sic refert philippus a limborch  it does not become us to call providence to account or assign the ways it ought to act in infinite wisdom thought fit to appoint that matthew and john should end their gospels with the relation of our lords resurrection the resurrection demonstrated the divine mission of jesus christ to it as a proof the most valid and unexceptionable our lord referred the jews and therefore to it as the great fundamental matthew and john appealed they proved it by declaring that they had conversed with jesus christ after he arose from the sepulcher and when that was proved there could be no dispute about any thing else the divinity of the christian religion and the ascension and glory of their lord rest on this base all the blessings likewise of the gospel regeneration our resurrection and life eternal are ascribed by the apostles peter and paul to the resurrection of christ and for these reasons to be sure when john had described his lords resurrection he added  and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book  but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name we must allow then that the account of the ascension by luke and mark may be authentic though not mentioned by matthew and john  in the next place st john is not totally silent as to the ascension of our lord in his sixth chapter ver    it is written  what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before and in the  th chapter ver   th but this spoke he of the spirit which they that believe in him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified here most certainly the apostle speaks of the ascension of his master and though he did not write the history of it yet not obscurely says the thing was to be which confirms the accounts of st luke and st mark and since in the   th and   th chapters of st john ver      the apostle declares that jesus foretold he would send to them his disciples the comforter or holy spirit from the father after his ascension to heaven and that the apostles demonstrated by miracles after the death of their lord that they had received this comforter or divine spirit it follows that the ascension and glorification of jesus is as much asserted and confirmed by the gospel of st john as if that apostle like luke had writ the history of it this is evident to me i think it is not possible to dispute it  the sum of the whole is that the prejudices of the pious and the arts of the crafty and interested have defaced the true gospel of christ and substituted human notions and consequences in the place of divine revelation but let us strip the sacred records of the false glosses and systems with which the theorists have covered it and allow the enemy that the apostles sometimes wanting the unerring spirit of their master were liable to slight mistakes and inadvertencies in the representation of ordinary events that they did sometimes by too great an affection for their masters doctrine strain some things and cite prophecies that did not relate to jesus in any sense at all let us now see says a great man and upright christian what use the enemies of christianity have endeavored to make of the prophecies as the evangelists apply them and what answer the truth of the case will oblige us to give to them  they assert that the foundation of the christian religion is laid by the evangelists on the proof of this point that the mission and character of jesus were foretold by the prophets and that the validity of this proof depends entirely on the force of those particular prophecies which the same evangelists have applied to the illustration of it in their several gospels upon this hypothesis the enemy undertakes to show that the prophecies so applied by them do not at all relate to jesus in their proper and literal signification but only in secondary typical and figurative sense but then this way of interpreting them is equivocal precarious and incapable of yielding any rational satisfaction and of consequence christianity has no foundation such is the use the enemy make of the prophecies applied by the evangelists  in truth if we admit that christianity has no other foundation than what the enemy assign it it might not perhaps be difficult for them to make good the rest for upon that supposition many objections are thrown in our way which it is scarce possible to get rid of but while they fancy themselves to be demolishing foundations they are battering only such parts of the edifice as serve for its ornaments rather than its support and had the enemy gone farther and shown that some of the prophecies cited by matthew did not relate to jesus in any sense at all they would have done no more than what some of the primitive fathers as well as modern critics had done before them without designing or doing the least hurt to christianity  jesus declared in general that moses and the prophets had testified of him but since the evangelists did not think it necessaay to give a precise account or deduction of the several prophecies which were alleged by him in proof of that declaration it is sufficient to take it just as we find it without thinking ourselves obliged to defend all the particular instances or applications which were offered afterward in support of it by fallible men mr whiston in his literal accomplishment of the scripture prophecies has produced    prophecies from the old testament which are cited in the new in proof of the messiahship of jesus and which he declares to have been clearly and directly fulfilled without the least pretense of any reply from any author whatsoever now if any number of these how small soever are found to be as clearly accomplished as he takes them to be they are sufficient to support the authority of the gospel though all the rest were thrown aside  but to say the truth the grounds of our faith in these latter ages of the church do not lie in the particular interpretations of prophecies made by men who might be mistaken and who as jerome st jerome is one of the four great doctors of the latin church who support the magnificent bronze chair of st peter in this saints church in rome  the other three doctors are st augustine st ambrose st gregory great might be the piety of those doctors for any thing i can say to the contrary but this is certain from their writings that they did not understand christianity  in my memoirs of several ladies of great britain vol   p     i gave an account of st augustins works and observed that this great saint was born in africa november        in the reign of constance  and died august      0 at hippo  aetat     st jerome was born at stridon in dalmatia in the year   0  and died in the year   0 aged  0  there is a good edition of his works in   volumes solio paris      but the later edition of martianay the benedictin is much finer and more valuable  st jerome was a hot abusive man and quarrelled even with st augustine in his disputes he is more like a madman than a faint and ever in the wrong he writ comments on all the prophets ecclesiastes st matthew and the epistles to the galatians ephesians titus and philemon but they are sad stuff in respect of some modern performances compare them with the comments of dr clarke mr lock dr benson and others of our country and you will see what a poor creature this saint was in respect of our english divines and philosophers he translated the old testament into latin from the hebrew without understanding the hebrew well and he corrected the ancient latin version of the new testament this is far from being correct though the church of rome has decreed it to be infallible and appointed it to be used in the church  the best and most useful thing this saint writ is his treatise of illustrious men which contains a summary of the lives and the titles of the books written by ecclesiastical authors to his time the next in worth to this in my opinion is his book of letters in which are several fine moral sentiments and much good advice though his criticisms on the bible in this work are weak enough  he will have it that it was wisdom and not a young woman that david took into bed to him when he was old and cold which is a mere fancy that plainly contradicts the history of that affair in the bible but jerome abhorred a woman as much as mrs astel did a man and detested and blackened matrimony and a wife to extol and exalt that whim of his brain virginity with detestation he owns he beheld every big bellied woman the finest sight in the world though rendered so in the holy matrimonial bed and could not bear looking at her but as he reflected that she carried a virgin so he tells us in his letters and of consequence a fit supporter of st peters chair  st ambrose is the next supporter and saint he was born at treves in the year   0  and died the  th of april      aged    this holy prelate was a great contender for tritheism and the rights of the church and writ many worthless pieces for them and persecution he acted an insolent and senseless part in the case of the emperor theodosius in the affair of thessalonica when that prince ordered the seditious to be destroyed and he died soon after the greatest and most blessed of men say paulinus and baronius who both writ his life  the best edition of his works is that of the benedictins paris        volumes folio with many notes  as to st gregory of neocaesarea and the four other saints of the name to wit the two nazianzens nysse and armenia i shall have occasion to mention them in the next volume of my journal and therefore shall here only observe in respect of ncocaesarea usually called thaumaturgus or the wonderworker that he died in the year     according to baronius and the saint of armenia or in   0 according to fabricius and that the best edition of his works is that of gerard vossius in  to mayence   0  his pieces were likewise printed at paris in folio      with the writings of some minor saints this folio is a collection of things written by saints   says more than once by trusting to their memories in citing these very prophephecies were frequently mistaken in the words and sometimes in the sense of them nor is the evidence of prophecy so proper in these days to convert men to the faith of christ as to confirm those who have already embraced it serving chiefly as st paul expresses it not to them who believed not but to them who believe  the sum then of this article is that upon the first promulgation of the gospel while the conversion of the jews was the principal object of our saviors ministry and afterward of his apostles the argument of prophecy was of all others the best adapted to persuade and conquer the prejudices of that nation but in preaching the gospel to the gentiles not acquainted with the jewish scriptures nor tinctured with any jewish prejudices the testimony of its miracles and the purity of its doctrines were the most affecting proof of its divine origin yet when by the evidence of these people had once received the christian faith and acquired a competent knowledge of it they would then perceive that the argument of prophecy was a part also of the evidence essentially necessary to complete the demonstration of its truth     let this be done to remove encumbrances to clear up difficulties and to answer objections otherwise unanswerable and the writings of the apostles will appear to be a globe of light from heaven to irradiate the human understanding and conduct the sons of men to the realms of bliss their lessons are the dictates of the spirit of god their sanctions are of such force in a certainty of future judgment and retribution that they incline a rational to have a serious regard to them  in a word the religion of nature is perfect but men are imperfect and therefore it pleased god to send our savior into the world to republish the law of reason by his preaching and in the writings of the apostles and by him to give many motives to men to incite them to perform their duty as set forth in his written laws and in the more striking example of our lord his onlybegotten son let us be christians then my dear bob and adore the divine goodness for the life eternal prepared for the righteous as declared in the sacred records let us hearken to the apostles who knowing the terror of the lord persuade men and so govern and conduct ourselves by the rules of revelation that when the man christ jesus who appeared in the world to redeem us will return to judge us by the gospel we may ascend with him to the unbounded regions of eternal day and in everblooming joys live for ever in the presence of god  i have done where you think i am wrong you will be pleased to say  my friend replied that he had no objection to make he was quite satisfied and obliged to me for my advice thus ended the conversation between bob berrisfort and jack buncle          july   my departure from yeoveringreen and arrival at a shakingbog at the bottom of a mountain the  d day of july i left yeoveringreen and set out again for ulubrae to get my horses and portmanteau but proceeded now on foot because by climbing over a high mountain which it was impossible for a horse to ascend and then walking half a mile over a shakingbog where a beast could not go i was to save many miles and beside mr berrisfort was so obliging as to send one of his servants back with mr harcourts horses which i knew not which way to return with my pole in my hand then i set out and after i had bid adieu to my friends who walked with me a couple of miles to the foot of the hills i bagan to mount the alp at six in the morning and at eight arrived on its summit here i had a fine road due south for an hour till i came to a very steep descent that led to the shakingbog as my paper of directions informed me it was an ugly way down and the better to go it i resolved first to breakfast and bid tim see what he had got in his wallet immediately he produced a roast fowl a manchet and a bottle of cider and among some trees on the brow of a hill by the side of a spring that ran off the way i was to go i sat down to the repast i gave my lad half the bird and the other half i dispatched in a very short time drank a pint of cider and was on my feet again i then began to descend and in an hour made a shift to get to the bottom though the way was bad being very steep wet and slippery i came to a dirty lane about two hundred yards long and that ended at the shakingbog     the nature of a shaking bog this kind of bog i take to be an abyss of standing water covered with a thin arch of earth that is a water communicating with the abyss so covered or weakly vaulted over and of this opinion i find the right reverend erich pontoppidan is in his natural history of norway the bishop does not tell his reason for so thinking but mine is that i have seen in ireland the arches of several of those bogs broken and a deep unfathomable water at some distance from the arch they are very dangerous frightful places and many of them play up and down like a long plank in a very surprising manner     we return from the bog to the mountain and arrive at a farmers house to go half a mile over such a bog and the most elastic of them i had ever tried was what i did not much like though the author of my paper of directions an old servant of mr berrisfort affirmed it was quite safe and as to tim he would not on any consideration cross it he was positive we should sink beyond recovery what to do then was the question i tried for some time to go round the bog at the bottom of the enclosing mountains but that was soon found impossible and therefore it only remained to go up again to the top of the hill and try onwards for some other descent beyond the bog we did so and after walking two hours southwest at a good rate had a view of a deep glin to which we descended by an easy slope and marched through it to the west and northwest for two hours till it ended at a wood this we passed without any difficulty as there were walks cut through it and came out into a broad valley that had a river very near us and a sweet pretty cottage on the margin of the flood i went up to the house to ask my way and found at the door three men the eldest of whom seemed to be about thirty years old they asked me very civilly to walk in and seemed to wonder not a little at seeing me and my man in such a place with our poles in our hands     an account of mr fleming and his two brothers these men were three brothers and roman catholics two of them were gentlemenfarmers who lived together and jointly managed the country business the eldest was a franciscan friar who came to visit them their good manners in their plain dress surprised me and their benevolence made me wonder a great deal more their maid laid a clean cloth in a minute and brought some cold roast beef good bread and fine ale they bid me heartily welcome many times and were so frank and generous so cheerful and gay especially the eldest of the farmers who sang several good songs over a bowl of punch after dinner that i could not think of leaving them immediately if i had known my road and was easily prevailed on to stay several days a friendship commenced immediately between the eldest fleming and me and there was not one cold or cross minute in it for the few years that he lived he loved me as his brother from the first day he saw me and i had so great a regard for him that with a sorrow i cannot help i think of his death to this day how to account for such sudden passions i know not the thing has always appeared to me very strange mr fleming to be sure was a man of a bright and very extraordinary understanding though no more than a farmer in this world had a most happy temper a generosity too great for his fortune and was for ever cheerful and free but these things however pleasing could not be the cause of the sudden and lasting friendship between us as i have been acquainted with men of fortune who equalled him in these respects and yet they never struck me more than for the present time whatever might be the cause the fact is certain no two men ever liked one another more than we did from the first hour of our acquaintance and as i had the happiness of converting him to the protestant religion it is possible that might cement a friendship which a sameness of disposition had helped to produce the arguments i used to make a convert of mr fleming the reader will find in the appendix to this journal among other interesting matters that are too long to be inserted in the story of my life i shall print them in hopes they may be of service to some other soul they were introduced the first day i was at mr flemings house by his saying to me after dinner  dear sir will you give me leave to ask you by what strange cause it has happened that you are thus traveling on foot in this unvisited country it must be an extraordinary affair i am sure  sir i replied my case is very uncommon i do not believe that any thing like it ever was before and perhaps such another affair may never happen again i little thought then that i should afterward meet with two instances of the same kind of thinking and resolution in the female world to wit miss chawcer and miss janson whose histories i have given in the first volume of my memoirs of several ladies of great britain p        the critics i remember had some doubts as to the reality of these two cases but to this i answer that they may as well doubt the truth of my own story and from thence proceed to deny the reality of my existence because several incidents in my life are strange and such as they have not heard of before it is not however in the power of criticism to invalidate what i deliver as facts i will tell you my story and so began to relate the religious dispute between my father and me and how it was brought to a head by the devil possessed by a woman called a motherinlaw as the glass went round i let them know how a man in the twentysecond year of his age forsook all for the true gospel of christ and at a time of life when very few think of religion resolved to confess himself a christian deist to all whom it concerned if it brought him to want and from a morsel of bread to the grave so far i was heard without interruption though i declaimed by the way against the dreadful heresy of three gods but not thinking i was in company with catholics for then i imagined that such subjects of the king of england were only to be found in ireland i brought into my oration against false religion the diabolism of popery and gave it several thrusts as indeed i always do whenever it comes in my way for good reader though i love the catholic men and women because i am a friend to man and nearly related to many romanists of great fortune yet popery i abhor and look upon it as the greatest woe that ever the devil introduced into this lower world to ruin mankind but when i began to touch this string and was raking rome papal fore and aft fleming the friar changed color several times which i took notice of and knew not what to ascribe it to unless he was very sick and at last he told me by way of game that i was an eloquent young gentleman and had a flow of language but my mistakes as to the church of rome were very great and he begged leave as he was a priest of the holy roman church to set me right in my notions this was a great surprise to me it struck me silent for some minutes at last however i told the gentlemen that i asked their pardons for making so free with their religion which i should not presume to have done but that i thought they had been protestants that as to his offer to set me right he did me great honor and i would with pleasure hear him i would to be sure be a convert to the strength of his arguments if unanswerable or offer such reasons for remaining a protestant as must satisfy a rational man he then went on and my reply followed the substance of this is what the reader is to find in the appendix    this is all i can say as to the reason of this matter in respect of the thing it was of the greatest service to me my new acquired friend assisted me to the utmost of his power in the accomplishment of my designs in that part of the world i then was i had his head his hand and his house at my service and by them i was enabled to give a roundness to a system that was too happy to last long     my arrival at ulubrae and what passed there but as to the shaking bog i was to have passed to go to the gentlemen at ulubrae fleming told me i had a fortunate escape in not venturing over it for though it be passable in one narrow way about a yard broad yet a stranger to the bog must perish in attempting to cross as the timber causeway that was made over the great marsh time out of mind is invisible in many places and one sinks for ever the moment he steps off that way but i will show you an easy road my new friend continued to the gentlemens house to whom i am no stranger and will make you acquainted with some passes through the mountains that will render it easier riding over this country than you have found it he did so and by his guidance i arrived at ulubrae the  th day of july being the   th day from the morning i left the philosophers the gentlemen were startled at the sight of me as they concluded i had perished and had as they assured me mourned my sad fate they were impatient to hear the adventure of the mountain and by what strange means i was jumbled all the way to tom flemings who lives so far from the hill i went into and the road from it to his house scarce passable for a mortal inform us we beseech you how these strange things came to pass  gentlemen i said i am extremely obliged to you for your concern for me and will tell you my story as soon as we have dined as the servants are now bringing the dishes in and accordingly when we had done i gave them a relation in detail they were greatly pleased with my history and much more to have me returned to them in safety again if they had not seen me they said they could not believe the thing and they would order the whole account to be entered in the journal of their society as the most extraordinary case they had ever known or perhaps should ever hear related again their secretary as directed writ it down in the big book of transactions and it remains in their records to this day  in short reader these worthy men were so greatly rejoiced at my being alive when they thought me for certain among the dead that they put the bottle round in a festal manner after dinner we drank and laughed till it was midnight     my departure from ulubrae to eggleston the  th day of july i took my leave of the gentlemen at ulubrae and proceeded to the east riding of yorkshire to look for miss melmoth fleming came with me as far as eggleston to show me the passes between the hills and the best ways over the mountains many vast high ones we crossed and traveled through very wonderful glins several scenes were as charming as any i had before seen and the low ways as bad but he knew all the roads and cross turnings perfectly well and shortened the journey a great many miles i had told him the business i was going on and he requested if i succeeded that i would bring miss melmoth to his house that his brother might marry us and as to ortonlodge which i had described to him and told him where to find for he had no notion of it nor had ever been among the fells of westmoreland as he thought that country unpassable he promised me he would go there himself and bring with him two laboring men to assist my lad in putting the garden and house in the best condition they were capable of receiving that he would bring there seeds and trees such as the season allowed and do every thing in his power to render the place convenient and pleasing he would likewise sell me a couple of his cows a few sheep and other things which i should find before me at the lodge and let me have one of his maids for my servant in the house this was good indeed i could not wish for more   00      from eggleston i went to mrs asgils to look for miss melmoth but she was gone the  th of july early in the morning fleming and i parted and i proceeded as fast as well i could to the appointed station but when i came up to mrs asgills door the  d day in the evening july  0 and asked for miss melmoth an old man the only person in the house told me mrs asgill had been dead near a month and miss melmoth went from thence immediately after the funeral of her friend that she had left a letter with him for a gentleman that was to call upon her but that letter by an accident was destroyed and where the lady then was he could not so much as guess he farther told me that miss melmoth had sold the goods of the house and the stock bequeathed to her by her deceased friend to the gentleman who inherited the late mrs asgills jointure and she would return no more to the place this was news to me it struck me to the soul doleful tidings how ye wound what to do i could not tell but as i rid to the next town determined at last to try if i could hear of her at york to that city i went the next day asked at the inns walked the walls and went to the assemblyroom my enquiries were all in vain one gentleman only did i see who was acquainted with her and he knew nothing of her present abode from york then i proceeded the next morning to search other towns and left no place unexamined where i could think she might be three weeks were spent in this manner without hearing a syllable of her and then i thought it was best to return to my lodge for what signified my five hundred pounds to appear with in the world it must be soon gone as i had not the least notion of any kind of trade and if i joined any one that was in business i might be mistaken in the man and so cheated and undone then what could i do but carry a brown musket or go a hand before the mast for as to being an usher to a school for bread were i reduced to want that was the life of all lives that i most abhorred nothing else then had i for it but my silent mountainlodge which kind providence had brought me to there i resolved to go and in that charming solitude peruse alone the book of nature till i could hear of some better way of spending my time   0  by accident i meet miss melmoth to this purpose then i went the  d of august      to barnards castle in durham and intended the next morning to set out for mr flemings house in stanemore to go from thence to my cottage on the side of a westmorlandfell but after i had rid a mile of the road to eggleston where i purposed to dine i called out to my lad to stop a sudden thought came into my head to ride first to gretabridge as i was so near it to see some fine roman monuments that are in the neighborhood of that village to that place i went then and passed the day in looking over all the antiquities and curiosities i could find there i returned in the evening to my inn and while a fowl was roasting for my supper stood leaning against the housedoor looking at several travelers that went by and some that came to rest where i did that night many figures i beheld but none i knew at last there came riding up to the inn full speed a young lady on a most beautiful beast and after her two horses more on one of which was her man servant and on the other her maid she had a black mask on her face to save her from the dust and sun and when she lit from her horse she id not take it off but went with it on into the house after she had looked for a moment or two at me this i thought very strange a charmer to be sure i said with what life and grace did she come to the ground but how cruel the dear little rogue is to conceal the wonders of its face landlord i said to the master of the house who was coming up to me can you contrive a way to get me one view of that masked lady and i will give you a pint  sir mine host replied that i can do very easily for this lady has sent me to let you know she wants to speak with you  with me  transporting news i flew to her apartment and there saw that dear irresistible creature who had added to the inferior charms of face and person that wisdom and goodness of conauct and conversation which are the true glory of a woman it was miss melmoth she had heard i had been at mrs asgills house and did not get the letter she left for me which made her think of riding toward gretabridge on an imagination she might find me thereabout as she remembered to have heard me say in one of our conversations that i intended as soon as i could to look at the roman antiquities in this place but she had very little hopes she added of succeeding in her enquiry as little as i had of her riding up to the inn and this made the meeting the more pleasing it did enhanse the pleasure indeed it turned the amor into an adventure and gave it that delicious flavor which the moderns read of in the histories of past times but rarely experience in these days the reader that has been engaged in such a wonderful and tender scene can only form an idea of a felicity which words would in vain attempt to express  as soon as we had supped i recited my adventures since we parted and gave miss melmoth a flowery description of ortonlodge then asked if she would bless me with her hand and sit down with me in my pretty solitude  sir miss melmoth replied if you required it i would go with you to hudsonsbay had i a hundred thousand instead of four thousand pounds which is my fortune exclusive of some personal estate which my friend mrs asgill by her will bequeathed me and the whole is at your service to dispose of as you please  give me thy hand then i said thou generous girl you make me the happiest of men and in return i swear by that one supreme tremendous power i adore that i will be true and faithful to thee till death dissolves the sacred obligation twice do i swear by the great spirit in whose dread presence i am with your right hand now locked fast in mine across this table and call on him as witness to our vows that neither time nor chance nor aught but deaths inevitable hand shall ever divide our loves miss melmoth said amen   0       miss melmoth and i proceed to ortonlodge and are married by father fleming early the next morning the third of august we rid to eggleston where we breakfasted and proceeded from thence to mr flemings house up stanemore hills where we arrived at nine oclock in the evening and had beds there that night my friend tom and his brother jemmy were gone to a fair but the eldest brother the franciscan friar was at home and entertained us very well we took him with us very early the next day to ortonlodge which we reached at eight in the evening and found the house and garden in good order my friend mr fleming had done every thing possible to make it a convenient and comfortable place he had made near the lodge two little rooms for servants and had put a bed in the greenhouse in the garden for a friend he had likewise sent there a couple of cows some sheep and lambs ducks and geese cocks and hens and every necessary he thought we might want there good tom fleming there never was a better man or a kinder friend to his small power  we had likewise fish in abundance in the waters at the foot of our hills and goats and kids and plenty of wild fowl few things were wanting that reason could desire and for us who thought that happiness that is pleasure and repose did not precariously depend on what others think or say or do but solidly consisted in what we ourselves did feel and relish and enjoy there could not be a more delightful station discovered on this globe  to conclude the best things that ortonlodge afforded were ordered to the fire and before they were brought on the table the man of god threw the fillet or ribband over our hands according to the romish manner and pronounced the nuptial benediction on us husband and wife we sat down to supper  thus did the stars preside with friendly rays and bid me hail at last the happy days when sheltered within this wild retreat above the scorn below the rage of fate blessed in a wife a friend and books alone to this mad world and all its plagues unknown the smoothpacd hours did sweetly pass away and happy nights still closed each happy day finis advertisement next winter
