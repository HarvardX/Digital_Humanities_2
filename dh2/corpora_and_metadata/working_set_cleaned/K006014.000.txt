the newriver head a tale attempted in the manner of mr cdenis and inscribed to john wilkes esquire  by robert lloyd  labitur and labetur in omne volubilis aevum hor london printed for g kearsly opposite st martins church ludgate street and w flexney near graysinn gate holborn mdcclxiii  the newriver head a tale dear wilkes whose lively social wit disdains the prudish affectation of gloomy folks who love to sit as doctors should at consultation permit me in familiar strain to steal you from the idle hour of combating the northern thane and all his puppet tools of power shame to the wretch if sense of shame can ever touch the miscreants breast who dead to virtue as to fame a monster whom the gods detest turns traitor to himself to court or minister or monarchs smile and dares in insolence of sport invade the charter of our isle but why should i who only strive by telling of an easy tale to keep attention half alive against bolgolam and flimnap rail for whether england be the name name which we are taught no more to prize or britain it is all the same the lilliputian statesmen rise to malice of gigantic size let them enjoy their warmth a while truth shall regard them with a smile while you like gulliver in sport piss out the fire and save the court but to return  the tale is old indecent truly none of mine  what beroaldus gravely told i read it in that sound divine and for indecency you know she had her fashionable turn as prim observers clearly show in the other parson doctor stern yet pope denies it all defense and calls it bless us want of sense but even the decent pope can write rape of the lock of bottles corks and maiden sighs of charming beauties less in sight of the more secret precious hair popes letters and something else of little size you know where if such authorities prevail to varnish over this petty sin i plead a pardon for my tale and having hemmed and coughd  begin a genius one of those i mean we read of in the arabian nights not such as every day are seen at bobs or arthurs whilom whites for howsoeer you change the name the clubs and meetings are the same nor those prodigious learned folks your haberdashers of stale jokes who dress them up so neat and clean for newspaper or magazine but one that could play wondrous tricks changing the very course of nature not asmodeus on two sticks or sage urganda could do greater once on a time incog came down from his equivocal dominions and traveled over a country town to try folks tempers and opinions when to accomplish his intent for had the cobbler known the king lord it would quite have spoiled the thing in strange disguise he slily went and stumpd along the highway track with greasy knapsack at his back and now the night was pitchy dark without one stars indulgent spark whether he wanted sleep or not is of no consequence to tell a bed and lodging must be got for geniuses live always well at the best house in all the town it was the attorneys you may swear he knocked as he would have beat it down knock as you would no entrance there but from the window cried the dame go sirrah go from whence you came here nell john thomas see who knocks fellow i will put you in the stocks be gentle mam the genius cried have mercy on the wandering poor who knows not where his head to hide and asks a pittance at your door a mug of beer a crust of bread  have pity on the houseless head your husband keeps a lordly table i ask but for the offal crumbs and for a lodging  barn or stable will shroud me till the morning comes twas all in vain she rang the bell the servants trembled at the knell down flew the maids to tell the men to drive the vagrant back again he trudged away in angry mind and thought but cheaply of mankind till through a casements dingy pane a rushlights melancholy ray bad him even try his luck again perhaps beneath a house of clay a wandering passenger might find a better friend to human kind and far more hospitable fare though not so costly nice or rare as smokes upon the silver plate of the luxurious pampered great so to this cot of homely thatch in the same plight the genius came down comes the dame lifts up the latch what want ye sir god save you dame and so he told the piteous tale which you have heard him tell before your patience and my own would fail were i to tell it over and over suffice it that my goodys care brought forth her best though simple fare and from the cornercupboards hoard her stranger guest the more to please bespread her hospitable board with what she had  twas bread and cheese it is honest though but homely cheer much good mayt do ye eat your fill would i could treat you with strong beer but for the action take the will you see my cot is clean though small pray heaven increase my slender stock youre welcome friend you see my all and for your bed sir  there is a flock no matter what was after said he eat and drank and went to bed and now the cock his mattins sung however such singings light esteemed it is precious in the muses tongue when sung rimes better than he screamd the dame and pedlar both arose at early dawn of rising day she for her work of folding clothes and he to travel on his way but much he thought himself to blame if as in duty surely bound he did not thank the careful dame for the reception he had found hostess quoth he before i go i thank you for your hearty fare would it were in my power to pay my gratitude a better way but money now runs very low and i have not a doit to spare but if you will take this piece of stuff   no quoth the dame i am poor as you your kindest wishes are enough youre welcome friend farewell  adieu but first replied the wandering guest for bed and board and homely dish may all things turn out for the best so take my blessing and my wish may what you first begin to do create such profit and delight that you may do it all day through nor finish till the depth of night thank you she said and shut the door turned to her work and thought no more and now the napkin which was spread to treat her guest with good brown bread she folded up with nicest care when lo another napkin there and every folding did beget another and another yet she folds a shift  by strange increase the remnant swells into a piece her caps her laces all the same till such a quantity of linen from such a very small beginning flowed in at once upon the dame who wondered how the duce it came that with the drapry she had got within her little shabby cot she might for all the town provide and break both yorkstreet and cheapside it happened that the attorneys wife who to be sure took much upon her as being one in higher life who did the parish mighty honor sent for the dame who poor and willing would take a job of charing work and sweat and toil like any turk to earn a sixpence or a shilling she could not come not she indeed she thanked her much but had no need good news will fly as well as bad so out this wondrous story came about the pedlar and the dame which made the attorneys wife so mad that she resolved at any rate spite of her pride and lady airs to get the pedlar tete a tete and make up all the past affairs and though she wished him at the devil when he came there the night before determined to be monstrous civil and drop her curtsie at the door now all was racket noise and pother nell running one way john another and tom was on the coachhorse sent to learn which way the pedlar went thomas returned  the pedlar brought  what could my dainty madam say for not behaving as she ought and driving honest folks away upon my word it shocks me much  but there is such thieving here of late  not that i dreamed that you were such when you came knocking at my gate i must confess myself to blame and i am afraid you lately met sad treatment with that homely dame who lives on what her hands can get walk in with me at least tonight and let us set all matters right i know my duty and indeed would help a friend in time of need take such refreshment as you find i am sure i mean it for the best and give it with a willing mind to such a grave and sober guest so in they came and for his picking behold the table covers spread instead of goodys cheese and bread with tarts and fish and flesh and chicken and to appear in greater state the knives and forks with silver handles the candlesticks of bright french plate to hold her best mould tallow candles were all brought forth to be displayed in female housewifry parade and more the pedlar to regale and make the wondrous man her friend decanters foamed of mantling ale and port and claret without end they hobbd and nobbd and smiled and laughed touched glasses named their toasts and quaffd talked over every friend and foe till eating drinking talking past the kind houseclock struck twelve at last when wishing madam bon repos the pedlar pleaded weary head made his low bow and went to bed wishing him then at perfect ease a good soft bed a good sound sleep now gentle reader if you please well at the lady take a peep she could not rest but turned and tossed while fancy whispered in her brain that what her indiscretion lost her art and cunning might regain such linen to so poor a dame for such coarse fare perplexed her head why might not she expect the same so courteous civil and wellbred and now she reckoned up her store of cambricks hollands muslins lawns free gifts and purchases and pawns resolved to multiply them more till she had got a stock of linen fit for a dowager to sin in the morning came when up she got most ceremoniously inclined to wind up her sagacious plot with all that civil stuff we find amongst those who talk a wondrous deal of what they neither mean nor feel how shall i mam replied the guest make you a suitable return for your attention and concern and such civilities expressed to one who must be still in debt for all the kindness he has met for this your entertainments sake if ought of good my wish can do may what you first shall undertake last without ceasing all day through madam who kindly understood his wish effectually good strait dropped a curtsie wondrous low for much she wanted him to go that she might look up all her store and turn it into thousands more now all the maids were sent to look in every cranny hole and nook for every rag which they could find of any size or any kind drawrs boxes closets chests and cases were all unlocked at once to get her point her gawz her prussianet with fifty names of fifty kinds which suit variety of minds how shall i now my tale pursue so passing strange so passing true when every bit from every hoard was brought and laid upon the board left some more urgent obligation might interrupt her pleasing toil and marring half her application the promised hopes of profit spoil before she folds a single rag or takes a cap from board or bag that nothing might her work prevent for she was now resolved to labor with earnest hope and full intent to get the better of her neighbor into the garden she would go to do that necessary thing which must by all be done you know by rich and poor and high and low by male and female queen and king she little dreamed a common action practiced as duly as her prayers sold prove so tedious a transaction or cost her such a sea of cares in short the streams so plenteous flowed that in the dry and dusty weather she might have watered all the road for ten or twenty miles together what could she do as it began the involuntary torrent ran instead of folding cap or mob so dreadful was this distillation that from a simple watering job she feared a general inundation while for her indiscretions crime and coveting too great a store she made a river at a time which sure was never done before finis
