emily herbert or perfidy punished a novel in a series of letters  dublin printed by william porter for mess white colbert cash w porter lewis jones and halpen  m dcc lxxxvii  emily herbert or perfidy punished letter i lady stanley to mrs grosvenor london of all comforts i miscarried when i played the fool and married these caroline are the sentiments you have so often heard me most melodiously warble forth indeed with tears in my eyes  but i retract  i now bless the hour in which i became a wife and look back to it with almost as much heartfelt joy as on that happy one in which i became a widow  you are amazed  but it is a fact  and so great is my friendship for you that in spite of my present affliction i was determined you should receive the joyful intelligence from myself before my eyes were so totally destroyed with weeping as to put it out of my power  behold me then a widow my old soul of a husband comfortably and quietly laid in his grave  can you figure to yourself a happier creature i cannot young handsome rich  my own mistress thank heaven i cannot once more say the world is all before me  where to choose as well as what to choose ambition has had its turn i have seen my error of matrimony too i have had a sufficient dose twas a bitter one but i am amply rewarded for my fortitude in swallowing it it has produced the most salutary effects what they are i have told you above and now i can truly say with the spirited eloisa not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love   with these unfettered sentiments have i not reason to look forward with transport believe me i do and impatiently long to begin a new course of life what the past has been you pretty well know but what is to follow aye child that take my word for it shall be quite on a different plan will you come and be witness to it say the word a female companion is not amiss if i could meet with one according to my own ideas and as such i think you would suit me extremely well my late poor dear husbands apartments are at your service come and occupy them if the proposal meets your approbation  think of what i have said and in the intervening time i will think of more important matters  you never beheld mortal so ravishingly handsome as i look in my fables the very few fellows i have seen since the glorious day i first figured in them are all expiring and swear i ought to be shut up in mere charity but i have no such design believe me  however i am on the point of bidding the dear creatures adieu for awhile the town is almost deserted and i am on the wing for the country it is rather unlucky this unexpected event did not take place the beginning of winter but one must endeavor to be content it is better late than never my villa is a paradise and in a genteel and cheerful neighborhood and were it not i have the vanity to believe my attractions would draw it a sufficient number of admirers the only society likely to afford me consolation in my present melancholy state  to you you see i have freely opened my heart but do not therefore fancy i have so little of the hypocrite in my disposition as to appear to the world in my true colors no no that would never do though i believe in my conscience were every woman to speak her sentiments as freely as i have done mine would not be found very singular what think you but since it is the custom to wear a mask i shall not take off mine till others set me the example  adieu let me hear from you and tell me what you think of my proposal accept it freely if it is agreeable to you and whether or not believe me  affectionately yours arabella stanley  letter ii same to the same stanleyplace your congratulations dear caroline found me just arrived here but i had so many matters to arrange on my first coming being now the sole proprietor that i could not find time to acquaint you with it before i admit your reasons for not at present accepting my offer are weighty but consess i am sorry you had any to refuse it as i find i wish for you infinitely more now when convinced i cannot have your company than before this is a true dash of the female you will allow but i never aspired to be any thing better  that is to say than exactly such a female as i am it is true there are beings who figure under that appellation who do no great credit to it mere milk and water compositions who answer no earthly purpose in life except to fill up the space in which they vegetate and fifty such have i already been pestered with since i came into the country for i have received visits of condolence from every soul twenty miles round and what is worse have been obliged to return them not to mention being also compelled to settle my features in some measure answerable to my outward garb under this restraint you may believe i made them as short as possible to the no small mortification of some and no less joy of others the first class you may guess are males the latter their wives sisters daughters nieces etc these naturally felt some unpleasant sensations on seeing themselves so greatly eclipsed and trembled for the effects my superior charms might produce on their husbands lovers and so forth and indeed not without cause as every unprejudiced spectator must acknowledge  as decency does not permit me at present to grace any of their balls either private or public i am rather at a loss for amusement but shall very soon emerge the most rigidly scrupulous must acquit me of all indecorum if at the expiration of six tedious months i venture to appear amongst them and thank my stars four of the six are over  in the mean while i pass much of my time on horseback conscious no woman ever excelled me in the accomplishment of riding or looked half so captivating in a habit black of all others too by far the most becoming my haunts are discovered though i affect the most retired spots and generally meet half the fellows in the neighborhood prancing there in hopes to get a peep at the enchanting widow if a bow or how do ye should be graciously given to their peep they look so delighted so elate that it would charm you to see them i have not yet beheld the happy man who stands the smallest chance of being honored with my more particular notice but flatter myself the time is not far distant as i hear we are soon to have a regiment of dragoons quartered in this part of the country and as i have a partiality for a red coat shall look out amongst them for an object on whom to bestow my smiles it will be hard if out of the whole corpse i cannot find one worthy that enviable distinction or who may at least serve to flirt with and amuse me during the summer that over my dear caroline away i fly on the wings of pleasing expetation to the seat of dear delight london where i need not be one moment at a loss when there perhaps you will comply with my former proposal if possible i hope you will  yours etc arabella stanley  letter iii the same to the same stanleyplace i told you a regiment was expected they are arrived but my dear caroline how shall i describe to you with justice the charms of their bewitching commander the elegant the enchanting and i feel i may add the irresistible lord sommerville  yes irresistible i repeat for i have a strong presentiment he cannot ask any favor i shall have either fortitude or inclination to deny him nay should he even talk of matrimony horrid as the subject would sound to me from any other i vow i think i could listen to him with pleasure surely that is saying enough  i happened to be taking my usual airing on horseback the morning my lord made his first appearance at the head of his regiment and met them in a road near the entrance of the town which being rather narrow i was obliged to stop my horse and place myself close to the side that they might pass without incommoding me my rosinante had not been accustomed to things of this nature and was a good deal startled at the drums music colors etc this however gave me an opportunity to show my skill in horsemanship but great as it is i found it no easy matter to prevent his taking a leap with me over the hedge in order to escape from a scene that did not delight him quite so much as his mistress i kept my seat however pretty well in spite of his prancing for some time but just as the blooming sommerville appeared whether struck with his superior attractions or those of the beautiful creature he rode but certain it is he gave a sudden spring and i being off my guard was in an instant thrown prostrate at the feet of my hero since he was to play me this trick he certainly chose the moment most apropos i need not tell you i presume i found myself instantaneously pressed to the bosom of the gallant the enchanting sommerville half a hundred of the dear creatures now left their ranks and flew to offer me their assistance said a thousand gallant things of course but i had no eyes no ears for any except my charming deliverer who appeared not a little delighted at being the fortunate he who had first flown to my relief  it is now time to tell you i received no other injury than the loss of my heart and as i wished only for a proper object to bestow it on i blessed the accident which had thus procured me one so perfectly to my taste being at length replaced on my saddle i would have bid him adieu after expressing my gratitude and so forth but this his lordship would by no means allow he insisted on my giving him permission to see me safe home could i caroline refuse having ordered the regiment to halt away we rode in full review all eyes fixed upon us and not a few conjectures formed i presume by those we left behind  it was during the course of this delightful bustle i happily learned the name and rank of my conqueror though had he been the lowest subaltern of the corpse his charms would have produced no less effect and greater is impossible for i absolutely adore him and so would you could you get one single glance of his enchanting figure for it is not merely the finest face in the world it is his person  his manners  his language the expression in his eyes in short it is sommervile altogether  well  and pray you impertinently ask does my lord appear as sensible of your ladyships charms as you are avowedly of his impertinently i say  for what can be more so than to doubt it have i not already told you he possesses every possible perfection of course taste to make proper distinctions must be of the number  yes yes my dear i have the vanity to believe our passion is mutual  we are already on the most delightful footing for you are not to imagine this is an affair of yesterday no my good friend my time and thoughts were for the first ten days too happily employed to think of writing nor would you now have been thus favored had he not been absent pray now you cry is this the first moment he has left you then since the adventure happened  why no not absolutely  though it is pretty nearly the case  it would delight you could you be a witness to the envy this affair has given birth to in every female breast in the country  no doubt a dash of scandal to accompany it for they generally are of the same party but you know me too well to believe this will sit very heavy on my heart let the dear creatures vent their spleen in any way most likely to relieve their gentle bosoms with all my soul my sommerville and i look down upon them with eyes of pity from the summit of our felicity  do not mistake me however caroline  matters are not yet quite so far arranged between us as you may probably take it into your head to fancy  my sentiments have undergone a total revolution since i became acquainted with him matrimony of which i had so justly formed such horrid ideas does not when i think of my sommerville in character of a husband shock me quite so much as it formerly did  i begin to fancy it might be bearable with him i have made many very serious reflections on the subject the result is  i know not exactly  but in fine he must be mine one way or other so farewell  yours sincerely arabella stanley  letter iv lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire colchester you have not forgot i presume charles how piously i cursed my stars for being compelled to join my regiment at the moment i hoped to have brought matters to bear in a certain affair de coeur which for some time wholly engrossed me  how far my hopes were well founded remains to be proved vanity says well  but be that as it will it is no longer in my power to proceed in it  here i am distant fifty long miles from the fair object of my pursuit so she is safe for the present and i in the mean time must endeavor to console myself the best way i can nature has formed me of a most happy disposition and such as every soldier ought to be composed of since our motions are so very uncertain  you know in what humor i drank my farewell bottle with you at brookess in pretty much the same i began my march to these quarters nor would it have been much improved yet i believe but for an adventure which i am now going to inform you of in few words for i hate longwinded stories nor am i very good at the business  we had arrived within a small space of our destined quarters and were marching to drums beating colors flying music playing etc in order to make our first appearance with proper eclat when behold in a narrow lane through which we were obliged to pass a fair creature on horseback attended by a couple of servants in mourning she too in a habit of the same sable hue which set off her charms to the highest advantage met us as we were flourishing along  she stopped her horse fearing perhaps he might be a little unruly and so it happened for just as i came up she could no longer govern him he started she fell and i charles had the good fortune to quit mine time enough to catch her in my arms almost before she reached the ground  on a nearer view i was struck motionless by her charms such a face such an elegance of person and such a pair of wicked sparkling eyes mine never before encountered  at that moment i as much forgot maria as if no such dear creature existed the betwitching lady stanley for that is the title of my new flame has most effectually done her business and mine too  she has nothing farther to fear from my persecution as she used to call it charles the less cruel arabella shall nay has driven her image from my breast and has supplied its place by her own  you may possibly have seen this lady heard of her you certainly must since her marriage with that old dotard lord stanley made so much noise that even i heard of it though at that time in america  she was the daughter of a citizen who for the sake of having a lord for his soninlaw gave her and twentythousand pounds to a fellow old enough to be her grandfather she had been blessed with a modern education which accounts for her accepting such a husband about six months ago she had the pleasure of seeing him laid in his coffin but not till he had settled on her two thousand a year jointure  her grief is not so violent but it will admit of consolation nor if i mistake not her ideas of virtue so rigid as to make a fellow shoot himself that may happen to be enamoured of her this may suffice to give you an idea of her character in case you should chance to be a stranger to it which i can hardly suppose but of her beauty if you have never seen her i can give you none since it is not in the power of language to do it justice  now charles confess i have been a fortunate fellow for you will not i hope be so impertinent as to fancy i can possibly fail to render myself agreeable to her  thus instead of lounging about at a loss in what manner to kill the time while compelled to remain here i expect and not without reason to pass every hour of it in the highest felicity for as i said before my charmer knows too much of life to assume unnecessary airs of cruelty or i am greatly deceived in the conjectures i have formed of her a few i expect nay wish to meet with as a conquest too easily gained would render the business insipid enchanting as she is farewell i am on the wing to pay my devoirs her seat is but half an hours ride from hence and she expects me  yours etc sommerville  letter v lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanley place he loves me caroline yes the adorable sommerville loves me he has declared his passion in terms so persuasive that i can no longer doubt his sincerity  what will become of all my vows against matrimony should he tempt me to resign my liberty a second time ah i fear they will avail me little when set in competition with his insinuating eloquence yet i have not so far forgot what i suffered while in bondage as to think of it without horror  for love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies is it not so caroline show me the wife at least in the beau monde who is not looked upon with indifference by her husband after the first month or two  and could i exist under such a distressing circumstance from the divine sommerville  no caroline  no  even my pride would not support me under it  in answer to yours what is the censure of the world to me which you endeavor to paint in such flaming colors who does it spare none but the old and ugly believe me nay did it spare me was i not as much censured for marrying as i did as i can be for  for  you understand me child  vain would be the attempt to please every one take my word for it and that being the case the wiseft thing we can do i think is to please ourselves and so my dear do not be shocked if you should hear of a little flirtation being carried on between me and my adonis i make no more vows however observe that  if nothing but the sober state will serve his turn why i must even try what i can do to make him easy  last monday for the first time at my lords request i made my appearance at the assembly  i could not with propriety dance quite so soon nor would i if i could as my vanity was infinitely more gratified in having him and half the pretty fellows in the room attached to me the whole evening to the unspeakable mortification of the misses who languished in vain for partners twas delightful beyond expression to see with what envious eyes they gazed upon me at the same time affecting to put on airs of indifference and contempt the truth is i believe his constant attendance at my villa has already set the silly souls a talking  my husband dead only a few months and i already on so intimate a footing with a gay young fellow fie upon it  it is a fine text for the good souls and i will be sworn has been twisted and turned a thousand different ways by every female in the country  it is ever so in these country places and really one must pardon it in consideration of their being often at a loss for conversation  no wonder they make the most of a subject when they happen to find one and that too so perfectly suited to their taste i am now going to take an airing with him on horseback so must bid you adieu as i expect him every moment and merely took up my pen to kill the time till he arrives and to tell you that i am your perfectly happy  a stanley  letter vi miss herbert to miss fermer colchester my aunt has carried her point in spite of all opposition sophia and i am actually at this moment writing to you in my old apartment in her mansion whether i shall find myself much happier here than at home is a point i am by no means clear in for though a good woman and very fond of me she has her humors as well as some other folks but this at least she has promised that i shall suffer no farther persecution from the wretch as she calls him to whom my dear father has been prevailed upon for the sake of a quiet life to promise my hand  this assurance so necessary to my peace will enable me to bear without a murmur all her whims however ridiculous they may sometimes prove i am therefore highly delighted with the change in my situation and should be still more so were i not by it so far removed from you to whose society i have been so long accustomed but to expect to pass through life without a few disappointments would be expecting more than mortals are entitled to young as i am i think i may with truth say i have already had pretty evident proofs of it  never rage equld my mothers heavens that ever i should be compelled to give that appellation to a being so totally unworthy of it so very unlike her amiable predecessor ah sophia what a revolution has taken place in our once happy family since she assumed the reins of government but as i was saying we carried our point in spite of all her eloquence  my father is conscious i never could be happy with the creature in whose cause she so warmly interests herself he knows it well yet such is the ascendancy she has gained over him he had not courage to declare his sentiments  my aunt whose pride was shocked at the idea of such an alliance and who was glad of an opportunity to mortify a woman she most cordially despises spoke here is with all imaginable freedom and severity and declared rather than see her niece married to such a low bred insignificant illiterate fellow were he ten times richer than he is she would with pleasure follow her to her grave what should her sisters daughter who might boast of having some of the noblest blood in the kingdom in her veins debase herself by an union with an upstart a mushroom who could not trace his pedigree even to his grandfather forbid it pride  no madam cried she animated by the glorious subject of all others most dear to her no i will take care her daughter shall never bring such a disgrace upon our family though mr herbert has been weak enough to form so mean a connection let your nephew look out amongst his equals for a wife there he may find numbers who will pay that respect to his wealth which he is so ambitious to obtain but assure him from me people of family know better on whom to bestow it  happily for me sophia my poor father was not present during the dialogue of which the above is a part i should have sat in misery if he had but as he was not i own i enjoyed it exceedingly to repeat all that passed is impossible suffice it to say i am actually here and depend so much on my aunts pride and spirit that i trust i have nothing farther to apprehend from my ignoble lover now let me tell you my dear sophia what changes have happened amongst my old friends here since i left them so many indeed that thought it is but two years i find very few of my companions remaining some married some dead and others removed to london of the latter are the two amiable fitzherberts they have bid adieu to this part of the world and are both going to be married the gentle maria danby is no more this news though it grieved did not surprise me i feared i had taken a last leave of the dear girl when i was sent for home the lively miss mason has at last given her fair hand to mr mountague and is as gay and and as giddy as if no such sober event had taken place she called upon me the moment she heard of my arrival these i think sophia are all the names you are acquainted with as mrs mountague was my first visitor i learned all the above particulars from her with a thousand diverting anecdotes of many others for nothing escapes her observation the following therefore you will readily believe could not easily do so  but this is not all i have to tell you emily cried she after having answered all my questions we have got a new neighbor you must know to supply the loss of those who have forsaken us and such a flirt  a lady of quality child just imported from london with all the airs and graces of a town bred belle you remember i presume that old sold of a lord whose seat is just by and which you and i used so often to wish in our possession  perfectly well my dear you cannot then have forgot that he like a wise man married a miss i forget her name about two years and a half ago  well and pray what next has he brought her down here to set example to our country damsels  lord child why he is dead she is a widow of six months standing and if i mistake not has already made choice of a second husband we are all ready to run distracted here you must know for she has by a single glance of her wicked eyes robbed us of the most elegant fellow that ever figured amongst us well pray my good friend what pretensions have you to  pho pho interrupting me i guess what you are going to say my dear  i am married  very true but is that a reason why i should not rail at this impertinent monopolizer as well as others  she is very handsome then i suppose o intolerably so replied my friend there is positively no enduring it  then so conceited so horidly conscious of her charms so  so  in short so provokingly insolent that we are all in a rage and wish for nothing so much as to see her fairly eclipsed by some superior beauty and thank my stars i no longer despair of it  you  yes even you my dear emily shall effectually do her business we have all tried it but to no purpose that glorious achievement is reserved for you  really you are wonderfully kind charlotte in wishing to bring me into such a dilemma what have i not to dread should i rob the fair widow of an admirer so highly favored no no i will have nothing to do in the affair so pray settle it the best way you can without me not to mention my doubt of success after the account you have given me of her attractions  o you are wonderfully humble my dear at least you would endeavor to persuade me so but i will disappoint you no compliments shall you get from me i promise you though you have given me so fine an opportunity i leave that to lord sommerville  a lord say you nay then i must positively try what can be done a new face is something in my favor aye emily and such a face as yours too i will take any bet the first glance of those soft blue eyes shall put the widows black ones quite out of fashion so pray exhibit as soon as possible i die to see the effect they will infallibly produce  but where am i to engage in this arduous undertaking how am i to get a sight of him or rather how is this prodigy of a man to get a sight of me  where why at the assembly to be sure for there they never fail to make their appearance but as her ladyships recent state of widowhood does not permit her to dance they sit as spectators flirting at no small rate scarce deigning to take the least notice of any of the company and finding this is to be the case the company now by one consent take as little of them the truth is we begin to suspect  o fie charlotte  nay child wait till you hear others on the subject i have been moderate  remember to put on all your airs and graces next monday i will chaperon you should your aunt decline going  saying this she took her leave  now my dear sophia i must bid you also adieu having spun out my letter to the extent of my paper mrs mountague has imposed a pretty kind of task upon me it must be confessed i cannot say i have quite so great a share of vanity notwithstanding her flattery as to hope for success however i will try what can be done to revenge the cause of our neglected belles believe me ever  sincerely yours emily herbert  letter vii same to the same colchester you are no doubt sophia desirous to hear what success i have had in my intended conquest but i would advise you to suspend your impatience as i am sorry to inform you i have not yet seen this formidable beau  on mentioning to my aunt mrs mountagues request that i should accompany her to the next assembly she not only declined going herself but begged i would not think of it till she could introduce me in a proper manner after that she should have no objection to my going with any of my friends  i own i was a little chagrined at being thus prevented yet upon the whole i believe she was right she piques herself you know upon acting in all things with the exactest propriety  the above point being settled my aunt told me she intended to wait upon lady stanley as she heard she was come to make some stay in the country  the hint charlotte had given me made me hesitate in my assent to her proposal yet how could i venture to object on so slight a foundation and if i had i fear the good ladys prejudice in favor of those happy mortals dignified with a title would have got the better of all i could say she observed however i did not so readily answer her as she expected it seems and asked why i paused  i was then obliged to say something and therefore replied mrs mountague had been talking to me about her and seemed to think her rather gay for one who had so lately lost her husband  so you very wisely concluded mrs mountague a better judge of decorum than i am did you emily she forgets child that some grains of allowance are due to persons of her ladyships rank people of quality have a manner peculiar to themselves which those who are not accustomed as i have been to associate with them do not comprehend i shall most assuredly visit her and have too much regard for you not to take that opportunity of introducing you as from such an example you cannot fail to improve yourself in a thousand things which though trifling perhaps in themselves are yet essentially necessary to render a woman perfectly well bred and which there is no acquiring except by keeping company with those of a certain rank  this sophia was so like my aunt that i could hardly keep my gravity however she luckily did not perceive my looks and it was settled that we were to pay our respects to lady stanley the next day we accordingly did so but had not the felicity of finding her ladyship at home being told she was gone to take an airing  i own i was disappointed as my curiosity was greatly excited the following morning our visit was returned but alas we were then from home also  thus all things remain just as they were when i wrote last except that we have taken the preliminary steps toward making an acquaintance with this beauteous widow whose charms have caused such violent emotions amongst us i ought not indeed to include myself since i cannot say i am conscious of any at present how it may be when i have seen her and her adorer i know not in the interim i am busily employed in making preparations for the assembly and that let me tell you is now an affair of no small importance seeing i am deputed to so great an undertaking as the conquest of a lord  were i to let my aunt into the grand secret i am persuaded she would with joy play the part of my abigal herself on the occasion could she thereby hope to facilitate so glorious an enterprise how would she exult how triumph if she could by my means or indeed any other add another twig of quality to her genealogical tree  farewell dear sophia in my next i hope to give a more particular account than i can do at preset in the mean time believe me ever  affectionately yours emily herbert  letter viii same to the same colchester the important day is over sophia and i have seen them  but i will for once endeavor to be circumstantially minute as i know it will please you better than to skim the surface over as i generally do  well my dear  i dressed and will freely own paid rather more attention than usual to the labors of my toilet this labor was not lost for if i might trust my glass i really looked more than barely tolerable  at the hour appointed mrs mountague and her handsome husband called upon us for she had agreed to go with us though my aunt was to be of the party  the moment she saw me ah the poor widow cried she alas thy triumph is near an end  why emily for heavens sake what kind fairy has presided at your toilet to day in my life i never saw you half so lovely what say you mountague dont you think a certain event is on the eve of taking place i know not charlotte replied he what event you particularly allude to but this i will venture to prophesy there will be many a wounded heart sent home this evening from the assembly  aye that there will cried she both male and female or i am much mistaken but let us be going we are late enough  away we drove the room was already crowded mr mountague led my aunt to a feat sir charles neville whom we met at the door took charlottes hand and a friend of his a mr aston presented me his and we followed them  twould be nothing sophia were i not to add all eyes were fixed upon us as we sailed up the room this you must take for granted or all my trouble in decorating myself must have been to very little purpose  i was impatient you may believe to discover the captivating widow and no less to have a peep at her charming captive in this i was instantly gratified as they sat exactly oppofite to us charlotte was going to point them out to me when i said in a half whisper you may save yourself that trouble i cannot be mistaken in my life i never saw so striking a figure  as which as her ladyship to be sure replied i  you have quite overlooked her impertinent lover then emily  not absolutely but one at a time if you please we will think of him by and by  while this passed for it is a farce to deny it i observed his lordships eyes frequently strayed to where we sat or must i be vain enough to say they were fixed upon me her ladyship too favored me with some very scrutinizing glances my aunt now being informed who she was desired the master of the ceremonies to introduce us to lady stanley this done the usual compliments of being sorry we had not the honor of meeting her ladyship at home etc etc passed on all sides and we again took our seats i confess i found her manner and address rather cold and a little haughty my aunt however was very well satisfied and declared her quite the woman of quality  minuets were now going to begin we observed lord sommerville press lady stanley to walk one with him she appeared surprised at his importunity as if she had said why this whim to night when you know i never do this was the interpretation my friend and i put upon it be that as it will she declined his invitation but judge of her emotions for believe me sophia they were abundantly visible when on her ladyships refusing he instantly came up to me and begged i would do him that honor she appeared shocked to death and really if she had made a point of aving him wholly to herself not without reason since it seems this was the first instance in which he had presumed to swerve from his allegiance  i certainly had no pretense to follow her ladyships example as i was not obliged to know that by complying with a request so natural i planted daggers in her gentle bosom i gave him my hand then not i do assure you with an air of triumph but with as much ease and indifference as i should have given it to any other man in the room  how we performed will no doubt be recorded in the annals of the assembly so to their authority i shall leave you for information i may now truly affirm every eye was intently fixed upon us except when turned to observe what effect this wonderful event produced on his mortified fair one i durst not for my life meet those of my friend mrs mountague least her looks should have disconcerted mine for well did i know they would be archly expressive of her triumph  by the time we had finished our minuet her ladyship had pretty well recovered from the shock her vanity had received and my lord having led me to my seat not without a gentle pressure for that sophia would have been a solicism in gallantry of which i presume he is incapable he found her on his return flirting most unmercifully with one of his brother red coats her hoop flung so gracefully over him one could barely discover the beaus head from under it and so intent were they on what they were saying that it was some time before they observed his lordship had joined them or at least chose to observe it how or whether he made his peace i know not i rather doubt not as in spite of her ladyships uncommon flow of spirits we could perceive symptoms of their being a little forced as for him though he did not leave her side during the rest of the evening i am sorry to say i caught his eyes wandering now and then and by frequent taps she gave him with her fan it appeared she found him somewhat remiss in his attentions  the room was so much crowded that i was averse from joining in the country dances but was at length prevailed upon to go down one with mr aston who is a very handsome and very pleasing young man indeed the ladies in general speak of him in warmer terms and perhaps he deserves it but you know i had other things in view  now my dear i leave you to draw what inference you think proper from the important particulars above recited  have i or have i not fulfilled my friend mrs mountagues prophesy for my part i pretend not to judge that her ladyship was under some unpleasant apprehensions there is no denying but whether she had cause for them is another affair they served however to divert charlotte and her friend emily as well as if ever so well founded nay she insists upon it they were so and is positive her reign is drawing to a conclusion  you will naturally expect i should tell you what is my opinion of the hero who has made so capital a figure in my epistle  why really my dear i have scarcely formed any that he is uncommonly handsome is most certain  that he dances gracefully presses ones hand with a tenderness an elegance of manner quite out of the common run is no less so  his eyes his teeth his hair are fine beyond expression i must acknowledge in short he is take him for all in all the kind of man one would not wish to be robbed of can i then blame her ladyships fears  were he as tenderly attached to me as it seems he is to her i presume  but we will presume no farther  she is much too handsome to be so easily rivalled no no sophia take my word for it she knows full well how to preserve the conquest she has gained but so much for badinage  my aunt whose passion for whist is as great as ever is to have a party in a few days lady stanley will not fail to have a card of invitation you may be sure  my lord i imagine has no chance for that as he has not yet been introduced and we do nothing contrary to the strictest rules of etiquette but as we have a violent predilection in favor of quality it is possible she will contrive to get it done before the day arrives  i therefore need not give myself any trouble supposing i was anxious about the matter which i by no means grant  farewell dear sophia believe me i am sufficiently happy in being relieved for the present from the teazing importunities of that odious wretch fitzpatrick were i but certain i should be no more tormented on his account lady stanley should have my free consent to convert her so much envied lover into a husband whenever she pleased witness my hand  emily herbert  letter ix lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanley place would you believe it caroline i have had a fracas with sommerville  twas a foolish affair and certainly unworthy my notice but one is not always on ones guard against those kind of weaknesses  will you credit me when i tell you i was the other night seized with so unaccountable a fit of humility as to experience something very like symptoms of jealousy true as you are alive  i now blush while i write it and wonder at my own folly not but he behaved in a most ridiculous manner as you will say and i have since made him confess  you must know there is a mrs grenville who has a house in this neighborhood she was absent when i first came but returned about ten days since and brought with her a niece the daughter of her sister who it seems died a few years ago but why the deuce should i take the trouble to give you their stupid history  this niece i will warrant ye is looked upon as a beauty and so was of course dressed out as if for conquest and introduced at the assembly last monday i should tell you however they had lest their names at my door some time before  i happened to be at the rooms when miss made her first appearance fellows are so volatile you know caroline any thing new no matter what attracts their silly notice not but the girl is handsome enough that is she is tall and fair and really at a distance looks very tolerable in short she no sooner marched up the room than i heard a general buz of who is she who can it be and such kind of vulgar countrylike exclamations i now turned my eyes and found this prodigy such as i have described her  she was accompanied by a mrs mountague who is also reckoned a beauty we have a profusion of such beauties here you must know and who affects to give herself as many airs as if she really was one  well  up they came to me and made some awkward speeches about not being at home when i did them the honor to return their visit and such kind of common place chat to which you may believe i paid very little attention  i own i rather wondered sommerville made no remarks when they went back to their seats as she certainly is not the sort of girl to be wholly overlooked but i soon found he had not been stupid enough for that neither for no sooner were the minutes going to begin than he was visibly in the fidgets i saw plainly she had caught his observation and that he died to exhibit his fine person with her  i enjoyed his perplexity though not a little chagrined i confess to find she had made such an impression on the sly wretch  but you will scarce believe me when i tell you the artifice he had recourse to in order to gratify the whim that had taken possession of him  nothing would serve him truly but i must oblige him by dancing a minuet with him  the first time observe he had requested such a favor knowing i had made a point of not doing it  nor had he till then looked upon it as any mortification but now he began to think me much to blame to appear so singular why not do as others did he longed to have me show them what a minuet ought to be and a profusion of such nonsense  never caroline had he appeared to me in so truly ridiculous a light i however refused and that too with a countenance which pretty plainly expressed my sentiments  he affected not to observe it but with a forced laugh cried how can you my dear creature be thus perverse how can you when you see the dancing fit so strong upon me thus refuse the honor of this dear hand but i will be revenged in the mean time i will go and figure with that new comer whose looks tell me she would be horribly disappointed after all the pains she has taken to decorate herself if she should not get an opportunity to display her finery to advantage  away he flew not daring to wait for my reply well knowing i was not so easily to be imposed upon as he affected to believe what would i not have given that she had been engaged how should i have enjoyed it but no such matter  up she got and simpered not a little at being so distinguished  how she performed you must guess as i cannot inform you for i took care to cast my eyes another way  major mansell sat at my elbow while this pretty scene was going forward i now turned all my attention on him and when sommerville had ended his frolic he found us so deeply engaged in a lively conversation that it was a considerable while before i saw he was returned to his seat  as my spirits were by that time recovered most unmercifully did i torment him the major quite elate with the notice i had taken of him joined me and i believe before we had done the poor penitent sommerville wished from his soul he had rather been seized with a fit of the gout than that of dancing  and he is now so heartily ashamed of his absurdity and the figure he cut while we were plaguing him that i think we have fairly destroyed any impression the girl had made upon his mind you know my talent for satire caroline i exerted it to the utmost and set miss off in such whimsical colors that i will engage he will never be able to overcome his regret for giving occasion to so much raillery  from that moment he has been more assiduous more attentive more devoted to me than ever and whenever i attempt to make her the subject of our conversation which i have several times done in a ludicrous manner he begs me to spare him and confesses the joke is so entirely against him that he cannot stand it  thus ends the story of our first fracas but whether it will be the last heaven knows that he at present adores me is most certain and that i adore him is no less so  judge then caroline what would be my feelings were he to  ah let me not for one moment suppose him capable of inconstancy  yet have i not some little cause to fear  when even an insignificant chit like her could for an instant produce such an effect  but caroline let her beware how she presumes to form hopes of his attchment  i am not a woman formed to set tamely down under such a mortification i know not what i say  i hate i despise myself for deigning to bestow a thought upon her  but let her as i said beware how she presumes to lay snares for a heart i think worth preserving  let us talk no more of her she has already engrossed more of my time and thoughts than she has any title to more i am persuaded than she has of my enchanting sommervilles however she may flatter herself to the contrary and flatter herself she will i make no doubt since her pert friend mrs mountague will not forget to inform her she is the only girl he has hitherto condescended to distinguish  this will of course set her silly heart in a flutter and  but no more of the hateful subject  i detest myself for troubling my head so much about it all i meant when i took up my pen was to divert you with the ridiculous story and to laugh with you at it and yet it has actually put me out of temper  nor can any thing in life be more stupid  we are to visit too that is the best of it we shall no doubt be prodigiously intimate  adieu dear caroline i do not intend being at their next trumpery assembly i am sick of them one cannot for ever laugh at the same thing however laughable  yours sincerely arabella stanley  letter x lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire colchester charles i have got into a most confounded scrape and how to extricate myself in the manner i wish the lord above knows i am cursedly entangled with this seducing this bewitching widow i still do justice to her charms and confess they are superior to most i have seen yet i never told you they were such as to make a serious or lasting impression on me this you cannot deny  she is not the kind of woman with whom ones heart has any thing to do  all i meant by my connection with her was to amuse the time likely to hang heavy on my hands while confined to country quarters this purpose she fully answered but for any thing farther i never had an idea of it  true one could not be quite so explicit with her on the subject and she has unluckily taken a thousand ridiculous things for granted which never once entered into my head the consequence is i do not know for my soul how to get handsomely quit of her  but why in such a hurry you will probably ask since our amor is of so short a date  that is the very thing charles i am to explain to you  though my heart has been merely passive in this affair it is now in a very different state nay if i may judge by its present feelings i am apt to believe it has never known any thing of a real passion for ah charles never till now had it seen the lovely the engaging the blooming emily herbert all language must fall far short of her perfection it is impossible to give you an idea of her  suffice it to say that i love love even to madness and nothing but the possession of the heart and person of her i adore can restore me to my sober senses marry her i cannot for am i not as bad as married already fettered by that cursed engagement to my cousin  would to the lord she were buried fifty fathom deep  my wife father may thank himself for all the irregularities i have been and may chance to be guilty of had he left me at liberty to follow my own inclinations i am positive i should have led a better life than i have done not that i have been much worse than my neighbors after all though they are pleased to take some liberties with my character let them be placed in my confounded situation and see if they will behave better marry her i certainly never will but unless she is graciously pleased to release me from my engagement i can marry no other  is this charles so great a trouble a man cannot get over do you think or equal to losing the better half of my estate  i think not now should i be refractory and take any other woman to be my wedded wife in defiance of the family compact that precious better half goes to her ladyship  curse me if it shall no no my consolation is i am not compelled to be hers  that is no inconsiderable one and since i cannot be anothers charles let the dear creatures look to themselves it would be devilish hard if i may not be permitted to amuse myself amongst them the best way i can since my perverse stars forbids my figuring in the sober character of a husband that is to say unless they have the liberty to choose me a wife  what i have now said i hope will fully justify any steps i may find it necessary to take in the prosecution of the affair on which my whole happiness at this moment depends in your opinion i mean in my own it certainly will  but i confess i have so much regard for you though you are rather a queer fellow too in some respects that i should not like to incur your censure  i wish to the lord charles you would go and pay your addresses to my rib elect perhaps you may like her well enough though i do not for she is thought by the unprejudiced both handsome and agreeable i will lay my life she will not refuse you you are as clever a fellow pretty nearly as myself nay she may chance to give you the preference for women are whimsical kind of animals that she does not care a straw for me she has the impertinence to acknowledge but loves mischief so much better than any thing else in life that she vows she will either have me or my estate out of pure spite and revenge for my indifference  there is a spirit for you  dont you think i should be wondrous happy with such a helpmate she like a vixen as she is enjoys my hampered situation beyond expression and makes it the subject of her mirth not only to me when we happen to meet but to every body else would to heaven she was as madly in love with me as i am with my adored emily that i might have it in my power to break her heart by my cruelty  yet this is the girl my father thought fit to entail upon me for a wife because truly he fancied himself under obligations to her father who chose to ask only that as a return for the favors he had conferred had i been in england when he died i might perhaps have contrived to have got the article relating to the cursed agreement struck out of his will but as illluck would have it before i arrived all was over and i found myself fettered as securely as law could bind me  thus circumstanced charles what is to be done  my emilys situation in life is such as precludes all hope of obtaining her on those terms as i only am at liberty to offer i saw her for the first time at the assembly about ten days since i was sitting by lady stanley who had till then wholly engrossed me being by far the finest woman in the place and having as i told you before in very plain terms expressed her partiality for me i could not do less than make a suitable return  we were of course on the most amicable footing imaginable  but ah charles who can express either my emotions or embarrassment on seeing the most angeic creature my eyes ever beheld walk up the room embarrassment i say because i durst not for my soul let her ladyship see the impression her beauty had made upon me  i was compelled to dissemble yet made so bungling a piece of work of it that it was to no purpose she saw it and though visibly enraged that i should presume to cast an eye on any other than herself affected to rally me with an air of indifference and to turn those perfections she secretly envied into ridicule we both failed in our purpose however it was no subject for a joke  i used all my efforts to command myself for that evening at least but found it absolutely impossible in spite of the mortification i well knew my mistress must suffer the music no sooner began for minuets than up i started charles the idea of her dear hand being given to another was not to be endured i made an offer of mine to my widow begging she would for once indulge me she saw through me and gave me such a look  but no hand you may believe  away i flew to my charmer and she with an ease a grace there is no describing granted my suit heavens what elegance what modest dignity did she display in every motion had she not thought fit to put an end to it i should have danced on for the whole evening she smiled at my visible inattention to the business but whether she imputed it to the right cause i know not though i flatter myself she could not be at a loss to guess  figure to yourself charles what passed on my return to my angry fair one words would never give you an idea of the scene i certainly looked as truly ridiculous as even she could wish indeed i felt it she however was flirting at no small rate with our major quite unconcerned as it were affected not to observe me for some time and when she did cast an eye upon me was so gracious so lively so witty  in short charles it was an excellent farce  i have since patched up a kind of peace but i shrewdly suspect it will not be very lasting though she endeavors to make me believe she has forgot the whole affair this i know is far from being the case and i shall therefore be upon my guard for i am fully persuaded she is not of a temper to put up without resentment what she will doubtless deem an unpardonable insult offered to her charms she has a devil of a spirit and i am well assured would stick at nothing to be revenged it is this belief makes me say i am got into a confounded scrape  had the lovely the enchanting emily been some weeks longer before she made her appearance it is probable she might have found lady stanley in a more favorable disposition her partiality might by that time have been lessened for i have not the vanity to flatter myself even my attractions great as they are and violent as the effect is they have produced on her would have power to fix a woman of her principies for any considerable period  but to rob her of her captive in the very height of her passion to rival her in my love at the moment she believed me blind to the perfections of every other woman  is this to be borne charles by a female of her spirit i sear not i own i have my suspicions as i think she over acts her part i doubt the sincerity of those smiles she favors me with and shrewdly suspect they are intended to conceal some hidden purpose it is unnatural to believe she could so easily pardon the emotions to which she was a witness the first sight of her rival gave birth to it is true i said all that man could say to appeafe the storm and as i was telling you she endeavors to persuade me i have succeeded though i doubt the fact  but this is not the worst  how shall i presume to sue for the affections of the lovely emily at the time when every soul in the neighborhood are talking most impertinently of my passion for the widow  you will easily guess our flirtation has afforded ample scope for teatable chat and that she has already been let into the whole secret  my constancy to be sure will appear to no great advantage yet must it not be more flattering to her to find her charms have had the power to diffolve such an attachment than if she had merely captivated an unengaged heart  certainly and depend upon it this reflection will have its due weight thus i reason upon it charles and i hope you will think it reasonable  pardon the pun should it strike you as one  well dont you think i am in a hopeful way entangled with one woman for whom i never in reality cared sixpence and dying for another who probably cares as little for me but i will not think my case so desperate because i should be tempted to shoot myself through the head did i believe it  after this i need hardly tell you i mean to try my sat with the dear girl and shall soon know whether i am to load my pistols or not for as to living without her it is an impossibility  this is all i can tell you at present except that my torment for as such i now look upon her visits the idol of my soul  her aunt with whom she lives at present has so great a partiality for every thing dignified with a title that in spite of a few scandalous anecdotes which have flown about concerning her ladyship she has called upon her on her return to the country  the same favorable circumstance may perhaps gain me admission hitherto i have only had the felicity of meeting my adorable once or twice as she was airing in the carriage with her old duenna my bow was graciously returned accompanied by a most bewitching smile  adieu   yours sincerely sommerville  letter xi miss herbert to miss fermer colchester so you are perfectly of mrs mountagues opinion sophia  surely this cannot be from any thing i told you since i merely said i had seen his lordship and that he had done me the honor to dance a minuet with me if this is a proof of conquest it renders the matter mighty easy  but what will you say my dear when informed that he is now not only a visitor here but a first rate favorite of my aunts she has had several parties and his lordship is never left out of the list of her invited friends  he is so well bred so agreeable so perfectly the man of quality  these are her remarks not mine pray observe that though i confess i must subscribe to the justice of them for he really has the art of pleasing in a very eminent degree  and does he practice this dangerous talent on you emily my sophia would i presume  why not it would be paying me a poor compliment were be to make me an exception  but no more trifling i love you too well to teaze you  know then that i have some little reason to believe i have made a deeper impression upon his mind than is perfectly agreeable to his friend the charming widow for she now affects to talk of him merely as a friend a young man for whom she really has a particular esteem one whom she wishes well as he appears to be deserving and to whom as a stranger in the country and a man of fashion she has shown some little attntion  you stare  that my dear is merely because you are unacquainted with the ton or the manners and caprices of a belle from the metropolis i doubt not you was simple enough to expect i had to tell you her ladyship like our coantry bred damsels was sighing and pining herself to death and was actually driven to despair by the perfidy of her fickle admirer  no such thing believe me it is not the fashion my dear in the beau monde in love to pine and languish  is quite out of the question there such a conduct would imply a degree of constancy at which a fine london lady would blush what their real feelings may be is another affair but to appear as if they felt themselves forsaken what woman of spirit would submit to not lady stanley at least i can answer for her and certainly it is the wisest course though every one has not a sufficient share of philosophy to put it in practice  my aunt is now fully convinced there never was any other than a friendly regard between them perhaps she is the more inclined to be of this opinion because she has i verily believe from the particular attention my lord begins to honor her niece with formed some very ridiculous and most likely sallacious hopes ridiculous i call them and i think justly for can any thing be more against them than this recent proof of his inconstancy  what reliance can we or ought we to place on a man of such a changeable disposition any new face i presume if tolerable would produce the same effect he vows the contrary for he has already begun vowing and all that sophia but whatever the neglected widow may think proper to confess she too could tell the same story or i am much mistaken  after all i cannot persuade myself her passion for him has been very deeply rooted since if it had i think artful as she is she could not all at once have assumed such an air of in ifference it is more probable she is as well as himself blessed with a dash of inconstancy in her nature or she could not so calmly resign him  do not from this sophia infer i think him so valuable a prize i must know him better before i determine that point at present appearances are rather against him according to my ideas  and were it otherwise and he should really mean to gratify my aunts ambition what am i to do with my nabob  can she suppose my stepdame will so easily give up her point and consent to her hopeful nephews being rejected for any lord in the creation  oh sophia if i can contrive to delay that hated match it is all i dare hope for  yet mere delay will not do neither heaven forbid i should ever be compelled to be his but i mean if they will permit me to live single it is all the favor i can expect and compared to giving him my hand would be perfect happiness  i tremble every day left i should get letters to order me home my only trust is that my aunt is if possible as averse from calling him nephew as i am to call him  ah i shudder even to write it  and that she will not easily be prevailed upon to put me again in his way now indeed she will be more averse than ever having as i said formed hopes of so superior a nature all his boasted wealth will never in her opinion compensate for the meanness of his origin  this is with her an unsurmountable objection but i sophia find a thousand others he is a creature of no education no breeding no delicacy i should blush every time he opened his lips there is a vulgarity about him that absolutely shocks me yet he has the vanity to fancy himself a man of the first consequence and has more hauteur than if he really as so but this is natural since pride and meanness are inseparable companions  most fervently do i pray he may meet in london where he is at present some sair creature more to his taste there he may find numbers who will gladly accept him with all his imperfections it is only such silly souls as you and sophia who having unfortunately more sentiment than ambition could resist so splendid a temptation that this may be the first news i hear is the sincere wish of   your affectionate friend emily herbert  letter xii lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanley place help me caroline to execrate the most ungrateful the most perfidious of men and above all help me to take ample vengeance on the detested object who has robbed me of his heart  yes caroline i have lost it  in vain would he add to his guilt by endeavoring to deceive me i despise him for daring to sancy he can impose upon me by his feigned tenderness long have i been sensible of the mortifying truth a love like mine was too clear sighted not to perceive it in spite of all his efforts to conceal what he had not courage openly to avow  ah no wonder he should blush at so preposterous an attachment  heavens that i should live to find a rival in a creature so insignificant a mere ignorant girl who has no one thing to recommend her but youth and novelty  oh how i could curse the hour in which i was fool enough to fix my affections on a wretch so unworthy that tenderness my weak heart has lavished on him  why are you not here that i might without the trouble of writing vent a part of the rage which at this moment consumes me  i am distracted driven to madness nor shall i ever know one moments peace of mind till i have effectually destroyed theirs  let her not presume to flatter herself her triumph shall be of long duration she shall be humbled caroline humbled to the dust if my good genius does not forsake me in the glorious attempt  can you figure to yourself what were my feelings on finding my suspicions of his infidelity confirmed beyond all possible doubt yet what a question  no you must first have loved like me and like me have been   i will not cannot proceed  my pride forbids it  let me from this hour banish that horrid idea from my memory and for the future devote my whole attention to dear revenge  little does he know the woman he has dared to slight but he shall by dear bought experience learn she is not formed of such soft materials as either to forget or forgive an injury though she has art enough to concenl her resentment till a proper opportunity presents itself in which she can display it to some purpose  and of that she does not despair but let me endeavor to be calm that i may give you some idea of my present situation  what i have now said will not much surprise von after the hints you will find dropped in several of my letters i confess i found it no very pleasant business to be more explicit however i have at lerght conquered that scruple and have freely told you sommerville has proved himself a villain  that is to say a man for are they not all deceivers born for our destruction  it is the character given of them by one of their own sex yet in spite of this we continue to believe and are of course undone  finding all hopes of regaining his perfidious heart at an end i at once determined to deceive him in my turn i could not stoop to reproaches scorned to gratify his vanity so far as to give him so clear a proof that he had it in his power to mortify mine i took a different method and flatter myself he is the dupe of my artifice  spare yourself the trouble my dear sommerville said i one day while he was endeavoring to persuade me of what he well knew was a falsity why this reserve with your friends i am not to learn that we cannot command our affections i know it by experience mine has betrayed me into a weakness which those destitute of my sensibility would undoubtedly condemn perhaps i ought to condemn myself  that you did love me i have had many prooss but that you now love another is no less clear to me  ah my charming lady stanley cried he attempting to take my hand   do not interrupt what i am saying nor fancy an apology either necessary or possible to excuse you for what most women would style your perfidious conduct  i scorn to reproach you nay i am sensible the crime is as involuntary as were your professions to me of an everlasting attachment you then believed what you swear i was happy while that attachment continued but do not fancy me so unreasonable a creature as to blame you for what i know it is not in your power to help  inconsistency is rooted in our nature it is vain to deny it you have only got the start of me my good friend for do not flatter yourself my passion for you could have retained its first fervor much longer i might indeed have followed your example and have attempted to deceive you i will also add i think i should have been more successful too for you men are sad bunglers in these matters but my nature is open frank and honest  since love is then at an end let us at least continue friends i will not swear i shall not look out for another adonis to supply your place a woman must have somebody to say civil things to her perhaps i may not easily find one who is so well qualified for the employment as yourself perhaps too i wish you had not quite so soon resigned it but as i said before i am for a woman a tolerably reasonable being  now sommerville giving him my hand we are friends he pressed it to his lips ah how i adore this noble candor these truly generous sentiments i ever knew my lovely arabella was above the little foibles of her sex  no compliments i beseech you you forget your conduct flatly contradicts the flaming speech you have just made farewell i am going to dress when you can spare an hour from more agreeable avocations let me see you saying this i bid him good morning and he not less astonished than delighted i presume at my heroism left me  now caroline let me know what you think of my fortitude it cost me some pangs i own but trust i shall be amply recompensed before i have done with them  to facilitate my purpose i judged it proper to cultivate some degree of intimacy with my rival and her old aunt the latter thinks herself a prodigy of wisdom but is in fact a fool whom i most cordially despise  as much do i despise the distinction she treats me with for well do i know it is my title alone to which i am indebted for it to her inferiors or such as she is pleased to look upon in that light she behaves with all the insolence and pride you can possibly imagine she absolutely sickens me with her fulsome adulation i am so my ladyd and ladyshipd whenever we meet that i can hardly restrain my risible faculties i see plainly she bridles not a little at the conquest her babyfaced niece has made and has already set her down in her stupid imagination a ladysip also  but i will take care to disappoint her silly hopes supposing the fellow has in reality any such views which i am however very far from believing  heavens were i convinced he had ever formed so foolish so absurd an idea i swear to you i would not seruple to treat them both with a dose of poison i freely confess that would be a triumph i could not stand  but enough of the detested subject for the present i must now reflection what is to be done  adieu  arabella stanley  letter xiii miss herbert of miss fermer colchester will it greatly suprise you my dear sophia to hear that the elegant sommerville has actually declared himself my lover  not at all you reply since you foresaw what would happen from the first  you have certainly proved yourself mistress of no small share of discernment for it is really and truly the case  that is to say he swears it  how truly i dare not yet pronounce but if this should not excite your astonishment surely what i am going to add must  lady stanley and i are now on the most sociable footing imaginable she calls upon me frequently and talks of his lordship with so much ease and indifference that i am almost tempted to believe the report of her intimacy with him has absolutely been groundless either this is the case or she is the most complete dissembler i ever met with she told me he had made her the confidant of his passion for me spoke of him in the highest terms and really pleaded his cause with nearly as much warmth as he does himself  what are we to think of all this sophia for my part i am wholly at a loss  if she does nay if she ever did love him it is most unnatural most unaccountable  yet what interest can she have in playing the hypocrite to me  i confess i doubt exceedingly those professions of regard and friendship she continually expresses not only for him but myself also they are too violent to be sincere on so short an acquaintance as ours i believe were the truth known she sets me down as a very cold insipid kind of a girl for i cannot prevail on myself to make suitable returns to all the civil things she is pleased to say to me i have not lived long enough in the beau monde to be mistress of such a flattering talent  my aunt and her ladyship are exceedingly gracious and no wonder for she affects to pay the highest deference to all she says and in my humble opinion that has been a great deal more than was necessary to one who is in fact a stranger but who can feel any degree of reserve or conceal any thing a person of quality will do one the honor to listen to  this obliging condescension has induced my loquacious aunt to acquaint her with all our family affairs and amongst others my fathers ridiculous plan as she calls it of giving my hand to morton whose accomplishments she has painted in no very flattering colors nor has she forgot to assure her it is a match which never shall take place while it is in her power to prevent it her sisters daughter shall never be thrown away on such an upstart a fellow of yesterday whose fortune is the only circumstance that could possibly gain him admission to the company of gentlemen  lady stanley applauds her spirit the delicacy of her sentiments and the noble resolution she has formed to oppose so preposterous an alliance and then flatters her vanity by mentioning lord sommervilles visble attachment  i generally sit silent on these occasions horribly vexed at my aunts wellmeant simplicity and doubting the truth of every word her ladyship utters  how is it possible sophia to conceive a regard for a person of whose veracity you are by no means certain a first impression is not easily conquered and the first i received of this i suspect artful dowager was not the most favorable  a title in the opinion of my good aunt is like charity it covers a multitude of faults but i am sorry to say i have not so high a veneration for it so his lordship need not be jealous of his since it will have very little influence in deciding the answer i am to give to his suit  i begin to fear you too sophia will think me as well as lady stanley rather tinctured with insipidity by the cool unimpassioned manner in which i write of a lover and of such a lover too as the accomplished sommerville  but you are mistaken my dear if you fancy i am quite insensible to his merit and attraction  ah sophia would it not be better could i with truth assure you they had made no impression on me most certainly it would for what can i expect but trouble and distress from indulging hopes which never may be realized  my aunt on the contrary sees no obstacles insists upon it i shall accept his hand without consulting even my father is positive he will be highly delighted to find she has been able to procure for me so noble an alliance it is all to be her doings you see sophia  that he is amiable and that my heart is but too sensible of it i will not pretend to deny yet still i dare not look forward i see nothing as i was saying but trouble and disappointment think of the rage and indignation i should bring upon my poor fathers head however he might secretly approve my conduct can i without pain think of subjecting him to the storm he must consequently expect from a wife of whose implacable disposition he has had so many proofs i am shocked at the idea  yet still more shocked at the thoughts of appeasing the storm by the sacrifice of my peace of mind and of every possibility of happiness  till i saw that is till i knew lord sommerville the utmost of my hopes was permission to live single rather than give my hand to the man i detest but now sophia i am afraid that permission alone would not content me yet even that is not yet granted  i every day expect to be obliged to return home in spite of all my aunts efforts to detain me the hated time draws near when my tormentor is again to be in our neighborhood which will i doubt prove the last of my liberty as they will certainly recall me then farewell hope farewell happiness and farewell my too amiable sommerville  the subject has quite disconcerted me sophia i must bid you adieu dearly i i fear shall i pay for the few weeks happiness i have enjoyed since i came here alas alas how little do we know what is likely to promote our felicity to avoid one kind of misery have i not foolishly plunged myself into another which may perhaps prove as fatal to my peace  adieu once more  my dear sophia emily herbert  letter xiv lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire colchester i plead guilty charles so pray let me have your pardon yet is it so very wonderful i should have been a little negligent when you consider the nature of the business i am engaged in to get fairly quit of one mistress and to gain the heart of another no tristing affair you must confess and what none but a fellow of my spirit i will venture any bet could have so happily accomplished in so short a time  i told you in my last i believe of being introduced to mrs grenville and of course to her adorable niece the lovely emily this i feared was not the most difficult part of the undertaking how to appease the apprehended wrath of my fair dowager appeared to me infinitely more so  but judge if you can of my astonishment when on my attempting to make a blundering kind of defense for a conduct my conscience told me deserved her indignation she very coolly and calmly acquitted me of all blame said the inconstancy of men never in the least surprised her she was sorry my passion had been of so very short a date here is she confessed might have held out some time longer though that it would have come to end as mine had done she had not a doubt was too generous to blame me for a fault which nature had intailed upon every son and daughter of adam wished me success in my new amor and concluded by saying since our love is thus come to an untimely end let us commence friends and see how that will do  this charles or words to the same purpose was the substance of her ladyships speech  i was confounded  twas so wholly out of the common style so new so very whimsical that upon my soul i looked like one doubtful whether to langh or cry would you believe it i felt a kind of disappointment a sort of mortification at finding myself held so confoundedly cheap  i endeavored to persuade myself twas merely a feint in order to recall me to my duty and by no means the real dictates of her heart  but faith she keeps it up not the shadow of displeasure have i had the consolation to perceive in her from that time to this  it is rather provoking charles however convenient it may be to my future operations but i now begin to suspect i have been the dupe and that she never cared for me farther than to gratify her vanity the devils in it if she could so easily have given me up if she had what think you yet you need not subscribe to that opinion it is not quite so pleasant as one could wish  she bid me too not be surprised if i found her looking out for another adonis to supply my place as she could not exist without somebody to say civil things to her  so cool so cursedly easy charles i could cut my throat for having held so despicable an employment not one tear not even a sigh escaped her  so far from it finding i was in no haste to leave her she very composedly told me she was going to dress should always be glad to see me and wished me a good morning  thus ends the story of me and my impertinent widow and now for that of my divine emily and a wonderful story you will say it is when i tell you i begin to suspect it must in spite of a thousand obstacles end in sober serious matrimony  i see no other resource charles she is not the kind of person to whom one dare offer less honorable terms of capitulation i see plainly with her it must be neck or nothing and certainly if any woman can merit such a sacrifice she is to all intents and purposes that woman yet the thoughts of being fettered not to mention the loss of two thousand a year by the bargain goes cursedly against the grain then what a triumph to that spiteful witch who is to be so great a gainer  at some moments i am tempted to play the hero and carry her off but what next  the scene which must of course follow so glorious an achievement does not appear very delightful i will honestly confess when i figure to myself the dear girl fainting dying distracted and justly accusing me as the author of all that misery i have not courage to undertake it unless i could persuade myself she would condescend to pardon such a step in consideration of the unconquerable passion which impelled me to take it and this i find no easy matter  a woman of virtue never can and my emily is pure and spotless as an angel both in mind and person  what is then to be done it is a question not easily answered charles i have asked it of myself a thousand times but never could hit upon one in any degree satisfactory one expedient there is and but one which if i can manage the point may at least remove part of my trouble and no inconsiderable part neither  it is this could i prevail on her to consent to a private marriage and to conceal it till the patience of lady mary is exhausted it might save me the mortification of seeing my estate played the very devil with  for i cannot suppose she will submit to lead apes merely to plague me fond as she is of mischief i would gladly hope when she finds she can make nothing of me she will make a husband of somebody else and that too before it is very long  there will certainly be no joke in playing the fool till she is as gray as her grandmother at least if she does carry it so far the laugh will be at her expense  now if i can bring my mind to fix on this plan which is by no means clear yet i do not absolutely despair of success my hopes of it are founded on two circumstances which i think have some weight  first my beloveds hand is promised by her father to a fellow who though rich as a jew she abhors her aunt who has a convenient dash of family pride in her composition is no less averse from the match than her lovely niece the second is that rather than give up the prospect of her being one day acknowledged the wife of a peer she would wait for that day any reasonable time provided the matter was made honorably certain  ambition is her hobby horse this i discovered before i had been an hour in her company and to a view of this nature i impute the gracious reception i met with  if therefore i can bring myself to swallow the bitter pill and can also bring her over to my party i think my adorable will not be able to withstand our united eloquences  had any one charles six months ago  nay six week told me i should now be talking thus seriously of matrimony i should have given them little credit for their skill in divination  yet so it is you see judge then what an angel what an irresistible creature my emily must be who has in so short a time wrought a miracle of this nature  love charles all powerful love  omnia vincit amor  there is all that can be said for it and so fare ye well  my next may probably tell you on what i have finally resolved  till then and ever  believe me yours sommerville  letter xv miss herbert to miss fermer sophia i have a thousand things to tell you would to heaven you were with me at this moment not only to hear them but to advise me never in my life did i stand more in need of an able counselor i am perplexed distressed and tormented with a thousand fears  my aunt  what shall i say of her i believe she means well nay i cannot possibly doubt it yet yet my dear sophia i tremble at the very thoughts of a proposal which she nevertheless consented to with joy  ah if i should be prevailed upon what will my dear father say how shall i ever after such a step so derogatory to female delicacy have courage to look him or the world in the face i cannot cannot bring myself to follow her advice indeed i dare not do it  yet sophia let me blushing confess my folly my weak heart would tempt me to gratify her wishes were i to listen to its dictates but take the particulars and then tell me what you my dear girl would do were you in my situation  i told you in my last lord sommerville had given me reason to look upon him as a lover my aunt you may believe was highly delighted to find i had made a conquest so perfectly consonant to her ambitious desire i verily believe she could hardly have been more so had she herself been the object of his regard  he called upon her yesterday i observed and embarrassment in his manner a something i had never seen before and could not now account for it struck me it fluttered me exceedingly i feared i knew not what my looks i found had betrayed my emotions for he took my hand and pressing it to his lips in the tenderest accents eagerly enquired if i was ill glad he had given me that pretense i said i had been teazed with a head ach all the morning  ah my beloved emily would to heaven your sommerville had no greater cause of complaint  what do you mean my lord now more alarmed than ever for heaven fake speak and tell me what occasions your distress he then took a seat between my aunt and me still holding my hand and thus addressed me that i love you my adorable emily i flatter myself you cannot doubt love you with a tenderness which no language can possibly describe that my whole happiness depends upon possessing the most invaluable of human hearts and this dear hand yet such is my unhappy situation that i fear to ask that blessing without which life will be no longer desirable  as you may imagine sophia i was much affected at this speech but remained silent  you cannot be surprised my lord said my aunt if i take the liberty of saying this discourse is rather extraordinary you could be no stranger to the circumstances you allude to when you first saw my niece was it then acting like a man of honor to attempt gaining her affections so circumstanced miss herbert is not in a line of life to be trifled with and   ah spare me my dear madam nor injure me so far as to believe me capable of it i know her inestimable worth i adore her i honor her she is and ever must be the sole mistress of my heart  i came now madam with full purpose to lay every sentiment of that heart before you and also my very embarrassed state if i durst hope when you are acquainted with it you would not withdraw from me the favorable opinions you at present honor me with i should look upon myself as the happiest of men  he then told us that his father had for several years before his death projected an alliance between him and a cousin of his own  sommerville was ever averse from the match but as she was then very young he continually flattered himself that time might produce some favorable alteration and that the affair might be dropped he went abroad on his travels his father died before his return and to his infinite surprise he found a clause in the will binding him either to marry the lady or give up half his estate and to add to the cruelty of his fate she was left free to reject him though he had not the same indulgence ah sophia too well they knew there was little danger of her taking advantage of that liberty the too amiable sommerville need never fear  or rather hope for a disappointment of that nature  this my dear friend is the substance of what he related  i thought it needless to be more minute as the subject is too painsul to dwell upon longer than was necessary to prepare you for what followed  this my dear sophia was a proposal for me to consent to a private marriage and to conceal it till we saw whether time would not effect a change in the ladys sentiments  ah never never my lord will i voluntarily consent to be yours at the expense of anothers happiness that other too the chosen of your family this considetation independent of a thousannd others must determine me to reject your lordships proposal  is the happiness of your adoring sommerville then so very indifferent to you my lovely emily that you should so cruelly sacrifice it for that of a person who is an absolute stranger to you for pitys sake reslect a moment you certainly have it in your power to render me the most miserable of men but by so doing believe me you cannot promote her felicity supposing it depended on my giving her my hand which i am by no means persuaded is the case since i here solemnly swear no woman except your dear self shall ever possess it  no miss herbert no if you inflexibly persist in sentiments so injurious to my peace to no other shall it ever be offered then turning to my aunt ah madam dare i presume to flatter myself i shall find an advocate in you to plead my cause with your charming niece he took her hand and putting one knee to the ground continued let me implore you my generous friend to use your influence in my favor  i know it is great  i know my emily pays the highest deference to your judgment on whose indeed can she with greater security rely speak then for heavens sake say   my lord interrupting him i am extremely concerned to learn you are so unfortunately circumstanced i feel for your embarrassed situation but still more for that of my niece and wish it were in my power to extricate you both from your present difficulties but how this can be effected without doing violence to that rule of conduct i have ever made it a point to be governed by i really am at a loss to determine  i certainly cannot thoroughly approve the plan your lordship is desirous of pursuing yet i may perhaps on reflection find it attended with less impropriety than it appears to be on a first view allow me then some time to take the affair into serious consideration and believe it will give me most sensible pleasure should i after that without fear of incurring the censure of the world be able to give your lordship such an answer as you wish  how shall i said he pressing her hand to his lips with servour find words to express a thousandth part of the gratitude with which my heart is replete for this condescending goodness you do not then bid me despair  ah my dear madam believe me it shall be the future study of my life to make you sensible this generosity isnot thrown away on an ingrate  my emily again placing himself by me why those averted eyes why those cold those killing glances surely the prospect of felicity your sommerville looks forward to with such unspeakable rapture cannot   my lord interrupting him in myturn though i am extremely sensible of my aunts kindness i must take the liberty to observe i think she will on mature reflection see so many obstacles so much glaring impropriety in what you propose that her answer cannot possibly confirm those hopes you indulge on such a slight foundation  if my looks express less pleasure than your lordship expects believe me it is because i see more clearly than you will suffer yourself to do that every hope of the nature you mention must be fruitless  i have a father my lord who is entitled to every mark of respect and obedience as far as i can pay it without rendering myself absolutely wretched and to that i would gladly believe he will never compel me that duty teaches me i ought not to engage in an affair of such infinite importance without his knowledge and approbation  emily cried my aunt though i must approve the sentiments you have expressed yet in your situation i will take upon me to say i think they may without a breach of duty be dispensed with the persecution you have already suffered too clearly convinces me you have little reason to expect that indulgence you talk of were your father suffered indeed to act according to his own ideas of rectitude perhaps you might avoid the horrid fate which now awaits you but too well do you know this is not the case he has delegated his authority to one who is not disposed to make a very generous use of it from her you also know you have nothing to expect but tyranny as she has a soul destitute of every sentiment of humanity  ah spare me my dear madam i am too sensible my happiness or misery are alike indifferent to her  i could not refrain from tears sophia the subject she had started quite overpowered me  they fell in abundance on sommervilles hand in which mine was tenderly pressed  he was affected beyond expression  i begged they would permit me to retire to which my aunt readily assented but his lordship said all the most fervent passion could dictate to sooth and prevail upon me to stay  i left them however and by what she told me when we met again after he had taken his leave i found he had nearly gained his point with her some scruples she confessed still remained yet they were overbalanced by the pleasure she felt at the thoughts of my being placed in so distinguished a rank in life  this circumstance she endeavored to paint in the most seducing colors such a triumph too over my stepmother and her illiterate nephew i own to you emily my dear these are motives which have great weight with me said she and i think you too cannot be so insensible but that you must feel satisfaction in having so glorious an opportunity to mortify one who has given you so much uneasiness and who you have abundant reason to know will stick at nothing to accomplish the scheme she has set her heart upon  i certainly wish my love his lordships affairs had been in such a situation as would have enabled him to marry you publicly then would my utmost ambition have been amply gratified but since they are not i advise you by all means to accept him on his own terms the restraint he now lies under cannot in the nature of things be of long duration we cannot suppose the lady will live single merely with a view to dispossess him of a fortune she is in no want of depend upon it when she finds there are no hopes of gaining his lordships affection she will look out for a more discerning lover and you will then be introduced into the world in so flattering a style that your father will not only pardon the part i have acted but thank me for it most sincerely  you see emily my lord is so generous as never even to enquire what fortune he may expect with you this is a noble proof of his love nor shall he lose by his disinterestedness that shall be my care granting your father were inclined to take a mean avantage of it which i cannot however believe he would even think of  i will not hurry you my dear take a reasonable time for reflection on what is past of his lordships passion you can have no doubt consult then your own heart and if you find in it those sentiments which you ought to feel for the man to whom you mean to give your hand tell me freely and i will be answerable for all the consequences which may follow the step i advise you to take  had he made such a proposal indeed without consulting me i should have had an ill opinion of him and you my dear emily would have been unpardonable had you been prevailed upon to consent to it but he has proved himself a man of honor he has acted nobly generously and with an openness and sincerity for which he deserves a proper return from us  what could i answer to all this sophia alas it coincided but too much with my own wishes to offer those objections i could and ought to have made i was silent only promising a retrospection on it as she desired  i have obeyed her most faithfully as you may well believe for it is never one moment out of my thoughts yet have i not courage to give the answer for which i am so earnestly importuned soon however i must determine how that will be my next will probably inform you till then my dear friend adieu  your ever affectionate emily herbert  letter xvi lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanleyplace prepare to be astonished caroline and if possible as enraged as i am at this moment would you believe it  ah would to heaven there remained a single doubt of the horrid truth he has absolutely proposed mar age to her  i have it from such authority as admits of none  no matter how i came by my intelligence i have more ways than one of diving to the bottom of all their secrets for this affair they are stupid enough to imagine is a profoumd one and to remain so for a certain time for reasons which i confess i am at a loss to guess at but i will do more caroline than keep their abominable secret  i will prevent their putting it in practice  yes however certain she may at this moment think herself however she may now triumph it shall be of short duration if my wits do not fail me i have a plot in hand which i believe cannot fail to blow all her ridiculous impertinent hopes far from her and i think a day will come when the perfidious the designing sommerville will bless me for my friendly interposition in saving him from so preposterous a piece of folly  but whether or not my trouble will be amply repaid by the gratification of my revenge  do you not honor me caroline for my astonishing command of temper it is true i have a set of simple souls to deal with this indeed makes my merit the less yet some contrivance it has cost me and a sew falsehoods but that is a trifle  my mind is not thank my stars formed on a narrow contracted scale it is free and unfettered by vulgar prejudices and of course perfectly fitted to the work i have in hand  ah how i shall enjoy their mutual disappointment nay i already anticipate the pleasure i shall experience  poor ignorant conceited creature to fancy nature ever intended her to figure as lady sommerville the very idea drives me to madness and the old doting fool of an aunt too  caroline it will be a scene delightful beyound all possible expression thus to blast all their hopes at the very moment they look upon them as certain  i told you formerly of a fellow her father meant her to marry  my business of late has been to learn every particular relating to that affair his character his disposition place of residence etc etc  all this i am now mistress of and to my infinite satisfaction find him exactly the kind of being i wanted to complete my revenge  rich low born  of course purseproud and overbearing  envying those who have a family name to boast of yet affecting to despise them for setting any value on what he calls the most absurd of all imaginary advantages selfwilled obstinate as a mule and to crown all dying for the creature who has presumed to  caroline i could execrate her very name  this animal then is destined to be the hero of my tale and in return for the service i expect him to do me is to be put in possession of his dulcinea  now read the enclosed copy of an epistle i have just dispatched to him then tell me whether you think it can fail to produce those glorious effects i expect from it  to john morton esquire though personally a stranger to mr morton i am well acquainted with his character and distinguished situation in life such is the high opinion i entertain of the former that i cannot without pain see him on the point of being basely robbed of the woman whom he honors with his tenderest affection the woman whose hand he has been promised by those who alone have a right to bestow it on him  the disappointment of those hopes you have formed is nevertheless preparing for you by the only person i presume who can be an enemy to so amiable a man as mr morton this you will readily guess can be no other than mrs grenville aunt to the lovely miss herbert who if left to follow the dictates of her own inclination i well know would prefer you to the man this truly ridiculous woman has made choice of for her  he has a title it is true this is his only recommendation surely a very poor one to a mind of liberal sentiments but of those mrs grenville is wholly destitute you cannot be ignorant of her character  it is a compound of pride and meanness i tremble for the fate of my lovely friend  she trembles for herself as she sees no possible means to escape the threatened danger her aunt has contrived to get her into her possession and we now find it was wholly with a view to put her into that of this insignificant lord  as she is denied the liberty of writing to her friends on this subject for she sells me her aunt will not suffer any letter to go without first inspecting its contents she is in absolute despair  this sir inspired me with the idea of informing you of her danger who are so deeply interested in it and can alone relieve her i consefs i am at a loss to say how this must or can be done one and one way only appears to me practicable and though a method i should highly disapprove in any other case i will yet venture to propose  taking it for granted sir you will rather than see the woman so justly dear to you given to another endeavor to frustrate such a malicious intention by any means however desperate my plan is this if you will so disguise yourself as to prevent all possible suspicion and as soon as possible come to me having a carriage ready and also a proper place where to convey the dear girl i will undertake to have her at my house at the time appointed from whence you may without hazard carry her off  you will by the step i have taken judge how deeply i am interested in the happiness of my amiable and truly distressed friend miserable she must be if her vile ambitious aunt succeeds in her present views since she abhors the man by her defrined to possess her with you who i am well assured know her inestimable worth and who adore her she cannot fail to enjoy that felicity she so justly deserves  this is the only adveie i have it in my power to offer and i flatter myself it will meet your approbation both for the gentle emilys sake and your own  it hurts my feelings to think a man of your character and fortune should be injured in so tender a point and that an insignificant boy merely because he has a title should thus triumph over you i think by what i know of mr mortons spirit he will not tamely put up with such an indignity  let me know what my poor friend has to expect as soon as possible since there is not a moment to lose if you wish to save her from inevitable misery or to possess the object of your affection   i am sir etc etc   there caroline what think you of my eloquence can it fail of success  impossible i think i have thrown in a convenient dose of flattery it will work like a charm i will lay my life  farewell i every moment expect the fellows answer and then should he agree to my scheme i must contrive to get the girl here this indeed will be no hard matter as her aunt is never better pleased than when i honor her with any degree of attention  i must ask you once more have i not a wonderful command over my passions am i not a finished hypocrite when it is necessary to assume that character  they are firmly persuaded my attachment to sommerville was merely friendship and he though he knows we transgressed the bounds of that frigid sentiment yet as firmly believes i never had any regard for him a circumstance not a little mortifying to his vanity what else can he think on finding i gave him up to another with so much cool indifference  oh it was a glorious thought and will i trust be productive of most joyous mischief  adieu arabella stanley  letter xvii lord sommerville to charles dalion esquire colchester prepare your congratulations charles  the adorable emily will soon be mine  mine by every tender every solemn tie what a miracle has her numberless perfections wrought on the once volatile mind of your friend sommerville he now talks of matrimony with as grave a countenance as if he were an old practitioner in the business  yes charles nothing is now wanting but the nuptial benediction to complete my wonderful transformation my mind is made up there was no getting my beloved on any other terms and to give her up was death and after all what does it signify one must marry some time or other why then delay it  have i then you will ask settled matters amicably with my cousin  dont mistake me  she is to know nothing of the matter nor any body else except your worship and the parties concerned that is to say my charmer her aunt to whom by the by i owe my success and your humble servant without that kind ladys interposition i am sensible i never should have prevailed on the engaging emily but through her sagacious arguments though mine could not get the better of her delicate scruples she has consented to keep our union a secret for some time persuaded no less than myself that lady mary cravens patience will not hold out much longer  and if the worst happens namely that she should discover it she can but claim her legacy  a devlish slice it will cut off my estate charles that is certain but there is no help i would rather submit to carry a musket than be tied to her for life  this however she cannot claim till i have in plain terms refused her or am married to another  now she has not yet you see asked me the question and if she waits till i ask her our affairs are likely to remain in statu quo  to prevent all possible suspicion my beloved is to continue with her aunt till such time as i can publicly acknowledge her  and should her father make any disturbance and insist on her returning home mrs grenville has taken upon herself to make that matter easy by acquainting him with the whole truth not doubting but he will be mighty well pleased to find she has dispofed of her in a manner so much more eligible in every respect than he intended to do himself since it was merely for the sake of a quiet life he ever consented to a match he by no means approved  see what it is charles to have a shrew of a wife  but a wife like the gentle emily  aye that is quite another affair and three days hence your friend will have that blessing to boast of  yet no boasting i forgot that  well a time will shortly come i hope when i may proclaim to all the world my unbounded happiness  my widow and i are on the best terms imaginable she even condescends to talk to me of my charmer asks how long this passion is to last says i am an inconstant wretch but too much like herself in that particular to excite either her wonder or indignation  i have some reason to believe she has found means to console herself for my infidelity as our major now does the honors of her house she is blessed with a most capacious heart  ah little does she dream i am on the point of giving mine away in earnest  three tedious days over charles and i shall be able to subscribe myself your supremely happy  sommerville  letter xviii lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanleyplace give me joy caroline all is over and i am beyond expression delighted with my handiwork  no positively there never was my equal nor a set of stupid mortals so completely outwitted i could expire with laughing when i figure to myself their consternation  if you do not see it in the same ridiculous light it appears to me in i would not give a straw for your feelings  my doughty hero swallowed the bait i threw out with the avidity of a gudgeon  his answer was exactly what i wished  he expressed some doubts however in regard to the damsels being prejudiced in his favor and well he might for she detested his very name and had ever used him accordingly  so much the better i trust he will now repay her in kind  but though he had doubts of the sincerity of her passion of his own he had none for he swore most manfully he would carry her off at the hazard both of soul and body rather than forego his hopes  bravo cried i as i perused his scrawl this is the very man i want it would be surprising with such noble spirits as we are possessed of we should not play the deuce before it is long  the happy pair were to have been fettered as last tuesday  every thing was finally settled miss was to remain as a miss with her plotting aunt  so happy so elate i will warrant ye with their imagined dignity  o dear o dear  well child i had called ore frequently on them than usual for some time past  my ladyship always did them honor the evening before the day of days my said ladyship was seized with a violent headache a card was dispatched entreating the favor of miss herberts company for an hour to accompany me in a walk as i thought the air might possibly remove it  no refusing her ladyships request  she came  away we strolled  but alas alas had not proceeded a quanter of a mile before we were terrified by the approach of four ill looking fellows making directly toward us  i screamed calling on all the gods and goddesses for protection she more courageous begged me not to be alarmed they could not mean us any injury  a moment served to undeceive her for before you could count twenty madam was wiskd up by one of them carried to the carriage prepared for her reception and away it flew like lightening  i now made the best of my way home my heart as light as a feather but my outward appearance in a state of distraction  fit succeeded fit my servants frightened out of their senses begging to know what had reduced me to such a deplorable condition it was an hour before i was sufficiently recovered to gratify their curiosity at length i accomplished it and amazement followed of course  to keep up the farce i was put to bed extremely ill  had not courage enough to inform mrs grenville of the disaster  no hurry for that you know  at length comes her carriage to convey miss herbert home what was now to be done why my woman was compelled to be the relater of the melancholy story i ordered her to go in it and to give the best account of the matter she could and above all to describe the lamentable state in which she had left me by way of apology for not waiting on her myself all this she would do perfectly well as she had not an idea that the whole was a concerted plot  it was now the old souls turn to be distracted in earnest never was such a scene of confusion as wilson was witness to and to crown the whole in the midst of her despair and before my abigail had quite finished the task imposed upon her in comes sommerville  ah what would i not have given to have seen his frantic behavior i envied her and sincerely wished i could myself with propriety have related to them the delightful particulars but that was impossible he raved he stormed he cursed and as in duty bound vowed he would never rest till he had discovered the villain who had robbed him of his hearts dearest treasure these were his lordships very words said wilson while giving me an account of what passed  why to be sure my lady he must have quite doated upon her as one may say and to be sure she was a mightly pretty creature but yet to take on so for one who was only an acquaintance like amazed me for had she been his own wife i verily thinks he could not have been in a greater taking  no nor perhaps half so great few men look upon the loss of a wife as any violent affliction  fearing to betray my real feelings i dismissed my maid when in a few minutes after comes mrs grenville begging for heavens sake i would allow her the honor of a moments conversation that she might learn the distracting particulars from my own lips this i could not decently refuse so up she came to my bedchamber  oh lady stanley i am the most wretched of women my poor dear child what must she now suffer to be thus torn from her friends thus exposed to a thousand insults alas i cannot support this dreadful shock  and still more dreadful disappointment of all my high raised hopes she would have said i presume caroline had she been honest enough to speak her mind freely  i pity you from my soul my dear madam if i feel this horrid affair thus sensibly what must you do who are so nearly connected with the amiable girl have you no idea who it can be that has dared to commit this horrid outrage  none in the world i can form no conjecture and it is that distresses me i came now principally to ask if your ladyship can give me any intelligence of the road they took or any particular description of the villains that i may as soon as possible send in pursuit of them lord sommerville who has shown us a thousand civilities has kindly offered me his services on this melancholy occasion  pray caroline observe the cool manner in which the old hypocrite mentioned his civilities  i am persuaded my dear madam he will do it with pleasure he is really a very worthy young man and always professed the highest esteem for my amiable friend miss herbert  i then in few words gave her the best account i could of what she wished to know that is to say misled her as far as possible and wishing her success in the important search she took her leave after having in the warmest manner acknowledged her gratitude for the kind concern i had expressed on the occasion  from that moment caroline the whole neighborhood have been in the finest confusion imaginable one friend galloping here another there some running this way some that but first on the list stands the gallant woe begone despairing sommerville  what are all their feelings when compated to his  aye child what indeed had i been kind enough to have waited till the honey moon was fairly over he might perchance have got the better of his affliction  but to dash the cup of happiness from his lip in such a manner o fie fie lady stanley it was really a wicked trick and what if known they would certainly never forgive  then such a virtuous love too none of your modish intrigues none of your modern fashionable matches where neither party care a fig for the other  in that case it might have been borne with christian patience  but here was nothing but downright love a passion pure and unsullied and who knows whether the poor dear creature will ever find himself in so pious a frame of mind again as long as he lives  there caroline i think i have given you a treat sure i am if you enjoy it as truly as i do you are not a little obliged to me i have got pretty well over the horrid shook and am now able to see my friends again of course i hear the story told a thousand different ways and am compelled to repeat all i know of it as often it will afford conversation for ages  adieu  yours ever arabella stanley  letter xix lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire colchester keep your congratulations charles for some happier fellow i am at this moment completely wretched  never was there so unaccountable so cursed an affair  i have almost turned my brain by fruitless conjectures my mind is in a state of absolute distraction my body sinking under the fatigue i have suffered  faith i almost blush to explain myself more clearly i feel myself humbled so confoundedly  ah could i but learn by whom i would take ample vengeance for the injury the indignity i have  but no more threats till fortune puts it in my power to realize them then charles call me a paltroon if i am worse than my word  know then that the very day preceding that on which my angel emily had promised to make me the happiest of men while she was taking the air with lady stanley she was seized by three or four villains and carried off  this charles is the horrible story in few words where or by whom the lord only knows for not the least information have i yet been able to gain though i have made it my whole business as you may well believe from the cursed moment i have not had an hours rest since the affair happened on horseback for ever enquiring at every stage every inn of every soul i meet yet how describe what i am in quest of  one carriage so like another and hundreds passing in all directions  i am frequently taken for a lunatic nor are they far mistaken  oh charles can you form an idea of a more distressing more mortifying situation on the very eve of enjoying the highest possible happiness  my emily all engaging modest tenderness  by heaven it is too much  it unmans me quite but for the rage which animates me and the glorious hopes that i shall yet be able to discover the wretch who has thus blasted all my prospects of felicity i should sink under my affliction  at some moments i have been tempted to suspect lady stanley i know she has a soul capable of any thing however inhuman  i know it well  yet i believe i should injure her she was confined for some days by the shock she received spoke of it with unfeigned concern to mrs grenville and was apparently little less afflicted than herself  i know not what to think i am perplexed bewildered in a variety of fruitless conjectures perhaps her father  yet that is ridiculous why have recourse to stratagem when he might have ordered her home whenever he pleased and as for the fellow to whom he had promised her he for that very reason could have no inducement to play the knight errant he was favored by her friends nay looked upon her as his own  yet charles it occurs to me at this instant he might possibly though i cannot well conceive how have heard she meant to disappoint him in that case who can say what a brutal passion like his might tempt him to  for brutal i may well call it since he knew he was her aversion  by heavens this is the only idea that has yet struck me with any appearance of probability  but then again why this force why not prevail on her father to send for her home and according to his promise give her to him  would not this have been a more natural plan no doubt of it  in short as i said i am in a labyrinth and absolutely unable to determine which way to bend my course next i write this while my horses are resting for my own part i can take none  they are ready  farewell  sommerville  letter xx lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanleyplace sommerville has commenced quixotte and is galloping all over the country in quest of his dulcinea the grenvilles and herberts all out on the same wild goose chase  air and exercise will do the good sculs a world of service in the mean time my hero is quietly enjoying the fruit of his labor  yet not very quietly neither for i find miss is rather resractory and by what he says i begin to suspect he wishes he were fairly quit of her or that he had got possession of his prize by more justifiable means  the fellows a fool and of course has not a spirit equal to the task i have assigned him but that is his affar i have brought him into the scrape it is his business to get out of it the best way he can  you must know he has wrote to me begging my further advice how to proceed i have not yet nor am i clear that i ever shall take the trouble to give it certainly not unless i find on reflection i can strike out any thing new or likely to afford me a little more diversion he describes her terrors on finding herself thus kidnapped in a style that plainly says he is not a little terrified himself for what may be the consequences of his valourous achievement to say truth they may be rather serious but this he ought to have foreseen  he says in his vile scrawl for the wretch can hardly write legibly that he had at first intended carrying her home to her fathers  but on finding she freely declared no power on earth should ever compel her to give him her hand that she abhorred him that death in any shape would be infinitely preferable to her than being united to a villain who had dared to insult her in the manner he had done he was so highly provoked and at the same time fearing her father on finding her so resolutely determined against him might retract his promise that he in an evilhour resolved to convey her to a house of his own and there to treat her with less ceremony than he had hitherto done in revenge for the contempt with which she had treated him  he at once put his plan in execution so that he had her now entirely in his power but with the violence of her agitations she had thrown herself into a sever was at the moment he wrote delirious and by the doctors pronounced in the utmost danger  after the fatal step i have taken adds he it is not in the nature of things i can inform her family of what has happened this would be setting myself in no very favorable light and all my hopes must then be at an end since it is impossible they can pardon this outrage gladly would i marry her even now though convinced her heart is in the possession of another could i thereby get honorably out of this confounded trouble should she die and if i may believe the physicians her recovery is very doubtful i shall have reason to curse the day i ever set eyes on her he then caroline implores me to write instantly and tell him what i would advise him to do were i to give him any advice it should be to hang himself at once both for his own sake and mine  the fellows an errant coward it is evident and of course may be tempted by his fears to impeach yet as i am not let him do his worst with all my soul the letter i wrote on the subject is all he has to produce against me and it is wrote in so friendly a style so consonant to the wishes of all her family except the old aunt that i think it will acquit me of any evil intention did i care any thing about it but the truth is i do not  what are the animals to me if the girl will be such a simpleton as to fret herself to death who can help it  had she not robbed me of the only man who ever had power to gain my affections she might for ought i cared have flirted on to the end of the chapter with every other she could find foolish enough to think it worth their while but to rival me there to rob me by her  heaven knows what caroline  of a sommerville  it was not to be borne  ah death is too gentle a punishment let her die then and let the fellow make the best of the story he can  the silly whim over sommerville may again be mine heavens the very hope of such an event gives me new life nor is it in any degree improbable a short time must convince him of the difference between an ignorant country girl and a woman of the world who knows how to set a proper value on his merit and accomplishments  it was a whim caroline a mere whim of the moment i have not a doubt he will soon conquer it and return to me a true penitent i will not humble myself so far as to make a comparison between her personal attractions and mine and as to her understanding it would be still more ridiculous  farewell  arabella stanley  letter xxi same to the same stanleyplace the wandering knight caroline is returned  but what a change he is absolutely worn to a shadow looks like the ghost of his former bewitching self and appears in the deepest despair  i have only seen him en passant think of that  not once called upon me though i condescended to write him a note to enquire after his health a cool card with compliments was all the return i got  i was weak enough to write a second time and i fear with a degree of tenderness for which i now detest myself this produced no better effect  polite but freezingly cold farewell all hope then farewell love and welcome hatred  yes caroline i think i now hate him hate him most heartily sure he might have continued to me his friendship common civility at least  to this i was certainly entitled  but be it so  since then he will not help to fill up my time in the manner i wish i must even find a way to do it without his assistance i will not be so ungrateful to him i will find employment for him before i sleep yes i will rouse him from this lethargy of woe if nothing but his beloved emily will serve his turn he shall have her but on such terms as i trust he will have reason to think a dear bargain  that is to say if she has not by this time given us both the slip by a journey to the other world for i have heard nothing of the matter since my last he arrived here a day or two after and the dear hopes of again having him all to myself put her and her whole tribe out of my head  it is too sure caroline that he loves her  i can no longer doubt it could i ever do so you will ask since he was actually on the point of giving so incontestable a proof of it by marrying her  i believed indeed he had a passion for her which as he could not contrive to gratify on any other terms he in a fit of desperation had agreed to it but that it was by no means so rooted in his breast as to produce the effect i am now a witness to  i was persuaded a few weeks would have restored him to reason and to me i have for once been deceived  he too shall be deceived in his turn  i will wring his heart since i find her detested image is so deeply imprinted there  how this is to be done you shall know in my next  so till then adieu  arabella stanley  letter xxii same to the same stanleyplace read the enclosed copy of an epistle i have fabricated caroline and which the despairing lover will receive by this time tomorrow  if i am not mistaken he will once more take horse but in what temper of mind i will leave you to guess it will at least free me from the mortification of seeing him here and that of having others witness to the indifference with which he nows treats me  my lord  in pity to an amiable young creature in whose happiness i know your lordship is greatly interested i take up my pen and trust my motive will plead my excuse  i have been an unwilling spectator to a scene of such complete villainy that my heart bleeds when i think of it  i blush to say i am housekeeper to the wretch of whose unexampled treachery i am now going to give an account  your lordship must have heard miss herbert speak of mr morton  he is the man who has by an unheard of piece of cruelty for ever destroyed her peace and of course lord sommervilles for i am not to learn the happy event which was to have taken place had he not basely robbed you of her  she has by the injurious treatment she has received been reduced to the point of death and no wonder since loss of honor to a mind pure as hers was i doubt not infinitely more dreadful  though now in this humble station i have seen better days my lord  i felt for  i pitied her distress and only regret it was not in my power to save her from ruin  alas it was not  she was too narrowly watched by the monster who has undone her  but finding to what a condition his brutality had reduced her he was compelled to put her under my care  i have the satisfaction to inform your lordship that care has not been in vain she is at length out of danger and i hope will shortly be able to leave this detested house could i contrive to find any way for her to escape  i offered to write to her parents  ah never she cried never can i see them more no  get me but out of this wretchs power and i will in some obscure corner hide my miserable head and trust death will soon in tender compassion to my unspeakable misery put an end to my days  i would also have offered to write to you my lord but judged she would be still if possible more averse from that i have ventured therefore to do it without her knowledge not doubting but you will find means to deliver her and to punish the wretch who has thus destroyed the happy prospect which awaited you  till then which i hope will not be long depend upon my utmost care and attention and believe me your lordships  most obedient etc  what do you think of madam housekeeper caroline  dont you think her letter will produce some rather unpleasant feelings in the gentle bosom of our despairing swain i flatter myself the account she has given him will on this occasion at least put his matrimonial whim out of his head and may be the means of his getting himself run through the body into the bargain for a tilting bout there must be or the deuce is in it should he come off conqueror my honest friend the nabob must even submit to the operation himself  no great matter which and as to the damsel we must leave her future fate to chance i think it does not promise to be any longer enviable  i have contrived to send the fine epistle to him by such a conveyance as shall leave him no possible doubt of its authenticity and expect to see him gallop off full speed as soon as he has properly digested its contents  dearly do i love a little innocent mischief  and this is perfectly so you will allow  i am now all impatience for the issue of this manauvre as it cannot i think fail to produce the best possible effects i have a presentiment that the poor devil of a nabob will come off with the worst for that he is an errant coward as i said before his style plainly evinces yet coward as he is i believe in my conscience the fellow would gladly compound for a slight scratch to be fairly quit of his refractory charge  adieu caroline  yours sincerely arabella stanley  letter xxiii lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire london i have been engaged in a most wonderful piece of business since my last charles which has produced a total revolution in my sober matrimonial scheme as you will readily conceive when informed of the infernal particulars  no fault of mine you must allow if i am compelled to take to my old courses again i was on the point of reformation but fate forbids and to that i must submit  after having made every possible enquiry after my adorable emily to no purpose i returned in a truly disconsolate condition to my regiment lady stanley on my arrival sent to enquire for me wondering i presume i had not called upon her i was in no humor for it and sent a very cool answer this produced a second note but wrote in a style which very clearly convinced me she not only wished for my company but hoped i would put it in her power to console me for the loss of my beloved  i have no longer a doubt that the airs of indifference she had thought proper to assume on finding my attachment for herself at an end were put on merely to conceal her mortification it must be owned it was of very short duration but all her condescension was thrown away upon me i could not for the soul of me in the humor i was take the trouble to visit her  what change time might have effected i know not but a letter i got of which i enclose you a copy put her as much out of my head as if no such person had ever existed  i will now charles suppose you have read it  judge then of my feelings on finding the horrid intelligence it brought me  till then i had never been wholly without my suspicions of the widow but at length compelled to acquit her as she knew nothing of the scoundrel who has been the author of all this misery he is now however smarting for his temerity and will not a second time i fancy be easily tempted to play the hero in such an adventure i think i have made him pay pretty handsomely for his frolic by heavens when i think of the sufferings of the gentle emily that dear object of my tenderest my everlasting affection i am almost distracted and could inflict a thousand deaths instead of one on the vile wretch who has so cruelly betrayed the innocence he ought to have protected but no more of this i will if possible proceed in my narrative  i instantly sat off attended by a couple of servants on whose courage and fidelity i could depend determined to rescue my dear girl from the power of the monster who had thus undone us both and severely punish him for his infamous conduct  i left my carriage at a little distance and mounting one of my servants horses bidding the other follow me rode up to the house  a fellow was standing at the gate  i demanded if his master was at home to which he replied in the affirmative then asked who he should announce  no matter show me in directly he led the way into a parlour and then went to inform his master who in a few minutes made his appearance  whether he guessed my business i know not as he was a stranger to my person but i did not leave him long at a loss  i had my pistols ready which he no sooner cast his eyes upon than a guilty conscience informed him at once of my purpose and like a coward as he is he made an effort to escape  this i prevented by setting my back against he door he now began to bluster and asked what i meant by daring to insult him in his own house   i mean to punish a most consummate villain and you are the man if not a coward as well as a villain take your choice of these pistols and be thankful i give you so honorable a chance for preserving your worthless existence  still affecting to look bold though he trembled in every joint and pray who are you that thus presumes to put my life in danger  oh no matter who and as to the why you can be at no loss to guess  he still drew back refusing to accept my offer finding however nothing less would do he at last took one and scarce giving me time to lay hold of the other fired and missed me i now fired in my turn and had the consolation to lodge the ball in his body  the report alarmed the family and a number of servants assembled take care of your master said i then seizing one of them by the arm i ordered him to show me instantly to the apartment of the lady who was by violence detained there unless he wished i should treat him as i had done his scoundrel of a master  the choice i had given him was easily decided and he immediately cried out this way please your honor  but now charles all language must fail me  my emily no doubt terrified by the confusion she had heard lay lifeless on the floor without a soul to afford her any assistance  i rung the bell in an agony it is impossible to give you an idea of  i believed her gone for ever as not a symptom of life appeared a woman came in terror and amazement depicted in her countenance  i ordered her to call for help and to procure whatever she judged most likely to restore my angel i had before i went up stairs dispatched my servant to bring my carriage to the door it arrived in a few minutes but all our efforts were ineffectual she showed no signs of life i then judged the air might be of more service to her than all their drops etc etc in case she was not absolutely past recovery  lifting the dear girl therefore in my arms and leaning her pale though still infinitely lovely face on my bosom i carried her gently to the chaise and putting her in took my seat by her and bidding the postillion drive slowly on left the cursed crew in a state of astonishment at what had passed which there is no describing they stood gaping with open mouths and every mark of stupid amazement not one of them having had courage to offer any resistance to my undertaking  indeed the whole took up so short a space of time that they had not got over their surprise nor had they recovered the use of the little sense nature had given them when i left them  i now endeavored by a thousand tender caresses to restore my beloved and to my unutterable joy at length perceived she began to open her languid eyes  oh charles guess if you can what was my rapture at that blessed moment  my emily my angel cried i in an ecstacy look up my best beloved banish all your fears and behold your sommerville whose whole happiness depends upon your recovery she now sighed deeply and a few tears fell from her eyes on my bosom which supported her my hopes began to revive this i thought a favorable symptom and i was not deceived  alas where am i said she at last but in so faint a voice i could scarcely distinguish her words  oh save me save me from him and she burst into a flood of tears  i gently pressed her to my throbbing heart  be comforted my emily you are no longer in the power of the wretch whose presence you so justly dread it is your sommerville it is the most tender of lovers who implores who entreats you to calm your agitation  sommerville exclaimed she  sommerville  good heavens am i awake may i believe my senses and again her dear head which she had made an effort to raise sunk on my breast  it is it is your sommerville my best beloved who has been the happy means of delivering you from the power of a villain and who now with transport folds you to his bosom  ah my lord turning her mild dovelike eyes upon me how shall i be able to express my gratitude  heaven has at length then heard my prayers and sure was doubly kind in sending you to my relief alas my lord you know not the terrors i have endured  ah charles too well i knew them for my peace  think no more of it my angel endeavor to forget the past and look only forward to scenes of happiness for happy you shall be if it is in the power of the most faithful the most ardent of lovers to make you so  oh my lord i have a thousand things to tell you a thousand questions to ask but am still so weak so very faint that i have not power to utter them  of this however be assured my heart is perfectly grateful for the important service you have so generously so nobly conferred upon me my family too will join their thanks to mine for so infinite an obligation ah they will now be convinced the man they so highly favored was a despicable wretch he has given but too fatal proofs of it  my poor dear aunt too  i dread to ask my lord what effect the shock had upon her but i shall soon i hope have the happiness of seeing her of removing all her apprehensions this delightful thought has given me new life i am better my lord much better pray order the servant to drive on as fast as possible indeed i can bear it now gracious heaven how will her kind heart rejoice to have me thus restored to her at the moment perhaps when she wholly despaired of it  if i now charles feared her impatience and violent emotions of joy might be too much for her still weak spirits how then have courage to tell her i had no design to put her again under her aunts protection  a thought however instantly struck me  mrs grenville my dearest emily is no longer in the country business of importance obliged her to go to london soon after the shock you mention and a severe one it was you will have no objections then my love to join her there as it is a shorter journey than going to your fathers seat indeed i ventured to resolve on this plan before you were in a condition to give me your opinion of it judging it would be more agreeable to you we are now on our way thither and shall with ease reach town early tomorrow  gone to london said you my lord this surprises me are you perfectly sure of it with some emotion  perfectly my dear and it was on that account as i observed before i took this road  certainly my lord if that is the case i prefer it greatly i wish not to see my father unless accompanied by her i have not indeed courage for it  yet alas how am i to blame for what has happened  proceed then my lord since it must be so let us get on as fast as possible i am miserable beyond expression nor shall i know a moments peace till once more under her protection  is this kind my emily taking her hand is your sommerville then so perfectly indifferent to you that his presence gives you no degree of pleasure i flattered myself your tranquillity would have been wholly restored on finding yourself under that of the most tender the most faithful of lovers  ah my lord do me the justice to believe i am deeply sensible of the infinite obligations i am under to you i should be the most ungrateful of creatures were i not but can it surprise you that i should impatiently wish to relieve my friends from the distress this unfortunate affair must have involved them in surely it ought not complete then your kind intentions convey me as soon as possible to my aunt and depend upon it you shall have no cause to accuse me of indifference till then i can think of nothing but the joy i shall experience in removing all her trouble and anxious suspense which you are sensible must have been greater than i can express  i now ordered the carriage to drive on and in the mean time did all in my power to calm her perturbation and as she had not a doubt of my sincerity by the time we reached the inn at which we were to rest that night she was tolerably composed more so indeed charles every thing considered than i could possibly have expected  to say truth her behavior surprised me a good deal and i could only account for it by supposing she consoled herself with the idea that i was unacquainted with the whole adventure and that by marrying her immediately all would be set to rights this conjecture did not serve to raise her in my esteem in her situation it was certainly natural to form such a wish but it set her delicacy in no very favorable point of view  i expected to have found her overwhelmed with sorry covered with confusion  in short i conceived it utterly impossible the amiable the modest blushing emily could after what had passed so soon regain any degree of tranquillity i had figured her to myself a prey to despair and so far from desiring to meet the eyes of her family that she would rather have wished to bury herself for ever from the sight of any human being than appear before them  such was the notion charles i had foolishly formed of her sentiments her ideas of virtue  it is pretty plain i had overrated them or as i said before she put a constraint upon herself in order the better to deceive me  neither the one nor other of these opinions gave me much satisfaction  yet i adore her person however her mind may have suffered in my esteem  and i will freely confess i shall with less scruple endeavor to gratify my passion though compelled to do it by less honorable means than i formerly proposed after this proof of her artifice and duplicity no doubt were i in the same predicament i should act as she does  it is a wise though not a very generous plan  but it will not take charles  thank my kind stars i am a little too far in the secret  happy as i said before she shall be if the entire possession of my heart and fortune can make her so but my hand she must no longer expect twould be ridiculous  every idea of honor of delicacy revolts at it should the fellow live what an additional triumph would it be for him you see it is absolutely impossible to think of it however blameless she may strictly speaking be and i flatter myself she will on serious reflection be convinced her wisiest course will be to accept the only terms it is in my power to offer she can expect no other  that she should endeavor to gain the same as before is as i said natural enough or at least would be so to the generality of women but i own to you i believed till now she was superior to the rest of her sex and am hurt by finding it otherwise  yet every thing considered it is perhaps better as it is since being more on a level with them than i had ever imagined she will with less reluctance do as as others have done before her  how to inform her of the change in my sentiments i know not for after all there is an undescribable something in her looks her manner in every word she utters that commands a respect absolutely incompatible with the proposal i wish nay must make since my heart tells me she is as dear to me as ever and that my whole happiness depends upon her smiles  charles you can form no idea of her beauty her numberless attractions by heavens they are irresistible and would almost justify any folly a man could commit  but it must not be i trust the engaging lovely girl will see her situation in a proper light and grateful for the service i have rendered her and what i still mean to do will generously reward my attachment but a truce with reflections let me put an end to our journey to london  we arrived the following day she was a good deal startled on my proposing her going to my house but having assured her i knew not in what part of the town her aunt resided though it should be my first business to enquire was compelled to acquiesce being as ignorant of it as myself and having no other friend in this place  it was too late that evening to begin my search of course she was obliged to accept an apartment for the night not without the greatest reluctance but what else could she do  i took care that my behavior should be such as to banish every apprehension in case she had formed any it was tender and respectful i judged it time enough to let her guess my design when i had pretended to make the enquiries she was so anxious about  how she spent the night i know not but i charles never closed my eyes and was a thousand times tempted to put an end to her suspense at once  can you wonder at it  so wholly in my power  i did not however interrupt her repose  the next morning i sent up my compliments entreating she would indulge me with her company at breakfast her answer was she had slept but little begged i would excuse her and permit her to have a cup of tea in the dressing room adding she hoped i would not a moment delay the business i knew was so interesting to her  this message she sent by my housekeeper who delivered it very distinctly this i readily granted ordering her to pay the lady every possible mark of respect and attention but in case she should ask for writing materials to take care not letters were sent out of the house till i had seen them  this increased watsons curiosity which i saw by her looks was highly excited on our first arrival i did not however think proper to indulge it just then though i believe charles i might have trusted her as she knows me pretty well and has not hitherto presumed to see farther into these kind of affairs than i would have her she is persectly satisfied with her situation and justly concludes i have a right to render mine as agreeable by any means i please i am master and she has been accustomed to obey me as such  that point settled and some other orders given to frank on the same subject i sallied forth not with hopes of finding our good aunt but my good friend dalton i would rather have staid at home to reflect at leisure on the delightful business i had in hand but feared my adorable might discover it which would at once have alarmed her and perhaps crushed all my hopes at once it was time enough when compelled to inform her my search had been in vain  i went out accoringly meaning as i said to call on you to give you this account  i did so but to my no small disappointment found you had left town the very day before  i was cursedly vexed having a thousand things to communicate besides what i have now mentioned finding no better might be i marched up to your study and there wrote this enormous packet which you will get i suppose on tuesday  so farewell  i can tell you no more till i have again seen my beloved  i hope she will not refuse me her company at dinner  it is now near the hour  i tremble i was going to say only that it is rather too feminine a foible for a fellow of spirit at the scene i have to encounter when i acquaint my angel her aunt is not to he found  i wish it were fairly over with all my soul and that she may bear the disappointment with more fortitude than i dae at present expect  would she my dear charles but consent to bless me without driving me to extremity there would not exist a happier fellow than your  sommerville ps i shall when my affairs are a little better arranged make some enquiry concerning the rascal i left wounded should he be mortally so i may have more trouble on his account than he is worthy of yet the affair properly stated must i think assuredly acquit me  adieu    letter xxi lady stanley to mrs grosvonor stanley place i have just had a visit from mrs grenville  no suspicion you see caroline of the hand i have had in the plot  so much the better since by this means i shall hear without trouble how matters go on  she is just returned from her brothers where they have had so delightful a squabble on the subject of their fair heroine that she vows she will never enter his doors again while she has life  mr herbert and his rib blame her want of proper care and attention for all that has happened she lays the whole on them for encouraging the presumptuous hopes of a fellow who has proved by his villainy how little he deserved it for you may well believe they soon heard who the hero was who had been the author of all this consusion but are by no means certain who the person is to whom she is indebted for her deliverance though they suspect sommerville finding by the old womans blabbing for she could not keep her own secret the footing his lordship was upon nay she brags of it and says but for that audacious wretch emily would ere now have been in so elevated a style as to have looked down on them all with the contempt they deserve nor does she yet despair if their conjectures are well founded since she knows his lordship is a man of honor were she once convinced her poor child had sallen into his hands all her cares would be at an end  certainly there can be no doubt of it if as you say they were so soon to have been married of this circumstance caroline i pretended ignorance  but what surprises me is her not writing to insorm you of her present situation this is the only thing which on that surmise i cannot clearly account for unless by supposing they mean to give you an agreeable surprise  ah lady stanley it is certainly so how could i be so stupid as not to think of that before depend upon it it is as your ladyship guesses what else indeed could prevent her letting me hear from her heavens what a triumph shall i yet enjoy over her ridiculous family who have presumed to treat me with so much indignity my spirits revive i am quite delighted with your ladyships superior discernment but my ideas have for some time been in such a state of confusion and perplexity i could think of nothing  and pray maam may i ask what is become of that wretch morton i long to hear the particulars of my lovely friends deliverance  ah he met not with half the severity he deserves death would have been too mild a punishment for his infamous conduct he is however most desperately wounded and still lies in the utmost danger one of his men immediately after the affair happened set off to mr herberts in order to inform his aunt of the horrid transaction not by his vile masters commands he owned for he was in no condition to give any nor would he i presume have given those if he had since it is more natural to believe he would have withed the whole odious story buried in eternal oblivion since he made so despicable a figure in it but the fellow thought it his duty to do so whatever might be the consequence  if we may credit the account he gives my poor niece met with more respect during her confinment than she had any reason to expect from such a brute he assures us his master as far as he was able to judge appeared as much concerned for what he had done as she could be on finding it was all likely to be ineffectual since she repeatedly assured him no power on earth should ever compel her to give him her hand  she never lest her apartment except once for an hour at his earnest entreaty and he said they concluded it was only then with a view to prevail on him to restore her to her friends  but finding all her eloquence tears and threats lost upon his hardened heart she left him nor ever would a second time admit him to her presence she was then seized with a violent fit of illness and how it would have ended continued the old dowager had not heaven interposed in her favor it is not easy to guess  and pray maam in what light does he appear to mr and mrs herbert surely they cannot acquit him while they presume to blame you  o as for mr herbert it is long since he has given up all pretensions to judge for himself yet he does condemn him as far as he dare do it  but she vows he acted like a man of spirit the girl was his by the most solemn promise he had rescued her from those who were on the point of robbing him of her for ever he would have married her  what then had he done amiss all she regretted was that he had not been fortunate enough to revenge the intended injury as she most fervently wished he was dear to her and ever should be if heaven spared his life but as to the undutiful the disobedient creature who had been the satal cause of all this trouble she hoped mr herbert had too much regard for her peace of mind ever to expect she would see her more should he be weak enough to think of such a thing she had taken her resolution one house should never contain them both on this she was fully determined her father might do as he thought proper  this caroline is the substance of what passed during mrs grenvilles visit she left me clearly convinced in her own mind that her niece would soon be here figuring away in all her glory as lady sommerville dont you think she stands a chance of being finely mortified by the disappointment of all her high raised ambitious hopes most horridly should i be so i confess could i for a moment believe he could be such an idiot  at any rate indeed i think he will not make himself so completely ridiculous nor will e i presume  quite so easily forbid her presence as that poor tame fool it seems has been  no no caroline sommerville will not be so soon intimidated take my word for it  i die to know how they are going on but am out of the track of gaining farther intelligence this in spite of my better judgment leaves me in some degree of anxiery  i hate suspense  yet it is impossible  absolutely impossible he can marry her ah i could not support that horrid stroke after the pains i have taken to prevent it i think he cannot be quite so lost to common sense though after all men are the absurdest of animals and the wisest of them at times are the direct contrary  would i had never seen him or that i could tear his perfidious image from my breast i detest myself for bestowing a thought upon such an inconstant yet he is never one moment out of my head  my present cicisheo does all in his power to supplant him in my affections and if any man could do it mansell would be the man he is not wholly void of attractions and i believe adores me but he is not a sommerville  however he has no reason to complain of my cruelty there is no doing without somebody to trifle with and he has that talent to perfection  farewell  yours etc arabella stanley  letter xxx lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire london on my return home after having dispatched my last packet to you frank with a grin of self applause on his countenance presented me a letter which he said miss herbert had given him to put in the post but as my honor had ordered him to keep any he might get till i came home he thought it his duty to obey  i found it addressed to a friend of here is miss fermor  i had some thought of committing it to the flames without gratifying my curiosity with a sight of its contents but could not resist the temptation of seeing in what manner my adorable spoke of me and her past adventure  i retired to my room and not without emotion broke the seal  i had every possible reason to be flattered by her expressions of gratitude for the service i had done her but you shall judge for yourself charles  i will transcribe her epistle having a leisure hour and that done proceed to inform you of other matters  to miss fermor ah sophia what a dreadful situation have i been in since last you heard from me what inconceivable terrors have i suffered  at the very moment i believed myself going to be united to the most amiabe of men was i torn from him and from all my friends terrified  insulted  oh my dear girl it was more than human nature could support without sinking under it what a wretch has the man so highly favored by my poor father proved himsfelf good heavens that ever he could have been so infatuated need i after what i have said inform you that wretch was morton  you would no doubt wish to know all the particulars of so extraordinary an event but spare me the repetition till we meet that time i trust is not far distant i am no longer in his power for which my thanks are due to heaven and the generous lord sommerville who at the hazard of his life has been my deliverer yes sophia i repeat at the hazard of his life he has rescued me from a stale of absolute misery  ten tedious days did i pass in a distraction of mind no words can describe he did not even attempt to apologize for what he had done on the contrary he seemed to triumh in the success of his odious scheme and the disappointment of all my hopes of happiness swore i should now be compelled to give him my hand which though he no longer valued he would accept believing he should by that means mortify me more than by any other method he could devise  shocked beyond expression as you may well imagine at such a declaration and fearing he would contrive to put his horrid threat in execution i endeavored to soften his resentment by promising to give up lord sommerville and to use every possible effort to conquer my former reluctance on condition he would restore me to my aunt  in vain were all the promises i could make he insisted i should instantly marry him either with or without my consent never till i was his wife should i have leave to quit that house this he assured me was a point no power on earth should make him relinquish if therefore i wished to revisit my friends i knew on what terms i could do so bid me seriously reflect on my situation as he was not a man to be trisled with that he had my fathers approbation nor did he sear losing it by any step he had or might be compelled to take in order to accomplith his purpose that i was his by the most solemn promise as to those i made he knew me too well to put any trust in them  his cool determined manner terrified me sophia infinitely more than any other could have done i retired to the apartment allotted me plunged in the deepest despair and there gave free vent to my unavailing tears  next morning i found myself extremely ill he sent up to beg he might be permitted to see me  alas was it in my power to prevent it by a refusal he came and appeared alarmed at the condition in which he found me i had not undressed but had thrown myself on the bed where i lay the whole night without closing my eyes  i was soon after seized with a fever which i sincerely hoped would have put an end to all my troubles i believe he now very sincerely repented the step he had taken fearing the fatal consequences likely to ensue  i musst confess every possible care was taken of me during my illness no doubt as much or more perhaps for his own sake than mine i kept my bed for several days and when able to leave it he again requested admittance  i now found his behavior much changed he with a tenderness i did not think him capable of implored me to consent without obliging him to have recourse to compulsive measures which he wished to avoid declared he loved me with unabated passion that it should be the study of his life to make me happy begged i would forget the past confessed he had been much to blame that he had made use of some harsh expressions for which he was now truly concerned etc etc  my only reply was as before restore me to my friends and depend on my gratitude and the promise i have already made to give up lord sommerville  whether he would at last have complied with my request sophia heaven knows i am rather inclined to think he would since he must have been sensible it would have been no easy matter to have married me without my consent though he had threatened it  how the matter would have ended i cannot say this however is certain i would rather have submitted to the most cruel death than have consented to be his  in short lord sommerville was sent by heaven to my relief he left the wretch desperately wounded and brought me to london my aunt being here it seems and i choosing rather to be conveyed to her than my father  we arrived last night i was much shocked on finding myself under the necessity of remaining till this morning in his lorships house but what could i do it was too late to enquire for her then he is now gone out for that purpose and i in the mean time have given you this imperfect account of an affair which has as you may easily believe destressed me beyond conception  in a few hours i trust all my anxiety will be over i think i can now have nothing to fear from that odious creature should he recover which besides the horror and regret i should ever feel at being the cause though an innocent one of a persons death on lord sommervilles account i most sincerely wish least he should be brought into trouble my father cannot after so base a conduct continue to favor his addresses it is impossible sophia do not you think so this consolatory reslection almost makes me forget what i have suffered were i but once more with my dear aunt i should be comparatively happy and this i hope i shall be before night  adieu my dear friend i expect his lordship every moment to conduct me to her i will then write more fully as my mind will be more at ease  ah what gratitude do i not owe my charming deliverer  yours e herbert   transported charles to find myself mentioned by my beloved with such warmth such eloquent tenderness i felt a kind of pang at the thoughts of the deception i was on the point of putting in practice i paused for a few moments  had i fellowed the first cictates of my heart i should have instanly led her to the altar and made her honorably mine by the most sacred ties  every obstacle was then sorgot  but a little recollection of what had passed brought me to my sober senses vet even then i was staggered  what was i to think of the account she had given of the adventure so wholly different from that i had received of it was it possible she could so calmly talk of happiness of all her troubles being at an end if the rascal had treated her in the manner described in that cursed letter this puzzled me  but i considered the same motives which i concluded had made her conceal the horrid truth from me might induce her to be silent on the subject to her friend  this idea put an end to all my doubts and scruples at once my passion for the lovely injured creature continued in full force but all thoughts of matrimony fled with them the only remaining difficulty was how to inform her my search for her aunt had been fruitless since her next request would of course be that i would convey her home which you may believe i had no thoughts of complying with in short it was to be done the hour in which she expected me was come what would she think of not seeing me  while thus deliberating i heard her bell ring and presently a servant came to let me know she had enquired whether i was come in  i now could delay no longer but bid him return and tell her i was in the drawing room  down she came instantly  well my lord cried the lovely creature with sweet impatience what says my aunt have you seen her will she come sor me or am i to go to her perhaps she is now in the house  oh tell me do not keep me in suspense i beg of you  why these emotions my adorable emily compose yourself my best love taking her hand and leading her to a seat are you then so very impatient to leave the man who lives but in your presence  ah my lord no trisling i beseech you as you value my peace where is my aunt why is she not here she was going to the window charles no doubt in hopes of seeing her carriage at the door  why is my angel thus disturbed again taking her hand did i not flatter myself she would think herself perfectly safe under the protection of her adoring sommerville i should fear to tell her all my enquiries this morning have been in vain but i hope to be more successful another time  in vain with a look of terror have you not found her then my lord good heavens what will become of me how very very unfortunate are you certain she really came to london i now begin to fear your lordship has been misinformed she had no such design when i left her i am miserable beyond expression at this cruel disappointment  why miserable my angel interrupting her i may be more successful in my next attempt are you not with the man who adores you who would with joy sacrifice his life to give you a moments pleasure  ah talk not of pleasure my lord while i am thus at a distance from my friends let me be gone i will wait no longer alas i have been here too long already i wished to see my aunt i feared to meet the eyes of my father unless supported by her presence but since that cannot be let me set off instantly for rather would i encounter his indignation however severe than remain another hour in my present situation your lordship cannot but see the impropriety of it and will therefore pardon me if i appear to forget my obligations to you  i do not believe me i have a proper sense of them and ever shall when my mind is more at ease than it can be at present it shall be my study to make you sensible of my gratitude  and can my charming emily then talk with so much cool indifference of leaving a man she once prosessed to honor with her esteem attempting to press her hand to my lips  you astonish me my lord hastily withdrawing it can lord sommerville be surprised at my impatience surely if so i must have been greatly deceived in the opinion i believed he had formed of me but let us drop the subject permit one of your servants my lord to get me a carriage i have not a moment to lose and she was going to ring the bell  at that moment we were informed dinner was served  indulge me my emily with one short hour of your dear company and then if you will persist in your cruel intention you shall be obeyed  can you doubt it my lord  i took her hand to lead her to the dining room  first let me give directions and till the carriage arrives i will not resuse you my company though in my present perplexed state of mind it can afford but little pleasure  frank was waiting the moment we entered the room i bid him order my post chaise to be got ready as soon as possible at the same time giving him a look which he perfectly understood  but why yours my lord pray allow me to   do as you are told interrupting her can miss herbert suppose i will suffer her to go such a journey in any other  she was tolerably easy charles during the time we sat at table though frequently looking at her watch and listening for the sound of the carriage  above an hour passed and no account of it she then grew impatient and implored me to enquire why they were so dilatory  i rung the bell pretended to be in a rage at their stupidity and charged them to make all possible haste in the mean time said all that man could say to remove her anxiety but guess how it was increased on frank coming to inform me the postillion was not to be found he fancied he was gone to see his mother who he had heard was at the point of death and who lived at the other end of the town  i now stormed at his daring to go out of the way without permission my gentle emily begged me to consider the cause and on that account to forgive him at the same time entreating him to get her another as fast as possible  i need hardly tell you charles it was so contrived that under one pretense or other the day was so far advanced before we heard any more of the carriage that it was too late to think of setting off that night  it is utterly out of my power to give you an idea of her distress at these repeated and unlooked for disappointments she wept she wrung her hands n absolute despair and i believe was not even then wholly void of suspicion yet my behavior was so guarded that not a look or word escaped me that could justly alarm her  alar med she certainly was however to the last degree and almost fainting with terror and apprehension when finding she was under the necessity of staying another night she begged to retire  i now rung for watson who conducted her to her apartment and afterward told me the young lady had strictly and positively desired to have a chaise at the door by day light next morning as she wished to set out as early as possible  the morning came but no carriage  the dear creature had taken no rest her bell was rung repeatedly many hours before day but i had given directions not to answer it till the usual time of breakfast and to secure the streetdoor in case she should make any attempt to leave the house whether she did or not atttempt it is uncertain  about ten i went up to her dressingroom and tapping gently she instantly opened the door no doubt believing it to be watson on seeing me she started her lovely eyes were red and visibly declared she had been weeping  what am i to think my lord  with a dignity in her manner charles that actually overawed and disconcerted me most confoundedly of the treatment i have received i would gladly believe the disappointments of yesterday were accidental but why were my orders disobeyed this morning why or by whose authority is it i am now detained here when you know the impropriety of it and my extreme impatience to be gone  i paused charles absolutely unable to please myself with any answer i could give  finding i still gazed on her in silence and no doubt seeing guilt pictured on my countenance she continued  oh my lord do not for heavens sake do not give me cause to change the opinion i have hitherto entertained of you i have till now believed you a man of honor that my happiness was dear to you tell me then have i been deceived speak at once my lord and relieve me from this dreadful suspense most sincerely do i wish you may be able to remove those suspicions which this strange and let me say cruel and incomprehensible behavior has given rite to  throwing myself at her feet i passionately exclaimed oh my emily my adorable emily behold the most faithful the most tender of lovers imploring your pardon yes my best beloved i will confess i cannot wholy justify the conduct of which you complain i must own my crime but surely surely i have not sinned beyond forgiveness could i was it in nature i could resign without distraction the object on whom my soul doated and on whom the whole happiness of my life depends oh my charming my dearest emily did you love did you adore as i do how easily would you pardon the step that love has impelled me to take what hopes could i be able to indulge of ever seeing you again had i suffered you to leave me after what has passed your family no doubt are now too much irritated against me to favor my addresses nor is this all have i not cause to sear the idol of my affections might have met with a cool reception na severity from those who have never even before this unfortunate event treated her with that tenderness she is entitled to and so justly merits  this is my apology gazing on her with supplicating looks oh for pity sake let it find acceptance treat me not with asperity but tell me you forgive and make me the happiest of men  it is well my lord pray rise you have cleared up all my doubts and i thank you for it henceforth i shall know in what light to look upon those professions of love you may think proper to make as well as those you have heretofore offered you have as far as you possibly can made me miserable and no doubt find it a pleasant reflection how i have deserved this treatment i know not unless as a punishment for my credulity in believing you incapable of such an atrocious action i have only one question to ask for i scorn any reply to the very elaborate speech you have taken the trouble to make i should blush to attempt it though your lordship has not blushed to utter it  am i at liberty to quit this house i know it is in your power to detain me and you may by so doing make me a very wretched a very unhappy creature but a guilty one you never can  i would now have taken her hand charles but she withdrew it with a look of the utmost contempt  is your sommerville then sunk so very low in your esteem my lovely emily that he merits nothing but repulses ah too sure he has been fatally deceived while believing he once had a place in it what have i done to deserve this killing reserve these cruel suspicions i have loved adored you with the most tender passion that ever warmed the breast of man the whole study of my life shall be employed to convince my angel of its fervor and sincerity here on my knees on this dear hand i swear   swear not my lord interrupting me reserve those vows for some other believe me they will be lost upon me that you were once dear to me i must acknowledge but that time is passed never never to return i now see you such as you really are before i saw you only such as my weak simple heart represented you how flattering was that picture when compared with the original  surely my lord if not wretchedly hardened in guilt the horrid contrast must shock even yourself  but i lose time in these fruitless reflections  if your lordship wishes to regain any part of that confidence you have so justly forfeited suffer me instantly to set off for my fathers house this is the only favor i have to ask and the only proof you can give me that you are not so wholly lost to every sense of honor as i am at this moment compelled to believe  in this cool this mortifying style charles did the dear creature continue to treat all i could say either in excuse for my conduct or to convince her of the warmth of my passion  determined not to comply with her request i took no notice of it but in the tenderest manner pressed her to indulge me with her company at breakfast this she peemptorily refused declaring she would never on any terms quit that room till she left it in order to return home  thus charles ended our first conference you will perhaps tell me i behaved like a fool that having proceeded so far i ought not to have been quite so passive that a little more courage and less respect would sooner have brought matters to a conclusion  but you know her not she is not a girl to be dealt with in the common way she has a dignity a delicacy in short a something about her that forbid ones presuming to take the smallest liberty certain never to be forgiven  how the devil morton managed i cannot divine not by fair means i will be sworn or how she conscious as she must be by the past that to be thus in a fellows power is no joke dare treat me with so high a hand i know as little  i expected nothing but weeping and wailing to have seen her at my feet imploring mercy for a scene of that nature i was prepared but her behavior has totally disconcerted my plan of operations so much good sense so much calm argument and so void of apprehension  cursedly provoking charles is it not faith i now begin to fancy she never cared a straw for me if she had she could not behave in this unaccountable manner no it is as plain as the day she neither loves nor fears me but by heavens she shall do one or the other  i will be revenged for this proof of her duplicity i have so long been accustomed to treat her as a divinity that i know not how to lower her consequence and rank her as a mere mortal but my pride is now concerned it is piqued at her coldness she shall find i will no longer be such an egregious puppy as to be so easily intimidated i have gone too far to recede and at my next visit shall more explicitly inform her of my present intentions which if she is wise she will not reject  upon my soul every thing considered she might listen to my vows with less contempt she cannot seriously after what has happened expect a renewal of my former proposals though scrictly speaking she is still virtuous i would do her all possible justice i believe her mind pure and unsullied but still i say charles she should consider her situation is widely different from what it was before that cursed event yet she does not seem to value herself the lefs indeed when i think of the modesty and delicate reserve with which she conducts herself and with which every look and every action is blended i cannot but wonder she should now wish me to marry her which she certainly expects however i hope a time will come when she will see things in a better light  i shall for a day or two content myself with enquiring after her health as i i would give her time to make proper reflections and if she does so charles she shall have no reason to complain she shall find me all her heart can desire the whole study of my life shall be to render her happy  if she ever did love me i cannot doubt but she will comply but that is a point i am not now so clear in as i could wish  naturally all softness all gentle timidity how she has acquired her present courage i cannot possibly conceive  adieu  sommerville  letter xxxi same to the same london i told you in my last charles i had determined to give my beloved a few days leisure to reflect seriously on her situation flattering myself the result would be favorable to my wishes  at our next meeting i had every reason to believe i had acted wisely but you will find before you come to the end of this epistle she is as artful as the rest of her bewitching sex  having with infinite difficulty resisted the temptation of seeing her for two tedious days on the third morning i sent a note by watson entreating she would permit me the honor to wait upon her adding my visit should be no longer than was perfectly agreeable to her my request was granted  i found her in her dressing room she had been writing and had just laid by her letter when i entered to whom i did not then know but the subject had affected her reatly for the enchanting girl was still in tears  she endeavored to check them and to resume her former ease and indifference but it would not do she threw herself back in her chair and wept aloud  i was softened beyond expression  my angel emily cried i throwing myself at her feet and pressing her now unreluctant hand to my throbbing breast why these tears why this distress look up my best beloved turn those dear eyes on your adoring sommerville say but you forgive him that he has not wholly lost that place in your esteem you once gave him leave to hope he possessed and make him supremely blessed  his heart his fortune all all are yours and every moment of his future life shall be entirely deveted to his emily  what can i say my lord with a softness a sweetness in her voice and manner that melted my very soul you have succeeded but too well in your designs you have for ever ruined the peace of a young creature who certainly never injured you but who on the contrary beheld you with too much partiality oh my lord could i have believed the amiable the generous sommerville for such till fatally undeceived i fondly believed you who i say could have suspected him capable of such barbarity alas i at least was far far indeed from thinking it in his nature  ah wound not my soul with these unkind reproaches my amiable creature i cannot bear them from those dear those lovely lips interrupting her and transported to find her thus softened forget the past deign but to bless your penitent sommerville with one smile in token for forgiveness and look forward to many years of exquisite uninterrupted happiness  ah my lord what reliance can i place on the man who has already so cruelly deceived me or how look forward to happiness when all my hopes of it are thus destroyed for ever  is it nothing then my emily tenderly pressing her dear soft hand to my heart to be adored to be loved as never woman was loved before by the most fathful the most constant of men by that once happy because once favored sommerville my emily is all the world to me i ask no greater blessing i cannot figure to myself a more exquisite felicity than a return of that passion which can end only with my existence give me but permission to hope that you will endeavor to forget any part of my conduct that has incurred your displeasure and i will patiently wait your time you shall never again have cause to reproach me every thought every sentiment of my impassioned heart shall be laid open before you you shall be my guide my monitress  i here solemnly swear to be wholly directed by my best beloved in every future action of my life form me make me such as you would have me only promise   i will promise nothing endeavoring to remove farther from me on my attempting to throw my arm round her delicate waist as she sat by me on the sopha it was not in nature to resist it charles however as i saw my angel was alarmed i made shift to command myself fully persuaded that a short time would remove those delicate those engaging scruples and make her wholly mine  i will promise nothing my lord nor ought you yet to expect it let your future conduct deserve my approbation and trust to my gratitude leave me now i have been too much agitated for the present state of my spirits and wish to be alone  shall i venture to ask my emilys dear company at dinner quite transported with her condescending goodness  i have already said my lord i will promise nothing if i find myself able i will not refuse in the mean time allow me to compose myself i am far from well i have suffered much and my mind is extremely distressed  i now unable to command my emotions clasped the lovely creature to my beating heart and having printed a thousand kisses on the foftest whitest hand that ever nature formed thanked her for the delightful hope she had given me and withdrew  from that hour till the moment i expected to be again blessed with her presence i sat lost in a thousand transporting reflections all my fears were banished and i gave a loose to the most unbounded joy can you charles wonder at my ecstacie sweetly engaging as she had been during our enchanting interview  the dear girl did not disappoint me she came down and still continued the same amiable creature yet so much blushing modesty so perfect a propriety in every word and look that for my soul i durst not take advantage of her returning partiality  she left me early  and lest me full of the most flattering hopes that my love would be soon returned which was now become more ardent more firmly rooted than ever  i saw her no more that day as she declined meeting me in the evening and i would not be too importunate but readily admitted her apology  just as i was going out watson brought me a second letter which she said miss herbert had prevailed upon her to send to the post office but finding my honor was still at home thought i might choose to take that trouble myself  a pretty turn that charles was it not i eagerly took it saying she did perfectly right  and returning to my apartment broke the seal and had the felicity to find the contents as follows  mrs grenville had i not received a thousand proofs of my dearest aunts tender friendship and affection i should scarcely have courage to address her after having been the fatal though heaven knows the involuntary cause of so much misery and trouble to her and my other friends but trusting she is too generous to blame me for what it was not in my power to prevent i with less apprehension take up my pen  oh my dear madam i have been cruelly deceived deceived too by the man i believed incapable of such baseness the man even you looked upon as the most amiable the most worthy of his sex how will you be shocked when i add this man is lord sommerville great as i believed my obligations were to him for rescuing me from the no less detestable morton they are now cancelled by his present behavior  uncertain whether these sad lines blotted by my incessant tears will ever be permitted to reach your dear hand though one of the creatures he has placed about me has promised to convey them to the post i will not waste my time in giving you all the horrid particulars of his perfidy they shall be reserved till we meet should that wishedfor hour ever arrive suffice it to say when he had nobly generously as i then imagined delivered me from the power of that wretch he brought me to london assuring me you my dear madam were there this greatly surprised me as i knew not you had any such intention but could i doubt the veracity the honor of a man with whom i was a short time before to have been united by the most sacred ties  impossible  and alas if i had what would my doubts have availed  he had deliberately formed his cruel plan every circumstance too plainly proves it i have since remarked it was not the sudden thought but evidently preconcerted and deeply laid  my first request on our arrival was that he should instantly oblige me by making enquiries where i could find you he appeared no less anxious for it than myself and sat off that moment but to my inexpressble terror confusion and disappointment returned without success  judge what must have been my feelings on finding myself under the dreadful necessity of remaining all night in his house but think how infinitely more i am now distressed convinced he has basely betrayed me  oh my dear madam for heavens sake compassionate a wretched creature whose only hope rests on you to my no doubt enraged father i dare not presume to apply i sink under the apprehension of his too just indignation but you you were ever my kind my indulgent friend hasten then on my knees i entreat you and save me from destruction  hitherto i have had nothing to reproach him with but his cruelty in detaining me alas i am compelled to dissemble  his odious views are but too clear he no longer thinks me worthy of his hand yet professes himself the most passionate of lovers he knows but little of your unfortunate emily if he presumes to hope she would now condescend to be his even on those honorable terms he sormerly proposed  no believe me the man who has dared to insult and treat me in the manner he has done who has for a moment suspected me so lost to every sense of honor and of virtue as to comply with his present infamous designs must while i have life be to me the most detestable of monsters  i fear being interrupted  alas i have ten thousand fears  hasten then my dear aunt i once more implore you to my relief should heaven so far pity my wretched fate as to suffer this melancholy epistle to reach my only friend hasten and by your loved presence put an end to the unspeakable affictions of your affectionate and obedient niece  e herbert   what say you to this charles is she not a dear perverse bewitching little hypocrite can you after this proof of her artifice blame me for using a little in return  so while she has life i am to be looked upon as the most detestable of monsters it is devilishly severe faith but what say you to her easy manner of skimming over the adventure she met with from the other monster not a word of that escapes her ah let women alone it is said they cannot keep even their own secrets but i shall henceforth beg leave to deny the fact  here have i read two of the sweet creatures letters wrote to two of her dearest friends but not one syllable has transpired in either of them relative to the ill usage she has received upon my soul i cannot will not pardon this duplicity by her deceitful proceeding she sets me the example and by heavens i will profit by it  i too will dissemble for mine she shall be  on that as i said besore i am determined but if possible it shall be with her own consent i love i adore her more than ever man adored it is therefore i wish to reconcile her to her fate  that she did love me even this impertinent letter testifies i will rekindle that love or perish in the attempt  yes she shall confess i am still dear to her  that i am not the monster she at present affects to think me  had i still talked of matrimony she would have treated me with less severity nay even now i will be sworn would joyfully listen to me on that subject though she is pleased to say otherwise it is a conviction that i have no such intention which has given birth to this outrageous virtue delicacy and so forth  she declares her aunt is her only friend and i believe except myself she has not another what her father might be were he at liberty to follow his own inclination i know not but his better half ill talk care of that my life for it she will not suffer his indignation to evaporate it is in the cause of her hopeful nephew who it must be confessed has been rather roughly handled though he has a consolation to boast of such as it is which to me i own would afford but little the passion must be mutual or it has no joys for your friend sommerville a monster though he be  now charles if i can contrive to persuade the dear girl this only remaining friend is a friend no longer i trust she will have sense enough to see her wisest course will be to lay aside her present haughty resentful sentiments to accept my offers with a good grace and thus confer happiness both on herself and her adorer this is my scheme it is simple and easy as thus she shall believe her letter dispatched in due time comes a short categorical answer not indeed wrote by the dear hand of her aunt  too much enraged for that  but by those of her aunts abigail do you comprehend me in the mean time i continue all submission attention and respect this restores me gradually to my charmers good opinion and prepares her mind to make the best of her present situation on finding she has no other resource  this is a short sketch of my plan which i think can hardly fail of success when you reflect that her heart was once mine nay still is i fondly hope and am willing to believe  adieu my dear charles i am now going to write the important serawl on which i place my greatest dependence  ever yours sommerville  letter xxxii same to the same london it is over charles  my lovely weeping emily is now convinced she has no friend on earth to whom she can apply for protection of course i have only to wait patiently till the first tumult of her sorrows subside and then i trust reason will convince her she cannot do better than resign all thoughts of asking it of any other than her devoted sommerville  i contrived to get the letter sent by the post she received it from watson with joyful emotions and having no doubt of her fidelity hastily broke the seal before she left the room and happy was it she did for no sooner had she cast her lovely eyes over the first lines which were abundantly expressive than clasping her hand in an agony of grief and faintly exclaiming then i am lost indeed she fell lifeless on the chair where she sat  watson terrified at her fainting flew to assist and support her having first rung the bell with great violence  guessing what had happened i ran up stairs and sound my angel in this condition the letter lying by her on the floor i instantly raised her in my arms and conveyed her to her bed where kneeling by her i tried by every endearing and tender expression to recall her to life these and some drops which watson administered at length in some measure restored her to my wishes  i now ordered the servants to leave the room and pressing her almost liseless hands in mine begged her to tell me what had occasioned so sudden an indisposition she no sooner observed me than she looked terrified crying leave me leave me my lord nor cruelly attempt to recall to life a wretched creature who can never again know peace then bursting into a flood of tears she in the most pathetic heartmelting expressions bewailed her miserable fate  my love my dearest emily tell me i conjure you tell me what has happened thus to distress you am i not your friend your adoring lover can you doubt my zeal and readiness to serve and oblige you or even to sacrifice my life was it possible i could thereby restore my angel to peace and happiness speak to me command me here on my knees i swear by all that is sacred to refuse you nothing you can ask are you not dearer to me than my own soul  on my lord my lord attempt no longer to deceive me too well do i know what confidence to place in your vows and protestations perhaps when death has released me from this treacherous this wicked world a moment may come in which you will reflect with anguish on your conduct to one who once was weak enough to believe you faultless  heaven has severely ah how very severely punished my too easy credulity at present your lordship may perhaps triumph in your success you have indeed succeeded but too well you have undone me  ruined for ever ruined a poor young creature who deserved a better fate but i forgive you may heaven also be merciful and forgive you too and soon take me from this scene of inexpressible misery forsaken given up by all my friends become a wretched outcast what have i now to hope  every thing my best beloved every thing in the power of the man who adores you whose whole study it shall be from this moment to supply to you the loss of those unkind friends you lament they were not worthy to possess so inestimable a treasure they knew not the value of the jewel they thus reject but your devoted sommerville knows it well and will preserve it as the greatest blessing heaven can bestow on him  look up then my best love turn those dear eyes upon him trust him place a proper confidence in him and you shall be happy happy as it is in the power of the most faithful the most tender of lovers to make you  let me instantly quit this house then my lord this and this only i ask as a proof of your sincerity  by heavens you shall my emily even this cruel request i will comply with though i thereby deprive myself of every possible hope of felicity yes i will give you this painful proof of my sincerity but first let me see you restored to tranquillity you are not at present my angel in a condition to think of removing surely my behavior has been such as might banish every idea of fear or suspicion depend upon its continuance depend upon my honor never my lovely emily shall it be such as to incur your displeasure  i love i adore you it is true with a passion more ardent than words can express on a return of which my whole happiness is centered but it must be voluntary never will your sommerville forget that respect you so justly merit he will leave to time and his unremitted endeavors to convince you of his tenderness and affection to produce that wishedfor change in your sentiments which can alone constitute his felicity  in the interim he is and ever will be your unchangeable friend as such look upon as such command him  but do not be too precipitate my dearest creature reflect seriously on what you would wish to do whether return to your father  your aunt  or  oh my lord again bursling into tears why ah why all those obliging professions of friendship now when well you know they come too late for my peace my father  my aunt  alas alas i have no longer   she could not proceed her anguisn put it out of her power to finish the sentence upon my soul charles her distress softened me even to tears the drops sell on her lovely hand  ah my lord is it possible there should yet remain any degree of tenderness of compassion in a heart that ha hitherto been so callous so capable of acting as you have done even you weep my lord who have been the voluntary author of all my sorrows think then can i ever hope that my tears will cease to flow but let me seize the favorable moment to renew my suit am i at liberty to leave you no matter where or to whom i go heaven i trust will not wholly abandon me on that i rely  i have been a weak but not a guilty creature my lord and doubt not providence will guide my steps to some more hospitable door than those which are now for ever shut against me and again she sobbed as if her heart would break  by heavens charles it was too much i could hardly support her tender gentle complaints no reproaches no violent exclamations but all angelic softness i was temped to pronounce myself a villain to repent and to make a full confession  i did not yet however still hoping time would be my friend  i left her rather more composed confiding in the promise i had given her that she might consider what step she was to take saying i would wait on her again when she did me the honor to let me know she had come to a resolution  i waited several hours but no summons coming my patience was at length exhausted and i went up to her apartment  forgive me my emily i come to make a proposal which i flatter myself will meet your approbation  though it is worse than death to part from the dearest treasure i have on earth to be spearated from the loved object of my tenderest affections i will not break my word i have promised and will perform hear me my angel and then judge how far it will be agreeable to you  at present i presume from some words that dropped from those dear lips you would not wish to return either to your father or aunt  she sighed deeply and raised her fine eyes to heaven in despair  suppose then my dearest creature should till their displeasure subsides go to a house of mine in the country   of yours my lord exclaimed she  here me patiently my emily it is mine but i never reside there nor will i presume to attempt seeing you without your permission of this i give you my honor the present inhabitants are only the steward and his wife worthy honest people  i will not even offer to accompany you watson shall conduct you to them and if you will permit her remain there to attend you she is now no stranger to you and i trust you have found her behavior unexceptionable  the situation is retired but a most desirable summer residence there you will be at liberty to write to your friends to make your peace with them which i cannot believe will be attended with any difficulty and every scruple raised by my beloveds ideas of delicacy must vanish as no one need know the house is mine  some where you must be and certainly the country is more eligible on every account than being in town where you are so entirely a stranger  i shall give proper orders that you shall find every thing as convenient as possible and be treated with that respect which indeed no one can possibly resuse to so much excellence my carriage or any other if more agreeable though i could wish you would not so far mortisy me as to reject that shall wait your commands  yet i hope you will not leave me till tomorrow one short day my emily may surely indulge me in what says my angel have i been so happy as to propose a plan that does not displease her  alas my lord i would gladly believe you really now are desirous of repairing as far as possible the cruel injury you have done me i can have but one objection  it is still being in some measure under your lordships protection how is it possible to reconcile this with my ideas of propriety  she then paused for a moment yet what better can i do situated as i unhappily am to stay longer here would be infinitely worse it is a sad alternative my lord but i think you must be sincere and shall therefore only stipulate that you will not attempt to see me while i am at your house  most solemnly my love do i swear it unless by your permission and in this i was sincere not doubting but that permission would in due time be granted  before i left her every thing was finally settled i prevailed on her to remain that day and the next that i might have time to write to brown and his wife in order that every thing might be ready for her reception  tomorrow ah charles tomorrow then my charmer bids me adieu watson accompanies her and is to remain as long as she is found necessary by this means i shall learn how things go on i did not demand the liberty of writing to her lest she should have refused me now i can do as i please and shall not fail to indulge myself in that satisfaction  my heart tells me all will yet be well she cannot but approve my whole conduct one instance of it excepted and that i trust will be forgiven  what an enviable fate will mine then be and how amply shall i be rewarded for all the selfdenial i have practiced while i had the lovely creature thus in my power can there be a greater proof charles of the fervor and purity of my passion perhaps you may look upon it in a different light but you are deceived a heart like my emilys is worth waiting for and her person without it all beautiful and desirable as it is would not satisfy me  tomorrow  ah would that painful trial was over tomorrow my adorable leaves me but i must hope and think there is a reward in store for this heroic deed  farewell my dear dalton i am ever yours  sommerville  letter xxxiii miss herbert to miss fermer offer your thanks to heaven with mine my dear sophia for the happy preservation of your friend in the great danger i have exposed to that i have escaped from a state of unspeakable misery and from the power of a man whose artful conduct i had every reason to fear would in the end have wrought my undoing in spite of all my caution  oh my dear what terrors have i not suffered it is impossible to tell you the pains that have been taken to seduce me from the paths of virtue by the most artful the most dangerous of men dangerous because but too amiable once i thought him more so than any of his perfidious sex  but now my prayer is that i may never behold him more  yes sophia i now see him as he is and happy thrice happy do i think myself in making the discovery of his baseness before it was too late   i have some reason to fear the few lines i wrote to you on my deliverance from that wretch morton never reached you as i think you would not have failed to oblige me with an answer if so you are yet it is probable ignorant of many things which to repeat would only distress us both spare me then my dear friend let me pass them over in silence and merely tell you by what fortunate event i now write from a place of safety  sommerville  yes sophia the elegent the accomplished sommerville for in spite of the wretchedness he has so cruelly brought upon me i must do him the justice to say he merits those epithets but alas how are those engaging perfections obscured and tarnished by ten thousand vices  deceived by sommerville i say into a belief that my aunt was in london i consented to let him convey me to her there  but had i not agreed to this plan i am now fatally convinced i could not have avoided the snare he had laid for me i soon discovered his ungenerous his infamous views though he took all imaginable pains to alarm me as little as possible  his behavior during the tedious days i was compelled to spend in his house was perfectly respectful his care his attention and unremitted endeavors to oblige and reconcile me to my fate great beyond expression i saw plainly he had not a doubt of success and had nothing therefore to fear from violence  shocking as it was to be thus cruelly detained from my friends it was yet a considerable consolation his housekeeper had orders to provide me in those necessaries i stood in need of this she obeyed and i was under the necessity of making use of them having been torn from the protection of my aunt with no other clothes than those i had on  i need hardly add many more were provided and those too in more profusion and of a more costly nature than i had either inclination or occasion for  ah how little was he acquainted with the sentiments of your emily if he could for a moment believe trifles of that kind could aid his vile purpose  determined by some means or other to make my escape i judged it prudent to dissemble as this would make him less on his guard  i first however wished to inform my aunt of my situation no difficulty had been made when i begged they would put the letter i wrote to you in the post at least i prevailed though now i fear as i said it never reached you alas sophia that to my aunt was more fortunate but how was i shocked how were all my hopes crushed when i received her cruel her dreadfully cruel answer  i had scarcely cast my eyes over its heartrending contents than unable to support the blow i fainted  how long i continued in a happy insensibility i know not but when i recovered from that enviable state i found the author of all my sorrows kneeling by my bedside to which they had conveyed me diftracted by his apprehensions  he had no doubt read the fatal letter and i am persuaded pleased himself with the thought that i had not now a friend on earth to whom i could fly for protection for so my once kind aunt assured me in the most severe terms  yet he appeared sincerely affected at the condition in which he saw me and in the tenderest most affectionate manner protested there was nothing in his power he would not do to restore my tranquillity begged me to command him declared my happiness was infinitely dearer to him than his own that every word every action of his life should prove it to me  all i ask my lord is liberty to leave this house  how was i delighted sophia to hear him without hesitationi grant my request i really believed he at last began to repent of what he had done true he used every possible endeavor to dissuade me from my purpose but finding nothing would prevail he left me to compose my spirits and at leisure to reflect on the plan i meant to pursue  alas sophia on what could i now determine forbid my aunts forbid my fathers house their doors for ever shut against me  to whom could i fly for protection my mind was in a state of distraction my thoughts all confusion i could fix on nothing but at all events to leave the man i had so much reason to dread  finding i did not send for him again as i had promised when i came to some resolution he retrned to me and begged i would calmly listen to a proposal he had to offer which he flatttered himself would meet my approbation  this was since i would not be prevailed upon to bless him longer with my company which he valued more than life that i would condescend to reside for a while in a house of his in the country where i should be perfectly retired and where i might without those delicate scruples which now robbed him of me try every means to make my peace with my family who would perhaps be more readily reconciled to me when no longer with him  i naturally objected to this as being still his house  he replied they might remain ignorant of that circumstance as he never had lived there and repeatedly swore he never would attempt to visit me without my permission  i paused a while distressed beyond measure not knowing on what to resolve at length however i considered i might possibly find it easier as he said to make my peace there than while under his immediate protection and i confess i shuddered at the idea of finding myselt in london without a single friend to whom i could apply for it  those in the country i feared might be as much prejudiced against me as my own family  in short sophia i agreed glad beyond expression at his consent at any rate to my release  he begged me to delay my cruel purpose for a day or two that he might write to his steward to get every thing in order for my reception his housekeeper was also to accompany me and to continue as long as i found her necessary  the happy wishedfor hour of my deliverance at length arrived  i left him sophia and though still distracted with ten thousand painful apprehensions for the future found my heart relieved from great part of its distress  i confess i had still many doubts of his sincerity  i could not easily persuade myself he had wholly given up his dishonorable views the change in his sentiments was too suddden after all the artifice all the trouble he had taken to get me into his power to leave me without suspicion but to get from him was a great point gained  i might be mistaken it was possible he might be less wicked than he had hitherto appeared  at any rate it was infinitely better than continuing where i was that was certain misery this step might prevent my ruin  thank heaven my dear sophia this has been effected for providence ever kind and merciful sent me a friend when least expected an amiable generous compassionate friend who does me the justice to believe me innocent though unfortunate and who by every obliging attention endeavors to make me forget the past and look forward to happier days  we set out pretty early in the morning mrs watson the name of my traveling companion and who i till then had looked upon as a decent good kind of woman now began to talk to me with more freedom and familiarity than she had ever presumed to do ran out in most ridiculous praises of her lord said he was the most generous the handsomest and best of men that where he once took a fancy this sophia was her elegant expression he spared no expense nothing was too good or too dear  ah you are a fortunate young lady i am sure continued she how many no less beautiful would envy your situation here now you are going to reign sole mistress of the sweetest spot that ever you saw in your life and to be sure it is far more agreeable than being cooped up in london as you were  i was astonished  shocked  and all my fears returned fully convinced she was sent with me merely as a guard to prevent any attempt i might make to escape she durst not have talked in this style had not her vile employer let her fully into his infamous intentions she no doubt had her instructions and i am persuaded would have been but too faithful to the trust reposed in her  i made few answers to her impertinence but suffered her to run on as she pleased fully determined to proceed no further than the inn we were to sleep at if i could possibly help it i took care however to say nothing likely to create suspicion she then had none believing i was perfectly satisfied with my condition  when arrived at the last stage of that days journey we stopped and she went to order beds and supper  i observed an elegant carriage in the courtyard as we came in ah what would i have given to have known whether it belonged to male or female if the latter i was determined to contrive some means of making my situation known alas i had already been too cruelly deceived by the former ever to trust them more  on watsons return i carelessly asked her if she knew the owner as i was then viewing it from the window being still light enough for that purpose know yes that i do full well and little does lady mary craven guess i fancy i am here unless she may have seen my lords carriage as you have seen here is mercy on us what would she say did she know as much as i know she would tear your eyes out  my eyes amazed what on earth do you mean  mean why surely you must have heard his lordship talk of her why she is the very person he was to have married aye and would have married had he not taken such a fancy to you at least the world says so and to tell you the truth i believe it but to be sure his honor has a right to do as he thinks fit though by not doing it he must they say lose great part of his fortune  sophia can you conceive my aftonishment i was now if possible more anxious to meet with an opportunity of speaking to her much i had indeed heard of her and even my cruel betrayer spoke of her with esteem though he had hitherto declined fulfilling his engagement  the horrid phrase the creature had made use of shocked me i instantly conceived her ladyship had heard of my intended union with him and also perhaps of what had since happened i felt mortified exceedingly so and would have given worlds for an opportunity to justify myself but how to procure it i knew not  a thought occured to me the first time watson left the room which she frequently did as i presume she found the people of the house more cheerful companions than i was  i took a slip of paper which fortunately lay on the table and with my pencil wrote a few lines strongly expressing the misery of my situation and begging for the love of heaven her ladyship would condescend to see me the means of doing so i left to herself as i could think of none likely to succeed without creating suspicion in the creature i had every reason to believe was placed over me as a spy  this i sealed and gave the waiter who came to cover the table for supper charging him to convey it instantly into the ladys own hand  he could have no reason to refuse this request  away he went and left me agitated with ten thousand hopes and fears  near half an hour elapsed before his return  i sat in terrors watson had two or three times been in the room during his absence but still finding little pleasure in my company made her visits very short  to my no small joy at last the waiter entered sophia and giving me a sealed note said if i had any further commands i had only to ring the bell and he would attend  i opened it trembling from head to foot and had scarce power to read the contents my eyes grew perfectly dim i feared i should faint however a glass of water which i instantly drank relieved me  these were the few words the dear paper contained madam i feel myself much interested in your happiness i cannot doubt the facts you have mentioned they are dreadful your applying to a stranger is a convincing proof the situation you are in is not agreeable to you depend on seeing me this evening i will contrive to dispose of the woman you tell me has the charge of you and shall be happy to render you any service in my power  heavens sophia judge what were my feelings at that delightful moment it is not in the power of language to give you an idea of them supper came in a moment after and watson followed it  i feared she would remark the change which must have taken place in my countenance at dinner i had desired her to sit at table with me but now under pretense that she would be better amused elsewhere i told her i would dispense with her company she seemed perfectly fatisfied i sophia was still more so  i soon finished my repast  the cloth was but just removed when the door opened and in came my generous friend for well does her ladyship merit that tender appellation  ah madam covered with blushes and attempting to throw myself at her feet can you pardon an unhappy young creature for presuming to take so great a liberty were i also a guilty one believe me i would not have   say no more  make no apologies tenderly raising me and taking my hand in the most engaging manner i have not a doubt of your innocence that lovely countenance that amiable timidity those artless blushes plainly declare it  sit down continued she seating herself by me and still kindly holding my hand we have no time to lose in idle ceremony i am not entirely a stranger to your story i have even heard part of it since i came into this house your duenna has not the talent of keeping a secret she has already been talking of it to my woman and no doubt to others but it is of no consequence if you wish to escape from her  ah madam interrupting her it is all i ask of heaven  enough my lovely girl depend upon it you shall then and for all other matters we will leave them to talk over at more leisure at present let us think only how to manage the first point yet it will not i believe require much contrivance i think the wretch will not dare to dispute my authority  she was silent for a moment then said i have ordered my woman to keep her in chat till i return and that will be no very difficult matter for she seems an arrant gossip but i have changed my mind she may as well find me here my presence i am persuaded will not produce any bad effect ring for her miss herbert and without scruple say you have accepted the offer i have made you of sleeping with me let her form what conjectures she pleases my life for it she will not dare to oppose your design  how my dear madam shall i ever repay this goodness this unspeakable obligation taking her hand and respectfully pressing it to my lips  o very easily my dear but we will talk of that another time you forget that i have a double pleasure in what i am now doing first i hope i am serving you and secondly disappointing a man who richly deserves some mortification from me you know not how i enjoy the thoughts of his amazement when he hears his intended wife and intended mistress have so accidentally had a rencontre  pardon me my dear for the expression it can only cast a reflection on the wicked seducer his vile intentions you have nothing to do with he is a wild good for nothing moital nor have i ever believe me regretted his not claiming my hand which i give you my word would have been to no purpose i shall choose to bestow it on a worthier object i do assure you but ring your bell if you please it is late and we must set out early tomorrow as i mean to get home in the evening  is she not a delightful woman sophia  i obeyed and the waiter entered  tell the person who came with me said i i shall be glad to speak to her  she made her appearance a moment after but to give you an idea of her astonishment on seeing my companion is utterly impossible i could hardly keep my gravity  your young lady said lady mary has been so good as to say she will oblige me by steeping in my room to night you may carry her things there my maid will show you the way  madam my lady  i  i  in your room did your ladyship say  i  fear  that is i   o fear nothing i will take as much care of her as you can do i am rather a coward and dare not sleep alone you may go we shall follow you presently order my woman to bring lights  sophia never was there a more comic scene the creature was ready to ink into the earth  the style in which my kind friend spoke to her the easy manner as if she took it for granted she could have no objections so wholly disconcerted the few ideas nature had given her that she could make none  never mortal looked so soolish she had nothing for it but to sneak off and obey taken so entirely unawares so unprepared for such an event what could she do she was utterly confounded and unable to say one word either for or against the plan so left us to enjoy her perplexity which we certainly did not a little  soon after her ladyships woman came to let us know our apartment was ready  she too looked amazed but said nothing in the entry we found watson accompanied by the servant who had attended us from london and also the postillion as i passed she attempted to stop me  miss miss pray let me speak one word for heaven sake do  john  richard  cannot your  i wish  they stood gaping but made no answer  i slid by saying she could have nothing to tell me but what i could hear as well in the morning and with trembling steps scarce able to support myself hurried up stairs  it was evident she had made this effort to prevent me and certainly might have made a very disagreeable bustle had her auxiliary troops seconded her motion with spirit but happily for me they did not they had i presume received no orders from their master on the subject who with all his art and cunning had not i fancy foreseen that such an accident might happen perhaps too though so greatly his inferior in some things they might be no less superior in others and scorned to be farther concerned in so treacherous an affair  in short my dear sophia every thing fortunately succeeded to our wish next morning we left the house without interruption  watson was not even visible i gave every thing i had been obliged to receive from her to one of the servants charging her to deliver them into her own hands and with a joy you can have no conception of drove to this hospitable this delightful mansion where i meet with every possible attention and respect  my only distress now is the displeasure of my dear father and aunt could i but obtain their forgiveness my heart would be at peace lady mary has kindly promised to intercede for me i mean to write again she is to write also ah sophia pray with me her eloquence may not plead in vain this alone is wanting to complete my felicity  adieu my dear friend you shall hear from me again when these important letters are dispatched and then have a more particular account of my generous protectress there cannot be a more amiable creature  ah the deceitful the cruel sommerville is unworthy of her she knows it now better than ever she detests him for his perfidy to your poor emily and i need not i hope add i too look upon him as the basest of men thank heaven i have happily escaped all his snares may he before it is too late see his errors and repent  i go now to write to my father and aunt should their answers be propitious i shall be once more your truly happy as well as affectionate  emily herbert  letter xxxiv lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire london never never charles was there so unfortunate a fellow as i am at this moment by heavens i could curse my very existence for being such a confounded fool duped by an artful witch i have acted the part of a consummate villain i have injured insulted the best the most estimable of her sex and have deservedly lost her for ever yes she must look upon me as the most detestable the most unworthy of mankind but here i swear by all that is sacred i will be nobly revenged that fiend in the shape of lady stanley shall not escape with impunity dearly shall she be made to rue the effects of her diabolical plotting or my wits shall sail me  oh charles i am undone ruined all my hopes of happiness for ever destroyed by that vile harpys contrivance my emily my lovely my engaging gentle emily  must at this moment execrate the very name of her repenting truly penitent sommerville i am now astonished at my stupid credulity how was it in nature i could believe so scandalous so improbable a story her very looks every word every sweet expression the dear girl uttered  her letters which i like a mean despicable traitor saw by such unjustifiable means all all might have told me it was false  in those artless innocent letters she calls me a monster charles too justly might the lovely injured creature look upon me in that odious light no never never while i have breath shall i recover my own good opinion how then dare i can i hope to regain hers and yet without that blessing life must be a torment  but let me endeavor to be more explicit that you may comprehend me and you will then confess i have but too much cause for these exclamations  my adorable emily not wholly void of suspicion i now know to my cost lest me accompanied by watson as i mentioned to you we had agreed upon the very next day to my utter confusion i received the following letter from my friend major mansell judge if you can of my emotions on reading its dreadful contents  had this reached me a few days sooner it might have saved me from endless remorse and i might now have been supremely blessed in the possession of my angel emily for angels are not more pure more spotless  ah charles i ought never to have entertained a doubt of it but my conscience tells me i was unworthy to call such excellence mine  read mansells letter and then say is there any punishment i can contrive equal to crimes of that hagg lady stanley  my dear sommerville  i think i know you too well to believe my succeeding your lordship in the good graces of the fair widow gave you one moments uneasiness or that it could possibly weaken your friendship as a proof of mine accept this letter which i wish from my soul may come time enough to prevent those infamous effects which an injured a jealous woman intended to produce by arts she practiced with but too much success  i had long suspected the indifference she affected on your quitting her for the amiable the much injured miss herbert was merely put on to conceal the pangs it gave her it was unnatural to imagine a conquest like lord sommerville could be resigned with so much ease you cannot have forgot how often i have said i doubted her ladyships sincerity i have now most incontestable proofs of my penetration  you know i was on a pretty intimate footing with her before you left us she has attractions my lord and knows how to set them off to advantage as well as any one of her sex i had no serious views in the devoirs i paid her she could not but know it i have therefore nothing to reproach myself with  i often talked of your lordship i wished to discover her real sentiments as i suspected them and did all in my power to throw her off her guard i partly succeeded and was fully convinced by her own confession though she did not i believe mean to be quite so explicit had i not artfully drawn her on by my questions and appearing to admire her spirit that the lovely emily was carried off by her contrivance  my manner of treating the affair gratified her vanity and she was weak enough in the course of several conversations i had with her on the subject not only to own it but to triumph in the success of her cruel plot laughing at the fellow who had been her dupe and the reward he had met with for his heroic achievement  i also found she had formed hopes of drawing you again into her lure having thus robbed you of her charming rival this it is true she had too much pride to acknowledge in direct terms but i more than surmised it from several unguarded expressions she occasionally dropped  you my dear sommerville returned unsuccessful after having made every possible inquiry in order to discover the wretch who had injured you in so flagrant a manner you had searched in vain and it appears her hopes of regaining your heart were no less so she could not conceal her mortification at the disappointment even from me  you soon disappeared a second time  little did i dream lady stanley was the secret spring that occasioned your sudden departure  but of this too i have by mere accident discovered such evident proofs as almost amount to certainty  going a few days ago to call upon her i found she had walked out but had ordered the servants in case i came before she returned to say she should be at home presently  accordingly i went up to her dressing room to wait for her meaning to amuse myself with a book till she arrived i saw none on her toilet and began looking about in hopes of finding one her cabinet stood open i fancied i might meet with one there several letters and loose papers lay scattered up and down and there they might have lain in perfect sasety for me had not my eye caught the name of miss herbert on one of them all things considered i think my curiosity was pardonable  i took it up  but guess my surprise when i found it addressed to your lordship as coming from the fellows housekeeper who had carried off your lovely emily  i hastily took a copy which i enclose that you may be enabled to judge whether you ever received such a one  if so we cannot doubt her being the author as it is in her ladyships own hand writing though she would hardly send it to you without being susficiently disguised or more likely get some other to write it for her  one of the two you may depend on for how else could she come by such a wicked abominable scrawl  true  it might never have been sent one can hardly believe any woman could be capable of such an infernal scheme but this your lordship will be able to clear up to yourself  i would gladly hope she did not carry her malice and revenge quite so sar and if she actually did that you would give no credit to the horrid story since in that case i fear the amiable miss herbert in regard to whom i am told your intentions before her unfortunate adventure were perfectly honorable may have sunk in your lordships esteem  whether the wretch really did treat her with indignity  whether he was brute enough to take advantage of her unhappy situation having her thus in his power i cannot say  but this vile forgery is at least no proof of it  it is suspected the lovely girl is now yours my lord but this wants confirmation her friends i hear have not yet been able to trace her steps or to discover who it was that delivered her from morton however by the description he gives of the person they guess it is your lordship  but if so why does she not appear  this question i ask and can only account for it by supposing what i am very unwilling to believe  by our past friendship my dear sommerville let me entreat the favor of hearing from you and if possible clear yourself from suspicions which pain me to entertain i know you are not faultless more than myself the very best of us are not so but surely my lord you would respect the virtue of a young lady so truly deserving your tenderness and protection  pardon the freedom of these reflections in consideration of the motives which induce me to trouble you with this letter that it may fully answer my well meant purpose is the sincere wish of your lordships affectionate friend and most obedient servant  f mansell  taking it for granted you have now charles read my friends distracting letter let me ask what punishment you think sufficiently severe for the author of all this misery  i need not remind you of my receiving the cursed scrawl of which he found the copy you know it  and know also i was dolt idiot enough to give credit to the vile tale and also the fatal the unpardonable effects of my too easy credulity  ah charles they have for ever destroyed my peace i now when too late find my injured much injured emily is dearer to me than life that to call her mine honorably mine is so necessary to my happiness that i think i shall not have patience to endure the insipidity of my existence without her  and yet what hopes remain none i am afraid she cannot but despise my conduct ignorant as she is of the cruel deception that had been practiced and conscious of her innocence i must appear a brute  well might the angelic girl call me monster had i not obtained the promise of her dear hand were we not on the point of being for ever united by the most sacred ties what had she done then to produce so horrid a change in my sentiments  ah nothing nothing  i am absolutely more than half distracted charles and cannot proceed though i have still much to tell you and much you will wonder i am certain at the strange event i am going to relate you will confess it is one of those unaccountable accidents which one can hardly conceive happen by chance  yet so it certainly was  the account watson gives whom i had nearly put to death in my first transport of rage and disappointment is as follows   at the inn where my emily was to sleep the first night of her journey whose carriage do you think charles was the first object the stupid animal saw standing in the yard and which she well knew as she had seen it often nor was she ignorant of my engagement with its owner  no other than lady mary cravens  to be sure my lord i had no notion of what would happen  how should i cried she when attempting to justify herself  i knew her ladyships woman and thought there could be no harm in chatting to her a little and please your honor i am sure i said nothing that could discover my business there nor did i know miss herbert was acquainted with her ladyship nay for that matter she certainly was not for her maid told me so  what you mentioned her name then and told her she was with you cried i in a rage  oh dear my lord  indeed indeed i  i  that is i only  go on interrupting her scarce able to contain my indignation  why my lord when miss rang her bell and ordered me to attend which i supposed was to conduct her to her bedchamber who should i find sitting in the very same room with her but lady mary your honor may well think i was very much surprised and knew not what to say or do  i have prevailed on miss herbert said she to sleep in my apartment to night just for all the world please your lordship as if they had been the most intimate friends go carry your ladys things up stairs my woman will show you the way  these were her ladyships very words my lord i stood like a fool to be sure for what could i say  i never was so slustered in all my days at last however i did venture to say something though i hardly know what but her ladyship cut me short by repeating her orders so i was obliged to obey  when come a little to myself i ran to john and richard and bid them stand by me and i would try to prevent her getting up stairs  i trembled every joint of me as i waited their coming  but it was all to no purpose miss some how or other slipped by me though i once had hold of her gown too and they stood looking on never so much as putting out a hand to help me or daring to speak a word  and so please your honor next morning they were both gone in her ladyships carriage before i was up and one of the maids delivered me all her things that is the trunk and the key and to be sure i found every individual thing in it except the clothes she had on  confess charles this is a very extraordinary event  most unaccountably so how in the course of a few hours  nay less she could contrive to introduce herself to an absolute stranger to interest her so much in her favor yet who could behold the sweet creature with indifference to contract such an intimacy such a friendship  i am bewildered perplexed  and what is worse feel all the horrors of reorse and despair  i absolutely cannot upport the torment of her thinking me  villain  and how justify myself granting i could by relating facts mitigate my offenses how attempt seeing her in the presence of her new friend how appear before her had she fallen into any other hands i might have found courage for it despicable as i must be in her dear eyes but here it is impossible  i have deserved some reproaches also i am sorry to fay from her ladyship  ah how will my character be torn to pieces between them what a subject for their teteatetes could my evil genius have been more perverse than in thus bringing the only two women acquainted i wished might never meet there is a whimsicallity in it charles which were i not half mad with vexation would force a smile  let me now say a few words of that serpent that worse than witch that diabolical widow  i cannot give it up charles i must be revenged  help me if you ever wish i should know one moments rest help me to contrive the means  poison would be too merciful no i wish to torment to mortify to humble her in the most abject manner try what you can do for me but at present i can only think of my lost my adorable emily  mine did i say ah charles  yet she might have been mine  she had promised it  that reflection drives me mad  farewell sommerville  letter xxxv miss herbert to miss fermer ten thousand thanks to my dear sophia for her obliging congratulations on all my troubles being happily over  they are nearer being so my dear friend than you yet know you say you have not a doubt of my being soon restored to the favor of my family you are not mistaken i have received the tenderest letter imaginable from my aunt who gives me hopes my dear father will pardon all the trouble i have involuntarily occasioned him nay does now pardon me but cannot yet so far succeed as to gain my mothers permission for me to return home  this circumstance gives much pleasure to my generous friend who had pressed me not to leave this place and if obliged to go for a while insisted i should return and if possible spend some months with her finding how matters were at my fathers and that of course i was to go to my aunt she has wrote in the most polite and pressing terms to beg she will spare me to her for some time i think she will not refuse some flattering a request  and now sophia let me tell you though it will shock you as much as it has me to find man can be so very base so wholly lost to every sense of honor i find lord sommerville is more guilty more treacherous than even i till now believed him though alas there needed no further proos to render him in my opinion completely worthless  would you believe it sophia my aunt tells me she never received the letter i wrote her and to which i received so cruel an answer  how mean how horrid to stoop to such artifice  it is now evident he got possession of it and in order to facilitate his vile schemes wrote the answer himself which gave me such infinite pain and distress that to you no doubt shared the same fate since you wrote me word you never received it  good heaven sophia that a man so apparently amiable and generous so very superior to the generality of his sex should under those engaging appearances conceal so bad a heart so despicable a character  ah how thankful am i our intended union did not take place misery must inevitably have been the consequence what else could have followed though for a while i might have been deceived soon too soon i doubt not he would have thrown off the mask and your poor emily would have been completely wretched  have i not then infinite cause to thank the merciful interposition of providence for delivering me from so dreadful a fate and also for procuring me so amiable a friend as i find in my generous my kind protectress  my dear lady mary informs me te greatest friendship had subsisted between her father and the late lord sommerville that an alliance between the families had for many years been an object on which they had both set their hearts that in an affair of the utmost importance here is had conferred a very essential obligation on his friend this he could no otherwise repay than by confirming the promise he had before given that his son should since his lordship did him the honor to wish it either give his hand or forseit half his estate which in that case should be settled on the lady to this her father objected  but in vain it was the only return he could make he said and should his son be so blind to his own interest and happiness as to refuse fulfilling the engagement a thing he had no reason to fear he thought in settling his fortune in this manner he inflicted but too mild a punishment for his folly and ingratitude  her ladyships father died before she had attained her fifteenth year she then accompanied her aunt who still lives with her abroad  lord sommerville died some years after his son who was then on his travels was sent for home but arrived too late as his father had breathed his last what his sentiments were on finding the clause i have mentioned fully ratified she can only guess by his conduct which pretty clearly informed her he had no inclination to perform the stipulated engagement  one thing i had almost forgot which is that they are second cousins and that sommerville succeeded to the estate he now enjoys in consequence of its being entailed on the male heir otherwise it would have devolved to lady mary so that strictly speaking he is not to forfeit any part of it but which is nearly the same thing is to pay to her an equivalent sum of money  these in as few words as i could give you them are the particulars of that affair he has never been more attentive to her than even cold good breeding requires and happy it is her ladyship never beheld him with any degree of partiality she wished him to reject her yet would not inform him of her sentiments merely that she might have it in her power to punish him for his irregularities well knowing he is highly povoked at being thus fettered  her own fortune is very considerable nor does she mean to augment it by the sum she is on his rejecting her hand to receive from him had he proved himself more worthy she assures me she intended resigning her claim but since he is such a libertine she proposes accepting the money and settling it on a young gentleman his lordships nearest relation who is uncommonly amiable and deserving but whose family estate by the extravagance of his predecessor is reduced almost to nothing  this sophia is her generous intention nor is it possible to find an objection to it the artful the designing sommerville will after all in his estate possess but too much for the base purposes in which he employs it  lady mary has a great share of vivacity and often diverts me when talking of lord sommervilles embarrassed situation and the astonishment he must have been in on hearing of our first meeting and that i am now actually resident with her  it was certainly a very droll accident sophia as could possibly happen yet nothing of the mavelous neither as her house is within a few miles of that to which i was going  i am delighted to find by my aunts letter that wretch morton is in a fair way of recovery since base as he has proved himself i should have been shocked beyond expression to have been the cause of his death she tells me when he is able to travel he is going abroad and of course has no farther thoughts of persecuting me  thus you see my dear sophia my troubles are really nearly over not entirely indeed since i cannot be perfectly happy while my poor father is thus governed by a tyrant and not at liberty to show me that indulgence to which his heart inclines him but he has so long been accustomed to obey without a murmur that i trust he is not so sensible of his disagreeable situation as i am  lady stanley she also says is flirting away at a great rate with major mansell and seems wholly to have forgotten the inconstant sommerville and by the manner in which you find i speak of him i hope you will see plainly all your kind fears are groundless  no no sophia partial as i once was to him believe me i am so no longer nor is it in nature he ever should regain that place in my esteem he has so justly forfeited be under no apprehensions therefore on that account nor fear that i shall find any difficulty in expelling his image from my breast it is already done sophia and were i even to see him again which i sincerely wish i never may be assured it will be with all the indifference you can possibly desire one may pity but to love an unworthy object knowing him to be such must i think be an impossibility  i have not yet sophia said half i ought to have done in regard to my amiable friend but hitherto i have had so many other subjects which i wished to acquaint you with that she must and i am convinced would readily excuse me did she know i had been guilty of this apparent neglect and ingratitude  my dear lady mary then is about two and twenty tall and elegantly formed her face though not perfectly beautiful has yet an unspeakable sweetness of expression which many who from having merely a regularity of features are styled so have not her eyes are particularly fine her teeth uncommonly so in short to me she is an exceeding fine woman and for understanding real wit and vivacity i have never met with her equal add to this she is mistress of every fashionable accomplishment and has the most melodious voice i ever heard in my life  such is the woman whose hand lord sommerville declined accepting or rather properly speaking declined paying his addresses to for it is by no means clear he would have obtained it if he had now it is most certain as she tells me her heart has long been engaged to another to whom she would ere now have been united had she not made a point of waiting a decent time to see how his lordship would proceeed  but i will wait no longer said she to me yesterday as we were talking on the subject my resolution is unalterably fixed i will now make it my business to know his it is not usual for ladies to make the first advances nor should i in any other circumstances i might no doubt marry without consulting him but i feel a wicked pleasure in the thoughts of the dilemma into which i shall throw him by desiring his final determination  ah my dear lady mary is it in nanature he should one moment hesitate  oh very possible my dear of that i think he has given me pretty convincing proofs but thank my stars all men do not see with his eyes i purpose writing to him his answer will no doubt afford me some diversion and not a little will he be amazed as well as puzzled when he has the felicity to receive my epistle he no doubt flatters himself i shall in hopes some twenty years hence he will relent and take me live quietly a spinster till that joyous hour arrives  woefully does he deceive himself if he has any such ridiculous idea in a few days i hope to present my intended caro sposo to you emily you shall then judge whether it is possible i am likely to be such a fool  and now a word or two of her ladyships aunt mrs selby and i have done there cannot be a more worthy or more agreeable woman she doats upon her charming niece who has for many years been entirely under her care is highly pleased with the object on whom she has placed her affections and is no less impatient than he is to have the affair finally concluded to me she behaves in the kindest the most friendly manner indeed my being a favorite of lady marys was quite sufficient to insure me a gracious reception from her  i have every reason to think her ladyship has conceived a very sincere regard for me the unhappy situation in which she first found me greatly interested her in my favor and since she has as she obligingly says known me better she finds me worthy her tenderest friendship and esteem and hopes our attachment will not only be mutual but lasting as our lives  nothing she smiling assured me the other day could possibly weaken it on her side except my robbing her a second time of her lover  as to sommerville i pardon you emily said she but should you presume to captivate lord neville not all those bewitching smiles shall save you from the effects of my wrath and indignation  farewell my dear sophia i shall be ever your affectionate friend  emily herbert  letter xxxvi lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanleyplace what a couple of bungling fools have i had to deal with caroline my revenge is but half completed and i could curse them for their stupidity  would you believe it the girl has after all my trouble escaped from them both and that too in triumph the first was too great a coward to accomplish my purpose and the other though i doubt not his intentions were favorable as i could wish yet by his ridiculous delicacy respect and such stuff has succeeded no better he however cannot know morton was such an idiot unless he has been dastardly enough to confess it in hopes to screen himself from farther vengeance and this i think cannot be as they have never met since the damsel was rescued by the valourous arm of sommerville who of course believes the story i wrote him in the name of the honest housekeeper  she has now as i said made her escape from him too but never never will you guess by whose means  only lady mary craven the very woman to whom he has for years been engaged to give his worthless hand  true as you are alive with her she is at present and there i pray heaven she may remain for i could not so far command myself as to see her with patience my only consolation is i have kept them all in a pretty decent bustle for some time past and i think put a final stop to her being lady sommerville  should he after all be foolish enough to think of such a thing  her gratitude to her benefactress to her new friend must be an unsurmountable bar to a lady of her refined romantic sentiments so i have done with the whole set and shall now find some other way to amuse myself  mansell yesterday while at dinner with me received letters from london one of them seemed to give him particular pleasure to tell you the truth i fancied it might be from some favorite fair one and jokingly told him my suspicions  he kept me some time in suspense not a little flattered i suppose at the symptoms of jealousy i had discovered at last however he gave it me to read and i found it was actually from sommerville acquainting him a friend of theirs the duke de saint clair whom they had both known in paris and from whom they had received a thousand distinguishing marks of attention was then in town had visited most parts of the kingdom and meant soon to set out on another tour the reason of his writing was to inform mansell the duke had made many obliging enquiries after him and finding it would not be far out of his road intended calling upon him he therefore thought it not amiss to give him notice of his graces design that he might be prepared to receive him and to show him every thing worth notice in this part of the country  and pray what kind of mortal is this fame duke young or old handsome or a fright rich or poor  nay laughing half these questions at a time would be more than my memory could retain pray begin again  pho how horridly stupid why old or young then come try if you can answer me that  neither about two or three and thirty will that suit you just my age  dont be impertinent mansell i care not a straw though he were as old as  what do you call him i give you my word  well now to your next question let me see what was it o handsome or a fright  why to this too i must reply as before  neither  ah shocking i will lay my life he is some queer figure some awkward ill made animal before i see him  now for the last and not least important rich or poor  aye as you say that circumstance may help to decide in regard to his other perfections out with it  rich as a sew then immensely rich and sprung from   no matter who interrupting him we are too wise in england and know too well the value of money to trouble our heads about family we leave that silly pride to those poor souls who have nothing else to boast of  well what think you of him smiling  oh charming is it possible i should not think him so  one question your ladyship has quite forgot  pray what may that be i know full as much about him already as i desire  what no spark of curiosity remaining to be informed whether he has a heart and hand to bestow  why what a jealous wretch thou art mansell no positively then i will not ask any such matter lest i should hear of your dangling in your garters before tomorrow and i do not want to be haunted by your ghost it is quite sufficient that i am so by your impertinent self so pray make yourself easy  this same duke should he keep his word caroline may afford us a little amusement i should rather say we must contrive to amuse him as he is a stranger which comes all to the same thing  to tell you the truth i begin to sigh for a little variety and have thoughts of going to some watering place the women hereabouts are a parcel of formal odd beings and pretend to give themselves airs truly as for the men i am tired of them there are too few one hates to see the same faces perpetually i shall stay however till i see what kind of a creature this same duke turns out i fancy by what i can gather from his friend mansell his riches are his greatest recommendation and no bad one neither let me tell you  adieu  sommerville is not expected here for some time  so much the better i have now for ever done with him  yours arabella stanley  letter xxxvii miss herbert to miss fermer lady mary has received a polite answer from my aunt with her ready consent to my staying as long as it is agreeable to her ladyship adding she is highly flattered by her very obliging request she also sophia writes in the kindest manner to me so that i really am now the happiest creature imaginable every thing i meet with here conspires to make me so and to banish the horrid remembrance of past sorrow from my recollection the whole now appears like a frightful dream and as such i endeavor to drive it from my memory on which it has neverthess made too deep an impression ever to be entirely erased  lord neville arrived here a few days since accompanied by a particular friend a sir henry cardigan the former is one of the finest figures i ever saw and his manner equally pleasing he seems to adore lady mary who is no less partial to him one may hope therefore they will though in high life be a truly happy pair which i am afraid is by no means a common case in the fashionable circle  her ladyship has wrote to lord sommerville  i would give worlds you could have seen her letter but it was impossible to ask a copy nor could i do it justice by attempting to repeat its contents no other woman i am persuaded could have acquitted herself so well on so awkward an occasion lord neville is impatient for the answer as on that depends his happy day  she cannot forgive lord sommerville for proposing to me a private marriage since avarice could alone be his motive no doubt he hoped thereby to evade the clause in his fathers will but had he entertained for me that regard she is pleased to say i merit that circumstance ought to have had no weight  ah sophia there is too much truth in her remark i was a very very weak creature not to see his conduct in the same light i now do perhaps there might be some little excuse for me young and inexperienced as i was but my aunt surely sophia she ought to have  yet this is ungenerous it is an ungrateful return for her well meant compliance she could only have my happiness in view but let me drop the humbling the mortifying subject never again shall his detested name sully my paper nor should i have mentioned him now had it not been to tell you of the letter he has by this time received should he at last consent to accept her ladyships hand which i need hardly add she has no thoughts of giving him he will thereby prevent the loss of that money on which it is plain he sets so great a value if he declines it it is her own and as i told you before she purposes bestowing it on a more deserving object lord neville so far from disapproving this generous design declares if possible it raises her in his esteem and renders her more dear to him  thus sophia we are on the point of having a wedding at which i am to figure as bridesmaid and the amiable sir henry as my companion on the happy occasion by the bye i have not treated that gentleman well i had nearly finished my epistle without saving one word about him though were i to say all in his praise they tell me he deserves i might fill another page or two how true the eulogium i cannot judge on so short an acquaintance all i can at present affirm is that he is uncommonly engaging and his person very elegant he has been unfortunate i hear in a first attachment which has left a kind of melancholy on his spirits which interests one sirangely in his favor lady mary has set me the task of removing his dejection says she is otherwise employed and therefore leaves him wholly to my care adding there is a sort of similarity in our situations and of course i must feel for him how far they are similar i know not being yet a stranger to the particulars of his in my next i may perhaps be able to inform you  i must now my dear friend bid you adieu  they send for me we are going to have a little concert and i am to accompany her ladyship on the harpsichord i told you i believe she sings like an angel another summons  adieu  yours ever emily herbert  letter xxxviii lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanley place our formidable beau is arrived and would you believe it after the account mansell gave me is actually handsome much more so than with his more important attractions was by any means necessary as for his graces understanding that is neither here nor there he is a duke caroline and were he an idiot i have too much sense myself to quarrel with him for that  it will not i presume surprise you much to hear i as usual engross his whole attention can i possibly help it if the fellows will be perverse enough to prefer me to the mortified colchester beiles it was much the same case in london and i have accordingly been most joyously hated in both places  poor mansell i believe wishes him at the devil and heartily repents introducing him but there is no help for that neither what would you think if i should a second time give up my liberty for the sake of being madame la duchess heavens what a glorious triumph over sommerville would it were in my offer but i dare not expect it for fear of a disappointment yet he is certainly struck with me nay even mansell though much against the grain has assured me he has been making a thousand enquiries  says he never beheld so fine a woman so much of the easy french vivacity  so much wit  in short so many attractions that he fears he shall not be able to escape the fascinating power of my charms  much of this caroline i must set down as parisian gallantry yet saying it of me is more flattering than to me  not that he is wanting in the latter for his whole conversation is made up of compliments he has sense enough it is plain to know his forte he would not shine much i believe on any other subject but that is a trifle and you know nonsense is eloquence in love  we were last night at the assembly every eye was fixed upon us i danced with him  to be sure he made no very brilliant figure on the occasion  well enough however for a duke  a stranger to our country dances too by the bye i forget who it is that asserts for a fact that fools can never excel in that accomplishmenth  do not set his grace down on that list neither i beseech you not quite so bad as that though no soloman  this morning we had a party on horseback he was in raptures  swore nothing could excel the elegance of my figure the grace the ease with which i managed the animal it is a mercy i am so perfect a mistress of the french language or i should lose a thousand flaming speeches for he cannot express himself well in english i have promised to teach him on condition he will prolong his stay but he fears it will not be in his power having promised to meet a friend who is to proceed with him in his intended tour  this is rather against me caroline to be sure and perhaps mansell too may out of revenge for he is jealous as the very devil whisper a few anecdotes in his ear that may damp the ardour of his passion this evening i am to have a concert and supper at my own house there is no time to lose you see  if i can succeed caroline how i shall enjoy the delightful thoughts of sommervilles astonishment i vow this is my principal motive for wishing i could gain so important a conquest he may then perhaps see the folly of prefering an insignificant girl to me besides i die to see paris  see it to be sure i may whenever i please but to make my first appearance there with so much eclat and so much splendor  adieu i must go and dress may all the graces lend me their aid on this occasion and i will be their most obedient servant ever after  yours arabella stanley  letter xxxix miss herbert to miss fermer the expected answer is arrived sophia i may perhaps before i close this be able to get permission to take a copy of it which you shall have in the mean time i will only tell you sommerville has set her ladyship free  in the most graceful and delicate manner a thing of that nature was capable of he has declined the honor of her hand  lord neville has now prevailed upon his adored lady mary to fix the day which is to make him he says the happiest of men and i believe he says true this day fortnight she has agreed to give him her hand in the mean time preparations of every kind are going on with the utmost expedition and all is joy and festivity  even sir henrys spirits are much more cheerful than they were this her ladyship is pleased to attribute to me but i cannot take the merit of it sophia though i confess i have obeyed her injunctions to the utmost and he appears grateful for my attentions i play to him ling to him and frequently walk with him before the rest of the family are stirring for we are early risers his conversation is highly entertaining there is a softness a gentleness in his manners which is extremely pleasing  do not be silly now sophia and infer from what i have said a thousand ridiculous things i will at once convince you you are mistaken by telling you the cause of that melancholy to which he has so long been a prey and you will confess there is little chance of his ever forming a second engagement with any of our sex  a young lady of large fortune saw him at scarborough about three years ago she fell desperately in love with him and tried every possible means to attract his attention but in vain she was not it seems remarkably handsome though agreeable and highly accomplished every one saw the conquest he had gained and many wondered how he could resist the temptation of so great a fortune that alone was none to him his own was abundantly sufficient to satisfy his ambition they met again in london still his behavior was merely polite and such as every woman of fashion is entitled to from a man of breeding she was taken extremely ill  the doctors declared her in the utmost danger nothing they could prescribe gave her the smallest relief she repeatedly said she wisned not to live life was insupportable to her that she looked for death as for her dearest and only friend this astonished and shocked her doting mother  in short sophia she at last confessed it was her hopeless passion for sir henry which had reduced her to the condition in which she then lay  mrs johnstone instantly sent for him and plainly told him her distress that her daughter was infinitely dearer to her than life besought him if his heart was not already engaged to another to take pity on her loved julia her fortune was very considerable her temper the most amiable her family and connections such as would do honor to any man  the generous cardigan was deeply affected he had no attachment and was persuaded he could not but be happy united to a woman who had given such striking proofs of her partiality though he felt for her no other sentiments than those of esteem and friendship these reflections induced him to comply with her wishes and those of her despairing mother this information soon restored her to health  in a short time they were married and she was the happiest of women sir harry too perfectly satisfied with his condition from the pleasing reflection that he had by the sacrifice he had made rendered her so  sophia my dear sophia blushing for my sex i write it this very woman in less than a twelvemonth eloped with an ensign in a marching regiment fled with him to france soon in her turn forsaken by her worthless gallant she gave in to every kind of excess and about a year and a half ago she died an object of pity and wretchedness in paris i leave you to make your own reflections on this dreadful story and shall only add you may now judge if after having experienced such misery in the married state though with such flattering prospects it is likely he should ever venture to confide a second time in any of our sex or trust his honor his selicity in their hands no no sophia be assured he never will adieu for the present  i will try what i can do to get the copy i mentioned  in continuation we are so perpetually and i may justly add so agreeably engaged sophia that it has not till now been in my power to finish my letter though it was begun some days since  we have been to a ball given by a family in this neighborhood the company not very numerous but what is much more to my taste in general pleasing and agreeable  sir henry before we set out asked for the honor of my hand  lady mary looked arch and smiled she whispered something i know not what though guessed it was in consequence of his request yet surely nothing could be more natural but the truth is her ladyship pretends to foresee what i prophesy will never happen ah sophia we have both susfered too severely already from the source at which she hints that he esteems me i have not a doubt that he is pleased with the attention i pay him and is grateful for it i am exceedingly sensible and who can see him and not seel themselves interested in his happiness  but what has all this to do with love  nothing it would he hard sophia it one could not see perfections in a man nay have a very sincere a very tender friendship for him without having also sentiments of that nature  i feel the attachment of a sister for him and am sully persuaded that of a brother is all he does or ever will experience for your emily  what i now tell you is a fact you may depend upon it lady mary laughs at me when i talk to her on the subject and says i am a sly girl and know more of the matter than i choose to consess  in vain i declare the contrary  sir henrys cyes have let her into the whole secret she says and she daily expects his tongue will follow their example  as for you emily cries she i take it for granted you have made a thousand vows never again to trust the faithless sex it would no doubt be highly ridiculous having sound one amongst them perfidious and of course poor sir henry can have nothing to expect  is it not so child  pretty nearly and really sir henry must have a greater portion of faith than a man ought to have if he has not also made a few resolutions on the subject  my life for it he has said her ladyship laughing but i will take any bet they are not such as you would persuade me you imagine them to be but here he comes so adieu i leave you to settle the important point by yourselves  and away she tripped though i made signs for her to stay  as he entered i felt a blush on my cheeks why heavens knows since he certainly could not tell he had been the subject of our conversation at least i hoped so though i had soon reason to fear he had overheard part of it as he came in by what he said  and what is the important point we are to settle said he tenderly taking my hand if it is one in which i am any way concerned i know no person on whose judgment i could so firmly depend as in that of the lovely miss herbert  what is the resolution the charming emily is so positive i have formed  ah replied i smiling though a good deal disconcerted it is not i may safely say that you will not be a listener sir henry but i will punish you by not gratifying your curiosity  then you must permit me to guess again taking my hand and if my conjecture is right i may venture to pronounce you are deceived whatever resolution i may have formed i feel it will not long be in my power to keep it  here sophia to my infinite satisfaction our teteatete was interrupted by the entrance of lord neville i slipped away and came up to finish this epistle perhaps you will think the last page contains more interesting matters than the first  i know not sophia nor can i with certainty say whether i wish what i have just related will bear the interpretation i well know you will put upon it i will consider it more at leisure and once more bid you adieu  emily herbert p s you must be content without the copy of the letter i hoped to have got for you lady mary is so much engaged i could not think of giving her the trouble of looking for it nor am i quite certain it is a proper request  suffice it to say his lordship has managed the point with a better grace than we expected  the pretense he urges for declining the honor of her hand is that his heart is irrevocably attached to another of course unworthy her ladyships acceptance she has only therefore to command him and shall find him ready to fulfill the engagement to which he is bound by his fathers will wishing her every possible happiness with a more deserving object  ah sophia a more unworthy one she can hardly meet with    letter xl same to the same my dear sophia my aunt has just wrote me a most wonderful piece of news  yet i know not why i should look upon it in that light neither since her ladyships beauty at least whatever her other perfections may do is sufficiently attractive for even a conquest of this flattering nature  lady standley i mean  a parisian duke my dear of immense fortune too he came it seems to spend a few days with major mansell  saw her  was captivated  and has actually made proposals whether they have met with a gracious reception my aunt is not certain but i can hardly doubt of it her vanity alone i think will induce her to be propitious nay few women i fear could resist so brilliant a temptation  a duchess sophia  virtue you see is sometimes even rewarded in this life  lady marys day of days as you call it draws very near this is monday on friday next she has promised to reward lord nevilles patience heaven grant they may be happy as they deserve to be you beg me to tell you minutely every thing that passes between the engaging sir henry and your emily you have taken it would seem a prodigious fancy to him sophia  shall i or shall i not gratify your curiosity i think i will as i know it is not of the impertinent kind know then that i begin to believe he spoke the truth when he said i was mistaken in a certain conjecture i had formed if he ever has vowed to revenge the injury he has received from one of our sex by slighting all the rest i suspect he begins to repent of his intended cruelty at least he evidently makes your emily an exception for to her he devotes his whole time and most pleasing attention  and now let me observe it is either a mistaken notion to affirm we can only once in our lives experience a serious attachment or i certainly never yet did so and when i compare my present sentiments with those i felt for that wretched man who so ill deserved my partiality i am of opinion i deceived myself and that the terrors of being compelled to give my hand to one my heart abhorred made me the more readily believe the other had made an impression on it my aunt too so averse from the one match and so very anxious for the other  in short sophia i will be ingenuous should the amiable sir henry really entertain any such design as lady mary and indeed i myself am rather of opinion he does i feel it will not greatly displease me  but am i honest my dear sophia in speaking thus coldly on the subject i fear not yet till one is quite certain you know it is at least prudent  ah sophia you would absolutely adore him he is exactly the original of that picture you have so often drawn for the man who alone could have power to engage your affections and is not your friendship and mine founded on a similarity of sentiments judge then whether it is possible i should behold him with indifference  farewell  i had no design when i sat down to write so long a letter all i meant was to tell you of lady stanleys conquest  yet like a silly weak creature as i fear i am i have told you things infinitely more interesting i do not repent however and am yours  emily herbert  letter xli lady stanley to mrs grosvenor stanleyplace could i have patience to delay for a few days i should no longer have addressed you as the comparatively insignificant lady stanley but in the character of madame la duchess de saint clair very true caroline so make up your mind to bear this event without envy no very easy matter let me tell you but it is the wisest thing you can do since what i now say is a fact  a something has ever whispered me i was born to make a distinguished figure in life talents like mine were not given to be hid in a napkin is not that the phrase caroline  no matter i do not mean to conceal them i have before said how astonished how delightfully amazed will sommerville be his dulcinea too who presumed to dispute his heart with me let me repeat the joyous intelligence caroline in a few days nay before this can possibly reach you i shall be no more but madam in duchess may perhaps condescend to let you know what is become of me  i have consented to accompany his grace in his intended tour pity to disappoint him you know seeing a little more of the world is not amiss nor will he be the worse for it if as they say it tends to improve one  no violent passion on my side you are a witness since i am not quite blind to his imperfections  no  but i can shut my eyes which comes exactly to the same thing  ah he comes he comes the conquering hero comes i fly on the wings of ambition to meet the lord of all my wishes and such he is for what can any reasonable woman wish for more than to be decorated with a ducal coronet  his carriage is at the door  yours for the last time  arabella stanley  letter xlii major mansell to lord sommerville the happy knot is irrevocably tied sommerville  but she will poison us both i believe for the tricks we have played her yet i can hardly hold my pen for laughing  i had even the impudence to stand father on the occasion and give her away  his grace ha ha ha his grace i say behaved through the whole farce infinitely better than i expected for though a brazen dog yet he is as ignorant as the devil  how she could be so easily duped is beyond my comprehension yet every thing was carried on so plausibly the letter you sent me telling me of his intended visit on purpose for her ladyships inspection was an excellent stroke it had all the effect you could desire  i saw she instantly formed her plan of conquest  he came  i said nothing of introducing him to her  willing to prevent suspicion the motion should come from herself she gave many broad hints  but for two whole days i would not understand them  at last she plainly asked me saying she thought she could not do less than show some little attention to a stranger of his rank  how i kept my countenance the lord knows nothing could have given me the power of doing it but my desire to revenge the irreparable injury she had done you and faith sommerville we have succeeded to a miracle i accompanied his grace to her house she was adorned for conquest so that he was caught by the first glance of her eye she saw it and did her utmost to secure her captive from that moment he was her most devoted slave and flattered her as never woman was flattered this covered all his defects  in short he had not been here above a week when he made honorable proposals she faintly objected to their short acquaintance  this obstacle he contrived to remove  she now as her friend consulted me i replied her ladyship could alone judge of what was likely to make her happy  no doubt in point of rank and fortune the offer was unexceptionable but i had hoped her heart was otherwise engaged  meaning to myself  pho pho scarce able to conceal her joy we have played the fool long enough mansell it is high time we should grow wise  i acquiesced affecting however to put on a mortified look  the day was accordingly fixed a license obtained and as i have already told you i had actually the face to lead her to the altar and give her away  his grace was all rapture and her grace no less delighted i believe though she did not so very plainly discover her transport  i spent the evening with the happy pair and at a proper hour left them  how to describe the next days scene is absolutely out of my power  indeed you may swear i did not think proper to be a witness i had not courage or impudence for that call it which you please but his graces two servants  alas his no longer  gave me a few of the particulars i had given them their instructions and they implicitly followed them  about one oclock next morning they both went to her house and finding the happy couple were sitting most sociably togeter at breakfast marched in without ceremony and richard being the best orator of the two his hat in one hand and scratching his head with the other said i suppose you have done with us now mounseer and we may take back the carriage and horses to our master you know his lordship said he could not lend them to you for above ten days or a fortnight and you have had them almost twice that time already not that i believe his honor will be angry seeing as how you have married so fine a lady  i hope however before we go you will please to give us something to drink yours and madams health  her grace astonished and enraged at their behavior and believing they had drank too much already was still more so on finding the duke bore with so much patience their unparalleled insolence  for heavens sake my dear lord duke rising terrified from her seat  turn those abominable wretches out of the room how can you suffer them to approach you in that condition  why what offense pray returned richard we only came civilly to tell him we were going home with the carriage to our master he knows we ought to have been at home before now  the fellows mad cried she almost frantic for his grace still kept silent who is your master what lord are you a talking of get out of my presence this instant or i will order you both to be thrown out at the window  what lord why lord sommerville to be sure mercy on us has not mounseer there told you all about it i beg pardon if i have said any thing amiss  i thought for sartain your ladyship must have known that you had married my lords valee de chamber i am sure we all knew he came down here on purpose and borrowed the horses carriage aye and us too to make a figure with  heaven and earth what is it i hear and instantly overpowered by the shock fell lifeless on the floor  his grace now rung for help dismissed the fellows and what followed i know not farther than that she had set off in a post chaise and four early next morning leaving him master of the premises and as her lawful husband i should imagine he has a right to enjoy all the profits arising from them i have not seen him since having been obliged to go to norwich on particular business that very day where i shall remain probably a week or more so expect to hear from you before i return to the regiment  you may well believe the whole country will be in a fine buz about her ladyships adventure nor is there one soul i may venture to pronounce who will not rejoice in her disgrace the airs she gave herself added to some other matters had rendered her odious to every mortal hereabouts to the women particularly as for us fellows that is another affair  where she will bend her course heaven knows but i fancy she will never figure in this part of the world again perhaps she is gone to paris in order to look after his graces property there while he condescends to superintend here is in england ignorant as he is of most things i will lay my life he contrives to receive her rents and to spend them too but all this is mere conjecture for ought i know to the contrary he may by this time have gone after his bride  i presume your lordship cares as little about the matter as i do we have done her business pretty effectually and she may now make the best she can of her bargain perhaps richard may have been able to give you some of the particulars i have related more distinctly than i have done he being a witness nay a principal in the denouement of the plot adieu dear sommerville i hope you find your too just ndignation pretty well appeased  yours sincerely j mansell p s to complete your lordships triumph what think you of inserting the following paragraph in the morning post  a few days ago was married by a special license the right honorable lady stanley to monsieur courrois valet de chamber to lord sommerville    letter xliii miss herbert to miss fermer well my dear our wedding is over  my friend lady mary is now the happy the adored wife of her amiable neville  this is the first leisure hour since the joyful event i have been able to dedicate to my sophia nor have i time at present to write much as we are to have half a hundred people to dine with us and i am not yet dressed we have balls and concerts out of number as will be the visits we shall have to return but those once over i hope we shall settle for a while though not very long i believe as my lord is impatient to conduct his lovely bride to his own seat where she insists upon it i must accompany her her aunt will remain here  i have not yet given my answer nor can i till i hear from mine which i expect to do every hour having already wrote to her on the subject my dear father is out of the question he seems to have given me quite up but too well i know it does not proceed from want of tenderness  i hope a time will come in which i may receive from his own lips pardon for all the trouble and uneasiness i have given him  sir henry  what of him cries my kind sophia  why my dear i think i may now venture to say my company has in a great measure made him forget his past misfortunes  he has in the most engaging manner assured me the possession of my hand and heart is alone wanting to render him the happiest of mankind  and what answer did i make you ask sophia  ah my dear friend could i believe this and one moment hesitate impossible in my own mind i mean  no necessity for being quite so hasty in acknowledging my real sentiments though i fear he guessed them  in fine he by some means or other obtained my permission to write to my father lady neville is almost as much delighted with the prospect of your emilys felicity as she was with her own  the post this moment arrived  a letter for me  i must lay down my pen till i read its contents  in continuation good heavens sophia what a story is here i am utterly confounded amazed beyond all possible conception  it cannot be  she is she surely must be mistaken never since i was created did i hear such a history no my dear i shall never so far get the better of my unspeakable astonishment as to be able to tell you  lady stanley  lord bless me i know not where to begin the duke i wrote to you about some time since proves to be an impostor this is not all  before it was discovered he had actually married her but what appears to me the most inexplicable of the whole is he is said to be valet to lord sommerville and had borrowed his masters carriage servants etc etc to carry on the abominable deception  this part of the story i cannot possibly give credit to  would she not have known again both one and the other yet that is a silly objection since if it really is so he would no doubt take care to send none she had ever seen but what in the name of wonder could induce him to have any hand in it it is this i cannot fathom what had she done to deserve such a punishment from him how had she offended i am perplexed confounded and know not what to make of it my aunt too is on the spot so that there must be some foundation for it one would think were it not so very improbable  lady neville calls me i will return in a moment   it is certainly a fact sophia her ladyship and all my friends below are in no less astonishment than myself they were reading the news papers and actually met with the story there which was the occasion of their sending for me down we are all now in the greatest consternation and would give worlds to know the whys and wherefores of the matter for it is those we can make nothing of  bad as his lordship is we can hardly conceive he could take part in such an infamous transaction unprovoked and i never heard she had given him any reason for resentment he had a pretense for his vile conduct to me though such as no man of honor would have looked upon as a justifiable one he no doubt excuses it to himself by pleading the violence of his passion as those libertine creatures all do i suppose but here we can find no earthly cause for what he has done if it is true that he actually is guilty but this i say bad as he is i cannot believe  the fellow must have made use of every thing without his knowledge in short the more i think of it the more i am bewildered so i must leave the affair as it was  one thing i had almost forgot and no wonder her ladyship no sooner found how she had been deceived than she set off in a post chaise and four nobody knows whither taking only her woman and one man servant with her his grace is left master of the mansion house  how long he means to occupy it or what he intends to do next no soul can guess  adieu i have scribbled till i have scarce left time to dress  yours e herbert  letter xliv same to the same read the contents of the enclosed my dear sophia and you will find a full explanation of the mystery contained in my last i will not anticipate nor add even one of the thousand reflections i have made return it by next post and believe me yours in a violent hurry  emily herbert the enclosed letter to miss herbert madam colchester in justice to lord sommerville i take up my pen  a story you would probably hear of in which his lordship bears a considerable share must to those ignorant of his motives set him in no very favorable point of view i am far from justifying his conduct in regard to miss herber it will admit of no apology no one can more severely condemn it than myself every man of honor of delicacy must hold it unpardonable forgive me madam for presuming to recall circumstances to your remembrance which must be painful all i mean is to lay open a scene of treachery practiced but too successfully against him by the most artful of women which i hope will convince you he is not quite so culpable as you have hitherto had but too much cause to believe him and also excuse the revenge he has taken on his greatest enemy an enemy who has for ever destroyed his peace of mind and every possibility of happiness  that happiness wholly depended on the amiable miss herberts esteem and he has for ever lost it he knows he confesses the justice of her resentment and though rendered the most wretched of men submits with resignation to the punishment inflicted on him  know then miss herbert that woman is no other than lady stanley it was myself who made the discovery of her baseness envious of your virtue and superior attractions she wished to reduce you to her own level but heaven ever watchful over the innocent preserved you from the snares she had laid and she now suffers very severely for her crimes  she it was madam who by her arts persuaded mr morton to carry you off from lord sommerville for whom she had then as warm an attachment as a a mind depraved as here is is capable of her motive was not only to revenge herself on you for robbing her of his affections but she also hoped to regain them when he found you were lost to him for ever in this as well she might she was deceived miss herberts charms had made too deep an impression to be so easily effaced  more enraged than ever she next forged a letter as from a servant at mr mortons while you were confined in his house which she sent to his lordship telling him you were there and expressing the most sincere sorrow for the insults and brutal treatment you had received from her vile master in short to spare your delicacy the shock of hearing more of its horrid contents imagine if you please the worst so wicked a woman could invent  lord sommerville enraged and distracted with this intelligence having no suspicion of the fraud and believing the infamous story instantly set off for the place of your confinement and rescued you as you know from the power of the man who forcibly detained you  i wish i could as fully justify his lordship in what followed as i trust i have thus far  but i attempt it not it is impossible he is deeply sensible of it himself the punishment he has inflicted on the worthless lady stanley i need not relate mrs grenville has no doubt given you the particulars but it was only in my power or that of his lordship to explain his reason for arrogating to himself that prerogative and he would not presume to take so great a liberty i am fully persuaded give me leave to assure you upon my honor he is even ignorant of my having done it  faulty nay unpardonably so as he has undoubtedly been i yet cannot but pity him from my soul when i consider the inestimable treasure he has lost in losing the lovely the amiable miss herbert ah he too is indeed sufficiently punished  pardon my engrossing so much of your time and believe me with the most perfect esteem and respect madam  your most obedient humble servant j mansell     letter xlv miss herbert to miss fermer well my dear sophia  our curiosity you find is at length fully gratified  what think you of the artful the horrid lady stanley your astonishment no doubt equalled mine surpass it it could not  was there ever do you think another so complete a wretch in female form i would gladly hope not  the amiable sir henry was much alarmed on reading the majors letter i saw his color change as he perused it and his eyes frequently turned on me  was it possible he could really for a moment fear my resentment was over because his friend had proved he was not quite so great a villain as i had believed him  or rather made an attempt to prove it for in fact i do not find him much less so than he was before her ladyship being so very vile a creature does not excuse him whatever he might by her arts be persuaded to believe it is impossible to justify him  nay i think his base his ungenerous behavior to me afterward was infinitely the more unpardonable  was he not sophia the most abandoned of mankind could he because he believed me so cruelly injured by another have wished to render me still more miserable  ah no no  none but a libertine like himself could have been capable of forming so execrable a design  well may he despair of regaining my esteem  heaven forbid i should be so lost to every sense of honor and delicacy as to be able to beslow it on so unworthy an object  lady mary as well as myself observed sir henrys emotions  ah cried she smiling poor sir henry has now no chance he may even take refuge on the nearest friendly willow he can meet with to be sure our emily cannot be so cruel as to refuse her pardon to his lordship you see he is not quite so black as his friend would persuade us and we foolishly believed him she is too good a christian i hope not to forget and forgive besides you find he repents most seriously  ah lady neville spare your raillery do not torture me by  nay sir henry interrupting him i i beseech you spare me you surely pay me a wretched compliment while you suppose it possible i can ever feel any sentiments but those of horror and contempt for so worthless a being  could i ever look upon him in a more favorable light i should little merit that friendship and esteem with which you honor me  i believe sophia i looked rather grave  he threw himself at my feet and respectfully taking my hand cried never my adorable emily will i rese from this humble posture till you have smiled forgiveness i ought indeed to have known my angel better i blush for my folly but a true passion is ever apprehensive only say you pardon me and tell me i have not wholly forfeited  come come emily put the creature out of his misery i am too happy myself not to wish every mortal equally so looking on her amiable husband who seized her hand and pressed it with fervor to his lips come say something civil and set his simple heart at rest  it must then be on condition sir henry does me more justice for the future than to believe i can ever be so blind to my own felicity as to prefer any man to him much less the worthless one who has caused his present perplexity  he flung his arms tenderly round me and before i could possibly disengage myself pressed me to his breast with looks which plainly spoke his gratitude  that is a good girl you have really made me a handsome speech considering it was extempore and since we are all friends again suppose i make a proposal which i think will contribute not a little to keep us so  oh by all means not dreaming what it was to be i give you my word there is nothing i desire more  well then emily suppose  suppose now you were to do the very genteel thing and tell us you will before the end of this week  let me see  this is wednesday  aye just so  before the end of this week give your hand to   ah my dear lady neville endeavoring to interrupt her how can you be so very silly  i felt my face in a glow sophia and stopped  sir henry flew to her joy sparkling in his intelligent countenance thus on my knees let me thank my kind my good friend for her generous interposition then rising and taking my hand can my lovely emily refuse to oblige the amiable lady neville say my dearest creature you will comply with her request and make me the happiest of   stop i beseech you sir henry positively i will not be so taken in her ladyship is very sly how could i evr imagine this was her fine proposal if i had can you believe i should so readily have agreed to hear it  oh not for the world to be sure laughing at my foolish attempt to justify myself and to say truth sophia it was sufficiently so but i was horridly disconcerted who could ever have fancied such a wicked thing but now having so clearly acquitted yourself to the satisfaction of all whom it may concern suppose as i was saying you should name tomorrow  tomorrow exclaimed i  oh next day then  pray lady neville and pray miss herbert but we will not differ about trifles so to end all disputes let it be saturday  in short sophia by some means or other she actually carried her point and on saturday next bless me my dear friend what am i to do no preparations made mercy on me i had a thousand things to think of a thousand things to settle  she says all that will be an amusement hereafter  it is so in the common style to lay in a stock of finery as if a girl was afraid when once married she should never get another new gown again as long as she lived  i should have told you sir henry has received most gracious answers both from my father and aunt i wished much to have had them both present at the ceremony but the former had there been no other impediment is at this time laid up with the gout and as for the latter lady neville jestingly says one old fidgeting aunt is enough at a time and she will lend me hers  the truth of the matter is mrs grenville earnestly begged to be excused but is extremely desirous of seeing us as soon as possible afterward  so the important affair was settled this very morning  wednesday  thursday friday  only three days  good heaven my dear sophia is it actually possible sir henry assured me of it not an hour ago and can i now for the first time begin to doubt his veracity  affectionately yours emily herbert  letter xlvi lady neville to miss fermer your friend emily was on the point of taking up her pen to tell you she was married last saturday i happened to pop into her room at the very instant and foreseeing she would make but a poor hand of it with her tremors trepidations and so forth took it quietly from her sent her down to her sir henry resolved to acquaint you with it myself  as to my being quite a stranger to miss fermer that obstacle we flatter ourselves will soon be removed as we hope to call in upon you in the tour we are going to make and by that means i shall be so no longer in the mean time you must fancy the visit over and it is perfectly the same thing  do you comprehend me  well and so on saturday as i was saying the dear girl was married  some folks now who have happier talents would fill half a dozen pages having such a theme but i see nothing wonderful in it  she so lovely he so discerning   as soon as we are ready we shall set off for her fathers it is proper i under whose roof this affair has been transacted should present sir henry you know lest they should accuse him of running away with her without my leave  then away we march to show him to her aunt  next to you but you pray observe are to pack up your very best bib and tucker as we mean to take you with us so pray dont fail to be ready  when we leave our aunt we proceed to my lords seat stay there till i have looked about me a little set matters to rights as a notable wife ought to do find a thousand fauts turn off half a score of his favorite domestics etc etc to show i know who is mistress and that he has not married a raw ignorant girl  well after that sir henry takes us all to his chateau trembling no doubt for the example i have set his gentle emily when she has in her turn played the wife there for a few days we whisk up to london and buy finery of course are presented show ourselves at every public place meet with universal admiration and then return to the country where having composed our features into a proper degree of gravity we commence wives in sober downright earnest  that very amiable creature lady stanley alias madame la duchess has wisely taken herself out of the kingdom some say to france and his grace having consulted a lawyer and finding he is bona fida lord and master of all she has left behind her makes himself easy and is resolved she shall seek him before he goes in quest of her how they will end their days the deponent says not  there child there is all the news i am mistress of dont forget the part i have assigned you and believe me  yours m neville  letter lvii lord sommerville to charles dalton esquire dover charles i have actually seen her  seen my enchanting my still adored emily  seen her the wise of another and yet i live  in the opposite box at the playhouse i beheld the lovely creature infinitely more so if possible than ever  i had heard of her being married only a few days before but for the care and watchful attention of sedly who was with me when i was informed of it and who has never quitted me since i should certainly have shot myself through the head  i was mad distracted and i have him to thank for not being guilty of some desperate action  when i saw her he forcibly held me for i was absurd enough to attempt flying to her  happily he made me quit the house  happily i say for with confusion i write i have injured the dear angel too much already ever to wish to distress her farther  i returned home in an agony that i think would even have excited pity in her dear breast ordered my things to be packed up late as it was and actually set out that night for dover from whence i write these lines while waiting for the packet  never never more will i subject myself to the inexpressible torment of seeing her again but will quit england for ever that i may not run that hazard  now my dear dalton for the last time while resident in my native land do i bid you adieu and am your unhappy but sincere friend  sommerville  finis
