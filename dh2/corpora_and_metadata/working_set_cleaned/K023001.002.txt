portrait of alexander pope mr pope kneller pinx      parr sculp    mr popes literary correspondence volume the second  with letters to and from lord summers lord harrington lord parker bishop atterbury judge powys mr dryden mr secretary harley mr secretary addison matthew prior esquire mr steel etc   london printed for e curll in rosestreet covent garden mdccxxxv  to the reader we presume we stand not in need of any more apology to the reader for this publication than we did for the last for we hereby declare that mr pope ep pt and rs are all out of the question  mr curll is the sole editor of this volume and it is what the former was a collection of what has been printed and a compilation from original manuscripts but not stolen either from twickenham wimpole or doverstreet but at the last place while mr pope was dangling and making gilliver and cooper his cabinetcounsel away goes mr curll on the   th day of june in the year of our lord god      and by the assistance of that celebrated artist mr rijsbrack takes a full view of our bards grotto subterraneous way gardens statues inscriptions and his dog bounce an account of some of them are hereunto subjoined and a prospect of mr popes house from the surrey side will be shortly exhibited in a very curious print engraven by the best hands  we have not any thing farther to add in this place mr curll himself having opened the work and fully made good his promise to the lords of being a match for mr pope in prose and he may really say in regard to all the attacks which have been made upon him by this petulant little gentleman especially the last veni vidi vici  philalethes londini    julii die natali      to mr pope sir that great philosopher and honor of the english nation the lord chancellor bacon see his essay on deformity gives it us as his opinion that deformed persons are commonly even with nature for as nature has done ill by them so do they by nature being for the most part as the scripture says void of natural affection and so they have revenge of nature certainly there is a consent between the body and the mind and where nature erreth in the one she ventureth in the other  ubi peccat in uno periclatur in altero but because there is in man an election touching the frame of his mind and a necessity in the frame of his body the stars of natural inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of discipline and virtue therefore it is good to consider deformity not as a sign which is more deceivable but as a cause which seldom fails of the effect whosoever has any thing fixed in his person that does induce contempt has also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn therefore all deformed persons are extreme bold first in their own defense as being exposed to scorn but in process of time by a general habit also it stirs in them industry and especially of this kind to watch and observe the weakness of others that they may have somewhat to repay again in their superiors it quenches jealousy toward them as persons that they think they may at pleasure despise and it lays their competitors and emulators asleep as never believing they should be in a possibility of advancement till they see them in possession so that upon the matter in a great wit deformity is an advantage to rising kings in ancient times and at this present in some countries were wont to put great trust in eunuchs because they that are envious toward all are more obnoxious and officious toward one but yet their trust toward them has rather been as to good spyals and good whisperers than good magistrates and officers and much like is the reason of deformed persons still the ground is they will if they be of spirit seek to free themselves from scorn which must be either by virtue or malice and therefore let it not be marvelled if sometimes they prove excellent persons as was agesilaus zanger the son of solomon aesop gasca president of peru and socrates may go likewise amongst them with others  his lordship observes that these men were instances of the most exalted virtue but i wish i was not obliged to say that you are a precedent of the most depraved vice for a demonstration of which i shall regularly proceed viz  you very well know sir that in the year      when the courtpoems  viz the bassettable the toilet and the drawing room were published upon your sending for me to the swantavern in fleetstreet in company with mr lintot and enquiring into the publication of that pamphlet i then frankly told you that those pieces were by mr joseph jacobs a dissenting teacher given to mr john oldmixon who sent the same to be published by mr james roberts in warwick lane and that my neighbor mr pemberton and myself had each of us a share with mr oldmixon in the said pamphlet for this you were pleased to treat me with half a pint of canary antimonially prepared for the emetic effects of which it has been the opinion of all mankind you deserved the stab my purgation was soon over but yours will last without a timely repentance till as the ghost says in hamlet with all your imperfections on your head you are called to your account and your offenses purged by fire yet notwithstanding your behavior to me in turning this matter into ridicule and making me the subject of several of your libels all which i have equally despised i made you an offer of reconciliation though you yourself was the aggressor evidenced by my letter of the   d of march last   you were by me acquainted that you had disobliged a gentleman the initials of whose name were pt who to show his resentment was resolved to publish a large collection of your letters to this you thought fit suitable to your former behavior to return me a very impertinent and false answer in the grubstreet journal daily journal and daily post boy that you believed the whole to be a forgery and should not trouble yourself at all about it in the last of which papers on the  th of april i gave you a full reply to which it was not in your power to rejoin what steps were afterward taken in this affair i shall impartially relate  pt from whom i had not heard in two years before wrote me a letter that you should soon be convinced of your mistake and being indisposed himself appointed rs to be his agent an account of which whole transaction i have laid before the public in the initial correspondence see the  d volume of mr popes letters etc printed by mr curll   on the   th of may last i published the said collection of your letters and on the same day upon your being told by a gentleman who saw you in the court of requests at westminster that it was pretty plain the letters published were no forgeries you very pertly replied so much the worse but this by the bye sir was owning them to be genuine  upon your complaint to some lords bolingbroke attainted oxford impeached etc vid your epistles whom you make patrons to the abuse of others it was owing that the books were seized and not to the advertisement which was but the shoeinghorn to your groundless resentment against me but you have met a second defeat before that most august assembly as you did in your first attack relating to the duke of buckinghams works  therefore confess you have a tartar caught be once sincere and frankly own your fault you say sir it will be but justice to you to believe that nothing more is yours than what you have owned notwithstanding all that has been published in your name or added to your miscellanies since      by any bookseller whatsoever your booksellers ab origin are indeed pretty numerous viz j tonson w lewis who sold your essay on criticism to b lintot l gilliver b motte a printer j brindley o pain t boreman and c corbet all hereditary bookbinders to whom you sold by agency your sober advice from horace as will be proved notwithstanding you are resolved still to deny it   awake dear poet leave all meaner things to low ambition and the pride of kings let us since life can little more supply than just to look about us and to die expatiate free  o while along the stream of time thy name expanded flies and gathers all its fame say shall my little bark attendant sail pursue the triumph and partake the gale and shall thy verse to future age pretend thou were curll s enemy but now his friend that urged by thee he turned the tuneful art from sounds to things from envy to the heart for wits false mirror held up natures light and proved the air of lying it would have a better air in him curll to own the printing as well as publishing of mr popes letters etc but he the said curll was of a different opinion was not right that virtue only makes our bliss below and all our knowledge is ourselves to know see the beginning and end of the essay on man  but to return sir you say i was first threatened and afterward punished for printing the court poems see the notes variorum on the dunciad page     pray who gave you the authority of punishing remember only that now is my turn to punish and if i have not the spleen of a warpt poet or a scots medicaster i will find some other prescription that shall once more as shakespeare says harrow up your soul  to believe nothing is yours but what you own would be merely ridiculous did you not deny the dunciad for seven years did you not offer a reward of three guineas by an advertisement in the postman to know the publisher of your version of the firstpsalm and when you were informed did you ever pay the premium did you not publish the worms yourself and leave out the foecundifying stanza and do you own any of these in the preface to the second volume of your works in short sir your conduct as to your poetical productions is exactly of a piece with what i once met with at the old bailey a most flagrant offender was put upon his trial for a notorious theft and by his egregious shuffling he put mr recorder lovel into a violent passion sirrah says he you have got a trick of denying what you ought to own and of owning what you might as well deny an please your honor quoth culprit that is the way not to be hanged however impudent jack was tucked up by a fresh fact proved upon him that very sessions  thus if with small great things may be compared kind fate at length may wait on thief and bard as to the publication of your letters a state decypherer has assured me that by a transposition of initials the plot is unravelled ex gr pt is trickster pope rs is silly rascal to sell imperfect books and then cry out whore first pray most sincere sir how could either pt or rs come by the letter i wrote to you if ap rs and pt were not all of a clan risum teneatis amici  who was it played the gardener sure it could not be honest searle mr popes gardener at twickenham  in lopping some branches inoculating others and transplanting a large shoot from one of your letters to mr cromwell and graffing it upon mr walshs stock  refrain the path that leads to evil tell the plain truth and shame the devil ananias and saphyra felt the divine vengeance for one lie what then do your confederates expect or justly ought to dread for so many as have been told about the publication of your letters  the plot is now discovered lawton gilliver has declared that you bought of him the remainder of the impression of wycherleys letters which he printed by your direction in      and have printed six hundred of the additional letters with those to mr cromwell to make up the volume  yet still it must be given out that a nobleman has been robbed and his innocent servant must be discarded to support your most flagrant falsehood this sir is eating shame and drinking after it therefore if you have any remorse of conscience take dr arbuthnots last advice study more to reform than chastise and begin with making yourself the precedent  let various painters kneller richardson jarvas rijsbrack and my sign painter draw your outward part but human pencils cannot show the heart i shall take my leave of you at present and only acquaint the public under your cover that this volume contains the remainder of your correspondence with mr cromwell and your submission to mr dennis some other pieces which if you speak truth you cannot deny though as yet you have not had the candor to own every thing herein attributed to bishop atterbury is genuine and the performances of the other gentlemen will subsist by their intrinsic merit  i have large materials toward a third volume and if sir notwithstanding our present bickerings you will be so kind to favor me with any assistance it shall be gratefully acknowledged by  sir your humble servant e curll ps my bookbinder j jackson in pall mall told me he had your leave to sell the pyrated edition of your letters for which reason neither he nor dodsley shall sell mine once more  yours etc ec    mr alexander pope debtor to mr edmund curll to an advertisement in the postman      promising three guineas to discover the publisher of his version of the first psalm     0 to a promise of ten pounds on producing one of bishop atterburys letters  0 0 0 to discover the publishers of mr popes letters    0 0 total      0  all these articles i have made good and therefore think myself justly entitled to the promissory rewards abovementioned  a fitter couple sure were never hatched some married are indeed but we are matched e curll  a true narrative of the method by which mr popes letters have been published it has been judged that to clear an affair which seemed at first sight a little mysterious and which though it concerned only one gentleman mr pope is the son of a trader and so is mr curll  par nobile  is of such a consequence as justly to alarm every person in the nation would not only be acceptable as a curiosity but useful as a warning and perhaps flagrant enough as an example to induce the legislature to prevent for the future an enormity so prejudicial to every private subject and so destructive of society itself  this will be made so plain by the ensuing papers that it will scarce be needful to attend them with any reflections more than what every reader may make  in the year      edmund curll bookseller published a collection of several private letters of mr pope to henry cromwell esquire which he obtained in this manner  mr cromwell was acquainted with one mrs thomas to whom he had the indiscretion to lend these letters and who falling into misfortunes seven years after sold them to mr curll without the consent either of mr pope or mr cromwell these letters were a free gift so that there was not any occasion to ask the consent of either of those parties mr curll purchased them as justly as mr lintot did the copy of mr popes homer etc  see the letters in the preface to vol i  this treatment being extremely disagreeable to mr pope he was advised to recall any letters which might happen to be preserved by any of his friends particularly those written to persons deceased which would be most subject to such an accident many of these were returned him  some of his friends advised him to print a collection himself to prevent a worse but this he would by no means agree to this is a notorious falsehood for it will be proved that the books sold by rs to mr curll were printed at mr popes expense  however as some of the letters served to revive several past scenes of friendship and others to clear the truth of facts in which he had been misrepresented by the common scriblers he was induced to preserve a few of his own letters as well as of his friends these as i have been told he inserted in two books some originals others copies with a few notes and extracts here and there added in the same books he causes to be copied some small pieces in verse and prose either of his own or his correspondents which though not finished enough for the public were such as the partiality of any friend would be sorry to be deprived of  to this purpose an amanuensis or two were employed by mr pope when the books were in the country and by the earl of oxford when they were in town  it happened soon after that the posthumous works of mr wycherley were published in such a manner as could no way increase the reputation of that gentleman who had been mr popes first correspondent and friend and several of these letters so fully showed the state of that case that it was thought but a justice to mr wycherleys memory to print a few to discredit that imposition these were accordingly transcribed for the press from the manuscript books abovementioned  they were no sooner printed but edmund curll looked on these too as his property for a copy is extant which he corrected in order for another impression interlind and added marginal notes to in his own hand this is another falsehood mr curll only gave a copy of this pamphlet to rs to show pt that he had reprinted those letters which came out in      and corrected the errata therein   he then advertised anew the letters to mr cromwell with additions and promised encouragement to all persons who should send him more falsehood the third mr curll defies any man living to produce any such advertisement   this is a practice frequent with booksellers to swell an authors works in which they have some property with any trash that can be got from any hand or where they have no such works to procure some curll has in the same manner since advertised the letters of mr prior and mr addison a practice highly deserving some check from the legislature since every such advertisement is really a watchword to every scoundrel none can be more a scoundrel than the writer of this narrative as the many falsehoods detected in it will prove in the nation and to every domestic of a family to get a penny by producing any scrap of a mans writing of what nature soever or by picking his masters pocket of letters and papers  a most flagrant instance of this kind was the advertisement of an intended book called gulliveriana secunda where it was promised that any thing which any body should send as mr popes or dr swifts should be printed and inserted as theirs  by these honest means mr curll went on increasing his collection stupid impertinence what has mr curll to do with dean smedleys book called gulliveriana or with the conduct of any other person nor was mr curll any ways concerned in printing gulliveriana  and finding as will be seen hereafter a farther prospect of doing so he retarded his edition of mr cromwells letters till the   d of march       and then sent mr pope the following letter the first he ever received from him a greater favor than mr pope deserved at his hands   sir to convince you of my readiness to oblige you the enclosed is a demonstration you have as he says disobliged a gentleman the initial letters of whose name are pt i have some other papers in the same hand relating to your family which i will show you if you desire a sight of them your letters to mr cromwell are out of print and i intend to print them very beautifully in an octavo volume i have more to say than is proper to write and if you will give me a meeting i will wait on you with pleasure and close all differences betwixt you and yours  e curll rosestreet    march      ps i expect the civility of an answer or message     the enclosed were two scraps of paper supposed to be pts a feigned hand the first containing this advertisement  letters of alexander pope esquire and several eminent hands from the year   0  to      containing a critical philological and historical correspondence between him and henry cromwell esquire william wycherley esquire william walsh esquire william congreve esquire sir william trumbull sir richard steel e o  mr addison mr craggs mr gay dean swift etc with several letters to ladies to the number of two hundred nb the originals will be shown at e curlls when the book is published  the other paper was a scrap of some letter in the same hand which expressed a dissatisfaction at curll for not having printed his advertisement  what more cannot be seen for the rest is cut off close to the writing  mr popes friends imagined that the whole design of e curll was to get him but to look on the edition of cromwells letters and so to print it as revised by mr pope doubtless that was mr curlls intent or he need not have acquainted mr pope with his design of printing a new edition  in the same manner as he sent an obscene book to a reverend bishop and then advertised it as corrected and revised by him falsehood the fourth one hundred guineas shall be paid to this narrativewriter if he can produce any such advertisement of mr curlls this is founded on a merry story and the fact as follows viz  mr henry hoare eldest son of sir richard hoare came to mr curll and told him that dr robinson then bishop of london heard he was concerned in printing an edition of the earl of rochesters poems mr curll told mr hoare that he was among other bookssellers and printers  viz mr darby in bartholomewclose mr bettesworth in paternoster row mr rivington in st pauls churchyard mr pemberton in fleet street etc concerned in an edition of that noblemans works but likewise told mr hoare that he would get a book interleavd for my lord bishop and whatever his lordship saw amiss if he would be pleased to strike out any lines or poems therein such leaves should be reprinted and rendered conformable to his lordships opinion away goes mr hoare overjoyed with this message from mr curll with a tender of his duty to the bishop and opens his credentials upon hearing which the bishop smiled and made the following reply to mr hoare sir i am told that mr curll is a shrewd man and should i revise the book you have brought me he would publish it as approved by me this no doubt mr curll might justly have done for whatever is not condemned is approved a standingmaxim this in civil canon and common law    or if there was any such proposal from pt curll would not fail to embrace it perhaps pay for the copy with the very money he might draw from mr p  to suppress it and say pt had kept another copy he therefore answered the only way he thought it safe to correspond with him by a public advertisement in the daily postboy  daily journal and grubstreet journal  e curll returned an impertinent answer it was universally allowed to be a very pertinent one in the same paper the next day denying that he endeavored to correspond with mr p and affirming that he wrote by direction but declaring that he would instantly print the said collection in a few days more he published the advertisement of the book as above with this addition  ec as before in the like case will be faithful  he now talked of it every where said that pt was a lord this is false ep is a nobleman pt is a scrub  or a person of consequence who printed the book at a great expense and sought no profit but revenge on mr pope who had offended him particularly that some of the letters would be such as both church and state would take notice of but that pt would by no means be known in it that he never would once be seen by him but treated in a very secret manner he told some persons that sifted him in this affair that he had conversed only with his agent a clergyman of the name of smith who came as he said from southwark with this person it was that curll transacted the affair who before all the letters of the book were delivered to curll insisted on the letters of pt being returned him to secure him from all possibility of a discovery as appears from a following letter  mr pope on hearing of this smith and finding when the book came out that several of the letters could only have come from the manuscript book beforementioned published this advertisement  whereas a person who signs himself pt and another who writes himself r smith and passes for a clergyman have transacted for some time past with edm curll and have in combination printed the private letters of mr pope and his correspondents some of which could only be procured from his own library or that of a noble lord and which have given a pretense to the publishing others as his which are not so as well as interpolating those which are this is to advertise that if either of the said persons will discover the whole of this affair he shall receive a reward of twenty guineas or if he can prove he has acted by for curll had said in his advertisement that he wrote to mr p by direction and another of his drawing up of mr popes life began thus by direction nb this was true e curll direction of any other and of what person he shall receive double that sum  whether this advertisement or the future quarrel of curll and smith about profits produced what followed we cannot say but in a few days the ensuing papers being the whole false it is not half see the initial correspondence hereto subjoined correspondence of pt and edm curll were sent to the publisher t cooper which we shall here lay before the reader  there appear but two letters from pt till one of april the  th which must be in      as it relates plainly to mr popes advertisement in answer to curlls letter to him of march   d  i april   i saw an advertisement in the daily advertiser which i take to relate to me i did not expect you of all men would have betrayed me to squire pope but you and he both shall soon be convinced it was no forgery for since you would not comply with my proposal to advertise i have printed them at my own expense being advised that i could safely do so i would still give you the preference if you will pay the paper and print and allow me handsomely for the copy but i shall not trust you to meet and converse upon it after the suspicion i have of your dealings with master p unless i see my advertisement of the book printed first within these four or five days if you are afraid of mr p and dare not set your name to it as i proposed at first i do not insist thereupon so i be but concealed by this i shall determine and if you will not another will it makes a five shilling book i am  your servant pt   ii sir i should not deal thus cautiously or in the dark with you but that it is plain from your own advertisement that you have been treating with mr pope   iii i still give you sir the preference if you will give me   l a score for   0 each book containing   0 pages  vo and pay down    l of the same the whole impression shall be yours and there are letters enough remaining if you require to make another  0 sheets   vo a five shillings book you need only answer thus in the daily post or advertiser in four days   ec will meet pt at the rose tavern by the playhouse at seven in the evening april   d and one will come and show you the sheets   mr curlls answers april         sir i have not ever met with any thing more inconsistent than the several proposals of your letters the first bearing date oct   th      gives some particulars of mr popes life which i shall shortly make a public use of in his life now going to the press  the second of your letters of nov   th      informs me that if i would publish an advertisement of a collection of mr popes letters in your custody the originals should be forthwith sent me and for which you would expect no more than what would pay for a transcript of em  in your third letter of the fourth instant you groundlessly imagine i have attempted to betray you to mr pope say you have printed these letters yourself and now want to be handsomely allowed for the copy viz   l a score which is   l more than they cost printing appoint a meeting at the rose on the   d instant where i was to see the sheets dealing thus as you truly call it in the dark  april    you put off this meeting fearing a surprise from mr pope how should he know of this appointment unless you gave him notice i fear no such besettings either of him or his agents that the paying of seventy five pounds would bring you to town in a fortnight would i be so silly as to declare it by your last letter of last night a gentleman is to be at my door at   this evening who has full commission from you  you want seventy five pounds for a person you would serve that sum i can easily pay if i think the purchase would be of any service to me but in one word sir i am engaged all this evening and shall not give myself any further trouble about such jealous groundless and dark negotiations an honorable and open dealing is what i have been always used to and if you will come into such a method i will meet you any where or shall be glad to see you at my own house otherwise apply to whom you please  yours ec for pt or the gentleman who comes from him at eight this evening  this appears to be the first time curll had any personal conference with r smith the clergyman  to the reverend mr  smythe sir i am ready to discharge the expense of paper print and copymoney and make the copy my own if we agree but if i am to be your agent then i insist to be solely so and will punctually pay every week for what i sell to you   answer to pts of may   sir you shall as all i have ever had any dealings with have find a just and honorable treatment from me but consider sir as the public by your means entirely have been led into an initial correspondence betwixt ec and pt and betwixt ap and ec the secret is still as recondite as that of the freemasons pt are not i dare say the true initials of your name or if they were mr pope has publicly declared that he knows no such person as pt how then can any thing you have communicated to me discover you or expose you to his resentment  i have had letters from another correspondent who subscribes himself ep which i shall print as vouchers in mr popes life as well as those from pt which as i take it were all sent me for that purpose or why were they sent at all  your friend was with me on wednesday last but i had not your last till this morning saturday  d may i am sir  yours ec ps what you say appears by my advertisement in relation to mr pope i faithfully told your friend the clergyman i wrote to mr pope to acquaint him that i was going to print a new edition of his letters to mr cromwell and offered him the revisal of the sheets hoping likewise that it was now time to close all resentments which on honorable terms i was ready to do i told him likewise i had a large collection of others of his letters which from your two years silence on that head i thought was neither unjust nor dishonorable      i cannot send the pts letters to curll letters now because i have them not all by me but either this evening or tomorrow you shall not fail of them for some of them are in a scrutore of mine out of town and i have sent a messenger for them who will return about three or four this afternoon be not uneasy i never break my word and as honorable and just treatment shall be shown by me i shall expect the same return  the estimate and letters you shall have together but i desire the bearer may bring me fifty more books pray come to night if you can  i am faithfully yours e curll for the rev mr smythe half an hour past ten  curll was now so elated with his success the books in his hands and as he thought the men too that he raised the style of his advertisement which he published on the   th of may in these words in the daily postboy  this day are published and most beautifully printed price five shillings mr popes literary correspondence for thirty years from   0  to      being a collection of letters regularly digested written by him to the right honorable the late earl of halifax earl of burlington secretary craggs sir william trumbull honorable jc general  honorable robert digby esquire honorable edward blount esquire mr addison mr congreve mr wycherley mr walsh mr steel mr gay mr jarvas dr arbuthnot dean berkeley dean parnelle etc also letters from mr pope to mrs arabella fermor and many other ladies with the respective answers of each correspondent printed for e curll in rosestreet covent garden and sold by all booksellers nb the original manuscripts of which affidavit is made may be seen at mr curlls house by all who desire it  and immediately after he writes thus to smith  may         sir your letter written at two afternoon on saturday i did not receive till past ten at night the title will be done to day and according to your promise i fully depend on the books and mss tomorrow i hope you have seen the postboy and by this it appears it was of curlls own drawing up which he denied before the lords this is false mr curll told the lords he copied the advertisement and returned the original this rs knows to be true approve the manner of the advertisement i shall think every hour a long period of time till i have more books and see you being sir  sincerely yours e curll for the reverend mr smythe  but the tables now begin to turn it happened that the booksellers bill for so it was properly called though entitled an act for the better encouragement of learning came on this day in the house of lords some of their lordships having seen an advertisement of so strange a nature thought it very unfitting such a bill should pass without a clause to prevent such an enormous license for the future and the earl of i  y having read it to the house observed further that as it pretended to publish several letters to lords with the respective answers of each correspondent it was a breach of privilege and contrary to a standing order of the house whereupon it was ordered that the gentleman usher of the black rod do forthwith seize the impression of the said book and that the said e curll with j wilford for whom the daily postboy is printed do attend the house tomorrow and it was also ordered that the bill for the better encouragement of learning be read a second time on this day sevennight by this incident the booksellers bill was thrown out this is likewise a flagrant falsehood   may         the order made yesterday upon complaint of an advertisement in the postboy of the publication of a book entitled mr popes literary correspondence for thirty years past being read mr wilford the publisher and mr e curll were severally called in and examined and being withdrawn  ordered that the matter of the said complaint be referred to a committee to meet tomorrow and that e curll do attend the said committee and that the black rod do attend with some of the said books    may    pt writes to curll on the unexpected incident of the lords to instruct him in his answers to their examination and with the utmost care to conceal himself to this effect  that he congratulates him on his victory over the lords the pope and the devil that the lords could not touch a hair of his head if he continued to behave boldly that it would have a better air mr curll was resolved not to put on that air of lying pt advised but told the lords strict truth which occasioned the breach not quarrel between them in him to own the printing as well as the publishing since he was no more punishable for one than for the other that he should answer nothing more to their interrogatories than that he received the letters from different hands that some of them he bought others were given him and that some of the originals he had and the rest he should shortly have pt tells him further that he shall soon take off the mask he complains of that he is not a man of quality as he imagined but one conversant with such and was concerned particularly with a noble friend of mr popes in preparing for the press the letters of mr wycherley that he caused a number over and above to be printed having from that time conceived the thought of publishing a volume of ps letters which he went on with and ordered as nearly as possible to resemble that impression but this was only in ordine ad to another more material volume of his correspondence with bishop atterbury and the late lord oxford and bolingbroke and he confesses he made some alterations in these letters with a view to those which mr curll shall certainly have if he behaves as he directs and every way conceals pt  we have not this original letter but we hope mr curll will print it which he has done in the initial correspondence with several others  if not it can only be for this reason that it preceeded their quarrel but one day mr curll knows of no quarrel but much roguery  it proves the letters of bishop atterbury lord bolingbroke etc cannot be in curlls hands though he has pretended to advertise them bishop atterburys letters etc are in mr curlls hands which he is ready to produce   the next day curll answers him thus  for the reverend mr smythe thursday   mane   th may      dear sir i am just again going to the lords to finish pope i desire you to send me the sheets to perfect the first fifty books and likewise the remaining three hundred books and pray be at the standard tavern this evening and i will pay you twenty pounds more my defense is right i only told the lords i did not know from whence the books came and that my wife received them this was strict truth and prevented all further enquiry the lords declared they had been made popes tool i put myself upon this single point and insisted as there was not any peers letter in the book i had not been guilty of any breach of privilege  lord delawar will be in the chair by ten this morning and the house will be up before three  i depend that the books and the imperfections will be sent and believe of pt what i hope he believes of me   the book was this day produced and it appearing that contrary to the advertisement false the advertisement did not say there were any peers letters in the book  there were no letters of lords contained in it and consequently not falling under the order of the house the books were redeliverd  at the same time curll produced and showed to several of the lords the foregoing letter of pt false again mr curll showed the letter at large not the extract herein recited which seems extraordinary unless they had begun to quarrel about profits before that day but after it it is evident from the next letter that they had an information of his willingness to betray them and so get the whole impression to himself this is false rs having before contracted with mr curll for  00 books and given him a receipt for  00 but delivered only   0 and those all imperfect   to the reverend mr smythe rosestreet past three friday    may      sir   i am falsely accused   i value not any mans change of temper i will never change my veracity for falsehood in owning a fact of which i am innocent   i did not own the books came from across the water nor ever named you all i said was that the books came by water   when the books were seized i sent my son to convey a letter to you and as you told me every body knew you in southwark i bid him make a strict enquiry as i am sure you would have done in such an exigency   sir i have acted justly in this affair and that is what i shall always think wisely   i will be kept no longer in the dark pt is will of the wisp all the books i have had are imperfect the first  0 had no titles nor prefaces the last five bundles seized by the lords contained but    in each bundle which amounts to   0 and  0 is in all but   0 books   as to the loss of a future copy i despise it nor will i be concerned with any more such dark suspicious dealers but now sir i will tell you what i will do when i have the books perfected which i have already received and the rest of the impression i will pay you for them but what do you call this usage first take a note for a month and then want it to be changed for one of sir richard hoares  my note is as good for any sum i give it as the bank and shall be as punctually paid i always say gold is better than paper and  0 l i will pay if the books are perfect tomorrow morning and the rest sent or to night is the same thing to me but if this dark converse goes on i will instantly reprint the whole book and as a supplement to it all the letters pt ever sent me of which i have exact copies together with all your originals and give them in upon oath to my lordchancellor you talk of trust pt has not reposed any in me for he has my money and notes for imperfect books let me see sir either pt or yourself or you will find the scots proverb verified nemo me impune lacessit   your abused humble servant e curll ps lord o  and lord delaware i attend this day i will sup with you to night where pope has one lord i have twenty this ps as cooper printed it contradicts itself mr curll called at lord delawars house and found him and lord cowper gone to holland and that evening mr curll had the honor to spend with lord haversham as to lords mr curll might have double his number      mr curll just after in the london daily post or general advertiser printed an advertisement that he would publish all the letters sent him by ep pt and rs  to which in two days his correspondents returned the following answer  to manifest to the world the insolence of e curll we hereby declare that neither pt much less rs his agent ever did give or could pretend to give any title whatever in mr popes letters to the said e curll and he is hereby challenged to produce any pretense to the copy whatsoever  we helped the said e curll to the letters and joined with him on condition he should pay a certain sum for the books as he sold them accordingly the said e curll received   0 books which he sold perfect and imperfect at five shillings each and for all which he never paid more than ten guineas and gave notes for the rest which proved not negotionable besides which pt was persuaded by rs at the instigation of e curll to pay the expense of the whole impression viz    l no part whereof was repaid by the said curll therefore every bookseller will be indemnifyd every way from any possible prosecution or molestation of the said e curll and whereas the said e curll threatens to publish our correspondence and as much as in him lies to betray his benefactors we shall also publish his letters to us which will open a scene of baseness and foul dealing that will sufficiently show to mankind his character and conduct to this mr curll replied in the daily postboy of may    viz gentlemen the scurility of your advertisement i despise falsehood under your own hands i shall here prove upon you and as to your scandal in affirming that my notes proved not negotiable i will take proper measures it is declared that neither pt much less rs his agent ever did give or could pretend to give any title whatever in mr popes letters to mr curll and he is challenged to produce any pretense to the copy whatsoever pt in his first letter to mr curll writes thus to show you my sincerity and determinate resolution these letters shall be sent you they will make a four or five shilling book yet i expect no more than what will barely pay a transcriber that the originals may be preserved in your hands to vouch the truth of them yours pt ps i would have you add to them what you formerly printed of those to mr cromwell in a letter from rs to mr curll he thus writes sir my cousin pt desires you will get  00 of the titles printed with all expedition and assures you that no man whatsoever shall vend a book but yourself for you shall have the whole impression to be sure i shall leave it to your generosity to consider me for the copy i am your friend and servant rs on monday the   th instant mr curll published these letters though he had but  0 books and those wanting titles and prefaces but the same day at noon rs sent for mr curll to the standard tavern in leicesterfields where mr curll paid him  0 l in cash  0 l by a negotiable note payable in a month    l and a conditional note for   l for which rs gave a receipt to mr curll in full for  00 books delivering then by two porters five bundles of    books in each making   0 which he said came by water and they were sent to mr curlls house and his wife received them in his absence mr curll having had in all but   0 books though a receipt given for  00 and the last   0 all delivered imperfect i therefore desire to know if this does not open a scene of baseness and foul dealing that sufficiently show to mankind the characters and conduct of pt and rs i shall say no more till i publish the whole of their transactions upon oath e curll   pt rs  may          the effects of this quarrel has been the putting into our hands all the correspondence above which having given the reader to make what reflections he pleases on we have nothing to add but our hearty wishes in which we doubt not every honest man will concur that the next sessions when the booksellers bill shall again be brought in the legislature will be pleased not to extend the privileges without at the same time restraining the license of booksellers since in a case so notorious as the printing a gentlemans private letters most eminent mr pope is no more a gentleman than mr curll nor more eminent as a poet than he as a bookseller  both printers and booksellers conspired to assist the pyracy t coopers edition is the pirated one and which all honest booksellers and the public have agreed to discourage  both in printing and vending the same  ps we are informed that notwithstanding the pretenses of edmund curll mr curll never pretended to have any more letters of mr popes than he produced to the lords in committee  the original letters of mr pope with the postmarks upon them remain still in the books from whence they were copied and that so many omissions and interpolations have been made in this publication as to render it impossible for mr p to own them in the condition they appear mr pope well knows that these letters now appear as he directed them to be printed which will hereafter be made more fully appear   the initial correspondence or anecdotes of the life and family of mr pope who can shame p  break all his cobwebs through he spins the slight selfpleasing threads anew destroy his lies or sophistry in vain the creatures at his dirty work again throned in the center of his base designs proud of extending his vainglorious lines epist to arb his own example strengthens all his laws he is that petulant poorwretch he draws ess on crit anecdotes of the life and family of alexander pope esquire it is a very just observation made by a late impartial biographer the author of some anecdotes of the life of mr tho hearne of edmund hall oxon that those persons who have been most industrious in handing down to posterity the memorials of other men have generally had the misfortune to be neglected themselves unwilling that so hard a fate should befall a man who so little deserves it i was glad to embrace any opportunity rather than trust a thing of such consequence to hereafter and i have this satisfaction how uncommon soever it may be thought to give an account of a man in his lifetime that i have preserved some memorials of an indefatigable gentleman now living which an able pen may improve greatly to his honor when dead  with this view then i shall begin my labor with the account mr pope has given us of himself and proceed to other authorities to which i shall all along refer  e curll  mr alexander pope was born in cheapside london on the  th day of june in the year      so that one week produced both pope and the pretender memorable era  his parents being of the roman catholic persuasion educated him by a private tutor of whom he learned latin and greek at one and the same time  he passed through some seminaries with little improvement till twelve years of age after which he perfected his studies by his own industry see jacobs lives of the poets  vo page       so early a propensity had he to the muses that among several other pretty poetical productions he sent his friend mr cromwell an ode on solitude written when he was not twelve years old see his letters to henry cromwell esquire  and before this time he had severely satirized his schoolmaster as appears from the following original letter viz  to mr curll march         sir in pursuance to your advertisement desiring such accounts of mr pope as his deserts demand i send you these anecdotes the truth of which i can testify and will if called upon as having been his schoolfellow my self at the time  the fact is very remarkable as it is a proof of that natural spleen which constitutes his temperament and from which he has never deviated in the whole course of his life  the last school he was put to before the twelfth year of his age was in devonshirestreet near bloomsbury there i also was and the late duke of norfolk at the same time it was kept by one bromley a popish renegado who had been a parson and was one of king jamess converts in oxford some years after that princes abdication his name was william bromley

an advantageous offer made him he went a travellingtutor to the present lord gage  mr alexander pope before he had been four months at this school or was able to construe tullys offices employed his muse in satirizing his master it was a libel of at least one hundred verses which a fellowstudent having given information of was found in his pocket and the young satirist was soundly whipped and kept a prisoner to his room seven days whereupon his father fetched him away and i have been told he never went to school more  how much past correction has wrought upon him the world is judge and how much present correction might may be collected from this sample i thought it a curious fact and therefore it is at your service as one of the ornaments of this excellent persons life  yours etc ep   thursday oct         mr curll understanding you propose to write the life of mr pope this is only to inform you i can send you diverse memoirs which may be serviceable if your design be really to do him neither injustice nor show him favor  i was well acquainted with his father and with the first part of his own life though since he has treated me as a stranger  it is certain some late pamphlets are not fair in respect to his father he was of the younger branch of a family in good repute in ireland and related to the lord down formerly of the same name he was as he has told me himself and he was very different from his son a modest and plain honest man a posthumous son and left little provided for his elder brother having what small estate there was who afterward studied and died at oxford he was put to a merchant in flanders and acquired a moderate fortune by merchandise which he quitted at the revolution in very good circumstances and retired to windsorforest where he purchased a small estate and took great delight in husbandry and gardens his mother was one of the seventeen children of william turnor esquire formerly of burfithall in the  riding of yorkshire two of her brothers were killed in the civilwars  this is a true account of mr popes family and parentage the oxford antiquary informs us that thomas pope the young earl of down died in st marys parish in oxford

was sent the following letter viz  to mr curll nov         sir i troubled you with a line some time since concerning your design of the life of mr pope to which i desired your answer in the daily advertiser of thursday the   th inst oct i do not intend my self any other profit in it than that of doing justice to and on that person upon whom sir you have constantly bestowed some care as well as pains in the course of your life and i intend him the like for his conduct toward me  a propos to his life there have lately fallen into my hands a large collection of his letters from the former part of his days till the year      which being more considerable than any yet seen and opening very many scenes new to the world will alone make a perfect and the most authentic life and memoirs of him that could be  to show you my sincerity and determinate resolution of assisting you herein i will give you an advertisement which you may publish if you please forthwith and on your so doing the letters shall be sent you they will make a four of five shilling book yet i expect no more than what will barely pay a transcriber that the originals may be preserved in mine or your hands to vouch the truth of them  i am of opinion these alone will contain his whole history if you add to them what you formerly printed of those to h cromwell esquire but you must put out an advertisement for otherwise i shall not be justified to some people who have influence and on whom i have some dependence unless it seem to the public eye as no entire act of mine but i may be justified and excused if after they see such a collection is made by you i acknowledge i sent some letters to contribute thereto  they who know what has passed betwixt mr pope and me formerly may otherwise think it dishonorable i should set such a thing afoot therefore print the advertisement i here send you and you shall instantly hear from or see me  adieu pt   the old gentleman pt not calling upon me i did not put the advertisement into any newspaper and this whole transaction lay dormant near two years but upon regulating some papers in my scritoire about the close of march      this advertisement came to my hands and reflecting within my self that the resentment between mr pope and me though from the first ungenerously taken up by him had continued much too long being almost eight years i was willing to lay hold of an opportunity for proposing an accommodation accordingly i wrote to mr pope and enclosed the abovementioned advertisement in the handwriting of pt and desired his answer which he thought fit in a very ungentlemanlike manner to return me in three papers viz the grubstreet journal the daily journal and the daily postboy in the last of which i replied april  th see the appendix no i and ii   upon this incident pt renewed his correspondence and sent me word he had seen an advertisement of mr pope which related to him and that mr pope should soon see the collection of letters published for that upon my not advertising them he had been persuaded to print them himself and offered me the refusal of the impression his demands for which were    pounds and added that a person should meet me at the rose tavern in bridgesstreet and bring me at a day appointed one of the books in sheets but on the day appointed i received a countermand that he thought he had lost his wits by making such an appointment and seemed in a terrible panic lest mr pope should send some of his twickenhambravoes to assault us but how mr pope was to know of this meeting is the cream of the jest i sent him word that i commiserated his fears but as to my own part i did not at all dread any assassination whatever from mr pope even though it were a poetical one to this pt rejoined that a gentleman should call at my house precisely at eight in the evening in a weeks time but in the interim i received the following letter viz  to mr curll may        sir pt will send you  0 books all but the title which you may order as you please and therefore was not wrought in five or six days time and you may pay for them as you propose at the weeks end it will be left to your honor to show you my intentions are honorable  you may therefore advertise as you propose five or six days together that the book will be published by you the   th instant  your servant pt   accordingly on the  th of may rs a short squat man came to my house not at   but near  0 at night he had on a clergymans gown and his neck was surrounded with a large lawn barristers band he showed me a book in sheets almost finished and about a dozen original letters and promised me the whole at our next meeting and the next day i received the following note from pt and a letter from rs viz  to mr curll sir you see i leave all to your own prudence and you now see i trust your honor as to price etc which settle with the bearer against the weeks end for out they must come now forthwith i doubt not you will return my letters and we must by no means seem to use pope with disregard but rather commend etc lest by any circumstances i writ to you the publisher be detected  yours pt   the clergyman you saw will bring you the books to whom i insist you will deliver my former letters concerning mr pope whom i must be concealed from and he tells me you had written an advertisement of mr popes life in which if you insert any one circumstance of what i told you in a private letter i shall be discovered and exposed to his resentment i insist on your honor in returning them therefore  you may do as you please your self in relation to the references to cromwells letters and therefore you may add any such advertisement to the title of the book it self for i do not thoroughly understand you as to that pt  to mr curll may        dear sir please to send by the bearer the title and the preface and an estimate and the papers you promised me last night i mean the letters the printer is drawing out the sheets and you shall have the rest with expedition if i should get off my engagement for this evening leave word where i shall meet you i am  your friend and servant r smythe ps the old gentleman is vastly pleased at our meeting last night dont fail to send by the bearer the letters i shall have great news and good to tell you friday to both our advantage     two a clock saturday may  0      dear sir my

says tuesday i am  sir your friend and servant rs ps why dont you advertise        may      sir you see how earnest pt is to have these books out therefore you will receive by the bearer some titles by one aclock you shall have more books but he must insist on some money to pay the printer the number i shall bring you will be near  00 be at home at    for i may get them before i am  your friend and servant rs   according to the request herein i staid at home and about one oclock rs sent for me to the standard tavern in leicesterfields where i paid him ten pounds and gave him a negotiable note for fifteen pounds payable in a month as he desired  we had not been together half an hour before two porters brought to the tavern five bundles of books upon a horse which rs told me came by water he ordered the porters to carry them to my house and my wife took them in they contained but    books in each bundle making in the   bundles   0 books all wanting the letters to mess jarvas digby blount and dr arbuthnots letter but he said they contained  0 in each bundle which with  0 i had before without titles or prefaces made  00 and gave me the following receipts  may         then received of mr curll ten pounds on account by me r smythe  received at the same time a note of hand of fifteen pounds one month after date which when paid is in full for three hundred books by me r smythe  nb he had a conditional note of mine besides payable on demand for five pounds  e curll   about two a clock on the very day of publication the   th instant all the books that were in my custody were seized by a warrant from the house of lords and my self and mr john wilford publisher of the postboy were both ordered to attend their lordships the next day which we did accordingly mr wilford and the printer of the postboy whom he brought with him were upon examination discharged but the lords resolving themselves into a committee i was ordered to attend the next day  at my return home i found the following letter from rs  to mr curll    may      sir as soon as i heard of our misfortune of the books being seized i posted away to pt he said he found his great caution was but necessary but though he knew mr popes interest with the great he apprehended only his personal revenge or a chancery suit knowing he would spare no cost to gratify his revenge he said if you had been more cautious than to name lords in your advertisement this could not have happened but since it has happened you shall not only find him punctual but generous he immediately sent me with money to pay off the printer and i have the whole impression in my hands i then found that the rogue had delivered your last parcel imperfect but i will bring you both those sheets and the whole impression the very first day they can be safely delivered you  pt says he never intended any more advantage but merely not to be out of pocket except you had been willing to gratify me a little but now he will be just and act handsomely to you though ever so much to his own loss provided you keep secret our whole transaction  as it is plain that popes whole point is only to suppress the books and find out who gave the letters you will entirely disappoint him in both if whatever questions the lords ask you will answer no more than thus that you had the letters from different hands some of which you paid for that you printed these as you did mr cromwells before without mr popes ever gainsaying it and that as to the originals many you can show now and the rest you can very speedily  it is well that an accident hinders you at present from the originals which now they would seize pt thinks it was indiscreet to advertise the originals so very quick as the first day until you actually had them which by his own falling ill he could not come at so soon in the place where they lay  the lords cannot stop the books above two or three days if at all  and pts wonderful caution as it happens will enable you to sell them whatever orders they may make for he apprehending injunctions in chancery might suppress the book had already printed another title and preface which throws the publication entirely off you and might be safely vended even in that case  in short if you absolutely conceal all that has passed between pt me and your self you win the old gentleman for ever for his whole heart is set upon publishing the letters not so much for this volume as in ordine ad to much more important correspondence that will follow viz with swift late lord oxd bp rochester and lord bol  you shall hear soon from me i hope this will be quickly over i remain  your faithful servant r smythe      may sir we heartily congratulate you on your victory over the lords the pope and the devil for we have sure information that the books will be restored to you either this day or to morrow  the old gentleman is charmed with your behavior yesterday only thinks it wrong that he hears you owned the books were sent to your wife by an unknown hand  this may induce enquiry and suspicion of some dark transaction and be thought shuffling the lords will think you more sincere and twill have a betrer air to say you had the originals and copies from different hands and that some you paid for some were given you and you printed them in your own right  you can suffer no more for printing than for publishing them and the lords cannot touch a hair of your head  all that pt can apprehend is that pope may obtain an injunction in chancery against e curll by name notwithstanding which those books may be selling which have not your name with the preface which he provided for that purpose  and you cannot but observe when you read that preface that at the same time that it makes you not publisher it yet proves your right to cromwells letters  this is as lucky as can be and pope cannot obtain an injunction without owning himself in the bill author of the letters which will serve you to prove the letters genuine  if you observe all the old gentlemans directions you will soon be fully acquainted both with his person and designs in the mean time to show you he will take off the mask and clear the mysterium magnum you complain of i have his leave to tell you these things which he would have writ to you himself but that his arm is now disabled by the rheumatism  he is no man of quality but conversant with many and happening to be concerned with a noble lord a friend of mr popes in handing to the press his letters to wycherley he got some copies over and above this incident put first into his head the thought of collecting more and afterward finding you did not comply in printing his advertisement he went on with it by himself found cromwells answers in the same lords possession with many others which he printed as near as possible to correspond with the letter and paper etc  the observations he made in some paragraphs etc were necessary the same things being repeated in other letters either of this or the next volume particularly the original of the letter to mr walsh is in his hand  i hope to have some of his originals when we meet the books that rascal sent imperfect you shall have perfected on your first desire by a line to dicks in which you are disird to send us word of what you now think of the honor and candor of  your faithful friend pt      may thursday   a clock sir you are happily got off to my extreme pleasure i take the first minute i hear of your acquittal to tell you from certain information that   popes friends particularly  would have done any sort of illegal injustice to have come at you even to imprisonment and confiscation of the books it was wholly owing to  that your are defended in your rights and it will be but common gratitude in you as well as may possibly nay certainly recommend you to their patronage to take the first opportunity to return them your public thanks the coach waits and i am going with this joyful news to the old gentleman and to have his orders for what he promised is the reason i cannot possibly see you this night i am  yours most sincerely r smythe   may    sir i have seen pt from whom i hoped to have had the mss but i found him in a very different humor from what i left him he says you did not follow the instructions he sent you in not owning the printing which though in your letter you seem to think nothing yet joined to your having owned to others that you had them from across the water was almost all that you could discover yet further we are certainly informed that you have named me as the hand that conveyed them this you have said that i was a clergyman belonging to c church in southwark judge you whether we can think of you as you have reason to think of us whether this be honorable usage after you had known what pt had done and what a sum he paid to get you the whole impression pt had reason to think you would betray him as soon as you had it judge too if you have done wisely to hazard by your blabbing the loss of a future copy of immense value which i much doubt he will ever let you have he has positively enjoined me not to trust my self with you till better assurance and the best way for my part that i know you can give any assurance is to send the  0 pound first to dicks coffeehouse in a note on mr hoare by  0 tomorrow morning and to show pt that you trust him as absolutely in that small sum as he has done you in a much greater as soon as you do this and not before he will send all the things you desire which i believe he would never have done after your naming me and coming so near as southwark but for his being so earnest to have the book published  in one word he has put it upon this test  i am sorry you have given him this occasion of distrust i would be glad to do you a good office with him but i fear you have done me a bad one in naming me i am  yours rs your answer ought to be very satisfactory        may      sir i will bring you the remainder of the impression thursday evening for i am really tired with this capricious temper of the old gentleman he suspects his own shadow i shall leave it to your generosity to consider me for the copy i am just sent for to him and am told he is in good humor i have but just time to tell you  i am your friend and servant rs   appendix no i whereas ec bookseller has written to mr p  pretending that a person the initials of whose name are pt has offered him to print a large collection of the said mr p  s letters to which ec requires an answer this is to certify that mr p  having never had nor intending ever to have any private correspondence with ec gives his answer in this manner that he knows no such person as pt that he thinks no man has any such collection that he believes the whole a forgery and shall not trouble himself at all about it  no ii whereas ap poet has certified in the daily postboy that he shall not trouble himself at all about the publication of a large collection of the said mr p  s letters which pt has offered ec to print this is to certify that mr c never had nor intended ever to have any private correspondence with ap but was directed to give him notice of these letters now to put all forgeries even popish ones to flight this is to give notice that any person or ap himself may see the originals in mr p  s own hand when printed initials are a joke names at length are real no longer now like suppliants we come ec makes war and ap is the drum   whereas a person who signs himself pt and another who writes himself r smith and passes for a clergyman have transacted for some time past with edm curll and have in combination printed the private letters of mr pope and his correspondents some of which could only be procured from his own library or that of a noble lord and which have given a pretense to the publishing others as his which are not so as well as interpolating those which are this is to advertise that if either of the said persons will apply to mr pope and discover the whole of this affair he shall receive a reward of twenty guineas or if he can prove he has acted by direction of any other and of what person he shall receive double that sum  whereas it is promised in mr popes name in the daily postboy that twenty guineas shall be paid to a person who signs himself pt to discover rs or forty guineas shall be paid to rs if he will discover pt or any body else who was in the confederacy of publishing mr popes letters this is to give notice that another person who writes himself ep was likewise concerned with edm curll in the said important confederacy who have all jointly and severally agreed to oblige mr pope if he will make it better worth their while and let e curll print his works for the future who hereby promises in justice to all the purchasers of the said mr popes letters bought of him to deliver this week gratis the letters to mr jarvas mr digby mr blount and dr arbuthnot which were wanting in all the copies seized and in a month will be also published letters political and familiar by mr prior mr addison mr pope sir richard steel etc being the second volume of literary correspondence etc printed for e curll  rosestreet conventgarden may         to the most noble and right honorable the peers of great britain my lords this day seennight i was in the same jeopardy as mr drydens hind doomed to death though fated not to die but till the hour of my death i shall with the most grateful acknowledgements always remember both the justice and honor your lordships have done me on this occasion  prevarication my lords is a noted finesse of the society of jesus mr pope says in one of his letters that an evasion is a lie guarded but in another to mr wycherley he thus writes page        i am sorry you told the great man whom you met in the court of requests that your papers were in my hands no man alive shall ever know any such thing from me and i give you this warning besides that though your self should say i had any way assisted you i am notwithstanding resolved to deny it an excellent proof this of the modesty of alexander pope of twickenham esquire  now my lords to matter of fact i shall this week publish a new edition of mr popes literary correspondence etc wherein the letters to mr jarvas mr digby mr blount and dr arbuthnot which were wanting in all the copies seized by your lordships order shall be by me delivered gratis and as i am resolved to detect if possible the contrivers of this gross imposition upon your lordships i will by way of supplement print all the letters i have received from ep pt and rs with some other correspondences which as mr bays says shall both elevate and surprise the public  i have engraven a new plate of mr popes head from mr jarvass painting and likewise intend to hang him up in effigy for a sign to all spectators of his falsehood and my own veracity which i will always maintain under the scots motto nemo me impune lacessit  e curll   to the booksellers gentlemen being informed that there are clandestinely sent to mess innys and manby some copies of mr popes letters this is to give both them and

those which thin unbodyd shadows fill that glide along the elysian glades or skim the flowery meads of asphodill but those in which a learned author said strong drink was drunk and gambols played and two substantial meals a day were made the business of it is to express from me and from my holiness to you and to your gentleness how much i wish you health and happiness and much good news and little spleen as may be a hearty stomach and sound lady and every day a double dose of coffee to make you look as sage as any sophy for the rest i must be content in plain prose to assure you that i am very much obliged to you for the favor of your letter  but if i may be allowed to object against any thing you write which i must do if it were only to be even with you for your severity to me it should be that passage in yours where you are pleased to call the whores of drury lane the nymphs of drury i must own it was some time before i could frame to my self any plausible excuse for this expression but affection which you know sir excuses all things at last furnished me with one in your justification which i have here sent you in verse that you may have at least some rhyme to defend you though you should have no reason  if wit or critic blame the tender swain who styled the gentle damsels in his strain the nymphs of drury not of drury lane be this his answer and the most just excuse   far be it sirs from my more civil muse  those loving ladies rudely to traduce  alleys and lanes are terms too vile and base  and give ideas of a narrow pass  but the wellworn paths of the nymphs of drury  are large and wide tydcombe and i assure ye i made no question but the news of saphos staying behind me in the town would surprise you but she is since come into the country and to surprise you more i will inform you that the first person she named when i waited on her was one mr cromwell what an ascendant have you over all the sex who could gain the fairones heart by appearing before her in a long black unpowderd perriwig nay without so much as the very extremities of clean linen in neckcloth and cuffs i guess that your friend vertumnus among all the forms he assumed to win the good graces of pomona never took upon him that of slovenly beau well sir i leave you to your meditations on this occasion and to languish unactive as you call it  but i find i have exceeded my bounds and begin to travel on the confines of impertinence however to make you amends i shall desire mr wycherley to deliver you this letter who will be sure in less than a quarter of an hours conversation with you to give you wit enough to atone for twice as much dullness as i have troubled you with therefore i shall only give my respects to some of our acquaintance and conclude  to baker first my service pray to tydcomb eke and mr cheek last to yourself my best respects i pay and so remain for ever and for ay sir your affectionate humble servant a pope  letter ii nov  0th   0  sir about the time that mr wycherley came to london i troubled you with a letter of mine in hopes of prevailing with you to continue the favor of yours but i now write to convince you that silence is not always the surest guard against impertinence i have too great a sense of those many civilities received from you to desist from expressing it till i receive more for you not only have acquainted me with many of my errors in scribbling but with some in my conduct and i owe to you the knowledge of things infinitely more of concern to myself than any thing of mine can be to others the advantage i have obtained from both might endanger your being put upon an endless trouble of criticizing on the rest of my faults and therefore you have reason to make some delay with those now under your examination though i never could expect you should once look upon them but when you were perfectly at leisure yet so much assurance your former kindness had given me that i was under some apprehensions for your health on the score of your silence and i desired mr wycherley to inform me on that subject which he did not either through forgetfulness or else believing i should be soon in town and i had certainly been there before this time had it been in my power to comply with his most obliging invitation and my desires of seeing him and you but since i find i must not hope for that satisfaction till after christmas i entreat you will not in the mean time let me be so unhappy as to doubt of your welfare which is the sole business of this letter that to make you some amends for the unconscionable length of my last shall not add a word more but that which i hope you will ever believe that i am  dear sir your most obliged and most humble servant a pope ps pray continue to assure mr wycherley of my real affection for and service to him and let him know i writ to him two posts since you will likewise oblige me by giving my service to mr betterton when you see him who i am afraid is not well not having seen his name among the actors in the public advertisements    letter iii december      0  dear sir i received the favor of your kind letter wherein i find you have obliged me before i expected it in reviewing the papers i sent you i have been asked i believe twenty times by sir william trumbull for a sight of that translation but have deferred it till i could supply the blank spaces i left in the fair copy by your approbation if therefore you will send it enclosed to mr thorold the tobacconist in dukestreet to be sent me by the coach as soon as you can conveniently it will come very opportunely since i find i can no longer refuse to show it to sir william with any decency i am mightily pleased with your objection to my attributing friendship to dogs yet think the want of equality is no obstacle to the friendship of some country gentlemen of my acquaintance with theirs i am extremely impatient to enjoy your agreeable conversation and to let you know how much i prefer it to any here where indeed dogs and men are much on a level only the first have more goodnature and more sagacity if i were not at this instant very much afflicted with the headache i would offer a few more considerations in behalf of the fourleggd part of the creation but i will only add one word that you and i will never disagree about dogs or any thing else for i am with very much esteem and ever will be  sir your most faithful friend and humble servant a pope ps i design to write to mr wycherley by this post in answer to the most kind and friendly letter i ever received i shall never be unhappy or melancholy in the country as long as he and you will oblige me with your letters    letter iv june  0th      dear sir i was extremely concerned to leave you ill when i parted from the town and desired mr thorold to give me an account of the state of your health by the next coach he omitted to do it and i have been since at mr englefylds till yesterday when i received the ill news that you continued ill or much as i left you i hope this is not true and shall be very uneasy in my fears for your health till i have a farther account from yourself which i beg you not to defer i hope the air of this forest may perfectly recover you and wish you would to that end try it sooner than the end of the month if you desire mr thorold he will at a days warning take a place for you my father joins in this request and mr englefyld is overjoyed with the hopes of seeing you at his house when i have your company i cannot but be well and hope from the knowledge of this that you cannot be very ill in mine i beg you to believe no man can take a greater interest in your welfare or be more heartily affected toward you than my self who am with all the esteem and tenderness of a friend  dear sir your faithful humble servant a pope  letter v june   th      dear sir if my letter pleased you yours overjoyed me and i expect impatiently your kind visit a little room and a little heart are both at your service and you may be secure of being easy in em at least though not happy for you shall go just your own way and keep your own hours which is more than can be done often in places of greater entertainment  as to your letter of critical remarks on drydens virgil i can only say most of what you observe are true enough but of no great consequence in my opinion at least line   0 and sanctify the shame  seems to me very beautiful and so does  it is doubly to be dead line     and bandyd words still beat about his ears  this i have thought gross as well as you i agree with you that the     d line and closed her lids at last in endless night  is contradictory to the sense of virgil for so as you say iris might have been spared and in the main it is to be confessed that the translator has been freer with the character of dido than his modest author would allow i am just taking horse to see a friend five miles off that i have no little visits abroad to interrupt my happiness at home when you are here so that i can but just assure you how pleased i am in the expectation of it and how sincerely i shall ever be  dear sir your most obliged and affectionate servant a pope ps pray bring a very considerable number of pint bottles with you this might seem a strange odd request if you had not told me you would stay but as many days as you brought bottles therefore you cannot bring too many though we are here no drunkards it is a fine thing to have a learned quotation for every occasion and horace helps me to one now  non ego te meis immunem meditor tingere poculis plena dives ut in domo ode    l     and to another ep   l   haec ego procurare and idoneus imperor and non invitus ne turpe toral ne sordida mappa corruget nares    and once more sat   l    been erit non piscibus urbe petitis sed pullo

the essay on criticism before twas published i desire you to read it and give me your opinion in what manner such a critic ought to be answered    letter vi dear sir i send this only to let you know how much our whole family desire to hear of your safe arrival in london and the continuance of your health you have without compliment obliged us all so much by your friendly acceptance of so poor an entertainment here that you could by nothing have obliged us more but by staying longer but i take so short a visit only as an earnest of a more kind one hereafter as we just call upon a friend sometimes only to tell him he shall see us again  all you saw in this country charge me to assure you of their humble service and the ladies in particular who look upon us but as plain countryfellows since they saw you and heard more civil things in that fortnight than they expect from the whole shire of us in an age the trophy you bore away from one of em in your snuff box will doubtless preserve her memory and be a testimony of your admiration for ever  as long as mochas happy tree shall grow while berries crackle or while mills shall go while smoking streams from silver spouts shall glide or chinas earth receive the sable tide while coffee shall to british nymphs be dear while fragrant steams the bended head shall cheer or grateful bitters shall delight the taste so long her honor name and praise shall last pray give my service to all my few friends and to mr gay in particular farewell that is drink strong coffee ingere tibi calices amariores i am with all sincerity  dear sir your most faithful friend and humble servant a pope july   th      letter vii dear sir i received your most welcome letter and am ashamed you should seem to give us thanks where you ought to assure us of pardon for so ill an entertainment your heroic intention of flying to the relief of a distressed lady was glorious and noble such as might be expected from your character for as chaucer says i think as noblest metals are most soft to melt so pity soonest runs in gentle minds   but what you tell me of her relations account of the state of her mind is not to be wondered at it is the easiest way they have to make some seeming excuse for a shameful indolence and neglect of afflicted virtue to represent it as willing to suffer and endure the cross alas sir these good people of large estates and little souls have no mind to ease her by bearing it off her shoulders by a generous assistance our savior himself did not refuse to be eased of the weight of part of his cross though perhaps simon of cyrene might allege to the jews that twas christs desire to bear it all himself and he for his part might be willing to go quietly on his journey without the trouble   be pleased to assure mr ballam of my faithful service i can never enough esteem a zeal so ardent in my concerns from one i never could any way oblige or induce to it it is an effect of the purest most disinterested strain of natural good humor in the world pray at your leisure return me those papers in my hand which you have and in mr wycherleys and favor me as often as you can with your letters which will ever be the most entertaining things i can receive in your absence  all those fine persons you mention return you their humble service  the fate of the berry moves at once my compassion and envy it deserves an elegy but who besides catullus and voiture can write agreeably upon trifles my humble service to the lady in the clouds where if i am once so happy as to be admitted i will not be put off like ixion but lay hold on the real juno i am most seriously  dear sir your most obliged and most affectionate servant and friend a pope july         to mr lintot bookseller aug        mr lintot mr addison desired me to tell you that he wholly disapproves the manner of treating mr dennis in a little pamphlet by way of dr norriss account of the frenzy of mr den  a narrative written by mr pope see his letter to mr addison of july  0      in vol i  when he thinks fit to take notice of mr denniss objections to his writings remarks upon cato  he will do it in a way mr dennis shall have no just reason to complain of but when the papers abovementioned were offered to be communicated to him he said he could not either in honor or conscience be privy to such a treatment and was sorry to hear of it i am  sir your very humble servant richard steel  mr pope to mr dennis may        sir i called to receive the two books of your letters these books were entitled original letters familiar moral and critical in two volumes  vo printed by e curll for mr dennis for whose benefit only they were subscribed at one guinea a set mr dennis died      and was buried at st martins in the fields london from mr congreve and have left with him the little money i am in your debt i look upon my self to be much more so for the omissions you have been pleased to make in those letters in my favor and sincerely join with you in the desire that not the least traces may remain of that difference between us which indeed i am sorry for if mr pope will not allow this to be called his recantation i know not what submission of any kind can be so termed  you may therefore believe me without either ceremony or falseness  sir your most obedient humble servant a pope  mrs thomas to mr curll sir being informed by a person of great worth and quality that you designed to publish a collection of original letters etc from the best hands since the restoration i here therefore transmit some very good ones which i am possessed of that i may contribute my little mite thereto and i am the more encouraged to pursue my first intentions of sending you the enclosed papers especially those from mr dryden from the great usefulness of such an undertaking who notwithstanding he was the honor and ornament of his country yet misled by the vices of that age had been too great a libertine in many of his writings but dearly did he repent of it before he died as certainly all must who have but even the principles of natural religion when they come to take a serious view of eternity he was continually bewailing the impossibility of calling in all his works and making a thorough reformation and therefore took all opportunities of deterring others from treading in his steps nay sometimes his zeal carried him so far as to chide even when there was no occasion as witness one of his letters to me who had desired his correction of some verses and had innocently said they were written in imitation of mr behns numbers i own i was pleased with the cadence of her verse though at the same time i no ways approved the licentiousness of her morals but you will see how severe he is upon me for it and i am very certain if he had lived but a few months longer he would have published a treatise by way of recantation which as he often used to say was the only method whereby he could redeem his crime and prevent a growing evil  sir if you think the private thoughts of this great man may be useful to the public and worthy a place in your collection they are freely at your service from  your sincere friend et june   th      letters of mr dryden to corinna mrs elizabeth thomas jun  madam the letter you were pleased to direct for me to be left at the coffeehouse last summer was a great honor and your verses a pastoral hereafter mentioned were i thought too good to be a womans some of my friends to whom i read them were of the same opinion it is not over gallant i must confess to say this of the fair sex but most certain it is that they generally write with more softness than strength on the contrary you want neither vigor in your thoughts nor force in your expressions nor harmony in your numbers and methinks i find much of orinda the celebrated mrs catherine philips in your manner to whom i had the honor to be related and also to be known but i continued not a day in the ignorance of the person to whom i was obliged for if you remember you brought the verses to a booksellers shop and enquired there how they might be sent to me there happened to be in the same shop a gentleman who hearing you speak of me and seeing a paper in your hand imagined it was a libel against me and had you watched by his servant till he knew both your name and where you lived of which he sent me word immediately though i have lost his letter yet i remember you live some where about st giless she lived with her mother in dyottstreet  and are an only daughter you must have passed your time in reading much better books than mine or otherwise you could not have arrived to so much knowledge as i find you have but whether sylph or nymph i know not those fine creatures as your author count gabalis a translation of the entertaining history of the count de gabalis by mr ozell is printed by e curll price   s   d assures us have a mind to be christened and since you do me the favor to desire a name from me take that of corinna if you please i mean not the lady with whom ovid was in love but the famous theban poetess who overcame pindar five times as historians tell us i would have called you sapho but that i hear you are handsomer since you find i am not altogether a stranger to you be pleased to make me happier by a better knowledge of you and instead of so many unjust praises which you give me think me only worthy of being  madam your most humble servant and admirer john dryden  letter ii madam the great desire which i observe in you to write well and those good parts which god almighty and nature have bestowed on you make me not to doubt that by application to study and the reading of the best authors you may be absolute mistress of poetry it is an unprofitable art to those who profess it but you who write only for your diversion may pass your hours with pleasure in it and without prejudice always avoiding as i know you will the licenses which mrs behn allowed herself of writing loosely and giving if i my have leave to say so some scandal to the modesty of her sex i confess i am the last man who ought in justice to arraign her who have been myself too much a libertine in most of my poems which i should be well contented i had time either to purge or to see them fairly burned but this i need not say to you who are too well born and too well principled to fall into that mire  in the mean time i would advise you not to trust too much to virgil s pastorals for as excellent as they are yet theocritus is far before him both in softness of thought and simplicity of expression mr creech mr creechs translation of theocritus is printed for e curll pr  s  d has translated that greek poet which i have not read in english if you have any considerable faults they consist chiefly in the choice of words and the placing them so as to make the verse run smoothly but i am at present so taken up with my own studies that i have not leisure to descend to particulars being in the mean time the fair corinna s  most humble and most faithful servant john dryden ps i keep your two   a pastoral elegy to the memory of the honorable cecilia bew    the triple league to

from you by which you see i am like the rest of the world an impudent borrower and a bad play master you take more care of my health than it deserves that of an old man is always crazy and at present mine is worse than usual by a st anthonys fire in one of my legs though the swelling is much abated yet the pain is not wholly gone and i am too weak to stand upon it if i recover it is possible i may attempt homers iliad a specimen of it the first book is now in the press among other poems of mine which will make a volume in folio of twelve shillings price fables ancient and modern translated into verse from homer ovid boccace and chaucer with original poems nb mr dryden died   00  and will be published within this month i desire fair author that you will be pleased to continue me in your good graces who am with all sincerity and gratitude  your most humble servant and admirer john dryden friday december   th      mr charles dryden to corinna madam notwithstanding i have been seized with a fever ever since i saw you last i have this afternoon endeavored to do my self the honor of obeying my lady chudleighs commands my fever is still increasing and i beg you to peruse the following verses according to your own sense and discretion which far surpasses mine in all respects in a small time of intermission from my illness i wrote these following viz  madam how happy is our british isle to bear such crops of wit and beauty to the fair a female muse each vying age has blessed and the last phoenix still excels the rest but you such solid learning add to rhymes your sense looks fatal to succeeding times which raised to such a pitch overflows like nile and with an after dearth must seize our isle alone of all your sex without the rules of formal pedants or the noisy schools what nature has bestowed will art supply have traced the various tracks of dark philosophy what happy days had wise aurelius seen if for faustina you his wife had been no jarring nonsense had his soul

necessary in case a certain earl should raise any uneasinesses in the house of lords our merchants are very angry at their late losses on the russia fleet and pretend the enemy must have had advices

the french generals for not having made more use of their victory at almanza which till the coming away of those letters had been followed by very insignificant success this had given our forces time to recover themselves and to take all the necessary precautions for the defense of catalonia where the people appeared firm to the austrian interest and the more so since they saw by the treatment of the valentians and arragenians what they were to expect in case of conquest the lisbon letters gives us hopes of retaking moura and serpa though we are afraid our four english regiments may suffer

therefore sent to mr palmer on the same subject who with two or three other venetian merchants brought me the project of a treaty which they desired me to read to my lord sunderland upon his return from new market in order to have it laid before the queen and cabinet to be examined and transmitted to your lordship with proper instructions in the mean time i am ordered to send a copy of it to

our first peers we had an unlucky business about two days ago that befell the muscovite ambassador who was arrested going out of his house and rudely treated by the bailiffs he was then upon his departure for his own country and the sum under a hundred pounds that stopped him and what makes the business the worse he has been punctual in his payments and had given order that this very sum should be paid the day after however as he is very well convinced that the government entirely disapproves such a proceeding there are no ill consequences apprehended from it your lordship knows that the privileges of ambassadors are under very little regulations in england and i believe that a bill will be promoted in the next parliament for setting them upon a certain foot at least it is what we talk of in both offices on this occasion  i am etc j addison  to the hon major david dunbar      sir i this morning urged to my lord lieutenant every thing you suggest in your letter and what else

in other company  i am afraid what you say of his grace the duke of marlborough  does not portend you any good  and now sir believe me when i assure you i never did nor ever will on any pretense whatsoever take more than the stated and customary fees of my office i might keep the contrary practice concealed from the world were i capable of it but i could not from my self and i hope i shall always fear the reproaches of my own heart more than those of all mankind in the mean time if i can serve a gentleman of merit and such a character as you bear in the world the satisfaction i meet with on such an occasion is always a sufficient and the only reward to  sir your most obedient humble servant j addison    these two letters relate to a very signal piece of service which mr addison did this gentleman in the year      when he was secretary to the earl of sunderland lord lieutenant of ireland it was so great a favor that major dunbar sent mr addison a bankbill of  00 l which he would not by any means accept after which he laid out the money in a diamondring which mr addison likewise rejected  mr b  ll  ss letter to mr t  r at bath aug      sir at this season london ceases to

to preside over the scarcity of fools pretty miss d  exposes her reputation to a thousand daily solicitations it is possible she may as yet retain her virtue if so she is certainly weary of her profession greatly opposite my friend is the character of the lady you inquire after whom i have not been able to see these six weeks save at her devotions on the sabbath where she was too deeply though most unfashionably engaged for me to claim any part of her attention i know you expect a rapture when i speak of her but i assure you her virtue awes and suppresses every idle thought she is a pattern to form an angel by and seems as though she would revenge on all mankind the devastations they have committed on her sex nothing has appeared worthy notice since your last i have however sent you something that has been handed about here i suppose intended as a satire upon your self you will smile to see all the rage of parnassus dwindled to this gentle hum with which my dear friend i shall conclude  yours etc  to the author mr jos turner it was printed in fol      of an epistle to mr pope occasioned by his epistle to the earl of burlington i while to our second jones s praise the

sting and deifies a punch alone to mr curll etc norwich june         sir for your second volume of literary correspondence etc i here send you an imitation of the feast of trimalchio from petronius arbiter compare it your self with the original or show it to mr pope or commit it to the flames which you please but if you print it you may say it was designed for the entertainment of our present mayor mr alderman vere member of parliament for norwich   your humble servant the translator  the feast of trimalchio imitaded from titus petronius arbiter convivium sybariticum praeludium the present age by a strange revolution of manners greatly resembles those profligate corrupt debauched vicious and abandoned times in which titus petronius arbiter lived and of which he has given so warm and lively a description in his satire that part relating to the feast of trimalchio remained through the injury of time imperfect till within these fourscore years when some fragments were found which completed the relation this is generally thought to represent the vices of nero who having devoted himself to the counsels of tigellinus his sole minister and favorite a man of obscure birth and corrupt principles did from the highest expectancy become a stubborn and a foolish tyrant there are some who think seneca to be described under the name of trimalchio others tigellinus in which view i shall at present take it although it is not so probable that he was the person intended by petronius in that character  the feast of trimalchio glutted with the public diversions of theaters amphitheatres and bacchanalian revels we visited the most sacred palaces of monarchy and beheld with aweful reverence the public banquettings of these earthly gods we saw the august emperor at his meals and we did see the people gape as he did eat i truly wondered that they should betray so much of the imperfection of human nature to the multitude who by this might discover that kings differed not at all from common men the luxury of the nation encouraged no entertainment which we did not partake of our ears were feasted with the most wanton and lascivious strains of instruments and voices and we could perceive the passions these airs inspired in the faces of an hundred beauties almost naked to the waist and now we purposed to retire and enjoy a weeks interval from the fatigues of pleasure when a slave came to inform us that his master caius pompeius trimalchio invited us to a repast where every man might speak his mind he is says the slave a man of infinite humor and a most excellent politician i assure you having dressed our selves we bid him conduct us to his master but in our way thither the streets were greatly thronged with horsemen who had been hunting and were now returning from the chase i was wholly taken up with the homage that was paid to one of the sportsmen and the grandeur of his equipage when menelaus a nobleman and one of his attendants steps up to us presenting a gentleman saying this is he with whom you are to dine  he was a portly man somewhat gouty and accosted every body with an affected smile upon our appearance he made an offer of alighting to receive us when the greater part of his retinue dismounted in an instant some of them held his bridle others took hold of his stirrup the rest bent their backs reclined their heads and threw themselves into the resemblance of so many horseblocks seeming to court his foot to tread upon their necks about which they wore a chain loose and careless to denote the pleasure they took in their servitude you may imagine this submission reduced the cavalcade to some disorder for my part i was quite abashed having never seen the like so flung my self upon the ground amongst the rest as did my companions in which we were very lucky for i afterward understood it was a ceremony required of every body that were to be his guests we were soon raised up mounted on led horses and the troop renewed it is former order marching regularly into a courtyard where we dismounted and walking to the entrance of the portico read this inscription  if any slave shall say aye or no contrary to the will of his master he shall be stripped of his livery and lose his wages  at the entrance of the hall was a glass room which i took to be the porters lodge and admired the contrivance but was presently convinced of my mistake when raised by pullies to the roof i discovered it to be a most stupendous lanthorn  we advanced to the staircase where a marketplace was described with slaves setting upon benches to the right and left to be bought and sold trimalchio hard by with a whip and bridle a little farther was represented how he first learnt to spell and beyond that was mercury holding him up by the chin and placing him on a throne fortune presented him with a cornucopia and the three fatal sisters spun a thread of gold he was in different places painted as a judge a general and a priest the whole was excellently performed and highly finished surfeited with this fulsom pageantry as we proceeded a slave stripped of his livery cast himself at our feet imploring our protection protesting his fault was inadvertency only that being roused from sleep and asked a question he knew nothing of he had said no when he should have said yes we were saluted by him in the dining room with thanks for the obligation which he told us was well bestowed for says he the wine my lord drinks you shall anon find to be in the disposal of his servants having viewed the sideboard the huge piles of massy plate and spacious cisterns double gilt on which trimalchios arms and name were engraven and it is weight marked on each piece we all seated ourselves except trimalchio for whom the chief place was reserved at the striking up of a band of music he made his entrance my friends says he i have business to dispatch but came thus soon lest my absence should make you uneasy now the servants entered sweating beneath the ponderous dishes which they seemed hardly able to support the flesh of bulls calves sheep deer and other quadrupeds all kinds of fish and fowl were stewed for the juices they contained which blended into one fluid formed a most delicious soup near in a golden charger were an hundred mangled vipers buried in their own blood in other dishes were the palates of cuckows the rumps of wheatears the brains of nightingales cavear of todpoles an onocrotalon the hump of a camel the proboscis of an elephant and a sows paps i knew not a seventh part of this course the greatest share of which was scrambled away before it could be distinctly viewed a slave in the hurry threw down a golden dish and stooping to take it up trimalchio gave him a sound box on the ear and ordered it to be swept out of the room the salvers rang and wine went briskly round when every body said something in praise of this service this applause was followed with a second and that indifferent considering the place the novelty of it however drew our attention it was a round table on which were placed the twelve signs in their proper order upon each of which the disposer had put some thing suitable upon aries was a sheepshead upon taurus a chine of beef upon gemini lambsstones and kidneys upon cancer a ducalcoronet upon leo the africanfruit upon virgo sausages upon libra a pair of scales in the one a pudding in the other a panegyric upon scorpio a sprat upon sagittarius a hare upon capricorn a lobster upon aquarius a goose upon pisces two mullets and in the middle a plate of sweet herbs now trimalchio entreated us to be merry called for more wine and larger glasses the company were highly elevated several courses followed too nauseous and tedious to relate i asked one of the guests who that woman was that scutled up and down the room her name is fortunata says he she is the wife of trimalchio she measures her money by the bushel and yet she sprang from a dunghill not long since no man would have touched her with a pair of tongs now she is his heaven his all in all what she says must be truth she is a wagtail a mere shrew a magpye whom she loves she loves and whom she loves not she hates trimalchio knows not half his income nor extent of his estate  the sun himself surveys it not at once but travels for the view a crow cannot fly over it in a week he buys nothing yet owns the whole town inhabits it all and is himself the people a twentieth part of his tenants dont know their landlord there are thirty degrees amongst his servants he has twentysix domesticchaplains and three orders of his favorites whom he teaches to jump over a stick he is himself a lover of peace for when the alemains and gauls were at war he sent and desired to be friends  upon this another orator arose and thus delivered himself the world the whole world cannot be ignorant of the virtues of our patron caius the government of provinces the high trusts and principal employments of rome are not bestowed by favor but merit nothing is now considered but integrity and worth what good work is left undone the luminous dignitaries of the church the immortal charges of the war the trade and flourishing opulency of the people the increasing glory and grandeur of the state these our romans shall record to perpetuity the honors of trimalchio which consist not in his many eminent and great employments but in his transcendent liberality profound policy and the ardent and unextinguished love he bears his country in whose incorrupt hands we are as counters and what just now stood for millions shall at his pleasure dwindle to ciphers we had now got our full dose and were grown sick of this fulsom slave when trimalchio leaning on his elbow thus spoke  this wine said he is good and fish should swim let us be merry and exercise our lungs as well as teeth well peace be with my masters bones say i who made a man of me you can tell me nothing which i dont know i never was outwitted for i am a thorough master of the practicks here he explained the heavens by banquets and showed us the influence of each sign upon our nativity clapping our hands and hollooing we rang an universal peal to his applause and swore all the philosophers and astrologers in the world were fools to him upon this he called for his will and ordered it to be read this set the whole family in tears and their howling was as grievous as their joy before had been excessive he repeated his epitaph himself which he assured us was of his own composing no doubt says he you wonder how i became so great considering my age for these teeth i lost when i was a boy and i have prospered ever since i was ever bold and confident because a fortune tellers informed me how long i had to live he run on thus for a great while when one behind thus whispered me this trimalchio says he is a pitiful scoundrel and his retinue a pack of rascals he became the mighty despicable thing he is by fawning wriggling whispering intriguing bargaining and backbiting no honest man can eat drink sleep or enjoy the light of the sun without paying an excise for the support of his luxury as if the gifts of providence were at his sole disposal sir continued he i never would wish for a better estate than the property of printing his last dying speech this fellows bluntness made me smile and the company withdrawing to the baths gito ascyltos and my self took this opportunity of stealing away unperceived among the crowd  plaudite  to colonel william stanhope now earl of harrington  oct        dear sir though after addressing two letters to you just before it may seem impertinent to trouble you so soon with a third yet i cannot resist the temptation of giving you joy upon your late promotion in which i hope you may find your interest as well as your inclination gratified while the rest of the world are making their court upon this occasion in town i am content here in the country to read the triumphs of my friends twice a week in the gazette my ambition at present is turned quite another way and all my humble endeavors are directed to please the fair there is a little papist villain in the neighborhood it is a defect in our language that the termination of the adjective does not mark the gender but you are to understand this in the foeminine who has robbed me of my heart and i have scarce had an hours sound sleep except it was at church these two months i know that all this is very ridiculous and that an halfpay officer ought no more to be in love than a common whore people of such precarious subsistence should give into no passion that is not supported by gain but when indiscretion cheats us in the shape of pleasure who can escape the snare i have this comfort still in reserve that as i have an heart entirely english it is odds i shall not continue two months longer in the same mind there is one instance however of my constancy that will never i am sure be impeached i wish indeed it were not clogged with the obligations you have laid upon me and then you would know it as much upon the account of your personal merit as any favors you have conferred on me that i profess my self  sir your most faithful and obedient servant richardson pack  to young lady who told me the army had no religion and challenged me to show her a prayer that had been made by a soldier madam it was always with the greatest attention that i received the honor of your commands and it is an equal pleasure to me when i am employed to execute them but the task you imposed upon me last night was what i confess surprised me in a visit where i hoped to have been entertained as a lover i little expected to be consulted as a divine nor did i believe you would have had the curiosity instead of hearkening to the faithful vows i was addressing to you to enquire about those i made to heaven as st paul became all things to all men that he might gain some so i find too i speak it under all the restrictions of modesty that a man must become all things to all women if he would pretend to succeed with any it is an unaccountable prejudice that prevails of late against our profession and particularly among the fair sex who seem to judge that virtue and vice consist rather in the dress of a tribe than the habit of the mind the prayer i send you enclosed which i give you my word of honor was made by a soldier will i hope convince you there are some military men who deserve not to be excommunicated from the chastest drawingrooms i shall submit to your lady mother whether the author or her chaplain be the better casuist of the two but when the question shall arise about a gallant i beg you to believe you will never find one who is with more devotion than my self  madam your most faithful etc richardson pack  a soldiers prayer o god thou searcher of hearts and judge of all men before whose awful throne we should tremble to approach did not thy mercy make thy justice less terrible look down i beseech thee with favor and compassion upon me miserable sinner pardon my offenses and pity my infirmities be not extreme to mark my follies for in thy sight shall no man living be justified remember i am but poor dust and ashes the child of vanity and the sport of passions without thy aid o lord all our endeavors after righteousness are fruitless all our wisdom empty pride all our happiness delusion do thou enlighten therefore my mind and sanctify my heart that i may know and practice the things that belong to my peace redeem me from the bondage of my sins and raise me to the fellowship of thy saints o let not the many and repeated instances of my guilt provoke thee to withdraw from me the assistance of thy holy spirit but accept of my unfeigned repentance second my resolutions of amendment and secure me from the danger of a relapse particularly o lord guard me from the temptation of  here mention those sins to which you are most subject by nature or evil custom which i have so often committed even after the clear conviction and professed abhorrence of my own conscience and thereby merited thy most heavy displeasure set thy law ever before me that the terror of thy threats may restrain me from vice and the encouragement of thy promises incite me to virtue make my obedience to thy will my delight as well as my duty that i may serve thee with purity and truth not by starts only when afflictions may humble me or the eye of the world observe me but in a constant uniform and sincere devotion without lukewarmness without hyprocrisy  after thy spiritual graces in the second place i beg a blessing upon my temporal concerns prosper my honest endeavors in that station wherein thy providence has placed me in this world give me the benefit of health and the quiet of contentment in all my fortunes protect me from all open violence or injuries and defend me from the arrows that fly in the dark the backbitings of a malicious and the flatteries of a deceitful tongue bless all my relations and friends forgive and reconcile my enemies teach me to make a right use of both that the malice of the one my awaken my caution and the kindness of the other confirm my constancy let me not live wholly unprofitable in my generation give me the honest ambition of deserving well of as many as i am able in all my aims desires and hopes let me consider the dignity of my nature and study to promote the glory of thy name  lastly as in duty bound i offer up my most hearty praise and thanksgiving for all thy mercies and benefits vouchsafed to me thy unworthy servant for my creation preservation amidst all the dangers with which i have been encompassed and for all the comforts and advantages of this life but above all for the glorious prospect of a better through the merits of thy son my redeemer to whom with thee and the holy ghost be ascribed etc  to mr curll sussex june  0      sir not long since here happened a very agreeable adventure the duchess of richmond and two ladies her companions greatly honored in being made so had so close an affection for each other that nothing but night could separate them in the daytime whatever was proposed by one the other two instantly complied with and there was but one inconvenience of which they complained the retiringroom in the garden had but two holes to redress this grievance an ingenious gentleman mr tho hill fellow of trin coll camb  made the following merry ballad called the third hole which needs no farther explanation than what will be found in the performance it self  yours etc  the third hole a ballad to the tune of packingtons pound i the graces were playfellows never asunder as horace and all the old poets agree this being once granted why then it is no wonder that whenever you saw one you always saw three in bed and at table still inseparable nor mortal nor god to part em was able nay even to do that which goddesses do if one had occasion still went the other two ii so in sussex at goodwood the seat of his grace the duke of richmond three nymphs or three graces choose whether o were i but horace their praises to thrill from morning to even were always together and did as we say the same thing in a quill in the park or the grove below or above not an inch ever a one from the other would move one only thing grieved em and fretted their souls where there should have been three there were but two holes iii with curtsy full low to the prince of the place in terms the most moving they jointly petition by all that is sacred

long congratulate them and give thanks to the prince by clearing your voices and aiding my song for now they may squat and sing laugh or chat yet all under one without hindrance do that and at the same time may their friendship improve by what we all count the beginning of love vi as for me this same ballad which now i compose with whatever else i hereafter shall write or poem or letter in verse or in prose be the subject what twill or serious or light nay yet farther still my intent to fulfill the last and the soberest writing my will i as freely resign as i would my own soul to that of the three that is your ladyships hole a decree for concluding the treaty between dr swift and mrs long the following papers are published from the cabinet of mrs anne long of draycot in wiltshire  whereas it has been signified to us that there is now a treaty of acquaintance on foot between dr swift of leicesterfields on the one part and mrs long of albemarlestreet on the other part and whereas the said dr swift upon the score of his merit and extraordinary qualities does claim the sole and undoubted right that all persons whatsoever shall make such advances to him as he pleases to demand any law claim custom privilege of sex beauty fortune or quality to the contrary notwithstanding  and whereas the said mrs long humbly acknowledging and allowing the right of the said doctor does yet insist upon certain privileges and exceptions as a lady of the toast these verses were written by the late earl of wharton in the year   0  round one of the toasting glasses of the kitcatclub fill the glass let hautboys sound whilst bright longys health goes round with eternal beauty blessed ever blooming still the best drink your glass and think the rest   which privileges she does allege are excepted out of the doctors general claim and which she cannot betray without injuring the whole body whereof she is a member by which impediment the said treaty is not yet brought to a conclusion to the great grievance and damage of mrs van homrigh and her fair daughter hessy it was this lady who occasioned the deans poem entitled cadenus and vanessa   and whereas the decision of this weighty cause is refered to us in our judicialcapacity we out of our tender regard to truth and justice having heard and duly considered the allegations of both parties do declare adjudge decree and determine that the said mrs long notwithstanding any privileges she may claim as aforesaid as a lady of the toast shall without essoin or demurr in two hours after the publishing of this decree make all advances to the said doctor that he shall demand and that the said advances shall not be made to the said doctor as un homme sans consequence but purely upon account of his great merit  and we do hereby strictly forbid the said mrs van homrigh and her fair daughter hessy to aid abet comfort to encourage her the said mrs long in her disobedience for the future and in consideration of the said mrs longs being a toast we think it just and reasonable that the doctor should permit her in all companies to give herself the reputation of being one of his acquaintance which no other lady shall presume to do upon any pretense whatsoever without his especial leave and license first had and obtained  by especial command g v homrigh  to mrs anne long at draycot near chippenham in wiltshire from

all his insinuation it having let me into such a happy converse with so sweet a scribe i must confess had it been my own case i know not how i might have been tempted into the like enormity under such

hours walk by severn side had the subject been better handled i know there are some thoughts in it would please you but since you are humbly contented with dull friends you must even take up with dull poetry my chief reason for writing it was to convince you that i was out of the spleen and in the best manner i could to show my gratitude for your not resenting my impertinencies whilst i was in it

avoid it the dead and the living my friends and my foes at home and abroad call upon me to say something and the reputation of an history which i and all the world value must have suffered had i continued silent i have printed here in hopes that somebody afterward may venture to reprint in england notwithstanding those two frightening words at the close of it his name whether that happens or not it is fit you should have a sight of it who i know will read it with some degree of satisfaction as it is mine though it should have as it really has nothing else to recommend it such as it is extremum hoc munus morientis habeto for that may well be the case considering that within a few months i am entering into my seventieth year after which even the healthy and the happy cannot much depend upon life and will not if they are wise much desire it whenever i go you will lose a friend who loves and values you extremely if in my circumstances i can be said to be lost to any one when dead more than i am already whilst living i expected to have heard from you by mr morice and wondered a little that i did not but he owns himself in a fault for not giving you due notice of his motions it was not amiss that you forbore writing to me on a head wherein i promised more than i was able to perform disgraced men fancy sometimes that they preserve an influence where when they endeavor to exert it they soon see their mistake i did so my good friend and acknowledge it under my hand you sounded the coast and found out my error it seems before i was aware of it but enough on this subject  what are you doing in england to the honor of letters and particularly what are you doing ipse quid audes quae circumvolitas agilis thyma do you pursue the moral plan the essay on man you marked out and seemed sixteen months ago so intent upon am i to see it perfected ere i die and are you to enjoy the reputation of it while you live or do you rather choose to leave the marks of your friendship like the legacies of a will to be read and enjoyed only by those who survive you were i as near you as i have been i should hope to peep into the manuscript before it was finished but alas there is and will ever probably be a great deal of land and sea between us how many books have come out of late in your parts which you think i should be glad to peruse name them the catalogue i believe will not cost you much trouble they must be good ones indeed to challenge any part of my time now i have so little of it left i who squandred whole days heretofore now husband hours when the glass begins to run low and care not to misspend them on trifles at the end of the lottery of life our last minutes like tickets left in the wheel rise in their valuation they are not of so much worth perhaps in themselves as those which preceded but we are apt to prize them more and with reason i do so my dear friend and yet think the most precious minutes of my life are well employed in reading what you write but this is a satisfaction i cannot much hope for and therefore must betake myself to others which are less entertaining adieu dear sir and forgive me engaging with one whom you i think have reckoned among the heroes of the dunciad it was necessary for me either to accept of his dirty challenge or to have suffered in the esteem of the world by declining it my respects to your mother i send a paper for dean swift if you have an opportunity and think it worth your while to convey it my country at this distance seems to me a strange sight i know not how it appears to you who are in the midst of the scene and yourself a part of it i wish you would tell me you may write safely to mr morice by the honest hand that conveys this and will return into these parts before christmas sketch out a rough draught of it that i may be able to judge whether a return to it be really eligible or whether i should not like the chemist in the bottle upon hearing don quevedos account of spain desire to be corked up again after all i do and must love my country with all its faults and blemishes even that part of the constitution which wounded me unjustly and itself through my side shall ever be dear to me my last wish will be like that of father paul esto perpetua and when i die at a distance from it it will be in the same manner as virgil describes the expiring peloponnesian sternitur and dulces moriens reminiscitur argos   do i still live in the memory of my friends as they certainly do in mine i have read a good many of your paper squabbles about me and am glad to see such free concessions on that head though made with no view of doing me a pleasure but merely of loading another  i am etc fr roffen  bishop atterburys vindication paris oct         i have lately seen an extract of some passages in mr oldmixons history of england the first of them is said to be taken from his preface to that history page   and runs in these words  i have in more than one place of this history mentioned the great reason there is to suspect that the history of the rebellion as it was published at oxford was not entirely the work of the lord clarendon who did indeed write an history of those times and i doubt not a very good one wherein as i have been i believe well informed the characters of the kings whose reigns are written were different from what they appear in the oxford history and its copy mr echards i speak this by hearsay but hearsay from a person superior to all suspicion and too illustrious to be named without leave  i also humbly refer it to the decision of another very honorable person whether there is not to his knowledge such an history in manuscript still extant and to a reverend doctor now living whether he did not see the oxford copy by which the book was printed altered and interpolated while it was at the press  to which i must add that there is now in custody of a gentleman of distinction both for merit and quality george duckett esquire one of the commissioners of the excise a history of the rebellion of the first folio edition scored in many places by mr edmund smith of christchurch oxon author of that excellent tragedy phaedra and hippolytus who himself altered the manuscript history and added what he has there marked as he confessed with some of his last words before his death these alterations written with his own hand and to be seen by any one that knows it may be published on another occasion with a farther account of this discovery in the mean time for the satisfaction of the public i insert a letter entire which i received since the last paragraph was written    to mr  oldmixon  sir accidentally looking on some of the sheets of your history of england during the reigns of the royal house of stuart at the booksellers i find that you mention the history of lord clarendon wherein you justly question the genuineness of that book in order to put the matter out of doubt i here send you the following account  mr edmund smith a man very well known to the learned world came down to make me a visit at  about june    0 where he continued till he died about six weeks after  as our conversation chiefly ran upon learning and history you may easily think that clarendons was not forgotten upon mentioning that book he frankly told me that there had been a fine history written by lord clarendon but what was published under his name was only patchwork and might as properly be called the history of alsmall and atterbury for to his knowledge twas altered nay that he himself was employed by them to interpolate and alter the original  he then asked me whether i had the book by me if i had he would convince me of the truth of his assertion by the very printed copy i immediately brought him the folio edition and the first thing he turned to was the character of mr hampden where is that expression he had a head to contrive a heart to conceive and a hand to execute any villainy the words are much softer in the history where instead of a heart to conceive we find a tongue to persuade and instead of the word villainy that of mischief as the citation is in another part of this extract truly made the unknown writer of this letter while he is charging others with the crime of falsifying lord clarendons history should have taken care to stand clear of it himself he then declared it was foisted in by those reverends sir i have only to add this that he not only underlined this passage as a forgery but gave during the short time he lived with me the same remark to some hundreds more    i am sir etc george duckett    in a second passage said to be taken from page     of the history itself mr oldmixon is represented as expressing himself thus  in the character of this great and excellent man mr hampden which we could wish had escaped his lord clarendons drawings or the drawings of those clumsey painters into whose hands his work fell there is something so very false and base that such coin could only come from a college mint in a word what was said of cinna might well be applied to hampden he had a head to contrive and a tongue to persuade and a hand to execute any mischief his death therefore seemed to be a great deliverance to the nation  there are not words to express the infamy of this slander and imposture nor the unparalled wickedness of those doctors who foisted so horrid a reflection into that character the person who did it was mr edmund smith of oxford author of phaedra and hippolytus a tragedy who at his death confessed to the gentleman in whose house he died that among a great number of alterations and additions which he himself made in the history of the rebellion by order of doctor aldrich doctor atterbury and doctor smallridge successive deans of christchurch this very saying of cinna applied to mr hampden was one and when he read it to one of those doctors he clapped him on the back and cried with an asseveration it will do the confession mr smith made and the remorse he expressed for being concerned in this imposture were his last words    a great part of the first of these passages including the letter is translated verbatim into french and published in a journal entitled bibliotheque raisonnee des ouvrages des savans de leurope pour les mois de juillet aoust septembre    0 tome   me   re party a amsterdam chez les westeins and smith    0 art   page     etc  after which the journalist adds the following reflection  cette decouverte fait peu dhonneur auxtrois theologiens qui sont nommez dans la lettre and qui ont pourtant tenu un grand rang dans langleterre and dans la republique des lettres comme mr atterbury cidevant evesque de rochester lun des trois est encore vivant il ne sera pas apparemment insensible a une accusation si grave and le public attend de lui les eclaircissemens que linterest seul de sa reputation semble en exiger sil se tait dans cette rencontre il ny a point de doubt que la falsification est prouvee and quand mesme il ne ce tairoit pas il faut que les eclaircissemens soient bien forts pour detruire ces faits  this discovery does little honor to the three divines named in the letter etc as mr atterbury heretofore bishop of rochester one of the three is still living he will not probably be insensible of so grievous an accusation and the public expects from him such accounts of it as even the interest of his own reputation seems to require if he is silent on this occasion there can be no doubt but that the falsification is proved and should he not be silent what he shall say to clear up this matter must be very strong to destroy the credit of such a testimony  being called upon in this public manner i myself obliged to declare that the foregoing account in all its parts as far as i am any ways concerned is entirely false and groundless for i never saw my lord clarendons history in manuscript either before or since the edition of it nor ever read a line of it but in print it was impossible therefore that i should deal with mr smith in the manner represented with whom as far as i can recollect i never exchanged one word in all my life and whom i know not that i ever saw till after the edition of that history if therefore he expressed himself to this purpose in his last moments as i charitably hope he did not he wronged me extremely and died with a lie in his mouth  this vindication of the truth and myself is necessary since i happen to survive the two other worthy persons mentioned were they alive they would i doubt not be equally able and ready to clear themselves from so foul an aspersion as to one of them dr smallridge the late bishop of bristol no suspicion of this kind can possibly rest on his memory because he was not any ways concerned in preparing that history for the press but as much a stranger to the contents of it as i myself was till it came forth in print i speak with the more assurance on this head because my great intimacy with him as my contemporary both at westminster and christchurch gave me all the advantages requisite toward knowing the truth of what i say with dr aldrich the third person accused i was acquainted more at a distance however being called upon in the manner i am i will add also what has come to my knowledge with regard to the share he and others had in the publication of that history  the revising of the manuscript written as i have heard not very correctly was committed to the care of bishop sprat and dean aldrich by the late earl of rochester who himself also assisted in that revisal from the beginning to the end of the work so that any changes made in it must have had the consent of those three persons they were men of probity and truth and incapable of conspiring in a design to impose on the public i can cite nothing that is material in this point from the mouth of the earl with whom i rarely conversed but the bishop and the dean to whom i severally succeeded in the deaneries of christchurch and westminster and in the sea of rochester have occasionally more than once assured me that no additions whatsoever were made to the manuscript history and even the earl in his preface to the first volume for his i take it to be though no name is affixed to it has publicly protested his innocence in this respect where he declares that they who put forth the history he means himself and his brother as appears from what follows durst not take upon them to make any alterations in a work of this kind solemnly left with them to be published whenever it should be published as it was delivered to them  could he and the two other persons by him employed be supposed to have made any additions notwithstanding such assurances to the contrary yet their good sense if not their integrity would have prevented at least their retouching those characters which are allowed to be the most distinguished and beautiful part of the work and to have something of original in them that is not to be imitated the afterstrokes of any less able pencil intermixed with those of the first masterly hand would soon be discovered and yet i am persuaded the most discerning eye can find out no traces of such a mixture no not in the character of mr hampden even in those words at the close of it against which mr oldmixon so warmly declaims they are perfectly in the style and manner of my lord clarendon they contain nothing new in them but only sum up in short what he had scattered through different parts of the two first volumes let the reflections there made be never so severe they may naturally be supposed in the warmth of composure to have come from the pen of an historian who had himself with zeal opposed mr hampdens measures and both seen and felt the sad consequences of them but that the editors of his history no ways concerned in those transactions should  0 years afterward coolly and deliberately make such a needless insertion is not to be imagined  the complaint on this and other heads should have been brought against these editors while it was capable of being thoroughly examined at present it comes a little too late unless it were better supported their very characters to those who knew them and the nature of the evidence to those who did not will be judged a sufficient confutation of it for pray what is this evidence it consists in an hearsay from a person superior to all suspicion it seems but too illustrious to be named in an appeal to another very honorable person to a reverend doctor now living and to a gentleman of distinction both for merit and quality none of whose names are thought fit to be owned the only one produced in the case is that of mr smith the author of an excellent tragedy but certainly not an author of rank and weight enough to blast the credit of such an excellent history of what use can this testimony be to his purpose even supposing the account of it exact when it is undoubtedly false as to two of the three persons it is levelled at dr smallridge and myself and may therefore be justly presumed alike false as to the third dr aldrich mr smith appears to have been so little in the secret of the edition of that book as not to have known even the hands through which it passed and is not therefore to be relied upon in his accounts of any other circumstances relating to it especially with regard to dr aldrich his governor at christchurch for whom his personal aversion and the true reasons of it are too well understood to need explaining i forbear saying any thing harsh of one not able to answer for himself but many now alive who knew them both know how improbable and altogether incredible it is that mr smith should have had the least share in dr aldrichs confidence on so nice or indeed on any occasion the gentleman who seems to be convinced of the truth of mr smith s assertions by his having pointed out and underlined the passages in print which he said he was employed by the three successive deans to interpolate and alter in manuscript must surely have been very willing to be convinced otherwise he would not have taken a mere assertion for a proof in such a cause and from such a person the story of this deathbed declaration slept for about twenty years near thirty have passed since the history of the rebellion was published i mean the first part of it and not a few since the death of every person that either was or is falsely said to have been concerned in that publication myself only excepted i might probably at the distance of montpelier where i was when mr oldmixon wrote never have heard of what he lays to my charge intelligence of that kind being as he knows not very open to me or should it reach me i might yet in my present circumstances be supposed not oversollicitous to appear in the disproof of it the delay of the accusation therefore if without design was not without its advantages and had it been deferred a little longer till i was not only out of the way but out of the world it had had a still fairer chance toward being uncontradicted and consequently credited i have lived to hear this idle tale and to bear witness against it there is no vanity in hoping that old as i am i shall outlive the belief of it an holland journal gave me the first notice how i had been treated and by that means an opportunity of vindicating myself which i was the rather determined not to decline because i suffered in company with others men of great note and merit through whose sides the authority of a noble and useful part of our english history was struck at where i only am aspersed and wronged i can i thank god more easily practice patience and submit to indignities and injuries in silence a foreign writer has used me in this case with greater civility and temper than mr oldmixon whom i know not that i have ever offended i forgive him his ill words and his hard thoughts and only desire him for the future not to indulge himself in illnatured relations of this kind without better vouchers his attack on me and on the dead who he thought might be insulted with equal safety is no proof of a generous and worthy mind nor has he done any honor to his own history by the fruitless pains he has taken to discredit that of my lord clarendon which like the character of its author will gain strength by time and will be in the hands and esteem of all men when mr oldmixons unjust censure of it will not be remembered or not regarded  fr roffen  to  dear sir your endeavors that i may forget my misfortunes are truly noble it would be to deserve them to fly from resolution they shall not depress me but i must help to bear what you tell me lies so heavy upon my friends i preserve a mean which is the excellence justice and fitness of all things in the moral system  virtues a mean and vice is an excess in doing more thans fit or doing less to poetise my friend is no mark of a depressed fancy or excessive sorrow but a sort of a comical way of treating things serious not after the subtle fashions of those you speak of that would magnify nature by depressing the deity who setting forth their necessary agreement make unnecessary strife with reverence do i mention these things and know  how the great love of nature fills thy mind and universal kindness to thy kind i am while thus juvenile an advocate for and not a railer against extremes these symptoms strongly bode a second youth that vapors with a feeble and defective flame it is the innervated arm of priam impotently raised against the thundering rage of youthful pyrrhus  however this epistle my dear friend shall not become more tawdry by its not being of a piece for i will conclude with answering your last serious question with another scrap of poetry  whatever the soul of nature has designed and wrought on matter is the effect of mind the form of substance is the formers art hence beauty and design that strike the heart there is naught in simple matter to delight it is the fair workmanship that takes the sight the beautiful effect of mind alone is comely and in all things comely shown where mind is not there horror needs must be for matter formless is deformity extracts of several original letters written about the year      by bishop atterbury to an ingenious french gentleman for whom he had a great esteem  the book memoirs and reflections sur les principaux evenemens du regne de louis xiv i now restore you gave me pleasure when i read it the turn is natural and familiar and there is an air of truth in all he says but i think not the hand of a master he tells his tale not like a man who knows any thing of the rules of writing well but as an easy companion at a table i say of his style what he says of his figure ma figure qui n etoit pas deplaisante quoique je ne fusse pas du premier order des gens bien faits ie my figure which did not displease though i could not be ranked among handsome people of the first class though not of the first or even second order of good writers he is yet agreeable i cannot possibly digest his taking notice p     of the chevalier de rohans fine legs an observation that i should have expected rather from the pen of a fine lady and which shows that the marquis was in his nature a little too intent on such trifles he is sensible of it and excuses himself in the words which follow but that excuse serves only to show the strength of the impression he was under in this respect since he had judgment enough to see the fault and commits it notwithstanding though i see he is manifestly piqud against lewis xiv and his minister louvois yet i am apt to believe him in all he says of both of them his resentment seems to carry him no farther than to give him the privilege of speaking what he knew to be true and as the world goes he that allows himself to censure the great even thus far must say a great deal of ill of them of several french poets he speaks thus  rousseau appears to me still a greater poet the more i consider him his talents are unconfined and enable him in every sort of writing to which he turns himself equally to excel but the old hard words he makes use of puzzle me often who care not to consult a dictionary and chiefly in his allegories chaulieu la fare and chapelle have many graces of the easy and natural style but i do not think them so perfect in their way as rousseau is in his nor to tell you the truth do i take such pleasure in reading them the letters particularly of chaulieu etc are not masterpieces in their kind and many of his little copies of verses have nothing extraordinary in them the copy which touched me most is the ode on fontenay muses qui dans ce lieu champetre etc   i cannot but observe that under all chaulieus seeming gaiety there is an air of melancholy which breaks out by fits and shows he was not at ease in his own mind he endeavors to conceal it and acts the brave but his readers with a little penetration may see through the disguise the fears of death haunt him perpetually and appear even in those places where he says he is not afraid of it i should be glad to know how he died whether with the same courage he commends in lady mazarine i should guess not by the observations i have made of him  after perusing a dissertation of mr de boze the bishop makes the following remark  this book i find was written two and thirty years ago and therefore it is no wonder that it should not be equal to the later performances of the same author one may say of it as tully speaks of his collection of paradoxes non tale est hoc opus ut in art poni possit quasi illa minerva phidiae sed tamen ut ex eadem officina exisse appareat though it be not of the same value with his other works yet it is such as that one may perceive the same workmans hand and skill in it he chose a little contracted subject and had not room therefore to show his talents at full length in managing it and yet narrow and dry as his subject is he has by making several little digressions and by taking occasion to say many things which were not necessary to his point rendered it not only instructive but entertaining in tenui labor at tenuis non gloria si quem numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus apollo whether his forth gordean be a reality or a phantom whether he owes his very being to this gentleman or is only rescued from oblivion and brought again to life by him let the antiquaries determine i am so easy and indolent as not to think it of much moment which way such facts are settled nor should i have thought what is written on this point worth reading if this author had not writ it in all he writes one sees the same candor and impartiality the same learning good sense and exactness if the argument he handles be not of importance he makes it so by his manner of handling it so that i could wish instead of four books he had written forty as old as i am and as many other things as i have to do i should read all of them i have perused says the bishop in another letter the book about this is the work entitled reflections critiques sur la poesy and la peinture by abbe du bos a new edition of it with corrections and additions has been published by the author since the writing of this letter poetry and painting with attention it is written in a very good gout and has excellent things in it i have been pleased with no book so much that has fallen in my way since i came into france however i could wish those philosophical reasonings had been omitted they belong rather to a member of the academy of sciences than to one of the forty and perhaps will neither convince nor please in such a performance the author seems to have gone too deep in that sort of reflections and sometimes not to have gone deep enough in others which relate more immediately and naturally to his subject forgive this freedom but it is my real sense of the matter besides there is i think a want of method in the whole the author has changed the order and disposition of his work in the last edition of it  and the   th section which is so long is to me a little obscure the many learned citations there do not clear but cloud the authors meaning i am apt to imagine that in the musical part of it he speaks of what he does not himself thoroughly understand for if he does he would probably have expressed himself so that his reader also would have understood it which as to me at least is not the case in one thing i differ from him essentially my fixed opinion is that the reputation of all books which are perfectly well writ comes originally from the few and not from the many and i think i could say a good deal in defense of that opinion i see him here and every where under the image of urbani parcentis viribus atque extenuantis eas consulto he seldom speaks out where he is likely to offend but contents himself oftentimes rather to infinuate than affirm and makes use of other mens words to express his own sense where he is unwilling too openly to own it or too strongly to press it ab art sua non recessit as tully says of aristoxenus even in his judgment of the belles lettres he plays the politician i could not but observe how in the last section but one he has furnished mr de voltaire with the hint of his poem on the ligue upon the whole i repeat my thanks to you for the great satisfaction which the reading of these the last edition is in three volumes two volumes has given me as to mr arnaulds piece entitled reflections sur leloquence though what he says there be sensible and just yet i do not see much of the great man in it and had no great pleasure in perusing it  the following remarks are made upon mr fontenelles manner of writing etc  i return you sir the two eloges which i have perused with pleasure i borrow that word from your language because we have none in our own that exactly expresses it by the account i had of those pieces i imagined them very different from what i find them mr fontenelles talents as to the knowledge of nature mathematics and the belles lettres are sufficiently understood but i take notice particularly of the art and address with which he conducts himself in nice points and the prudent and political views by which his pen is guided a quality that does not often belong to men who have spent so much of their time in studying the arts and sciences he has been misinformed as to one little particular in the short draught he has given us of sir isaac newtons figure the the very lively and piercing eye oeil fort vif and fort percant which he gives him did not belong to him at least not for twenty years past about which time i first came acquainted with him indeed in the whole air of his face and make there was nothing of that penetrating sagacity which appears in his composures he had something rather languid in his look and manner which did not raise any great expectation in those who did not know him i see mr fontenelle speaks warily as to the mss relating to antiquity history and divinity which sir isaac left behind him i wish for the honor of our country that they may be as excellent in their kind as those he published but i fear the case is otherwise and that he will be found to have been a great master only in that one way to which he was by nature inclined it is enough for us poor limited creatures if we remarkably excel in any one branch of knowledge we may have a smattering of more but it is beyond the lot of our nature to attain any perfection in them mr fontenelles praise of sir isaacs modesty and of modesty in general is to me the most pleasing part of that description he has given us of him it is that modesty which will teach us to speak and think of the ancients with reverence especially if we happen not to be thoroughly acquainted with them sir isaac certainly was and his great veneration for them was one distinguishing part of his character which i wonder or rather i do not wonder that mr fontenelle has omitted his opinion of them was that they were men of great genius and superior minds who had carried their discoveries particularly in astronomy and other parts of mathematics much farther than now appears from what remains of their writings one may apply to them what was said by an old learned man to one of less knowledge and fewer years who insulted him i have forgot more knowledge than ever you had more of the ancients is lost than is preserved and perhaps our new discoveries are not equal to those old losses  but this was not what i had in my thoughts when i sat down to write my intention was only to express the satisfaction i had in the perusal of what i return of which i could say more if the end of the page did not admonish me to tell you how much i am etc  the book entitled dissertation sur la music des anciens by the abbe de chateneuf i send you back is written in a very sensible and agreeable manner with a fine turn of thoughts and words as far as i am able to judge i could wish only that the writer had been a greater master of his subject so as to have given us distincter and fuller accounts of it which would have left no doubts upon the minds of his readers i am satisfied that a pen like his would have been able to express the most nice and difficult points of which he treats in a way equally instructive and pleasing and have opened to us in dialogue the mysteries of music as easily and familiarly as monsieur fontenelle has done those of astronomy the picture of leontium with which the reflections conclude is exquisitely drawn not only con studio but con amore as the italians speak of the favorite pieces of their best masters one would think the book was written on purpose for the sake of the character at the end of it as the most material part of a letter is sometimes carelessly thrown into a postscript i dare say mademoiselle a celebrated french actress lenclos was of the authors acquaintance hearsay could not have furnished him with so lively a description of her there is something in the picture that shows it was painted by the life and not copied from another one thing he says of her p   pardon the remark seems in some degree applicable to himself his words are very good and therefore i transcribe them son gout en le conduisant de fleur en fleur comme les abeilles lui fait courir indifferemment tous les pays and tous les siecles mais ces sorts dimaginations si legeres and si brillantes a dedaignent pour lordinaire le travail dattention un esprit ne pour les agremens and qui na jamais sacrifie quaux graces na guard de sassujetir a la patience qui seroit necessaire pour comparer les beautes dun tems avec celles dune autre pour etudier les rapports and les oppositions qui sont enter else pour les tourner de tous les sens dont on peut les envisager ensin pour y rapporter la triste and penible exactitude que demand une parallele ie his taste guiding him from flower to flower like the bees makes him rove indiscriminately through all countries and all ages but these kind of very sprightly and shining imaginations generally disdain a labor that requires attention a genius born for charms and which has never sacrificed but to the graces can never subject itself to the patience that would be necessary in order for comparing the beauties of one age with those of another to study the relations and oppositions that are between them to view them in all the lights in which they can be considered in sine to bestow upon them the melancholy and painful exactness which is requisite for the forming of a parallel    let me ask you for my own information whether tourner de tous les sens be a proper phrase in that case to me it seems to spoil the metaphor he cites some authorities which i am at a loss to explain particularly p    that of varro de repub romans l   c   sure he does not mean the ancient varro who wrote nothing that i know of under that title he is beholden i find to the long chapter of abbe du bois where the ancient authorities relating to his subject are collected and he has made a free use of them but my intention was to tell you rather what pleased me in the book than what i disliked  from what i have read in these books and other pieces since i came on this side of the water i have conceived a much greater opinion of the bishop of meaux than i had while in england and give him readily the preference to all those writers of the church of france which i am acquainted with he is an universal genius and manages every thing he takes in hand like a master good sense and sound reflections attend all he says which is expressed in the most agreeable and beautiful manner without any of the pomp or paint of false oratory he has particularly the secret of knowing not only what to say but what not to say the hardest task even of the most exact and excellent writers but you know him sir better than i and i should be to blame therefore in attempting any part of his character did not gratitude forbid me to return your books without giving you an account of the pleasure i had in perusing them even the ladys memoirs relating to our english princess gave me a good deal particularly that part of them where the story of her death is told in as natural and affecting a manner i think as is possible it has such a melancholy air of truth in it as at the same time that it gives conviction moves compassion and one can no more read it than one could have been present at the sad scene of it without tears i really prefer the bishop of meauxs funeral oration to those of flechier or bourdaloue though i think he would have wrote still better had he imitated them less for by that means he now and then heightens his expression a little too much and becomes unnatural i gave you one instance of that when i saw you last  the more i read of the bishop of meaux the more i value him as a great and able writer and particularly for that talent of taking as many advantages of an adversary and giving him as few as any man i believe that ever entered the lists of controversy there is a serious warmth in all he says and his manner of saying it is noble and moving and yet i question after all whether he sometimes is in good earnest pardon that freedom sir i have read him with attention and watched him narrowly i have read all the bishop of meauxs pieces that have been procured for me and will wait for the rest till i can have them from your hands in the mean time i will read worse books that i may relish his the more when i return to them though to speak the truth i know no writer in your tongue that has less need to have his reader so prepared for him do you hear nothing from your friend voltaire is england as well pleased with him as it was and is he as well pleased with england or does the satisfaction on one side abate in proportion as it lessens on the other when will the second edition of his henriade come out will it afford us a better monument to the memory of that prince and a nobler likeness than the statue on pontneuf it will if it be as well finished as it should be for non magis expressi vultus per ahenea signa quam per vatis opus mores animique virorum clarorum apparent   but the spirit of pedantry is coming upon me and it is time therefore that i tell you i am etc  i find the very last works of that great man the bishop of meaux are inferior to the rest but nevertheless i would be master of all he certainly wrote it is useful to observe even the defects of firstrate writers as well as their excellencies there is an illnatured pleasure in finding that as far exalted above us as they are they sometimes sink down to our level the bishop of meaux studied critical knowledge late with respect to the interpretation of scripture and was never therefore so true a master of it as he was of the way of interpreting it by the stream of tradition but the older he grew the more admired he was and that led him to think himself equal to every man in every thing and particularly to write books in latin and comments on scripture in both which ways i find him unequal to himself and i dare say that is the opinion of candid and judicious persons in your communion  our friend father courayer has been pursued with mandements censures and arrets nor have they i fear yet done with him i am concerned for the fate of so valuable a man and so excellent a writer whose views i am persuaded were innocent and good however in the manner of executing them he comes to have given so much offense the twenty bishops that have censured him seem to decline that part of the dispute which relates to the validity of our english ordinations however they have not spared the church of england on other accounts but have represented her in a more disadvantageous light than she deserves purely i suppose for want of knowing her they cite the bishop of meaux and cite those works of his which were written expressly against us which surely is a very odd way of representing our sentiments just as if i should quote monsieur claudes words from any pieces of his written against the church of france to prove what she held in any doctrine of importance i should think it became me rather to produce the writers of that church and the acts and monuments of it for my vouchers the twenty bishops have taken this method once or twice and if they had taken it always they would have been less liable to mistakes in their representations of us what the bishop of meaux

atterbury died at paris the   th of february      and his body was brought to england and interred on the   th of may following in his vault in westminster abbey his bowels were in an urn thus inscribed in hac urna depositi sunt cineres francisci atterbury episcopi roffensis  to his excellency the right honorable thomas lord parker lord high chancellor of great britain one of his majestys lords justices london henley near ludlow aug        my lord i taking london in my way between jews and kingston came to your lordships house the morning before i went to kingston but your lordship was then sitting i did then intend to have informed your lordship of what occurred in the circuit thitherto relating to the public especially in kent and after i came from kingston i found your lordship was gone out of town and before your return i set out for my countryconcerns here in shropshire till near next term so that what account i give your lordship must be by letter  though your lordship has heard how the verdict went in the trial at rochester occasioned by a charitysermon preached there by one hendley of istington he died not long after yet perhaps it may not be unacceptable to your lordship to have some abstract of the matter arising in it i began at six in the morning by my appointment and held till twelve the court was very full of clergymen and a great auditory and i gave both sides liberty to expatiate as they pleased especially the defendants that they might not say but that they had a full and fair trial most of the witnesses for the prosecution were unwilling and did prove the facts but meanly but afterward the witnesses for the defendants did upon questioning prove all the facts very fully upon all the defendants viz hendley the preacher the schoolmaster and the two collectors being all who were served with process sergeant comins sir constable phipps and mr blunden defendants after an harangue upon the virtue of charity and how essential to christianity though i thought the texts they cited proved another sort of charity viz goodnature and goodneighbourhood but i thought it not proper then to take notice of the distinction they insisted chiefly    that it would discourage all charity and charityschools which would thus be in danger of subversion    that every parson might order collections in his own parish for what charities he please especially if approved of by the bishop    that the rubric in the communion service a common prayer book being produced in court does imply that the parson and the bishop are entrusted in collections of charity in the church for it says that if the parson and churchwardens disagree in the distribution the bishop shall determine    that the parson of the parish and also the bishop of rochester did give hendley leave to preach this sermon for this purpose    that though the sermon was done yet the prayer for the holy catholic church at the communion table was not quite finished as were not also the sentences for exciting charity when mr farrington the justice of peace interrupted the collection    that the two present archbishops have preached charitysermons in london for the children of other parishes there    that there is no precedent of such an indictment ever before  too much time was spent on both sides relating to what power the bishops had anciently in the distribution even of tithes and profits relating to the church and their rights to license preaching and to direct what is to be done in churches and that laymen are not to intermeddle there  sergeant darnel mr baines and mr marsh were pro rege the substance of what they all said is herein mentioned intermixed with my own thoughts in my summing up to the jury  i first said that there were three things much insisted on by the defendants counsel and answered by the counsel on the other side which i thought ought to be pared off and put out of the case viz    all jealousy of discouraging all charity and charityschools for that they remained just as they were before as long as they kept within the bounds of their proper parishes but though this case was quite of a different nature relating to arbitrary collections and that in other parishes and the coming of fifty boys and girls together begging for that purpose and if this was practiced it might do more harm to charityschools by making them odious to their parishes whose poor would be injured by lessening the charity to them    it ought to be put out of the case whether mr hendley was authorized to preach there or not for that i thought it the same case if the parson of the parish himself had then preached it was at my tongues end if the bishop himself had preached as indeed it was the same but i thought it better not to heat the question by a supposal of the bishops preaching for that the preaching was not the point being used only to excite giving but the true point was whether the collection was without lawful authority and therefore the collecting of it in the church is not a jot better in point of law than if the fifty boys and girls had stood at the marketplace and the collectors had there received the charity of whom they could assemble about them    another matter i thought proper to be pared off though so much debated on both sides whether it was a crime i suppose the crime suggested in the bishop of rochesters court to interrupt the collection before the prayer for the holy catholic church and the sentences for charity were fully read since they thought that if such collecting is an unlawful act the proper time to stop it is just when it begins or soon after as here was done by mr farrington for otherwise common prayer or a sermon might be used to justify and give a sanction to any unlawful act and this stop might as well have been in the middle of the common prayer or of the sermon in case the unlawful collection had then begun so that the true point is whether the collection was unlawful and upon that all the case depends  as for the assertion that every parson of a parish may order collections in his parish for charities when and for what he pleases i declared my opinion that he could not it not being any part of his function like reading prayers preaching christening burying etc and i knew not how he was made judge of the times and objects of all charities within his parish though he might preach as much as he pleased upon the general duty of charity  as to the rubric in the communion service i said i thought that was to be taken secundum subjectam materiam viz the ordinary collection at the communion which is ever then used to be made for the poor of that parish but should not extend to every collection the parson should appoint for any foreign charity and that i did not till now hear that the clergy did claim such a power and farther i said that i thought those words of the rubric did not imply such a power in the parson for the words being the money given at the offering shall be disposed of to such pious and charitable uses as the parson and the churchwardens shall think fit wherein if they disagree it shall be disposed of as the ordinary shall appoint such a power of appointing a collection at pleasure is as much implied in the churchwardens as in the parson for they have as much liberty to disagree from the parson in the distribution as the parson has to disagree from them and so the churchwardens might also appoint collections for what charities they pleased but that i thought that the parson and churchwardens either jointly or severally could not appoint any collection for charity otherwise than in common form for the poor of their own parish and that those are the charitable uses intended by the rubric and particularly at the communion to the service of which those words of the rubric are subjoined i hope your lordship on reading that part of the rubric at the end of the communion service will be of my opinion which i then suddenly declared as to the implication and do not since alter unless otherwise convinced  as to what was mentioned of the two present archbishops it was for the poor of the same town though of a different parish and all the circumstances of those cases do not now appear nor were they litigated as this case is  as to the objection that there is no precedent of such an indictment ever before  sol  there never was such an attempt before that fifty boys and girls should go into another parish in another county and make a kind of migration in such a body really begging though with great formality and though much might be said as the counsel for the king insisted to bring them within the statute of vagrants especially seeing the stat of    eliz c   paragr   says that all persons calling themselves scholars going about begging shall be accounted vagrants yet i judged it not proper to put the case upon that point when i thought it so clear otherways and fit so to be mentioned  i also told the jury that this case did consist of two parts the first but particular and the other very general  as to the particular it is relating to the maintenance of the poor which is not of a spiritual nature but a mere layconcern and relating to the civil government and the several acts of parliament do plainly esteem it as such by ordering the rates and collections for the poor and putting the whole managment into the lay hands of the justices of the peace and the overseers of the poor who are to be nominated by the justices of the peace and accountable to them and by their directions to set the poor at work if they thought proper and therefore a justice of peace being then in the church might well take it to be a matter within his jurisdiction and that he might stop such a new and extraordinary proceeding newly begun among the clergy relating to the maintenance of the poor and a collection made by strangers without the consent or assistance of the churchwardens or overseers of the poor of that parish  but this case if under a general consideration is of a vast extent and mighty consequence to the king and the people and at which the very legislature may take great umbrage the levying of money is the tenderest part of our constitution and if it may be done arbitrarily under the show and form of charity which may comprize all good works and all good intentions it cannot be said whither it may go any more than it can be said whither these fifty boys and girls may go for as by the same reason they may go into all the parishes in england so collections as for charities may be set up in all the churches in england by the clergy as often as they please and though it be said it is all but voluntary giving yet it is a sort of compulsion by the solemnity in the church and vying with others and being marked out if refusing or giving meanly  in the time of charles i the parliament took great offense at some attempts for free gifts to the crown and we hear that cardinal alberoni is now setting up the like all over spain  but besides here in england no collection even for charity unless for the poor of the same parish is by law to be made but by the leave and permission of the king gathering of money being so nice a matter that it must not be done even for charity without his leave in the most compassionate cases and thence the ancient method of briefs under the great seal has been used even upon extreme great losses by fire and the stat of   and   of anne have put the whole management of briefs under the regulation of the court of chancery and empower the laying great fines upon the offenders but this method were giving a goby to all royal licenses and putting it in the power of the clergy to do all acts of charity of themselves at the expense of the people and to be sole judges of the occasions and to make what application and account they please  i told the jury that i was very clear of opinion in point of law this was a case of dangerous consequence and was an invasion not only on the kings prerogative but also upon the legislature and that i thought the defendants guilty  the jury stayed out but a little while and brought them in all guilty i then told the defendants counsel that if they did not like my opinion in point of law they might bring their writ of error and the indictment being so special it did equal a special verdict and they might have the opinion of a special court if they pleased  i then set a fine of a noble upon each defendant i saying it was so small only because it was made a question but now that a verdict had settled it there would be very heavy fines upon those who should presume to offend in like manner hereafter yet i heard that some gentlemen in the town had thereupon said that i had been too favorable to them by so small fines but it was far from my intention of any favor to them but of service to the king whereas if great it might have been said that while they were prosecuted for levying money on the people the prosecution was only to levy money upon them when it was really to settle the point and great fines might have raised compassion and perhaps a collection for them it would be great satisfaction to me if your lordship be of the same opinion with me as to the smallness of the fines i am sure i intended it for the best  i gave mr woodford a newspaper wherein was an advertisement which i thought very fit to be showed to superiors that the bishop of london had issued a circular letter to all his clergy to collect charities in their parishes for the poor vicarages in england which i thought much of a kin to the late collection in kent or rather more dangerous not only by raising a vast sum of money if the like in all dioceses but also by marking out people how far affected to the church throughout england and casting some reflection upon queen annes bounty and upon a beneficial explanation after by his present majesty yet as if to be supported by begging and this done in a time of taxes which must appear the more heavy after such collections and the clergy would thus gain a power of raising money as they please and applying it as they please how this project goes on i know not but sure it ought to be stopped and for that purpose a thing very apposite was mentioned in the debate of the late trial in kent that commonly about christmas when it is hard with the poor for want of work in great frost and snow then the bishop of london does send a circular letter to the parishes within the bills of mortality to make collections for the poor to be put into the hands of the lord mayor but it was also alleged in the same trial that precedent to such circular letter of that bishop the king sends a letter under his sign manual to that bishop authorizing and requiring him so to do this deserves to be inquired into and if true it is a case in point against this new letter of the bishop of london if without the kings license  a man of rochester worth nothing was convicted before me of drinking the pretenders health i ordered him to be whipped in open market twice till his back was bloody with a month between the first and second whipping  and at jews a man of rye was convicted before me for drinking the health of king james the third and saying he knew no such person as king george he had run out a good estate by looseness and had nothing left but an annuity of thirty pounds per annum for his life i fined him a hundred pounds and committed him till paid and that he should find good sureties for his good behavior for three years next after the payment of the fine i told him that by his paying a hundred pounds to king george he would certainly know there is such a person  your lordships notion against setting a state offender in the pillory was certainly very right and did so convince me that i have ever since ordered corporal or pecuniary punishments upon them as having a better effect upon shameless people and without giving the mob an opportunity to be troublesome  i declared in all my charges in this circuit as i did the two last terms at westminster that the number of base libels and seditious papers is intolerable and that now a quicker course will be taken about them for that now the government will not be so much troubling itself to find out the authors of them but as often as any such papers are found on the tables of coffeehouses or other newshouses the master of the house shall be answerable for such papers and shall be prosecuted as the publisher of them and let him find out the author letterwriter or printer and take care at his peril what papers he takes in  this last was a maiden homecircuit which had not been known before and is to be attributed to the late good law of transportation which is well put in execution in the counties near london whence transporting is easy but not so well in other parts of england the treasury would save much money partly by paying fewer rewards of forty pounds and partly by not long maintaining fellows in gaol if some rates were agreed to be given to merchants to carry them off speedily  your lordships order of notification to the justices of peace had a very good effect for they appeared much better this circuit than formerly especially in surrey where i told them that i would request your lordship that you would please to acquaint his majesty at his return how very well in particular his justices of peace in surrey had appeared upon his pleasure being notified to them for that purpose  i did in all my charges inform the audience of the occasion and necessity of that notification for that there was grown a sort of general neglect all over england of the appearance of the justices of peace at the assizes when the judges had often matters to inform them of by command of his majesty and trials of felons were often imperfect by the nonattendance of the committing justice of peace and that their attendance was a respect due to the king and his government upon those solemn occasions and that it is no hardship upon them there being three excuses which will be readily admitted if upon the call mentioned to the court barely upon the word of some other justice or proof upon oath by some other person viz   if not fit to travel by age or want of health   if living out of the county   if then actually out of the county but if justices of peace shall remain at home about their private affairs or to avoid the trouble of a journey to the assizes it ought to be looked on as a neglect of the duty of their office for they are not called only to notify to the people that they are in commission but to answer to their names in person  many of those in commission do not act and have not taken the oath of office whereupon i ordered in open court each clerk of the peace against next term to transmit to your lordship a list of such as reside in the county and refuse to act yet that he does in the mean time know of them if they persist in such refusal that so it may be their own doing if they are put out of the commission after his majestys favor to them in being put in  i fear i have tired your lordship with this long though abridged account but your lordships pardon will be an addition to all your former favors to  my lord your lordships most faithful and most humble servant littleton

may be lawful to and for the said peter le neve to dispose of and assign to any other person or persons subjects of the said lord and inhabitants of the said terrestrial globe the portion or any part or parts of his worldly goods with which it has pleased the almightyone to endow him by his last will and testament in writing made or to be made in manner and form following viz   in witness thereof to one part of these presents the said peter le neve has put his seal and the sealing and confirming the other part thereof is deferred to the time when the said peter enters the kingdom of darkness  my creed i believe in one god omniscient omnipotent allmerciful and that creator whose name is blessed is one and there is no unity like his who alone was is and will be my god who by his almighty power in one moment created the heaven and earth whose second thoughts cannot be more perfect than his first and therefore  i believe that he the same instant he replenished the world with human creatures male and female as well as with beasts of the earth and fowls of the air and that his mercy on his poor creatures is so great that he ordained none of them to feel the fury of his wrath  i believe his wisdom to be so great that he contrived at that instant the frame of all things so wisely that on no manner of event or accident whatsoever he will alter his first design of nature to produce that which is called a miracle  i believe him so powerful that without the assistance of angels devil or any other inferior beings he is able to punish the evil and reward the good done by us mortals and that the same breath of his nostrils can annihilate all which he created but if it so please him it may be as much to his glory to have the world endure to eternity  i believe the historical books part of the old testament to be wrote as other books are by faithful historians and that they contain certain select things worthy of observation and for instruction in order to the directing our affairs in this world and the adoration of one god and for the rest which contain the prophesies of several persons they were wrote according to the style of the eastern nations to reduce the jews to good living and from the idolatry and evil customs of their neighbournations and see no reason why some of those books called apocrypha should not be admitted into the same authority with the rest since they contain as good precepts and the historical parts better confirmed by the roman authors of the same time  as for them of the new testament i believe they were wrote by the followers of a great man to make the rest of the world believe what they through their zeal and love for his person saw through a magnifying glass and for so much thereof as relates to precepts of life and conversation very good  i believe christ to have been a great and good man conceived born died and was buried as other holymen for i cannot think him god omniscient since he himself says that he did not know the time of the day of judgment but the father only mark cap    v     i believe he may be preferred to a nearer participation in the beatific vision of god than the rest of good men to incline them to live peaceably and inoffensively in this world and to the adoration of an eternal being  i believe the several religions of this world so far as they center in the worship of his holyname and conduce to well living to be equally acceptable to him  i believe no person has power to remit sins but god himself  i think the mercy of god so much a greater attribute than his justice that he will not punish eternally for a temporary fault since most transgressions against the law of nature meet with some part of their punishment in this world and that there cannot be a rational being who can deny a deity and the providence thereof  extracted from the registry of the prerogative court of canterbury in the testamentor or last will of peter le neve late of great

to write to you of any body i know yet should my ignorance in the modes of writing cause you to esteem me less i shall repent my having learnt to write  your excellent judgment and the diffidence i justly bear to my own abilities always put a check to that sincere and honest warmth i am impatient to address you with but when i reflect on your many friendly indulgencies and see two kind letters of yours now before me both unanswered i plunge in ink lest my silence should be more criminal than impertinence itself remember however it is in compliance to your request and no fancied skill of mine in drawing characters you are very singular in your inquiry after mr  morals such questions are very uncommon here   de moribus ultima fiet quaestio  ought i not my friend to be cautious in discovering the blemishes and defects of this my native spot to one so resolutely determined to publish all the truths he knows of it even the worst with the sincerity and justice of an unconcerned historian now methinks i see you smile and ask me what is it you thus endeavor to conceal is not the fidelity of your island become a proverb your policy a jest your politeness wantonness and mimickry your commerce a combination of protected thieves the bane of industry and trade nor is there any other sign of divinity or liberty remaining with you except the opening of your churches and the courts of justice in a word it is become the characteristic of the english that they account it less glorious to act wisely than to defend the doing otherwise yes there is too much truth in your remarks the remembrance of virtue is almost lost and if any retain sentiments of honesty and religion they must be very secret if they would escape the public laughter this may be an excuse for the son of your friend he came green upon the stage was hurried into the triumph of vice and bore down by the torrent of corruption his beauty and comeliness of parts  rara est adeo concordia formae atque pudicitiae    were no small temptation to engage him with the vain the gay and the vicious they were the prevailing party in whose society he squandered an estate dishonourably and now i had almost said deservedly seeks a servile maintenance from that sink  a court  his fall occasioned this reflection of mine on beauty with which i will conclude  beauty does recommend the bearer to our notice and works a kind impression on all spectators in its own behalf but if it bring not matter of more worth as wisdom reason and the charms of virtue it is the worthless owners brand of shame and makes the stalking idiot more our scorn letter ii sir all the books which have been published here worthy notice i have constantly sent as you directed if i have withheld my opinion of their merit as you complain it was for many reasons i judged it unnecessary why do you so continually attack my vanity by the compliments you pay my judgment but since you seek some particulars of mr pope whose writings i profess amongst thousands to be an admirer of as i have often intimated i will take this occasion to inform you what i know concerning him many pieces of his the essay on criticism the rape of the lock the essays and dissertations on homer have appeared in your parts and one proof of their excellency is their being naturalized by persons of very eminent ability and rank see our former volume  other languages they have been translated both into french and italian are enriched with these and others of his works yet would you believe it he has translated homer preserved the sublimity strength harmony closeness and every other excellence of that venerable poet without knowing a syllable of greek and with an absolute ignorance of the english his essay on criticism is a smooth repetition of vidas nonsense his pastorals are no pastorals nor is he a poet these things are brayed about our street the asinorum crepitus the din of grubstreet pretenders to poetry and false critics have arose to poison our judgments some say he is too little to write well others that he has only a knack of writing and these wretches all write themselves to convince us it is without a knack cellars are full of their murmurings where like so many merciless chemists they violently rack and torture nature to confess some worth she has not in her mr pope is accounted by those not his enemies of overmuch borrowing this you will rather praise then disapprove when you shall know that the finest thoughts of the best writers were never made use of by him till he had improved and made them better view him in his public character he is an honor to our nation the good and wise rejoice that such and so notable a genius is manifested amongst us he has the satisfaction of not having lived in vain and has obliged the valuable part of mankind and is beloved by all the learned good and wise view him in private life there is nothing more amiable and endearing he is an example of the duty we owe our parents and the love we ought to bear our friends there is no truth if what i tell you is not true no friendship if i am not your friend  letter iii sir forgive me if i obtrude my advice think not of publishing as yet your works like fine painting and wine will ripen into more worth by age you should certainly complete the catastrophe i rejoice you have resisted the temptation offered it would be madness to throw an appearance of partiality on the face of your performance which you have so bravely avoided in every other part the devil is black enough in his real character the truer you can paint him the more damnable he will appear i can but laugh to see what an appearance kings and ministers the guardians of kings make when they are shown in history stripped of courtiers and attendants if in their lives they had few sure friends after their deaths they shall have fewer it is then that are glory is taken from their heads and their pride trampled on are they not deceived my friend who think by power to bury in oblivion the ill actions they are guilty of or to keep posterity from the knowledge of their vices i was the other day at a great mans levee it made me shudder he was corpulent and gross of body and seemed to me as if fatning for some sacrifice i then thought a corrupt minister surrounded by his creatures and mercenaries like the man who by unlawful practices had obtained the services of evil spirits and thinks it noble to be attended on by friends but yet expects in the end that they will tear him to pieces nb here i strongly smell another plot and abbe c  n certainly lives at twickenham by the help of fortunatuss cap mr pope has made the tour of st omers in order   to satyrize the conduct of the present ministry   to whitewash himself and   to compliment

pretty things i cansay add butlers rhymes to priors thoughts and choose to mimic all their faults by head and shoulders bringinastick to show my knack at hudibrastick i will tell you as a friend and crony how here i spend my time and money no more majestic virgils flights or towering miltons loftier heights or courtly horaces rebukes who banters vice with friendly jokes or cowleys wit or congreves fire or all the beauties that conspire to place the greenest bays upon the immortal brows of addison or priors inimitable ease or popes harmonious numbers please for i to phoebus bid adieu

stiffly tell you it is not hot the fire they say has in it it is true the power of causing pain in you but not more heat in fire that heats you than there is pain in stick that beats you and thus philosophers expound the names of smell and taste and sound thus when the famed faustina sings or handel tunes the trembling strings the voice they say is untuned air and all the musics in the ear

equipage not being come from rouen puts me under some difficulties but with the help of mr prior all things are made easy he has delivered your lordships letter to monsieur de torcy and he took notice to me how well mr prior has behaved himself during his stay here etc  manchester  to the earl of jersey extract paris aug         my lord i am now entering upon a troublesome part of my business the

manchester  to the earl of manchester loo sept         my lord i did not trouble you by last post not being then able to give a very good account of myself which i can do now having had the honor of a very long and particular audience of his majesty this morning the effect of which is that he knows all i was able to inform him of in relation to the present state of our affairs in the kingdom where you are and that i am ordered to go from hence to morrow morning for the hague to receive what orders his majesty may send me and to wait there till his farther pleasure be known  your excellency sees by the enclosed memoir the case of one girard a minister of neufchattel whom his most christian majesty will protect against what madame de nemours the lawful sovereign of the place designs to do in relation to her own subject his majesty commands me to intimate to your excellency that it is his pleasure that you concert with monsieur fribergen upon this subject and use your best endeavors with the court of france that they should let the matter be examined and decided by its competent judges according to the sense of the enclosed memoir of which monsieur fribergen has likewise a copy  you will have heard of the king of denmarks death before this reaches you so that as to public news i shall not trouble you  as to more private affairs obrian is taken up at brussels so your excellency must get bailey to tell you the particulars of what he knows relating to that man and what he thinks would be best to do that his being taken up may be serviceable to his majestys interests  i write this letter enclosed to bailey upon this head the account he gives your excellency you will be pleased to send directly to mr blathwayt  i take this opportunity my lord to repeat my thanks to you for your favors to me while i stayed with you at paris and to assure your excellency that in all places and stations i continue with great respect etc  m prior  to the earl of manchester hague oct         my lord i have the honor of your excellencys letters that of the  th which came strait hither and that of the  0th past by way of england and returned thence i understand by the gentleman nothing can be done so soon as we wish but as i have spoken to the persons concerned here in a little time i shall be able to give him a better answer than i can at present it is thought proper that bailey be continued in statu quo mr yard has let my lord jersey know what he has done in relation to the answer which couchman brought this at present my lord is all i can say upon this subject in general as soon as we can get together in england i hope to be more particular upon it and more satisfactory to the gentlemen concerned  we expect the king here to morrow night for certain and about saturday following we shall be wishing the wind fair obrian is by this time on board in order to his going for england the other persons seized this summer about loo are still in custody at arnheim  i trouble mr stanyan with what is less material and detain your excellency no longer than to repeat to you the assurances of my being with zeal and respect  m prior  to the earl of jersey extract paris oct         my lord i am to acquaint your lordship that bryerly one of the assassinators who had formerly some thoughts of going into england and discovering what he knew in hopes of obtaining his pardon and getting a recompense continues still in great necessity and is said to be in the same resolution some steps were made by mr prior in that matter when he was here of which he can inform your lordship and in case it may be judged for his majestys service to have him come over i am sure the promise of a pardon and some reward will tempt him i therefore desire your lordship would send me his majestys directions thereupon which i shall contrive to perform in the safest manner for him and the person who is to go between us  manchester  to mr prior paris oct         sir i shall now begin to trouble you often believing you are settled in the office which will be another sort of life than that in france but when i consider you have so worthy a person and so good a friend to act under i then think nothing can stand in conpetition with it i shall be every day more sensible of the loss of you here which i hope you will make up to me by letting me hear often from you i have acquainted my lord jersey with what passed in relation to me and the portugal ambassador in the apartment of monsieur de torcy he is going away else it would be impossible but there must be farther disputes of that nature the first opportunity i have i shall certainly return his rudeness when you can do it conveniently put my lord jersey in mind of what we have often discoursed about in relation to the affairs of france and what he was so kind as to say he would prevent if possible when i had the honor of seeing him last you can easily imagine i shall not be able to obtain any thing of this court if matters of moment must be only transacted by monsieur de tallard not that i am desirous of knowing more than what he would think proper in the post i am in i need not tell you that as a great expense is necessary here so an esteem for the person is as much and i flatter myself i shall not forfeit it unless this court finds i am only here to make a show  monsieur de tallard is daily expected and it may be will still make his complaints as formerly of the delays he meets with in england if so i can now answer him much better by what i have seen since my coming here  the day of parade is near and with the help of the advice you give me it will go well the calash is done and i like it though i assure you the coaches i brought from england do exceed it in gilding painting and carving all who see it do own and the french confess they cannot come up to our gilding though they pretend theirs will last longer i wish you was to be here for a few days the best apartment is now a la francoise velvet and damask chairs with gold galoon the frames gilded marble tables with large looking glasses and i found it was absolutely necessary and when i was doing it i would do it well the chapel which i have enlarged into the garden looks very handsome  i cannot finish this without my wishes that you may succeed in all things for your advantage etc i am etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester whitehall oct         os my lord i have received your lordships letter of the   th of october before you receive this mr prior will be with you it is his majestys desire that you discourse the business of the partition treaty with mr prior who has already knowledge of it and according to the account your lordship gives next of it you shall receive his majestys farther directions what else your letters contain i must beg leave to put off the answering it to another time i am etc  jersey  nb the earl of manchesters to the earl of jersey  paris nov        begins thus my lord mr prior informed your lordship by wednesdays post of his arrival here he having explained to me the subject upon which he was sent i wrote to monsieur de torcy etc     to the earl of manchester london nov   0      my lord i arrived here on friday night and every body confesses that roger is fitter than i to be sent express on saturday morning my lord jersey carried me to the king i first read to his majesty what your lordship said to the king of france and what the king answered thereupon and then i explained to his majesty the substance of the whole that had past during my being in france his majesty is satisfied with every step your excellency made and in one word we did as we ought to do his majesty asked me a great many questions about your entry you will easily believe i was glad on that occasion to do you justice hi majesty asked me about the rank which monsieur de torcys coach had and in all this affair i can assure your excellency he is very well satisfied i have seen as well charles as james erby and christopher montague i have been asked ten thousand questions and gave them the news of my lord mandevil being to arrive at paris within these six months for which we wish all very heartily i contracted a cold in the voyage and wisely increased it by running about these two days i am blooded and keep my chamber today which is the reason of my using another hand i hope your excellency will excuse it the king dined today with my lord rochester at his house near richmond my lord jersey is gone to dine with him whig and tory are as of old implacable dr davenant is coming out with another book in which he attacks the grants and is as i am told very scurrilous against my lord chancellor lord summers and halisax and our dear friend charles this i think is all the news i have known since my arrival i have only to add my great thanks to your excellency for your hospitality and kindness to me in france and wish you success in every thing there with all possible zeal and sincerity i am etc  m prior  to the earl of jersey extract paris nov         my lord i shall always discharge his majestys orders with all secrecy and care imaginable and i am apt to think this occasion will make monsieur de tallard take care how he behaves himself for he was not very easy when he found mr prior was come and that i was to have an audience i am etc  manchester  to mr prior paris dec        sir i could wish this court was so well inclined as to grant any favor in relation to the french protestants but at present i cannot see any inclination neither can i hope ever to have such credit with monsieur de torcy as on my account to persuade him if at any time i see a probability i shall not fail to act as is desired i have not yet made all my visits of ceremony and this day i am going to the arsenal you will be so kind as to make my excuse to lord jersey having nothing at present to acquaint him with only that king james continues still ill his distemper is boils in his backside i do not hear there is much danger unless it should turn to a fistula in a little time you shall hear more monsieur de tallard could not be so soon with you as he intended because the wind continued some days against him and obliged him to stay at calais i am glad to hear our proceedings were approved of and i am impatient to know the success of that matter though it may be i shall hear it first from monsieur de torcy i am etc  manchester  to the rt hon cha montague esquire extract paris dec        ns sir mr priors coming here and the private audience i had of the king the day of my entry occasioned much discourse and did me service with the ministers for now they see the king does not wholly rely on monsieur de tallard  king james upon mr priors coming hither believed i was to be recalled and he to be left here which for some time gave him great satisfaction it is not agreeable to them to see me live in such a manner that none of the english come to paris but they address themselves to me etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester whitehall dec        os my lord though i have written to you by my lords order ie the earl of jersey that is his letter i am to add a word from myself  you see by the news which accompanies this letter what was done in both houses yesterday in the upperhouse the bishop of st davids business dr watson who was accused of simony was thrown out and in the other house proceedings in relation to kidds matter relating to the case of pyracy came to nothing so that we gained two triumphs that day oh si sic omnia the commons address you will observe to be somewhat high but the moderation and wisdom of the kings answer is thought even by his enemies to be inimitable  davenant has printed his book against grants entitled an essay upon grants and resumptions octavo which i take to be a scandalous libel against the government i will send it you when we employ a messenger for i think it would cost you too dear if it came by the post  smith in the characters of the english and scots nobility drawn up at the request of the princess sophia by john macky esquire which were published by his son      octavo in the character of lord peterborough p    has this remarkable paragraph viz  his promising sir john fenwick his life if he would accuse the duke of shrewsbury and the lord orford to have a design to bring in king james and his writing a book by the assistance of dr davenent and putting one smiths name to it against that duke lost him with all honest men the house of commons having voted the one a scurrilous design to make a difference between the king and his best friends and the house of peers having ordered the second to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman  this book was entitled memoirs of secret service by matthew smith of the inner temple esquire octavo        who was a sort of discoverer of the plot and printed a book last year reflecting upon the duke of shrewsbury has printed another now to the same tune o tempora o mores every man says and writes what he will next week i intend to come out myself with a panegyric upon the king i am ever my lord with all imaginable respect etc  m prior ps i do not write to stanyan for he has not a park nor a do mr prior is waggish here these gentlemen called their mistresses their does in the world i mean a do fit for a pasty    to the earl of jersey extract paris dec         my lord mr prior may remember that i talked to him when he was here last about taking up one claude a frenchman as he says he is who served the late lord b  l in order to exchange him for pierre perault or arnold if your lordship be of that mind he is almost every day at the dogtavern in drury lane and couchman the messenger will be a proper person to apprehend him because he was acquainted with him when he was at paris this claude was very much at st germains while he stayed in france and endeavored to seduce several english thither but that which will be a better reason for seizing him is his having attended richardson one of the assassins while he lay concealed in the late lord b  ls house which i am told he bragged of when he was here last etc  manchester  to mr prior paris jan     00 sir having writ so lately by mr stanhope to the earl of jersey i do not trouble him now i must desire you to make my excuse and acquaint him with the contents of this there is nothing at present acting at st germains king james being not well and wholly giving himself up to devotions and prayers the wound which was very large is healed but it is thought they have done it too soon because the same humors run all over his body sometimes in his stomach legs etc he is extremely broke and most men are of opinion he cannot recover though he may go on some time as he is father cosme is run away with fifty thousand livres which he had in his hands and which he was to distribute among the irish they think he may be gone for england since he cannot be safe in any other place if i learn any thing of him you shall hear from me nevertheless it may not be improper to make some inquiry after him and you will find by my former accounts where his acquaintance live in london i was yesterday at versailles where i made a compliment to the king and the rest of the court it being new years day i dined with monsieur de boufflers i find them all very civil but how long it will last you can best judge i wonder my servant has not been with you the buckseason must make it up we want two posts having had no letters since the   st of december last i am etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester whitehall jan      00 my lord we have this morning two posts from france of the  0th and   d my lord jersey commands me to acknowledge your letter to him and to tell you that the house of lords sitting so late and he being obliged after its rising to go to kensington is the reason why he does not write to you you will see by the enclosed what a days work has been performed in the house of commons the irish grants to be reassumed and not even the third part of them to be reserved to the king and the ministry some of our friends particularly meaned and aimed at in the latter part of their vote this all comes like a torrent and the few who would cannot in the house of lords the king is a little more civilly used as to the business of darien his majesty is at least justified in his letters to the governors of the plantations thus we are my good lord scrambling and doing our best on one side against the other who are very troublesome not to say dangerous  we hear of the complaints you make from monsieur de tallard and prepare to redress them as well as we can as to the persons mentioned in your letter care will be taken  the king has not yet seen lord bazil or any address from him i do not hear that this lords countrymen are quieter i know not how far your houses resolution of to day will go toward calming them i am ever etc  m prior  to the earl of manchester extract whitehall jan   os my lord i do not find the king willing to be at a great expense about the person dont il sagit the person who is to serve us without having some assurance of the service he can do mr prior has been ill which is the reason i have not been able to know of him in what this person can be most useful i desire your lordship will in the mean time keep this matter on foot and let me know your opinion as to the expense and advantage we may have by it etc  jersey  to the earl of manchester whitehall feb  0 os my lord my lord jersey gives me in charge to own the receipt of your letters of the   th and   th the substance of which my lord will lay before his majesty the first opportunity  if you hear no more of the great affair it is because nothing is transacted in it farther than when your excellency was last advised of it consequently roger is not yet dispatched  i must congratulate your happiness that you are out of this noise and tumult where we are tearing and destroying every man his neighbor tomorrow is the great day when we expect that my lord chancellor summers will be fallen upon though god knows what crime he is guilty of but that of being a very great man and a wise and upright judge lord bellemont you will read in the votes was fallen upon today thus every day a minister till at last we reach the king by next post

will not be able to send his express away these two or three days my lord jersey still keeps his bed his gout had a fever which accompanied it but god be thanked both those distempers abate and i hope by next post he will tell you so in his own hand in the mean time we take what care we can about the contents of your last letter to my lord though god knows all the care we take signifies little considering how we are restrained as to the taking any body though the informations given make it highly necessary for the public good but you know england well enough in this point my lord  the speakers illness gives the house of commons leave to play till monday the address they presented yesterday to the king he answered very civilly but smartly i have not yet the words but shall send them with the first the sense was that he was sensible the nation lay under great taxes that he had and would contribute to the easing them by every way which was just that he thought he had the power of gratifying some who had been actually in the reduction of ireland out of what was his  i had written your lordship a long politic letter for i thought that roger would have been dispatched to you but since there are no particularities in the affair i have spoke of i have sent word to mr woolaston that roger may stay to go over with the midwife for my lady quod felix faustumque sit etc  if i might speak my particular sentiments concerning la person dont il sagit i would have him well sifted and tried if he means to act in earnest and is really disposed to the thing otherwise we may be bantered to say no worse of it but this is only to yourself my lord and from him who is eternally with great respect etc  m prior  to the earl of manchester april     00 os my lord for above these two months passed i have not had an opportunity of sending over a horace which we printed at cambridge and which my lord duke of somerset our chancellor presents to the king of frances library with a letter which his grace writes on that subject to the abbe de louvois but i have at last sent them by a footman who quitted my service the book and letter will be or are already delivered to mr stanyan and the favor we beg of your excellency is that you would honor this book with a word by which the court of france and particularly the archbishop of rheims and abbe louvois may take notice that the university of cambridge would establish a fair correspondence with the learned on your side by next post i shall write something to the soubibliothecaire underlibrarian monsieur clermont concerning the greek ciphers we would buy of them in this i must likewise desire your lordships good offices since without your appearing concerned in it we shall hardly make our matters bear as we desire

myself except that i am very glad my lord mandeville is come to town and hope he will stay long with us i am glad he is born at paris for had he been born here he would have liked living among us so little that i question whether he would have thought it worth his while to have sucked the votes of to day pretty well explain what i mean god knows how the business will turn or where this violence of the house of commons will end the lords seem as yet to adhere to their point on wednesday we expect the issue of all this seymour sir edward seymour plainly said to day that the original of all this proceeded from the ministers and from the chief of them the chancellor many other angry sayings of this kind have been vented and in the heat of this hurry kidd is arrived and sent up for with his papers by an order from the admiralty our friend late earl of halifax has said nothing of late in the house of commons my lord chancellor is very sick this is the abbrege of our case i think no very good one i am going to kensington the moment after i have told you that i am etc  m prior  to the earl of manchester whitehall april      00 os my lord our long session is this day god be thanked finished the irish grants resumed and the commons satisfied at least for some time yesterday was indeed a great crisis from the morning when it was doubtful if the lords would adhere to their amendments or no the commons fell directly upon impeaching the persons they named were my lords portland and albemarle the articles upon which they were going for procuring for themselves exorbitant grants in this state the affair lasted till after the second conference with the lords and immediately upon the managers returning from the conference the house though they thought the lords would recede locked themselves up till ten at night of which you see the good effects in the votes they threw fire about at every body had a great mind to fling at our friend charles late earl of halifax you see what they would have done to my lord chancellor and how duke schomberg and lord portland suffer in their address that strangers shall not be privycounsellors god knows whither this heat would have gone if it had not been timely dispatched by every bodys striving to come in so this bill passed upon the main we have life for six months longer and alors comme alors then as before   the affair upon which i came into france will be quite ended to night your lordship will pretend in any discourse you may have on that subject to think it was quite ended three weeks since or at least that you heard nothing to the contrary i hope my lord mandeville is well and his beautiful mother whom the french ladies will talk to death unless you get your doors locked up like those of the house of commons  my lord the earl of jersey commands me to acknowledge yours of the   th and says the perpetual hurry in which we have been must serve for a reason that as yet he has not spoke to the king to be your gossip but this my lord says is a favor which he doubts not but the king will grant and he will tell you so himself next post i am etc  m prior  to the earl of manchester whitehall april      00 os my lord our parliament affairs being at length finished we have a little time to think of our private devoirs i must therefore beg your excellency if you have not done it already to give the horace and the duke of somersets letter to abbe de louvois making the archbishop of rheims acquainted with the dukes present and the desire we have to correspond with the learned at paris i have written to mr clement what the university desires as to the procuring us some greek types if your excellency expends the money and are pleased to draw upon me i will answer the bills i should be glad they could be got ready soon i should not dare to trouble your excellency but that your protection to the university is absolutely necessary in this occasion  his majesty goes to morrow to hampton court and will stay there we say these six weeks at the end of a session of parliament you know we always talk of a change in the ministry we do so at present but upon what ground i know not i am etc  m prior  to mr prior paris may     00 sir the court being at marly monsieur de torcy will not be in town till to morrow so i must make my excuse to my lord jersey by you for my not writing my wife lays all the fault on you that we have not yet heard if we may give the littleone the kings name and i dare not venture without knowing that positively so that at present you are a little out of favor and will be so unless we hear by the next letters  i shall do all i can to serve the university and shall take care about the horace when i have it mr stanyan will acquaint you how that matter stands and how this book is seized at diepe i have not seen the archbishop of rheims for some time and i believe he is gone to his diocese  several of the great men here will dine with me tomorrow and among them the marshall de villeroy he will certainly ask after you as he often does the little hopes our friends at st germains have left is in scotland and if that fails all things will be quiet till the next meeting of the parliament i think instead of a change in the ministers we should have a new parliament that would be more for the kings service not much good can be expected from a last session we hear the king intends to go for holland next summer when that is certain pray let me know it which will oblige etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester hampton court may     00 os my lord i am to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the  th i do not believe there will be occasion for rogers stay as the affairs of sir william etc has gone through the hands of the church so it is convenient that it should so continue and as to the great affair i shall take care to manage it as you have already done in relation to that persons knowing it whom you mention in your letter the thing itself cannot i think in its own nature be long a secret god only knows what effect it may have when it comes out so strange a people are we and so resolved not to be pleased with any thing i shall be able in a post or two to send brocard some money out of which your excellency will repay yourself what you have expended before you give or order him the rest i believe there is no great matter to be known but such as it is he must be encouraged  i have only in charge from my lord jersey to own the receipt of yours of the  th and to tell your lordship that he will answer you by sending away your express with the first opportunity my lord chief justice holt having been here today and with the king in private has given people occasion to say that he has refused the seals if it be so or not i cannot say but as yet the seals are not disposed of the king god be thanked is well which is all the news i can send you from this place i dined today with mr montague here and drank my lord manchesters health i am etc  m prior  to mr prior paris june  0   00 sir i do not write by this post to my lord jersey because mr stanyan intends to set out on friday next and by him i will let his lordship know what occurs  i find by yours of the   th instant os that there are not to be any changes by this i see the town follows its old custom of placing and displacing several as for my own particular i shall never like france so well as not to wish to be at home you know the french very well and i believe you find the diversions at hampton court where i hear you are often more to your satisfaction than any thing here  the news we have at present is that the pope has made a promotion for the crowns viz the archbishop of paris who was yesterday at versailles to thank the king for france the bishop of passaro for the emperor and borgia a canon of toledo for spain there are still two in petto we have sometimes reports here of the kings being indisposed but i hope it is not true i am etc  manchester  to mr prior paris july  0   00 sir i was very sorry to hear my lord jersey had quitted the office and much more so because you also leave it i suppose you have long foreseen this and cannot but have taken care of yourself being upon the place for you often said men were forgot when abroad the hopes you give that i am to correspond with mr vernon makes me more easy than i should have been  the ambassador of savoy was with me to let me know that the duke his master had ordered monsieur de la tour who was formerly his envoy in england to return thither with the same character this will cause a great discourse because he was his chief minister but the reason why he comes is not hard to guess i was in hopes to have heard something concerning sir etc whose letter i sent lately to england as soon as i hear from my lord jersey i shall not fail to congratulate with him i am etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester whitehall dec  0   00 os my lord i am indebted to my good lord manchester for two or three letters and it would be unreasonable if i did not take the opportunity of mr chetwynds return to tell your lordship what i know of the state of things here that we shall have a new parliament is i think certain at least as far as i can see into the matter what sort of parliament it may prove i cannot any ways foresee but sure there never was so much work as at present in securing parties and bribing elections whig and tory are railing on both sides so violent that the government may easily be overturned by the madness of either faction we take it to be our play to do nothing against common sense or common law and to be for those who will support the crown rather than oblige their party and in order to this men are preferred who are looked upon to be honest and moderate in this number whether with reason or not time must decide we comprehend our lord keeper and our new secretary lord rochester and lord godolphin are in the cabinetcouncil the latter is at the head of the treasury the former we take it for granted is to go lord lieutenant of ireland though it be yet a secret the two companies are to be brought to an agreement if possible and mr montagues being made a peer we take for granted may contribute to this union since being in the house of commons he would make an ill figure if he either declined to support the new or should find too great an opposition in his endeavoring so to do as to the great affair i presume the king will wholly defer it to the parliament and act conjointly with their consent which i take to be the only method all that i can say more on this head is that i take it to be happy for the king that the will is preferred by the french at a time when every body was peevish against the court though with reason god knows about the treaty count tallard makes a foolish figure here i do not know as yet what he says to the king on this occasion but every body observes his excellency to be very melancholy and desponding and one may judge he has reason to be so as to his own particular concerning the part he has been made to act however his country in general may approve their monarchs breach of truth and treaty this i think is the present figure of our affairs which i am glad to write to so good a friend as my lord manchester though to most of the world here i am of opinion that to say least is to do best your friend my lord jersey grows very much a minister and is in a fair way of being very great as to my own affairs i have a great many friends who would set me up at cambridge i know i shall find great opposition from mr hammonds party there and great trouble in case i should throw him out from those men who will never be satisfied let me act as i will or can if your lordship thinks it convenient i know you will not refuse me your letter to the university my lord sandwich is gone to hinchinbrook i hear in order to set up charles boil against mr wortley montagues interest at huntington vive la guerre whosoever is chosen or cast out or on what side soever things turn i am most truly etc  m prior ps though i am no longer in a secretarys office venison would not poison a commissioner of commerce and does are now in season which may be useful to inform mr woolaston when next your lordship writes to him    nb it has been thought proper to accompany mr priors negociations with the following letter of the immortal king william iii as the basis upon which they were founded  his majestys letter to lord summers loo aug    school i imparted to you before i left england that in f france there was expressed to my lord p portland some insinuation to come to an agreement with us concerning the succession of the king of sp spain since which c tall count tallard has mentioned it to me and has made propositions the particulars of which my lord p will write to vernon to whom i have given orders not to communicate them to any other besides yourself and to leave to your judgment whom else you should think proper to impart them to the end that i might know your opinion upon so important an affair and which requires the greatest secrecy if it be fit this negotiation should be carried on there is no time to be lost and you must send me the full powers under the great seal with the names in blank to treat with c tall i believe this may be done secretly that none but you and vernon and those to whom you shall have communicated it may have knowledge of it so that the clerks who are to write the warrant and the full powers may not know what it is according to all intelligence the king of sp cannot outlive the month of october and the least accident may carry him off every day i received your letter of the  th since my lord wharton cannot at this time leave england i must think of some other to send ambassador into sp if you can think of any one proper let me know it and be always assured of my friendship  wr  his lordships answer tunbridgewells aug    school having your majestys permission to try if the waters would contribute to the reestablishment of my health i was just got to this place when i had the honor of your commands i thought the best way of executing them would be to communicate to my lord orf mr mont and the d of shrew who before i left london had agreed upon a meeting about that time the subject of my lord ps letters at the same time letting them know how strictly your majesty required that it should remain an inviolable secret  since them mr m and my secretary are come down hither and upon their whole discourse three things have principally occurred and are humbly suggested to your majesty    that the entertaining a proposal of this nature seems to be attended with very many ill consequences if the f did not act a sincere part but we were soon at ease as to any apprehension of this sort being fully assured your majesty would not act but with the utmost nicety in an affair wherein the glory and the safety of europe were so highly concerned    the second thing considered was the very ill prospect of what was like to happen upon the death of the king of sp in case nothing was done previously toward the providing against that accident which seemed probably to be very near the king of f having so great a force in such a readiness that he was in a condition to take possession of sp before any other prince could be ready to make a stand your majesty is the best judge whether this be the case who are so perfectly informed of the circumstances of parts abroad but so far as relates to england it would be want of duty not to give your majesty this clear account that there is a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally so as not at all to be disposed to the thought of entering into a new war and that they seemed to be tired out with taxes to a degree beyond what discerned till it appeared upon the occasion of the late elections this is the truth of the fact upon which your majesty will determine what resolutions are proper to be taken    that which remained was the consideration what would be the condition of europe if the proposal took place of this we thought ourselves little capable of judging but it seemed that if sicily was in the hands of the f they would be entirely masters of the levant trade that if they were possessed of final and those ports on that side whereby milan would be entirely shut out from relief or any other commerce that duchy would be of little signification in the hands of any prince and that if the king of f was in possession of any part of guipuscoa which is mentioned in the proposal besides the ports he would have in the ocean it does seem he would have as easy a way of invading sp on that side as he now has on the side of catalonia but it is not to be hoped that f will quit its pretenses to so great a succession without considerable advantages and we are all assured your majesty will reduce the terms as low as can be done and make them as far as is possible in the present circumstances of things such as may be some foundation of the future quiet of the kingdom which all your subjects cannot but be convinced is your true aim if it could be brought to pass that england might be some way a gainer by this transaction whether it was by the elector of bavaria who is the gainer by your majestys interposition in this treaty his coming to an agreement to let us have some trade to the spanish plantations or in any other manner it would wonderfully indear your majesty to your english subjects  it does not appear in case this negotiation should proceed what is to be done on your part in order to make it take place whether any more be required than that the english and dutch sit still and f itself is to see it executed and if that be so what security ought to be expected that if our being nearer the french be successful they will confine themselves to the terms of the treaty and not attempt to make farther advantages of their success  i have put the seal to the commission without expecting the return of the warrant the commission is written by mr secretary and no creature has the least knowledge of any thing besides the persons already named i pray god give your majesty honor and success in all your undertakings  i am with the utmost duty and respect sir  your majestys most dutiful and most obedient subject and servant summers  mr secretary addisons negociations being at the same period with those of mr secretary harley we have thought proper to subjoin them  to the earl of manchester whitehall march       0  my lord i am very sorry the ill state of my health rendered me so unfortunate as not to find your lordship at your own house and that i was not in a condition to receive your excellency when you did me the honor to call at mine before you left the town i thought i should not have had occasion to give you any trouble so soon more than to wish your excellency a happy and prosperous journey but this morning monsieur vryberge the envoy of the states general delivered a memorial to her majesty a copy whereof the queen has commanded me to transmit to your excellency that you may see the opinion of the states upon that affair in italy in which her majesty does entirely concur and therefore you will please both at vienna and all other places where you shall think it necessary to express her majestys sentiments upon that affair and do your utmost to prevent any alteration of the project which has been agreed with prince eugene for carrying the war into france under pretense of taking naples and sicily which are views no ways to be brought into comparison with the other design i am with the greatest respect etc  to harley  to mr secretary harley hague march      0  sir last night i came to this place where i received the favor of yours of the   th instant with a copy of the memorial of monsieur vryberge i have since waited on the pensionary to acquaint him that her majesty did entirely concur with the states general in that affair and that i had orders to use what diligence i could for vienna in order to prevent any alteration of the project concerted with the duke of savoy for carrying the war into france on that side i found by the advices he had received from vienna that he is apprehensive that the imperial court may have a particular view toward naples which is certain will be of fatal consequence besides the manner of evacuating all the places by the french troops in italy without the least notice of it either to the queen or to the states general gives them some reasons to mistrust the intentions of that court he tells me that they have received an answer from monsieur amelot and that the elector palatine will order the recruits he is to send for italy i hope i shall be able to set out for dusseldorp in a few days and then nothing will i hope prevent my being soon at vienna where i shall execute her majestys commands to the utmost of my power i shall continue to send you an account how i proceed as often as i can i am etc  manchester  to mr secretary harley frankfort april  0   0  sir i had not time to write to you from dusseldorp neither was their any thing material that required haste i came thither on the  th about noon and i had an audience of the elector this evening where after a compliment in the name of her majesty i acquainted him with my orders in relation to his interests at the court of vienna and that the queens minister who was going to reside there would have the same instructions he expressed a very great sense of her majestys goodness to him and he did enter into the whole matter of his right to the upperpalatinate with some warmth complaining of the usage of that court he mentioned besides his several titles also a treaty between the late emperor and him wherein it is agreed that he shall be put in possession which is since renewed by the present emperor i told him it was of the last importance that his troops in italy should be immediately recruited that her majesty did not doubt but he had put it in such a method as that i might find them so at my arrival in italy i must confess that i very much fear it though i am persuaded he will do all that is possible for he seemed not to disguise the difficulties he was under as that his officers were but lately arrived from italy and that the last accounts he had were that his troops were at the blockade of cremona that he was buying a battalion at onspach and that nothing should be wanting that was in his power to do as to the affair on the upperrhine he says there will be an army of  0000 men that the emperor will make his   000 the circles have agreed on  0000 this with the rest who are there and will be there makes up the number that there was also care taken for a sufficient quantity of ammunition etc his two chief ministers were to see me and i did find them agree in every thing the elector had told me i did press them also about the recruits in italy the next day i had an audience of the electoress and in the evening i took leave of both them i need not mention the expressions they both made use of in relation to her majesty and how great a sense they should ever have of it the electoress recommended to me the interest of their house and also that of florence i found by the elector that the great duke had agreed to pay  00000 pistoles but that the imperial court insisted on  00000 which he thought very extravagant and which they seemed to own at vienna but that they thought it just since he contributed and was one of the chief instruments in procuring the will in favor of the duke of anjou that they threatened to send troops thither as also to genoua in case they would not pay what was demanded i cannot tell what may be the consequence in case the imperial court should carry this matter too far but if these sums are actually employed in carrying on the war in italy we have no great reason to complain the elector of mayence being at bamberg i shall not wait on him but tomorrow i shall set out for vienna where i shall certainly be in ten days i suppose the wind has been contrary for i have received no letters nor shall i now till i come to vienna where i shall pursue my instructions and acquaint you how i find matters there i am etc  manchester  to mr secretary harley vienna april      0  sir i arrived here on the   st and had been here sooner had i not met with contrary winds on the danube though i find it would have been much the same thing for this week every one is in devotion i have nevertheless seen monsieur zinzendorf and monsieur wratislaw and did not fail to take the first opportunity to show them the ill consequence to the intended design of prosecuting the war into france should they first undertake that of naples and i did acquaint them with the orders i had received from her majesty as for count zinzendorf he was not so positive as the latter but they both agreed in this that it would not in the least prejudice that undertaking for since the french were entirely out of italy there were troops sufficient for both that prince eugene was to stay though his presence would have been of very great consequence that they had given their reasons to monsieur dopf which they hoped would satisfy her majesty as also the states general i had a great deal of discourse on that subject with the latter who i fear has no great opinion of the project concerted with the duke of savoy when i pressed that matter he did say that by the grand alliance that of naples was first to be undertaken and that the emperor was not able to sustain this war with some assistance of that nature that every thing was ready here and they had reason to believe they should succeed with a small number of troops i do not doubt but her majesty is already informed of the reasons they allege and i cannot but think though they do not positively own it that the orders are already gone to italy i have not as yet seen the prince of salms he being indisposed i believe i shall have my audience of the emperor in a few days i fear the duke of marlborough is still in england for there are now three posts wanting here i have received none from england since i left the hague i hope by the next post to give you a farther account and i am etc  manchester  to mr secretary harley vienna april  0   0  sir by the last post i acquainted my lord sunderland with my proceedings here and i have every little to add the emperor returns from luxenburg today and i suppose i shall have my audience of the empress tomorrow that of the empress dowager is over here are no letters yet from england so that i continue as often as i see the ministers to persuade them to lay aside the expedition to naples which i believe they will do unless it be approved of by her majesty what makes them more zealous in that matter is the apprehension that in holland they might be brought to consent to the dismembering it from the spanish monarchy and if once they are in possession of it england will never consent to it they flatter themselves that upon their appearing the people will declare as to the intended expedition into france it is certain that this court has sent the recruits they promised as also the mounting for their horse they also assure me that they are doing what is necessary in relation to their magazines but i am confident that in this they will fall short and i can easily perceive that their meaning is only till their troops can enter into france and then they must subsist themselves or we must do it which i find is the true reason which makes them say that of provence is most practicable because as i suppose they think they can be subsisted by our fleet they assure me that what is agreed on will be performed they wait with a great deal of impatience the success of the duke of marlborough count piper did deliver a memorial to the emperors ministers in relation to the battalion of muscovites in such terms that he could not receive it they did afterward make some alterations but in substance it is the same you will soon see the true intentions of this court in relation to the malcontents for they have seemed of late to desire an accommodation but it was on such terms that they might easily judge were impossible so that matter is at an end and they have procured a bull from the pope for the excommunicating of prince rogotzky and the rest of the considerable men of the catholics whether it goes so far as to all who adhere to them i cannot tell this is at present a secret but i suppose it will soon be otherwise if they intend it shall have any effect i should imagine that they will not find their account in it it may be the means to exasperate them and it may possibly induce them to quit that religion  i am doing all i can in the affair of the duke of savoy i hope i shall soon bring it to some conclusion i wait to see what orders i shall receive for i believe there are some to come which do not please this court after that i shall go to turin i find they intend to send count galas for the hague and count questenberg for england this is what monsieur galas does not like and his gentleman of the horse is come here on that account i have seen him who is intended for england and he seems to own it i am etc  manchester  to the earl of manchester may       0  my lord i received this morning the honor of your excellencys letter of april  0 i am heartily glad your excellency has had so much success as to shake that court from their speculative expedition against naples but i am very sorry that the misfortune of our army in spain is an irresistible argument to lay aside wholly that project the accounts we have of this disaster are only got from france yet they bring too many marks of truth not to be credited so far as that we have received a very great loss there the queen has done all that is possible on the sudden event and in this great uncertainty orders are gone this night to encourage the king of portugal to keep firm to the alliance and likewise to holland to consult with them the best way to recover the blow but all this will be to no purpose unless the emperor will exert himself on this occasion not only to lay aside the expedition to naples to push vigorously into france but also to act offensively upon the rhine these are points which the queen has so much at heart that her majesty has written to the emperor with her own hand it follows this which i enclose herewith to your excellency that you may please to deliver it with all possible speed and that you may be the better apprized of it i enclose also a copy for your own perusal your excellency will enforce it with such arguments as you will find according to your own sagacity may best incline h i m her imperial majesty to comply with so reasonable a desire and you will be pleased also to press the emperor to send his brother the king of spain some troops without that it will be hard for her majesty to prevail with the states general to join with her in sending more troops i hope my lord rivers will be prevailed with to return immediately to spain it would be a very ill return if her majestys zeal should occasion a coldness in the court of vienna i am with the greatest respect etc  to harley  her majestys letter to the emperor from the french sir my brother the advantage which the enemy has now obtained in spain might have such dismal consequences that i could not forbear to tell you that it is of the utmost importance that all your troops which are in italy should be employed to make an invasion into france and that at the same time the army in the empire should act with vigor on the rhine spain is so far from the countries in which my troops and those of the states general are that there is no remedy so quick nor so powerful as that of making this invasion your majesty is too well informed to amuse yourself with a little expedition for some member or dependency of that kingdom when the noble and principal parts of the monarchy in question the honor and welfare of my brother the catholic king are concerned i promise myself therefore from your prudence that you will think only on the reestablishment of the affairs of that prince by obliging his enemies to recall their troops for the defense of their own dominions i am  your majestys most affectionate sister anne r kensington may     0  to mr secretary harley vienna may      0  sir i have taken my leave of this court and have but this day obtained the answer in relation to the duke of savoy i have had a good deal of difficulty to bring them to this which is far short of what the ministers of the duke of savoy in england expected it is certain that their intention here is to delay all the farther execution of the treaty till after the peace and i suppose i shall find his rh not in the least satisfied i have not been wanting to press this matter and i have been here a month tomorrow i set out for turin they do assure me i shall find every thing ready for the expedition of france the detachment for naples is now advanced to bologna and in about a month more they will be in the kingdom of naples they think themselves sure of success i have enclosed the emperors recredential letter and have nothing farther to add but that i am etc  manchester  to mr secretary harley turin june     0  sir i received here the honor of yours of the     of may with her majestys letter to the emperor i do find they had at vienna the notice of our misfortune in spain on the   th which was the day before i left that pla by an express from prince eugene which they did not think fit to communicate to me and that at the same time mr chetwynd had given me an account of that matter and directed it to the dutch envoy in case i was gone which letter that envoy received some time after by the post i am sensible that had i stayed there was no possibility of stopping the detachment for naples for they have since sent a positive order to prince eugene and threatened him if they did not proceed what they allege since is that our fleet being not come they may be embarked as well from thence in case it is thought proper but i fear the court of vienna will not be very ready to send any of their troops to spain i have enclosed her majestys letter and i do not doubt but sir philip meadows who i understand is on his way to vienna will have the necessary orders i am etc  manchester  nb we are obliged to break off our political correspondence till the publication of our third volume by reason several valuable letters of mr prior mr secretary harley and mr secretary addison are expected as promised from abroad  a letter of advice to a young lady who had married above herself grew vain and despised her husband by the rev dr  madam give me leave to speak my mind to you a little sure you will because you know whatever i shall say proceeds from my value for you consider that a surgeon must probe a wound if he would make a perfect cure and give pain to give health would a person in his senses whom i should save from drowning by pulling him out by the hair quarrel with me for hurting him when he is safe out of the water therefore say down down self and read what follows  christianity common humanity and my profession obliges me to do every body all the real service i can but the civility the kind and friendly welcome which you have always received me with does more particularly oblige me to do all i can to promote your satisfaction therefore let me put you in a way to be easy in this world and happy in the next dont imagine now that you are fated to be unhappy there is no such thing god puts it in all our powers to be happy it is we make ourselves miserable the reason we dont find happiness is that we seek it without us and would rather bring things to agree with our humor than suit our humor to what happens let us do as mahomet did when he called to the mountain to come to him to show a miracle to his gaping disciples and the sullen mountain did not stir he said to them with all the cheerfulness in the world since the mountain will not come to mahomet mahomet shall go to the mountain and so climbing up he pleased the people and was perfectly satisfied himself since therefore happiness is to be found only within give me leave to draw your picture by setting the mirror of truth before you which if you view attentively and without partiality you will find your happiness and lay hold of it i dont mean your outward form or what fluttering fellows call roses lillies diamonds pearls balls of snow and bowers of bliss should i attempt it i might do you as much wrong as the painter has done i dont mean what may be seen or felt but what may be heard or understood your inside therefore is doubly composed of soul and self which god having made united together like man and wife now they can never be parted from one another whilst life continues and yet they often jar by the devils subtle arts who continually endeavors to set them at variance in which when he succeeds he makes a person miserable but when soul and self go hand in hand soul like a good husband by his strong reason governing with easy sway and self diffident of her own strength gladly submitting to be governed how blessed are both guardian angels attend to protect them and nothing from without can disturb their happiness but if soul happens to be pusillanimous or tyrannical or if self gets it in her head to wear the breeches then all the guardian angels leave self and the devil sends evil genii to take possession and stir up all the passions to become tormentors of self which before that were all her servants very submissive and useful when soul helped to keep them under on the other hand the evil genii are so continually contending with harrassing souls guardians that they grow tired and soon sleep regardless of their charge then does unhappiness fill the whole mortal frame then it is we feel all the racks and tortures possible and if we are now and then easy it is when we are in most danger it is then the black genii have put on the apparel of the sleeping angel and makes us mistake evil for good this is my poor friends case at present but soul has still force enough left to overcome self and reason to bring it to a right temper if we can but rouse souls guardians to our assistance which we will do by drawing selfs picture as it is at present but i am afraid you will scarce know or own it on account of its deformity but if you do know it and bring it to an examen a little conversation with soul will strangely mend it and then reason will make the colors have a quite contrary effect to sir godfrey knellers for they will brighten and beautify by time and the picture which was shocking will become the admiration of all beholders i have been thus long before i begin to draw to prepare you and in order to make you read with patience i promise you that souls picture which follows after this will please better  first then self is plaguey forgetful she does not remember that ever she was younger or handsomer she does not remember that ever she was worse in circumstances and much unhappier than she is at present she does not remember the time when she was much less respected than she is at present she does not remember that she was taught and should believe that religion is the most useful thing in life and i am afraid poor self has forgot to say her prayers  secondly self is very vain and arrogant for self does not attribute her good success to the blessing and unbounded mercy of providence but fancies that all is owing to wit and beauty and a fine voice but to snow you how much self is mistaken though you may have these qualities remember that the captain is no judge and all is a gift from heaven it is a sign of too much arrogance in self to let the world and every new acquaintance see that she manages all by too often exposing the weakness of her consort for though some may praise that spirit which conquers a man others will put wrong constructions upon it not only reflecting upon selfs choice which calls her judgment in question but say hard things though very undeserved and self wont believe it without she hears it however when soul gets the management again self will only do it in cases of necessity and before particular friends  thirdly self is very shortsighted and a little dust called praise thrown into her eyes makes her quite blind for otherwise she would not do the very same thing she blames and dislikes in others self will often swallow down a heap of flattery offered by sneerers drink poison because sweetened with honey and believes the givers to be sincere though the next moment they expose the credulity of the person who they here have been praising if they call her a goddess she believes herself divine and expects to be worshipped if the next that comes pays no homage but is more sincere and gives advice or reproof he is called an enemy or at least said to be very ill bred and if any comes to mortify her with direct contradiction she could crush him to atoms and if she has no power to hurt him she will tear and pinch her own flesh though it was ridiculous in teague to say arra faith my master was my very good friend and a man of sense and i am a very honest man and in somebody else to say do you know what it is to affront one of my character i am a s  yet if self could remember she often says the very same things in other words but when soul teaches self even as a dart thrown from an enemy that wounds may be made useful if the point be taken off it will prove a good walkingcane to help self to go upright  fourthly self is very passionate and therefore cannot bear to be controlled she thinks him an enemy that does it in earnest and believes he can be no friend that does it in jest she miscalls her passions not to part with them rage she calls highspirit and courage and filling in with her humor true friendship but she is a great coward though she can scratch and tear if i mistake not self is terribly afraid of self and the thoughts of being alone is a most uncomfortable prospect to have one that we can unbosom to without reserve or fear may be called having a friend but it is not natural friendship to have one that shall love where we love and hate because we hate without any regard to the unreasonableness of every passion or the justice or injustice of affection and resentment this is by no means to be called friendship it is only a union of interest god forbid that should be called friendship can highwaymen be called friends yet they do all this they sing together they kill together they eat drink and whore together but as they dont act upon principle upon the least jar or falling out they hang one another friendship is a virtue and nothing of crime can be consistent with it follies and weaknesses we cannot be without in this l se but a true friendship is to pity and forgive not to encourage them it is having a slave and fawning parasite not a frind to have such a one as self calls so a true friend will advise and repro and condemn self for the sake of soul even to the hazard of disobliging self a friend must help us to curb our passions refuse assistances in things unjust endeavor to engage heaven in our cause when just and never let us alone till we apply also to the almighty power and make him our common friend in a word friendship is directed by right reason and cannot consist without christianity  fifthly self is a great fop and agreat slattern soul has given her very good clothes fine ornaments plain and neat but self either leaves them like a slut in every corner of the house or when she puts them on she does bedizen them with lace and embroidery fringes and ruffles patches and powder that you can hardly see enough of the garment to distinguish the excellent stuff which it is made of soul has given her a fine gown called good humor whose outside was a celestial blue called meekness lined with a white persian called humility what does self but throws off the outside saying it was foolish stuff and tramples the lining under foot so that one could scarce know it soul had given her a stomacher called sincerity and charged her to wear it only on sundays and holy days and never to put it on without serpentine lace called discretion with a charge to let other people discover it and not do as court ladies commonly do by their clothes that is show them to all their acquaintance as soon as they get them but the giddy thing wears it every day loses her lace and as children do cries every moment who see my fine stomacher so that it must be a discerning eye that knows it to be genuine soul gives her a fine snuff box in the shape of a heart full of plain spanish snuff self throws it out and fills it with gunpowder and hellebore soul gives her a censor full of balm called gratitude charging her to turn the pipe of it upwards and set it on fire twice a day to make the smoke of it rise up to heaven assuring her that she would then find such a fragrancy spread around that would cure all distempers of mind and ease all bodily pain but poor self said there was too much trouble in the management of it that she had forgot her instructions and the book was too big that gave an account of it that there was indeed a place where people met to use their censors but she had more inclination to sleep than manage her censor when she came there and therefore thought it better to stay at home since that self has never been rightly easy  soul s picture in miniature  soul is honest generous grateful unwilling to do but unwilling to bear wrong sincere and open but wants help to distinguisn and correct the faults of self and has not enough been used to reason and reflect which makes us sometimes mistake right for wrong but let him put on passions and consideration and once rouse his good qualities and self will be reformed and reunited the angels will resume their charge hell will be baffled heaven will rejoice and earth will honor and admire if soul will learn to forgive he will learn to be easy and such is the pleasure of the victory over self in that case that it is worth all the pains and none know but those who have felt it it is of the nature of generosity but far superior without forgiveness here there is no forgiveness in heaven with it there is endless joy and humility is the way to exaltation here and hereafter to become good consider how many you may see excel you in goodness on whom heaven has not bestowed the tenth part of what you enjoy to make yourself happy nor can you murmur when you consider how many far more deserving than yourself in every respect are infinitely more miserable than ever you was in your life i dont doubt but the good sense you are mistress of will make you know when you read and consider what i have said and i hope you will believe i wish you as well and am as much your friend as any one living  i am madam your etc  0 july      a key to the first volume of mr popes literary correspondence in the year      mr curll purchased a collection of mr popess letters to henry cromwell esquire written between the years   0  and      these letters mr pope in his remarks on the dunciad book ii verse    says were procured by one mrs thomas while he was almost a boy which the author was ashamed of as very trivial things full not only of levities but of wrong judgments of men and books and only excusable from the youth and inexperience of the writer  we desire the reader to observe that mr pope being born on the  th of june      and the last of his letters to mr cromwell bearing date december         proves him to have been in the   d year of his age how inexperienced a writer he was at that time we shall not determine but in the year      mr pope himself published some letters which he wrote to mr wycherley before he was    years of age so that his experience like a crab goes backwards monstrous absurdity  the letters between mr wycherley and mr pope open our literary correspondence about which there has been such an eclat there is little more to be seen in these letters but that mr pope rubs the old bards back and he in return chucks our young poetical saplin under the chin  in mr popes account of mr lintots journey with him to oxford speaking of mr oldisworth i lost
