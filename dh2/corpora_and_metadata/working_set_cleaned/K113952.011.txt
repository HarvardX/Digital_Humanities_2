an ode distant to southern climes the sloping sun hastens to bend his rays beyond the line where sagittary puts his armor on slung is the quiver where his arrows shine his azure bow reflects the solar beam while his bright darts across the horizon gleam now first the woodcock near the gelid stream seeks his known haunt amid the embrowned copse where cruel fowlers take their deadly aim inglorious triumph see the victim drops  forbear your savage sport  oh spare ye swains the new adventurers on britannias plains now sharper bites the hyperborean blast while eager morning chills us at the dawn with drizzling sleet the sky is overcast and the white frost bespangles over the lawn the wellnappd drugget clothes the rural folk and homely cots display a thicker smoke come myra since the woods have lost their shade since undelighting are the hills and plains quit we the villas while their glories fade to seek the town where gayer pleasure reigns but if the villas still delight my fair welcome the howling grove and brumal air she like content can bless the barren heath her presence bids the shaggy mount be smooth for where she treads fresh herbage springs beneath and myrtles blow in spite of winters tooth the rugged north acknowledging her charms suspends his anger and his blast disarms november a pastoral elegy what means honest shepherd this cloud on thy brow say where is thy mirth and thy melody now thy pipe thrown aside and thy looks full of thought as silent and sad as a bird newly caught has any misfortune befallen thy flocks any lambs been betrayed by the craft of the fox or murrain more fatal just seized on thy herd or has thy dear phillis let slip a cross word the season indeed may to musing incline now that greybearded winter makes autumn resign the hills all around us their russet put on and the skies seem in mourning for loss of the sun the winds make the tree where you sit shake its head yet though with dry leaves mother earths lap is spread her bosom to cheer us is verdant with wheat and the woods can supply us both pastime and meat o no says the shepherd i mourn none of these content with such changes as heaven shall please though now we have got the wrong side of the year twill turn up again and fresh beauties appear but the loss that i grieve for no time can restore  our master who loved us so well is no more that oak which we hoped would long shelter us all is fallen then well may we shake at its fall where find we a pastor so kind and so good so careful to feed us with wholesomest food to watch for our safety and drive far away the sly prowling fox always lurking for prey o may his remembrance for ever remain to shame those hard shepherds who mindful of gain only look at their sheep with an eye to their fleece and watch them no more than the fox watched the geese whom now shall i choose for the judge of my song or must my poor pipe on the willow be hung no more to commend that goodnature and sense which always could please but never once give offense what honor directed he firmly pursued yet would not his judgment on others obtrude still ready to help with his service and vote but never to thrust oar in another mans boat no more honest shepherd these sorrows resound the virtues thou praisest so hard to be found are yet not all fled  for the swain who succeeds to his fields and his herds is true heir to his deeds his pattern he will follow his gentleness use take care of the shepherds and cherish the muse then cease for the dead thy impertinent care rejoice  he revives in his brother and heir on the banishment

soul superior to the shocks of fate thy wisdom was thine only crime thy virtue thine offense with patriot zeal in urgent time thy countrys best defense no fordid bribe could taint thy spotless soul no fears nor threatening numbers could control what though some chief patricians stood firm to thy injured cause what though thyself displayed the flood of eloquence and laws no rhetoric no reason could

allured and witnesses by hopes and threats secured and yet they pleaded freedoms light beneath a thin disguise pleaded a specious show of right from treachery and lies assumed of freedom the judicial awe and coined severe oppression into law let clodius now in conquest reign exert his tyrant power and every nerve of justice strain the pageant of an hour let cringing fools adore their gilded god

powerful preacher show and let electrified attention glow catch the bright flames which from his lips distill and strike out all the teacher with thy quill oh could thou echolike his words repeat soft

yet a while suspend our doom thine eyes supply the shortening day and save us from the hastening gloom while thou art here we still shall see the fields the groves the meadows wear their gayest dress to honor thee then quit them till the rising year as yet the tepid zephyrs sport and wanton in the leafy grove as yet the nymphs and swains resort to dales and woods to talk of love the little birds in every glade with tuneful vows their mates accost secure of summer and of shade nor dread the piercing wintry frost ah pretty fools ye little know how soon your happiness must end cruel amanda will thou go and rob them of their only friend will thou the sun and summer fly they only stay to wait on thee and horrid winter watches nigh impatient till thou set him free then will these verdant lawns and groves with cheerless frosts be covered over the nymphs and swains forget their loves and birds and poets sing no more stella who never sues in vain and poor melissus beg thy stay o hear the suppliant nymph and swain and cheat grim winter of his prey the rattle a song written at erthighall in denbighshire by miss charlotte brereton mdccxxxii and addressed to daniel ivey esquire i will sing you a ballad  o that it were merry though not of the abbot of canterbury nor yet of those heroes presume i to sing who at windsor once frightened the ghost of a king derry down etc nor sing i the fiddle which often at longleate has charmed all its hearers with music so sweet nor that merry bard will i mention at all who to the same tune took a trip to downhall derry down etc my ballad is not full soon you will know it of abbot or hero or fiddle or poet but it is of a sprightly most whimsical rattle who exceeds all us women in chat and in prattle derry down etc this rattle of rattles if he is inclined can suit well his converse to every ones mind he never is foolish not wise out of season to the gay he chats nonsense to the grave he talks reason derry down etc the worst thing i ever observed in this rattle is that to the priesthood he is apt to give battle i am quite out of tune when he these makes a farce on for who knows but i may in time wed a parson derry down etc we women are apt to digress as i find when dear self or a parson comes into ones mind may the reverends in safety and sanctity rest all and may i continue at erthig a vestal derry down etc but as i was saying this rattle has said if he ever weds again he will have an old maid how happy is he for old spinsters are plenty though i am not of that list for i never saw twenty derry down etc with me his acquaintance may sing and rejoice that he makes so judicious so decent a choice it is so natural too for we frequently see that ivey will cling to an old withered tree derry down etc of all sorts of wit he is most fond of a ballad so asses eat thistles  instead of a sallad though he thinks that my innocent pen cannot hurt he may thank me for making my ballad so short derry down etc though short as it is he will think it too long should it chance for awhile to silence his tongue to be silent he hates as the deel holy water for all his delight is in chat and in laughter derry down etc a ballad he asked and a ballad here is but if he should chance to take something amiss he must even thank himself for insisting upon it so here ends my ballad or for rhymes sake my sonnet derry down etc the two sneerers by wh  your servant sir says surly quin  sir i am yours replies macklin  you are the very jew you play   your phiz performs the task well  and you are brute himself they say  and most accomplished maskwell says rich who heard the sneering elves and knew their horrid hearts   acting too much your very selves  ye overdo your parts oriental eclogues by mr william collins eclogue i selim or the shepherds moral scene a valley near bagdat time the morning ye persian maids attend your poets lays and hear how shepherds pass their golden days not all are blessed whom fortunes hand sustains with wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains well may your hearts believe the truths i tell it is virtue makes the bliss wherever we dwell thus selim sung by sacred truth inspired nor praise but such as truth bestowed desired wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed informing morals to the shepherd maid or taught the swains that surest bliss to find what groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind when sweet and blushing like a virgin bride the radiant morn resumed her orient pride when wanton gales along the valleys play breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away by tigris wandering waves he sat and sung this useful lesson for the fair and young ye persian dames he said to you belong well may they please the morals of my song no fairer maids i trust than you are found graced with soft arts the peopled world around the morn that lights you to your loves supplies each gentler ray delicious to your eyes for you those flowers her fragrant hands bestow and yours the love that kings delight to know yet think not these all beauteous as they are the best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair who trust alone in beautys feeble ray boast but the worth the gulf of that name famous for the pearlfishery balsoras pearls display drawn from the deep we own their surface bright but dark within they drink no lustrous light such are the maids and such the charms they boast by sense unaided or to virtue lost selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain that love shall blind when once he fires the swain or hope a lover by your faults to win as spots on errain beautify the skin who seeks secure to rule be first her care each softer virtue that adorns the fair each tender passion man delights to find the loved perfections of a female mind blessed were the days when wisdom held her reign and shepherds sought her on the silent plain with truth she wedded in the secret grove immortal truth and daughters blessed their love o haste fair maids ye virtues come away sweet peace and plenty lead you on your way the balmy shrub for you shall love our shore by ind excelled or araby no more lost to our fields for so the fates ordain the dear deserters shall return again come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear to lead the train sweet modesty appear here make thy court amidst our rural scene and shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid but man the most  not more the mountain do holds the swift falcon for her deadly foe cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew a silken veil conceals her from the view no wild desires amidst thy train be known but faith whose heart is fixed on one alone desponding meekness with her downcast eyes and friendly pity full of tender sighs and love the last by these your hearts approve these are the virtues that must lead to love thus sung the swain and ancient legends say the maids of bagdat verified the lay dear to the plains the virtues came along the shepherds loved and selim blessed his song eclogue ii hassan or the cameldriver scene the desert time midday in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lillypeace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaid by thee ah why was ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o cease my fears  all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from shiraz walls i bent my way at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if ought of rest i find upon my sleep or some swollen serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind  sad was the hour and luckless was the day  when first from shiraz walls i bent my way o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said  farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain  whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain  yet as thou go may every blast arise  weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs  safe over the wild no perils may thou see  no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn o let me teach my heart to lose its fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way eclogue iii abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade what time it is sweet over fields of rice to stray or scent the breathing maize at setting day amidst the maids of zagens peaceful grove emyra sung the pleasing cares of love of abra first began the tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lillies rear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late at silent eve she penned the fold deep in the grove beneath the secret shade a various wreath of odorous flowers she made that these flowers are found in very great abundance in some of the provinces of persia see the modern history of the ingenious mr salmon gaymotleyd pinks and sweet jonquils she chose the violet blue that on the mossbank grows allsweet to sense the flaunting rose was there the finished chaplet welladornd her hair great abbas chanced that fated morn to stray by love conducted from the chase away among the vocal vales he heard her song and sought the vales and echoing groves among at length he found and wooed the rural maid she knew the monarch and with fear obeyed  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved the royal lover bore her from the plain yet still her crook and bleating flock remain often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu fair happy maid to other scenes remove to richer scenes of golden power and love go leave the simple pipe and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved and often the royal lover left the care and thorns of state attendant on the fair often to the shades and lowroofd cots retired or sought the vale where first his heart was fired a russet mantle like a swain he wore and thought of crowns and busy courts no more  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved blessed was the life that royal abbas led sweet was his love and innocent his bed what if in wealth the noble maid excel the simple shepherd girl can love as well let those who rule on persias jewelld throne be famed for love and gentlest love alone or wreathe like abbas full of fair renown the lovers myrtle with the warriors crown o happy days the maids around her say o haste profuse of blessings haste away  be every youth like royal abbas moved  and every georgian maid like abra loved eclogue iv agib and secander or the fugitives scene a mountain in circassia time midnight in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak secander thus began secander o stay thee agib for my feet deny no longer friendly to my life to fly friend of my heart o turn thee and survey trace our sad flight through all its length of way and first review that longextended plain and yon wide groves already past with pain yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried and last this lofty mountains weary side  agib weak as thou art yet hapless must thou know the toils of flight or some severer woe still as i haste the tartar shouts behind and shrieks and sorrows load the saddening wind in rage of heart with ruin in his hand he blasts our harvests and deforms our land yon citron grove whence first in fear we came droops its fair honors to the conquering flame far fly the swains like us in deep despair and leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have lent the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabrans flowery plain and once by maids and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shady grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale fair scenes but ah no more with peace possessed with ease alluring and with plenty blessed no more the shepherds whitening tents appear nor the kind products of a bounteous year no more the date with snowy blossoms crowned but ruin spreads her baleful fires around  secander in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes in tears their fruitless grief must send those hairs the tartars cruel hand shall rend  agib ye georgian swains that piteous learn from far circassias ruin and the waste of war some weightier arms than crooks and staffs prepare to shield your harvests and defend your fair the turk and tartar like designs pursue fixed to destroy and steadfast to undo wild as his land in native deserts bred by lust incited or by malice led the villain arab as he prowls for prey often marks with blood and wasting flames the way yet none so cruel as the tartar foe to death inured and nursed in scenes of woe he said when loud along the vale was heard a shriller shriek and nearer fires appeared the affrighted shepherds through the dews of night wide over the moonlight hills renewed their flight  twelve odes by the same ode to pity o thou the friend of man assigned with balmy hands his wounds to bind and charm his frantic woe when first distress with dagger keen broke forth to waste his destined scene his wild unsated foe by pellas euripides bard a magic name by all the griefs his thought could frame receive my humble rite long pity let the nations view thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue and eyes of dewy light but wherefore need i wander wide to old ilissus distant fide deserted stream and mute wild arun a river in sussex too has heard thy strains and echo midst my native plains been soothed by pitys lute there first the wren thy myrtles shed on gentlest otways infant head to him thy cell was shown and while he sung the female heart with youths soft notes unspoild by art thy turtles mixed their own come pity come by fancys aid even now my thoughts relenting maid thy temples pride design its southern site its truth complete shall raise a wild enthusiast heat in all who view the shrine there pictures toils shall well relate how chance or hard involving fate over mortal bliss prevail the buskined muse shall near her stand and sighing prompt her tender hand with each disastrous tale there let me often retired by day in dreams of passion melt away allowed with thee to dwell there waste the mournful lamp of night till virgin thou again delight to hear a british shell ode to fear thou to whom the world unknown with all its shadowy shapes is shown who see appalled the unreal scene while fancy lifts the veil between ah fear ah frantic fear i see i see thee near i know thy hurried step thy haggard eye like thee i start like thee disordered fly for lo what monsters in thy train appear danger whose limbs of giant mold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round an hideous form howling amidst the midnight storm or throws him on the ridgy steep of some loose hanging rock to sleep and with him thousand phantoms joined who prompt to deeds accursed the mind and those the fiends who near allied over natures wounds and wrecks preside while vengeance in the lurid air lifts her red arm exposed and bare on whom that ravening brood of fate who lap the blood of sorrow wait who fear this ghastly train can see and look not madly wild like thee epode in earliest greece to thee with partial choice the grieffull muse addressed her infant tongue the maids and matrons on her awful voice silent and pale in wild amazement hung yet he the bard aeschylus who first invoked thy name disdained in marathon its power to feel for not alone he nursed the poets flame but reached from virtues hand the patriots steel but who is he whom later garlands grace who left awhile over hyblas dews to rove with trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace where thou and furies shared the baleful grove wrapped in thy cloudy veil the incestuous queen jocasta  sighed the sad call her son and husband heard when once alone it broke the silent scene and he the wretch of thebes no more appeared o fear i know thee by my throbbing heart thy withering power inspired each mournful line though gentle pity claim her mingled part yet all the thunders of the scene are thine antistrophe thou who such weary lengths have past where will thou rest mad nymph at last say will thou shroud in haunted cell where gloomy rape and murder dwell or in some hollowed seat against which the big waves beat hear drowning seamens cries in tempests brought dark power with shuddering meek submitted thought be mine to read the visions old which thy awakening bards have told and lest thou meet my blasted view hold each strange tale devoutly true never be i found by thee oerawd in that thricehallowd eve abroad when ghosts as cottagemaids believe their pebbled beds

divine emotions spoke hither again thy fury deal teach me but once like him to feel his cypress wreath my meed decree and i o fear will dwell with thee ode to simplicity o thou by nature taught to breathe her genuine thought in numbers warmly pure and sweetly strong who first on mountains wild in fancy loveliest child thy babe or pleasures nursed the powers of song thou who with hermit heart disdainst the wealth of art and gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall but come a decent maid in attic robe arrayed o chaste unboastful nymph to thee i call by all the honeyd store on hyblas thy my shore by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear by her whose lovelorn woe in evening musings slow soothed sweetly sad electras poets ear by old cephisus deep who spread his wavy sweep in warbled wanderings round thy green retreat on whose enameled side when holy freedom died no equal haunt allured thy future feet o sister meek of truth to my admiring youth thy sober aid and native charms infuse the flowers that sweetest breathe though beauty culled the wreath still ask thy hand to range their ordered hues while rome could none esteem but virtues patriot theme you loved her hills and led her laureate band but staid to sing alone to one distinguished throne and turned thy face and fled her altered land no more in hall or bower the passions own thy power love only love her forceless numbers mean for thou have left her shrine nor olive more nor vine shall gain thy feet to bless the servile scene though taste though genius bless to some divine excess faints the cold work till thou inspire the whole what each what all supply may court may charm our eye thou only thou can raise the meeting soul of these let others ask to aid some mighty task i only seek to find thy temperate vale

only of expressing thoughts language never could impart now night her mournful mantle spreading had robbed with black the horizon round and dank dews from her tresses shedding with genial moisture bathed the ground when back to city follies flying midst customs slaves he lived resigned his face arrayed in smiles denying the true complexion of his mind for seriously around surveying each character in youth and age of fools betrayed and knaves betraying that played upon this human stage peaceful himself and undesigning he loathed the scenes of guile and strife and felt each secret wish inclining to leave this fretful farce of life yet to whatever above was fated obediently he bowed his soul for what all bounteous heaven created he thought heaven only should control the lass of isle worth mill by the rev mr woodeson dan pope first in vogue brought the blithe molly mogg and flourished her praise with his quill but strange that as yet no twickenham wit ever thought of a neighboring mill that the seas foamy juice did venus produce let poets insist on it still i stoutly aver that a fairer than her took her rise from the froth of the mill but say o ye nine how a nymph so divine could the lap of a millers wife fill say did not some god stray out of his road and set up his staff in the mill jove roguish and loose in the shape of a goose did leda so lovingly bill that helen she hatched who never was matched but by the fair lass of the mill in another disguise alemna he plies like amphitryon he frolics his fill then why might not jove as a cloak for his love take upon him the man of the mill no to tell every grace of this fresh water lass i must own far surpasses my skill even pope could not do it and from head to foot describe the fair lass of the mill once homer inflamed an hundred tongues claimed some arduous task to fulfill let me tell thee old bard this task were too hard though thou had all the clacks of the mill ye youth all beware she is bewitchingly fair her eyes most assuredly kill and a bosom more sleek than the downy swans neck has the beautiful lass of the mill under petticoat red though her feet be well hid yet peep they alternately will which plainly must show more charms in perdue has the beautiful lass of the mill but fie muse forbear it is better by far no more of those charms to reveal so doing you might new rivals excite and carry more sacks to the mill with influence benign ah would she incline with my stars but to favor my will so it might be with her twould be raptures i swear and music to live in a mill then fairone be kind nor with water or wind inconstant turn round like the wheel lest when i am dead it might justly be said that thy heart was the stone of the mill a song unjustly cloe you suggest that i inconstant have possessed or loved a fairer she would you at once with ease be cured of all the ills you have long endured consult your glass and see and if you think that i can find a nymph more fair or one more kind you have reason for your fears but if impartial you will prove to your own beauty and my love how needless are your tears if in my way i should by chance give or receive an amorous glance i like but while i view how slights the glance how faint the kiss to that much more substantial bliss which i receive from you with wanton flight the curious be through beds of violets ranges free and where each floweret blows extracts the juice of all he meets but for his quintessence of sweets he settles on the rose so i my passion to employ in each variety of joy from nymph to nymph may roam perhaps see fifty in a day those are but visits which i pay but cloe is my home elegy a shepherdess laments her drowned lover ye maids of the village attend to the sorrowful tale i now speak oh refuse not your comfort to lend for my heart is just ready to break ye knew my dear celadon well he was sprightly and handsome and young on his lips what persuasion did dwell how melodiously soft was his song he was all my fond heart ever desired he was all that was generous and brave what pity the charms i admired from death had not power to save but just as the day did approach to give the dear youth to my arms from the waters they brought me his corse how faded were all his gay charms as the lily when drooping with rain dejectedly hangs down its head so languishd his beautiful cheek and all its vermilion was fled his voice that as music was sweet no more i enraptured shall hear no more the fond swain shall repeat a tale of soft love in my ear convey the dear youth to his grave lest his beautiful form i adore yet one silent kiss let me have for alas i shall see him no more ye maidens attend on his bier and strew all the pathway with flowers and oh ye kind deities hear may their loves be more happy than ours as for me i will henceforth beware how in love i engage my fond heart for though love is a joy how severe is the pang from a lover to part zelis at tripoli to ibrahim is the late tripoli ambassador and zelis his wife ibrahim in london an epistle she has heard of his infidelity to her which occasions a fit of illness in which she writes this  oh thou delight and sovereign of my soul haste to revisit thy loved native shore quick as the lightning flies from pole to pole fly thou to me ere yet i am no more those charms which thou were wont so much to prize those charms alas are now for ever fled faded and gone the luster of my eyes and all the roses on my cheeks are dead as the pale lily drenched with morning dews hangs down dejectedly its drooping head so my wan cheek to the beholder shows never to resume its once delicious red black boding thoughts first robbed me of my peace and long in secret on my mind have preyed in vain is medicine tried to give me ease in vain alas is the physicians aid for babbling fame has whispered in my ear since you your zelis could no longer see that to your bosom she no more is dear and ibrahim is false to love and me that youre a rover like the birds of air or like the be that sips each honied flower you flutter round each gay fantastic fair and fondly court her to the myrtle bower does the first object of my early love to whom i gave my spotless virgin charms ungrateful to his faithful zelis prove and waste his substance in a dancers arms hark honor warns thee from each vicious deed oh rouse each virtue sleeping in thy breast thy zelis bosom then no more shall bleed no more shall be with jealous cares oppressed what would thou think if traitor to thy bed thy zelis should while thou art absent prove by every amorous youth astray be led and to whoever courts her yield her love but she though sharp thorns rankle in her breast still to her mate like philomel is true like that sweet bird at night can take no rest but sings a plaintive song of love and you no need have i of slaves to guard my door of negro hags most hideous to the sight virtue can shield whoever she dwells with more than eunuchs watching round her bed each night oh think thou dear destroyer of my ease oh think how cruel those deep wounds must prove how it must rob me of all joy and peace to know that ibrahims faithless to his love haste to my arms before my eyes i close to calm the torments i for thee endure haste for it is thou alone can bring repose the hand that gave the wound alone can cure oh then restore my peace before i die let me thy graceful manly person view oh let me hear thee say that though thy eye was free thy heart to me was always true so will i clasp thee in my longing arms so will i bless thee with my latest breath so will i pleased resign my faded charms to the relentless claycold hands of death and sure these faded charms again shall bloom and like to mans my soul to heaven shall fly my body rise more glorious from the tomb and live with allah to eternity else why has heaven bestowed a generous mind adorned with virtue constancy and love if here on earth no due reward they find they

with their spouse content or constant to their sighing mate how seldom souls below are joined for one another formed above how seldom pairs of hearts we find by heaven ordained for mutual love thus mans inconstant soul we blame for want of knowledge or of thought when all the while it is in the frame of both their bodies lies the fault when jove had made this little ball for fourleggd beasts and creeping things at length he formed to govern all a twoleggd creature without wings millions of these he made at once to save himself all further trouble and men and women for the nonce by pairs like tallies he made double then from olympus dreadful top well shaken in a bag together he tossed them down and let them drop just as it pleased the wind or weather some fell in asia some in greece in england some and some in spain but seldom two of the same piece in the same climate met again hence men who grown to riper years remembering this their former making hunt up and down to find their

in my bosom nor mine is the care or to tread the right path or my food to prepare ever my wishes i speak every want is supplied and how can i err  when the lord is my guide by the hand of indulgence each day am i blessed and am lulled every night on the pillow of rest when hungry my shepherd his votary leads to the banquet of nature that smiles on the meads and commands when i am thirsty my fever to cease with pure living streams from the fountain of peace thus calmly i wander the journey of life unknowing of sorrows unruffled by strife my shepherd still soothing with tender control each rebel of passion that heaves in my soul still pointing indulgent the path to my sight  and how happy am i  when i know it is the right should i tread the lone valley the comfortless ground where death spreads a midnight of darkness around no danger of fear  while i roam over the plain oh death all thy horrors and frowns are in vain still still through the desert my shepherd attends of parents the fondest the dearest of friends ah vainly ye wicked ye point at my heart for the hand of the lord turns aside every dart ah vainly believe me your rage ye employ to sully the sweets of an innocent joy the oil of delight shall still stream on my head and my cup the rich fountains of transport shall shed yes  faithful attendants  unmoved from my side thy truth shall protect me thy mercy shall guide yes  lifes little round with such friends will i stray nor heed any danger that frowns in my way then  wing my bold flight to my saviors abode and prostrate my soul at the throne of my god a divine pastoral by dr byron the lord is my shepherd my guardian and guide whatsoever i want he will kindly provide ever since i was born it is he that has crowned the life that he gave me with blessings all round while yet on the breast a poor infant i hung ever time had unloosend the strings of my tongue he gave me the help which i could not then ask now therefore to thank him shall be my tongues task through my tenderest years with as tender a care my soul like a lamb in his bosom he bare to the brook he would lead me whenever i had need and point out the pasture where best i might feed no harm could approach me for he was my shield from the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field the wolf to devour me would oftentimes prowl but the lord was my shepherd and guarded my soul how often in my youth have i wandered astray and still he has brought me back to the right way when lost in dark error no path i could meet his word like a lantern has guided my feet what wondrous escapes to his kindness i owe when rash and unthinking i sought my own woe my soul had long since been gone down the deep if the lord had not watched when i was asleep whensoeer at a distance he sees me afraid he skips over the mountain and comes to my aid then leads me back gently and bids me abide in the midst of his flock and feed close by his side how safe in his keeping how happy and free could i always remain where he bids me to be yea blessed are the people and happy thrice told that obey the lords voice and abide in his fold the fold it is full and the pasture is green all is friendship and love and no enmity seen there the lord dwells among us upon his own hill with the flocks all around him awaiting his will himself in the midst with a provident eye regarding our wants and procuring supply an abundance springs up of each nourishing bud and we gather his gifts and are filled with good at his voice or example we move or we stay for the lord is himself both our leader and way the hills smoke with incense wherever he has trod and a sacred perfume shows the footsteps of god while blessed with his presence the valleys beneath a sweet smelling savor incessantly breathe the delight is renewed of each sensible thing and beheld in their bloom all the beauties of spring or if a quite different scene he prepare and we march through the wilderness barren and bare by his wonderful works we see plainly enough that the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof if we hunger or thirst and are ready to faint a relief in due season prevents our complaint the rain at his word brings us food from the sky and rocks become rivers when we are adry from the fruitfullest hill to the barrenest rock the lord has made all for the sake of his flock and the flock in return the lord always confess in plenty their joy and their hope in distress he beholds in our welfare his glory displayed and we find ourselves blessed in obedience repaid with a cheerful regard we attend to his ways our attention is prayer and our cheerfulness praise the lord is my shepherd what then shall i fear what danger can frighten me while he is near not when the time calls me to walk through the vale of the shadow of death shall my heart ever fail though afraid of myself to pursue the dark way thy rod and thy staff be my comfort and stay for i know by thy guidance when once it is past to a fountain of life it will bring me at last the lord is become my salvation and song his blessing shall follow me all my life long whatsoever condition he places me in i am sure it is the best it could ever have been for the lord he is good and his mercies are sure he only afflicts us in order to cure the lord will i praise while i have any breath be content all my life and resigned at my death on friendship  nomen inane vale friendship adieu thou dear deceitful good so much professed so little understood how often to thy sacred injured name a thousand vain pretenders lay their claim like flies attend the

this night the poor mans prisoners friend an evening hymn by sir thomas brown author of religio medici the night is come like to the day depart not thou great god away let not my sins black as the night eclipse the luster of thy light keep still in my horizon for to me the sun makes not the day but thee thou whose nature cannot sleep on my temples centry keep guard me against those watchful foes whose eyes are open while mine close let no dreams my head infest but such as jacobs temples blessed while i do rest my soul advance and make my sleep an holy trance that i may my rest being wrought awake into some holy thought and with as active vigor run my course as does the nimble sun sleep is a death o make me try by sleeping what it is to die and as gently lay my head on my grave as now my head however i rest great god let me awake again at last with thee and thus assured behold i lie securely or to wake or die these are my drowsy days in vain i now do wake to sleep again o come that hour when i shall never sleep again but wake for ever a thought at waking that morning too will dawn when i shall rise fresh from the dust and soaring seek the skies then why should i lament that night draws on and tired refuse to lay my burden down though others more yet i enough have seen and guess what is to be by what has been and since my youthful days now almost past have pleased so little welcome thou my last it is the least care of all that fills this head what men design when i have stole to bed closing my eyes the world i now enclose and fancy waking murders my repose but in
