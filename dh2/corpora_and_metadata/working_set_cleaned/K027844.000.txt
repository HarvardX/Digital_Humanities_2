a proposal for the better supplying of churches in our foreign plantations and for converting the savage americans to christianity  the harvest is truly great but the laborers are few luke c  0 v   london printed by h woodfall at elzevirs head without temple bar       a proposal for the better supplying of churches in our foreign plantations etc although there are several excellent persons of the church of england whose good intentions and endeavors have not been wanting to propagate the gospel in foreign parts who have even combined into a society for that very purpose and given great encouragement not only for english missionaries in the west indies but also for the reformed of other nations led by their example to propagate christianity in the east it is nevertheless acknowledged that there is at this day but little sense of religion and a most notorious corruption of manners in the english colonies settled on the continent of america and the islands it is also acknowledged that the gospel has hitherto made but a very inconsiderable progress among the neighboring americans who still continue in muchwhat the same ignorance and barbarism in which we found them above a hundred years ago  i shall therefore venture to submit my thoughts upon a point that i have long considered to better judgments in hopes that any expedient will be favorably hearkened to which is proposed for the remedy of these evils now in order to effect this it should seem the natural proper method to provide in the first place a constant supply of worthy clergymen for the english churches in those parts and in the second place a like constant supply of zealous missionaries well fitted for propagating christianity among the savages  for though the surest means to reform the morals and soften the behavior of men be to preach to them the pure incorrupt doctrine of the gospel yet it cannot be denied that the success of preaching depends in good measure on the character and skill of the preacher forasmuch as mankind are more apt to copy characters than to practice precepts and forasmuch as argument to attain it is full strength does not less require the life of zeal than the weight of reason and the same doctrine which makes great impression when delivered with decency and address loses very much of its force by passing through awkward or unskilful hands  now the clergy sent over to america have proved too many of them very meanly qualified both in learning and morals for the discharge of their office and indeed little can be expected from the example or instruction of those who quit their native country on no other motive than that they are not able to procure a livelihood in it which is known to be often the case  and though it be allowed that some of these have approved themselves men of merit it will at the same time be allowed that the most zealous and able missionary from england must find himself but ill qualified for converting the heathen if we consider the difference of language their wild way of living and above all the great jealousy and prejudice which savage nations have toward foreigners or innovations introduced by them  these considerations make it evident that a college or seminary in those parts is very much wanted and therefore the providing such a seminary is earnestly proposed and recommended to all those who have it in their power to contribute to so good a work by this two ends would be obtained  first the youth of our english plantations might be themselves fitted for the ministry and men of merit would be then glad to fill the churches of their native country which are now a drain for the very dregs and refuse of ours  at present there are i am told many churches vacant in our plantations and many very ill supplied nor can all the vigilance and wisdom of that great prelate whose peculiar care it is prevent this so long as the aforesaid churches are supplied from england  and supplied they must be with such as can be picked up in england or ireland till a nursery of learning for the education of the natives is founded this indeed might provide a constant succession of learned and exemplary pastors and what effect this must be supposed to have on their flocks i need not say  secondly the children of savage americans brought up in such a seminary and well instructed in religion and learning might make the ablest and properest missionaries for spreading the gospel among their countrymen who would be less apt to suspect and readier to embrace a doctrine recommended by neighbors or relations men of their own blood and language than if it were proposed by foreigners who would not improbably be thought to have designs on the liberty or property of their converts  the young americans necessary for this purpose may in the beginning be procured either by peaceable methods from those savage nations which border on our colonies and are in friendship with us or by taking captive the children of our enemies  it is proposed to admit into the aforesaid college only such savages as are under ten years of age before evil habits have taken a deep root and yet not so early as to prevent retaining their mother tongue which should be preserved by intercourse among themselves  it is further proposed to ground these young americans thoroughly in religion and morality and to give them a good tincture of other learning particularly of eloquence history and practical mathematics to which it may not be improper to add some skill in physic  if there were a yearly supply of ten or a dozen such missionaries sent abroad into their respective countries after they had received the degree of master of arts in the aforesaid college and holy orders in england till such time as episcopacy be established in those parts it is hardly to be doubted but in a little time the world would see good and great effects thereof  for to any considering man the employing american missionaries for the conversion of america will of all others appear the most likely method to succeed especially if care be taken that during the whole course of their education an eye should be had to their mission that they should be taught betimes to consider themselves as trained up in that sole view without any other prospect of provision or employment that a zeal for religion and love of their country should be early and constantly instilled into their minds by repeated lectures and admonitions that they should not only be incited by the common topics of religion and nature but farther animated and enflamed by the great examples in past ages of public spirit and virtue to rescue their countrymen from their savage manners to a life of civility and religion  if his majesty would graciously please to grant a charter for a college to be erected in a proper place for these uses it is to be hoped a fund may be soon raised by the contribution of welldisposed persons sufficient for building and endowing the same for as the necessary expense would be small so there are men of religion and humanity in england who would be pleased to see any design set forward for the glory of god and the good of mankind  a small expense would suffice to subsist and educate the american missionaries in a plain simple manner such as might make it easy for them to return to the coarse and poor methods of life in use among their countrymen and nothing can contribute more to lessen this expense than a judicious choice of the situation where the seminary is to stand  many things ought to be considered in the choice of a situation it should be in a good air in a place where provisions are cheap and plenty where an intercourse might easily be kept up with all parts of america and the islands in a place of security not exposed to the insuits of pirates savages or other enemies where there is no great trade which might tempt the readers or fellows of the college to become merchants to the neglect of their proper business where there are neither riches nor luxury to divert or lessen their application or to make them uneasy and dissatisfied with a homely frugal subsistence lastly where the inhabitants if such a place may be found are noted for innocence and simplicity of manners i need not say of how great importance this point would be toward forming the morals of young students and what mighty influence it must have on the mission  it is evident the college long since projected in barbados would be defective in many of these particulars for though it may have its use among the inhabitants yet a place of so high trade so much wealth and luxury and such dissolute morals not to mention the great price and scarcity of provisions must at first sight seem a very improper situation for a general seminary intended for the forming missionaries and educating youth in religion and sobriety of manners the same objections lie against the neighboring islands  and if we consider the accounts given of their avarice and licentiousness their coldness in the practice of religion and their aversion from propagating it which appears in the withholding their slaves from baptism it is to be feared that the inhabitants in the populous parts of our plantations on the continent are not much fitter than those in the islands abovementioned to influence or assist such a design and as to the more remote and less frequented parts the difficulty of being supplied with necessaries the danger of being exposed to the inroads of savages and above all the want of intercourse with other places render them improper situations for a seminary of religion and learning  it will not be amiss to insert here an observation i remember to have seen in an abstract of the proceedings etc annexed to the dean of canterburys sermon before the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts that the savage indians who live on the continent will not suffer their children to learn english or dutch lest they should be debauched by conversing with their european neighbors which is a melancholy but strong confirmation of the truth of what has been now advanced  a general intercourse and correspondence with all the english colonies both on the islands and the continent and with other parts of america has been before laid down as a necessary circumstance the reason whereof is very evident but this circumstance is hardly to be found for on the continent where there are neither inns nor carriages nor bridges over the rivers there is no traveling by land between distant places and the english settlements are reputed to extend along the seacoast for the space of fifteen hundred miles it is therefore plain there can be no convenient communication between them otherwise than by sea no advantage therefore in this point can be gained by settling on the continent  there is another consideration which equally regards the continent and islands that the general course of trade and correspondence lies from all those colonies to great britain alone whereas for our present purpose it would be necessary to pitch upon a place if such could be found which maintains a constant intercourse with all the other colonies and whose commerce lies chiefly or altogether not in europe but in america  there is but one spot that i can find to which this circumstance agrees and that is the isles of bermuda otherwise called the summer islands these having no rich commodity or manufacture such as sugar tobacco or the like wherewithal to trade to england are obliged to become carriers for america as the dutch are for europe the bermudans are excellent shipwrights and sailors and have a great number of very good sloops which are always passing and repassing from all parts of america they drive a constant trade to the islands of jamaica barbados antego etc with butter onions cabbages and other roots and vegetables which they have in great plenty and perfection they have also some small manufactures of joyners work and matting which they export to the plantations on the continent hence bermudan sloops are oftener seen in the ports of america than any other and indeed by the best information i could get it appears they are the only people of all the british plantations who hold a general correspondence with the rest  and as the commerce of bermuda renders it a very fit place wherein to erect a seminary so likewise does its situation it being placed between our plantations on the continent and those in the isles so as equally to respect both to which may be added that it lies in the way of vessels passing from america to great britain all which makes it plain that the youth to be educated in a seminary placed in the summer islands would have frequent opportunities of going thither and corresponding with their friends it must indeed be owned that some will be obliged to go a long way to any one place which we suppose resorted to from all parts of our plantations but if we were to look out a spot the nearest approaching to an equal distance from all the rest i believe it would be found to be bermuda it remains that we see whether it enjoys the other qualities or conditions laid down as well as this  the summer islands are situated near the latitude of thirty three degrees no part of the world enjoys a purer air or a more temperate climate the great ocean which environs them at once moderating the heat of the south winds and the severity of the north west such a latitude on the continent might be thought too hot but the air in bermuda is perpetually fanned and kept cool by seabreezes which renders the weather the most healthy and delightful that could be wished being as is affirmed by persons who have long lived there of one equal tenor almost throughout the whole year like the latter end of a fine may insomuch that it is resorted to as the montpelier of america  nor are these isles less remarkable for plenty than for health there being besides beef mutton and fowl great abundance of fruits and gardenstuff of all kinds in perfection to this if we add the prodigious plenty and variety of excellent fish which is every day taken on their coasts it would seem that a seminary could no where be supplied with better provisions or cheaper than here  about forty years ago upon cutting down many tall cedars that sheltered their orange trees from the northwestwind which sometimes blows even there so as to affect that delicate plant great part of their orange plantations suffered but other cedars are since grown up and no doubt a little industry would again produce as great plenty of oranges as ever was there heretofore i mention this because some have inferred from the present scarcity of that fruit for which bermuda was once so famous that there has been a change in the soil and climate for the worse but this as has been observed proceeded from another cause which is now in great measure taken away  bermuda is a cluster of small islands which lie in a very narrow compass containing in all not quite twenty thousand acres this groupe of isles is to use mr wallers expression walled round with rocks which render them inaccessible to pirates or enemies there being but two narrow entrances both well guarded by forts it would therefore be impossible to find any where a more secure retreat for students  the trade of bermuda consists only in gardenstuff and some poor manufactures principally of cedar and the palmetto leaf bermuda hats are worn by our ladies they are made of a sort of mat or as they call it platting made of the palmetto leaf which is the only commodity that i can find exported from bermuda to great britain and as there is no prospect of making a fortune by this small trade so it cannot be supposed to tempt the fellows of the college to engage in it to the neglect of their peculiar business which might possibly be the case elsewhere  such as their trade is such is their wealth the inhabitants being much poorer than the other colonies who do not fail to despise them upon that account but if they have less wealth they have withal less vice and expensive folly than their neighbors they are represented as a contented plain innocent sort of people free from avarice and luxury as well as the other corruptions that attend those vices  i am also informed that they are more constant attendants on divine service more kind and respectful to their pastor when they have one and show much more humanity to their slaves and charity to one another than is observed among the english in the other plantations one reason of this may be that condemned criminals being employed in the manufactures of sugar and tobacco were never transported thither but whatever be the cause the facts are attested by a clergyman of good credit who lived long among them  among a people of this character and in a situation thus circumstantiated it would seem that a religious seminary might very fitly be placed the correspondence with other parts of america the goodness of the air the plenty and security of the place the frugality and innocence of the inhabitants all conspiring to favor such a design thus much at least is evident that young students would be there less liable to be corrupted in their morals and the governing part would be easier and better contented with a small stipend and a retired academical life in a corner from whence avarice and luxury are excluded than they can be supposed to be in the midst of a full trade and great riches attended with all that high living and parade which our planters affect and which as well as all fashionable vices should be far removed from the eyes of the young american missionaries who are to lead a life of poverty and selfdenial among their countrymen  after all it must be acknowledged that though every thing else should concur with our wishes yet if a set of good governors and teachers be wanting who are acquainted with the methods of education and have the zeal and ability requisite for carrying on a design of this nature it would certainly come to nothing  an institution of this kind should be set on foot by men of prudence spirit and zeal as well as competent learning who should be led to it by other motives than the necessity of picking up a maintenance for upon this view what man of merit can be supposed to quit his native country and take up with a poor collegesubsistance in another part of the world where there are so many considerable parishes actually void and so many others ill supplied for want of fitting incumbents is it likely that fellowships of forty or fifty pounds a year should tempt abler or worthier men than benefices of many times their value  and except able and worthy men do first engage in this affair with a resolution to exert themselves in forming the manners of the youth and giving them a proper education it is evident the mission and the college will be but in a very bad way this inconvenience seems the most difficult to provide against and if not provided against it will be the most likely to obstruct any design of this nature so true it is that where ignorance or ill manners once take place in a seminary they are sure to be handed down in a succession of illiterate or worthless men  there are many instances of this in the jesuites colleges throughout italy where the noblest foundations and the finest geniuss in the world are quite lost by a wrong turn and taste in the regents and to come nearer our present case the same may be observed in the two presbyterian colleges of new england which have so long subsisted to little or no purpose if we may believe the accounts that are given of them see british empire in america  but this apprehension which seems so well grounded that a college in any part of america would either lie unprovided or be worse provided than their churches are has no place in bermuda there being at this time several gentlemen in all respects very well qualified and in possession of good preferments and fair prospects at home who having seriously considered the great benefit that may arise to the church and to mankind from such an undertaking are ready to engage in it and to dedicate the remainder of their lives to the instructing the youth of america and prosecuting their own studies upon a very moderate subsistence in a retirement so sweet and so secure and every way so well fitted for a place of education and study as bermuda  thus much the writer hereof thought himself obliged to say of his associates for himself he can only say that as he values no preferment upon earth so much as that of being employed in the execution of this design so he hopes to make up for other defects by his industry and zeal  in europe the protestant religion has of late years considerably lost ground and america seems the likeliest place wherein to make up for what has been lost in europe provided the proper methods are taken otherwise the spanish missionaries in the south and the french in the north are making such a progress as may one day spread the religion of rome and with it the usual hatred to protestants throughout all the savage nations in america which would probably end in the utter extirpation of our colonies on the safety whereof depends so much of the nations wealth and so considerable a branch of his majestys revenue  but if this scheme were pursued it would in all probability have much greater influence on the americans than the utmost endeavors of popish emissaries can possibly have who from the difference of country language and interest must lie under far greater difficulties and discouragements than those whom we suppose yearly sent out from bermuda to preach among their countrymen  it cannot indeed be denied that the great number of poor regulars inured to hard living and brought up in an implicit obedience to their superiors has hitherto given the church of rome in regard to her missions great advantage over the reformed churches but from what has been said it is i think evident that this advantage may be overballanced by our employing american missionaries  nor is the honor of the crown nation and church of england unconcerned in this scheme which it is to be hoped will remove the reproach we have so long lain under that we fall as far short of our neighbors of the romish communion in zeal for propagating religion as we surpass them in the soundness and purity of it and at the same time that the doing what may be so easily done takes away our reproach it will cast no small luster on his majestys reign and derive a blessing from heaven on his administration and those who live under the influence thereof  men of narrow minds have a peculiar talent at objection being never at a loss for something to say against whatsoever is not of their own proposing and perhaps it will be said in opposition to this proposal that if we thought ourselves capable of gaining converts to the church we ought to begin with papists infidels and dissenters of all denominations at home and to make proselytes of these before we think of foreigners and that therefore our scheme is against duty and further that considering the great opposition which is sound on the part of those who differ from us at home no success can be expected among savages abroad and that therefore it is against reason and experience  in answer to this i say that religion like light is imparted without being diminished that whatever is done abroad can be no hindrance or let to the conversion of infidels and dissenters at home that those who engage in this affair imagine they will not be missed where there is no want of schools or clergy but that they may be of singular service in countries but thinly supplied with either or altogether deprived of both that our colonies being of the same blood language and religion with ourselves are in effect our countrymen but that christian charity not being limited by those regards does extend to all mankind and this may serve for an answer to the first point that our design is against duty  to the second point i answer that ignorance is not so incurable as error that you must pull down as well as build erase as well as imprint in order to make proselytes at home whereas the savage americans if they are in a state purely natural and unimproved by education they are also unincumbred with all that rubbish of superstition and prejudice which is the effect of a wrong one as they are less instructed they are withal less conceited and more teachable and not being violently attached to any false system of their own are so much the fitter to receive that which is true hence it is evident that success abroad ought not to be measured by that which we observe at home and that the inference which was made from the difficulty of the one to the impossibility of the other is altogether groundless  it is most true notwithstanding our present corruptions that there are to be found in no country under the sun men of better inclinations or greater abilities for doing good than in england but it is as true that success in many cases depends not upon zeal industry wealth learning or the like faculties so much as on the method wherein these are applied we often see a small proportion of labor and expense in one way bring that about which in others a much greater share of both could never effect it has been my endeavor to discover this way or method in the present case what has been done i submit to the judgment of all good and reasonable men who i am persuaded will never reject or discourage a proposal of this nature on the score of slight objections surmises or difficulties and thereby render themselves chargeable with the having prevented those good effects which might otherwise have been produced by it  for it is after all possible that unforeseen difficulties may arise in the prosecution of this design many things may retard and many things may threaten to obstruct it but there is hardly any enterprise or scheme whatsoever for the public good in which difficulties are not often showing themselves and as often overcome by the blessing of god upon the prudence and resolution of the undertakers though for ought that appears the present scheme is as likely to succeed and attended with as few difficulties as any of this kind can possibly be  for to any man who considers the divine power of religion the innate force of reason and virtue and the mighty effects often wrought by the constant regular operation even of a weak and small cause it will seem natural and reasonable to suppose that rivulets perpetually issuing forth from a fountain or reservoir of learning and religion and streaming through all parts of america must in due time have a great effect in purging away the ill manners and irreligion of our colonies as well as the blindness and barbarity of the nations round them especially if the reservoir be in a clean and private place where its waters out of the way of any thing that may disturb or muddy them remain clear and pure otherwise they are more likely to pollute than purify the places through which they flow  those who wish well to religion and mankind will need no other motive to forward an undertaking calculated for the service of both i shall nevertheless beg leave to observe that whoever would be glad to cover a multitude of sins by an extensive and well judged charity or whoever from an excellent and godlike temper of mind seeks opportunities of doing good in his generation will be pleased to meet with a scheme that so peculiarly puts it in his power with small trouble or expense to procure a great and lasting benefit to the world  ten pounds a year would if i mistake not be sufficient to defray the expense of a young american in the college of bermuda as to diet lodging clothes books and education and if so the interest of two hundred pounds may be a perpetual fund for maintaining one missionary at the college for ever and in this succession many it is to be hoped may become powerful instruments for converting to christianity and civil life whole nations who now sit in darkness and the shadow of death and whose cruel brutal manners are a disgrace to human nature  a benefaction of this kind seems to enlarge the very being of a man extending it to distant places and to future times inasmuch as unseen countries and after ages may feel the effects of his bounty while he himself reaps the reward in the blessed society of all those who having turned many to righteousness shine as the stars for ever and ever  finis
