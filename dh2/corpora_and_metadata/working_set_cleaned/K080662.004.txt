visited by travelers in which it has not been noticed in britain it was formerly held in high estimation not only because its flesh was accounted a delicacy at the tables of the nobility it appears from a curious book entitled the regulations of the household of the fifth earl of northumberland begun in      that herons were valued at the same price as bytters bitterns fessaunts pheasants curlewes curlews and peacockes peacocks  at principal feasts  item it is thought in likewyze that hearonsewys be bought for my lordees own mees so that they be at xiid a piece the price of the crane was   d at the same time and the goose  d or at most  d  partridges  d woodcocks   or   and snipes three for a penny    but because heron hawking was a favorite diversion insomuch that laws were enacted for the preservation of the species and any person by destroying the eggs incurred a penalty of twenty shillings  the plumage of the male bird is remarkable for its elegance perhaps we could with less propriety use the same expression if speaking of its general appearance and proportions nature has not provided it with webbed feet to swim after its prey which is almost wholly of the aquatic kind but has furnished it with very long legs to wade after it and these give it rather an awkward appearance when standing on the land the neck also is long and slender but when it stands on the side of a stream or river waiting for the passing of a fish its neck and head are drawn between the shoulders in flying its neck is also crouched down and the head almost concealed between the shoulders the male is chiefly distinguished from the female by having a fine crest of black feathers two in particular in some specimens are eight inches in length mr latham believes that this appendage is found only in males of a full age or perhaps very old birds mr pennant says that the long soft black feathers on the sides were used in old times as egrets for the hair or ornaments to the caps of knights of the garter and the crests of the males are now used as ornaments in the east  the female has only a very short plume of dusky greyish feathers and the loose feathers that hang over the breast are very short while those of the other sex are long this has been generally supposed a distinct kind the accurate linneus described it as another species under the specific name cinerea and many other naturalists have been of the same opinion as appears by the synonyms mr pennant observes this was formerly supposed but later observations prove them to be the same mr latham adopts precisely the opinion of mr pennant but in neither of their accounts can we find the authority on which that opinion is founded it is worthy of remark that albin who lived at a time when heronries were far more numerous than at present though even now they are very common in some parts at cres hall near goser in lincolnshire i have counted eighty nests in one tree pennant  in the first volume of his birds has figured the male and in the third volume the female yet gives not the smallest reason to conclude that he did not consider them as distinct species  in the breeding season they unite in large societies and build on the highest trees the nest is made of sticks and lined with rushes wool feathers etc they lay four five or six eggs of a pale green color they desert the nests in the winter and are then found on the banks of rivers or marshy places  the length is about three feet breadth five feet weight exceeds three pounds   plate lxxiv sterna fissipes black

terns and as they differ somewhat in their manners do not associate they are found during spring and summer in vast numbers in the fens of lincolnshire the eggs are three or four in number of a greenish or olive color spotted with black and have also a band of the same color about the middle these eggs are deposited among the reeds in fens and other marshy places the food is insects and small fish which it procures by hovering over the water and darting on its prey in the same manner as most other birds of the same genus  it is an inhabitant of most of the northern countries of

colemouse in these particulars  st that it is bigger  d that it wants the white spot on the head  d it has a larger tail  th its under side is white  th it has less black under the chin  th it wants the white spot on the covert of the wings mr pennant observes on this account given by willughby that the last distinction does not hold in general as the subject figured in the british zoology had those spots yet wanted that on the hind part of the head  the opinion of mr latham in this particular deserves attention also he says it is much to be feared that the marsh titmouse is not a distinct species most probably a mere variety of the colemouse genesis syn vol    in the supplement to the general synopsis of birds mr latham has added the following account under the head marsh titmouse in my synopsis it has not appeared clear to me whether the colemouse and this were different species i find it to be the opinion of sepp that they form but one being both figured in the same plates as male and female in one of them is a spot of white on the hind head and the sides of the head are white the throat black the other has the top of the head wholly black and the black spot of the throat wanting the nest seems here composed of sedge mixed with large catstail lined with down and feathers furnished with five white eggs mottled with red brown  the colemouse appears to be less injurious

dirty white color dotted with rufous these are deposited on the rotten wood mixed with a little moss if the entrance to the nest is too large it closes up part of it with clay leaving only a very small hole to creep through the nest of this bird is seldom disturbed or the eggs taken away when the female is sitting for her hissing so nearly resembles that of a snake that few would venture to put their hands into the hole to search for them and it is said that the female will suffer her feathers to be plucked off rather than desert her eggs or young the male also shows the greatest tenderness for them and its mate during the time of incubation  it feeds on all kinds of insects as well as nuts of the latter it lays up a considerable hoard in the hollows of trees and brings them out when other food is scarce the manner of its cracking the nut is curious and has been noticed by several authors and particularly willoughby he says it is a pretty sight to see her fetch a nut out of her hoard when placing it fast in a chink she stands above it with the head downwards and striking it with all her force breaks the shell and catches up the kernel  in its manners it is not unlike the woodpecker tribe it is not supposed to sleep perched for when confined in a cage it would creep into a corner at night to sleep dr plott says this bird by putting its bill into a crack in the bough of a tree can make such a violent sound as if it was rending asunder so that the noise may be heard at least twelve score yards  it is not migratory but changes its situation in winter pennant

nine  the wryneck is supposed to be a bird of passage appearing in the spring eight or ten days earlier than the cuckoo it feeds on insects and seems particularly fond of ants these the extreme length of the tongue enables it to pick out of the cracks where they are concealed it takes its name from a habit it has of turning its head back to the shoulders when alarmed or terrified it can also erect

opportunity to notice the singular manners of this tribe nature seems to have allotted more than an ordinary share of courage to these little creatures they equal the eagle in the fierceness of their attacks on smaller birds and defend themselves against those they cannot overcome with the greatest vigor and resolution though in this respect they imitate the larger carnivorous birds they have not like them claws strong enough to tear their prey to pieces but to supply this defect they fasten it on a thorn and pull it asunder with their bill even when confined in a cage it is said that they treat their food in a similar manner sticking it against the wires before they eat it  we now speak of the manners generally peculiar to the tribe how far those of the wood chat accord with them we can only presume from being of the same genus no english naturalist having yet been so fortunate as to meet with it since willoughby and ray pennant has not given a figure of it in the british zoology and it is a fact well known that both lewin and walcot have given figures of it drawn from mere descriptions this is the more to be regretted as no specimen of it was either in the leverian or british museums and that eminent ornithologist mr latham with his accustomed candor acknowledges in his account of it that he has never seen it mr pennant says he does not describe this bird from his own inspection and i must confess that it has never come under mine  he also says buffon does not speak of it as uncommon but gives it as his opinion that the redbacked shrike is a variety of this species as well as some other kinds he mentions and adds that from his own observation he cannot deny the fact we have compared them and do not hesitate to give them as two distinct species  it is only the

it is found in italy but only in the higher regions where the air is bleak in russia it is not uncommon particularly in the asiatic part of that empire there is a variety of this species much smaller

that if it hovers over them they will remain motionless on the ground while the fowler draws a net over them  we find on comparing the different descriptions given by authors of this bird with specimens that have fallen under our observation that few birds vary more in the colors of their plumage than the hobby in some the back is reddish or deep brown in others almost black with a bluish cast again we find some with the back throughout of a very deep lead color and others with the edges of the feathers of a pale yellowbrown the breast is generally of a pure white with dark spots but these also vary the white is tinged with a faint dirtybrown in some and the spots incline to brown instead of black in others the irides are brown of every shade in different birds one author m brisson says they are yellow some of these variations we must presume depend on the age of the bird but one circumstance has been noticed in adult specimens that deserves particular notice the vent and thighs which are generally ferruginous or rufous are sometimes white mr latham speaking of this variation says he has a specimen in which the thighs are dusky white longitudinally marked with

spotted with black that of the male is entirely black they differ very little in other respects except that the colors of the former are more obscure than in the other sex  most authors agree that this is a noisy and restless creature incessantly flying from bush to bush and always carefully concealing the place where its nest is deposited never alighting on the same spot but creeping to it on the ground in an artful manner the nest is placed at the bottom of some bush or under a stone and usually contains five or six eggs of a pale greenish color with marks of rufous  the trivial english name of this bird has been accounted for by mr latham in a very curious manner he says he cannot find it remarked any where for its having any song buffon compares its note to the word ouistrata

unsupported by the opinion of mr pennant we must recollect that the zoology of the latter author appeared many years before the synopsis of mr latham and probably the species was not so generally diffused and domesticated in this country before the british zoology was published as since that period it is impossible that we can account otherwise for what reason he excluded it since he has given the peacock pheasant guinea hen and other domesticated birds of foreign extraction which certainly had no better claim to his attention in that work than the beautiful bird before us  this species is a native of africa particularly of the cape of good hope from the latter place vast numbers have been brought to this country and the climate favoring their increase the kind is not uncommon in many parts of the kingdom it is rather an ornamental than useful species and is generally kept in gentlemens ponds for pleasure  albin published a figure and description of this bird from a specimen reared in this country sixty years ago he says it fed on grass and corn like other geese and thus concludes his observations on the two sexes the difference between the cock and hen could not be distinguished neither by the colors or shape but only by the cocks running to the hen with open wings clasping or embracing her round with them i could not find any other name for them from the

familiar to every rustic inhabitant in the kingdom in all its actions it discovers a degree of instinct superior to most birds in many respects it resembles the crow like that creature it feeds indiscriminately on every kind of food insects grain small birds or their eggs carrion and even young poultry sometimes it procures its food by stratagem at others by annoying larger animals when it has no danger to apprehend from them it is often seen perched on the back of a sheep or a cow picking off the insects that infest them in this respect we allow them to be useful but if they relieve the poor animals from their smaller enemies they subject them to their own uncontrollable insolence and sometimes pick out the eyes of animals that attempt to resist them in a domestic state it is often taught to repeat words or sentences it does not imitate the human voice with the same facility and propriety as the parrot but sufficiently distinct to be understood  its great share of instinct is clearly demonstrated by the situation and manner in which the nest is built it is placed conspicuously on the top of some tree or in a hawthorn bush but is always fenced below by brambles and other thick bushes that make it difficult of access the nest is composed of thorny twigs well interwoven and has the thorns sticking outward it is lined with wool feathers and roots and is plaistered within

with this bird or the crane in england but formed our descriptions from specimens in the elegant cabinet of dr mauduit in paris  in some foreign countries it is still very common is found in several parts of europe and asia it is also said to be found in africa and on the american continent  the weight of this bird is one pound the length about eleven inches the appendage of loose feathers which is situated on the back and hang over the rump were anciently used to decorate caps or head pieces and hence the ornament to a cap in later times was called an aigrette   plate xcix colymbus immer

and never visits the southern parts of great britain except in severe winters living chiefly at sea it is taken with much difficulty if pursued when swimming it dives under the water and does not appear again till it is at a considerable distance from its pursuers it is often caught under water by a hook baited with small fish willoughby says they are sometimes taken in this manner sixty feet under water  being rarely seen on land it has been believed that it never quitted the water and that it hatched its young in a hole formed by nature under the wing naturalists have discovered its nest among reeds and flags in the water where it is kept continually wet as in some of the grebe genus  this species is larger than the common goose the length is about twentyfive inches the male is said to be distinguished by a few brown specks on the side of the neck and by having the colors throughout more defined than in the female some authors have however considered the supposed females as birds

needless to remark that this bird is esteemed the most beautiful of the feathered race that inhabits the south of europe in its form it is rather inelegant but its colors are fine throughout the azure of its back is exceedingly bright and when the creature is hovering in the air in a fine day it appears resplendent in the highest degree  the absurd fictions that poets in the vigor of their imagination have formed concerning this bird have particularly inclined naturalists to examine its manners of life with attention the poets placed it in a floating nest during the time of incubation and endowed it with power to calm the adverse winds and seas aristotle and pliny tell us that this bird is most common in the seas of sicily that it sat only a few days and those in the depth of winter and during that period the mariner might fail in full security for which reason they were styled halcyon days pennant  among the moderns its flesh has been thought unperishable and capable of preserving woollen and other vestments from decay and it has also been supposed to turn its breast to the north when hung up dead  specimens of this bird are brought from almost every part of the world in england it is not uncommon it frequents the sides of running streams and takes its prey which consists entirely of fish by darting on it in the water it makes no nest but lays seven or more

fourth volume of this work without expressing his sincere acknowledgments to the public for the favorable manner in which it has been received from the encouragement which has attended it in the course of publication he presumes that the expectations of the subscribers have not been disappointed in any part of it and it is particularly pleasing to find the concluding numbers have given the utmost satisfaction  the author would have been happy if he could have promised at the commencement of this work to present a complete history of british ornithology but being aware of the difficulty of procuring some of the rare aborigines of the country and fearful of displeasing many subscribers by introducing others that are familiar to every one he conceived it would be most advisable to select only those which were particularly interesting to the english naturalist or country gentleman these including all the birds formerly known in great britain together with those rare migratory species that are sometimes found even in the interior of the country  as far as the prescribed limits of the work would admit the author hopes he has fulfilled this promise to the public if he has excluded some fine birds such as the goldfinch the bullfinch the pheasant and its varieties with others no less beautiful it was to reserve a place for some that were scarcely known to exist in the country the rosecoloured ouzel roller little bittern and golden oriole are of this description and to these we may add the egret cock of the wood black cock black woodpecker and waxen chatterer the wood chat which english authors have figured from mere descriptions sufficiently mark the attention of the author to render this work no less respectable than useful the rednecked grebe northern diver water ouzel dartford warbler dusky lark longlegged plover with many others equally rare and interesting having been procured purposely for this work evidently prove that no expense has been spared to make it complete  since the one hundred plates have been engraved some rare birds have come into the authors possession but rather than incur the imputation of trespassing on the public favor he declined adding them to the work until it appeared to be the wishes of the subscribers to have a supplement that being to be added at their request the public may be persuaded that every exertion will be made to render it worthy of their approbation  the distinguished manner in which works of natural history are encouraged at this period leads us to a few reflections which it is presumed are not entirely inapplicable to the present work and may be some apology for the different publications of that description which the author has lately submitted to the public  it is a noble sentiment of the british nation to be no less respected for their learning than admired for their valor by other nations yet it is a truth which national pride dare not conceal that several sciences and those especially of natural history have been more successfully cultivated by our continental neighbors than by ourselves the study of those sciences unfold too many advantages to civilized society to be entirely overlooked in any country and some of its branches have ever found admirers in courts and patrons in princes but it is not in every country that a number of less exalted individuals are disposed to afford them that encouragement which alone can evince the general taste of a nation  the devastations of war have indeed materially checked many learned enquiries in other countries whilst the english nation by its fostering protection have contributed much to their improvement this may ultimately excite a laudable emulation in this country to equal or excel others in the knowledge of those sciences for surely it is not to our credit that learned foreigners are well acquainted with the natural productions even of our country while we remain ignorant of them  the author of this work had formerly conceived that an epitome at least of the natural history of great britain would be acceptable to many and this is now in forwardness to completion botany the most useful and pleasing branch has been in part illustrated already in a manner that reflects honor on its authors the mineral fossil and marine productions are probably less generally known the insects and birds the author has endeavored to illustrate and he hopes his exertions have not been unsuccessful  the inimitable beauty and variety both of structure and colors which distinguish the natural productions of warmer regions will always obtrude on the attention of european naturalists and agreeably diversify a study that without such auxiliary aid might seem less interesting yet we may observe that to become well acquainted with exotic natural history it is necessary to examine that of europe in england like other northern countries nature assumes a grave aspect but yet presents an unbounded source of amusement and information to the intelligent mind and must merit the inquiries of learned men who are inclined to promote knowledge or feel an interest in the credit of the country  whoever has devoted much leisure to the study of natural history will be surprised at the inconsiderable number of learned works on that subject that are in the english language and of those it may be said as edwards in    0 essays on natural history remarks that what we have are mostly translations from other languages this is not however the only blame the artists of our country have been condemned for pirating their figures from the works of foreign authors and it must be owned this has been too frequently practiced since edwards wrote his book botany and ornithology have undergone great improvements and the latter in particular by the writings of pennant but more especially by latham who having added the information of preceding authors to a correct description of each bird seemed to leave little wanting of a complete british ornithology but a series of accurately colored figures of the different species to supply this deficiency in particular has been the aim of the author of this work and he trusts the selection of rare species that he has included in it will facilitate the study of that important and amusing branch of natural history
