hymns and sacred poems  published by john wesley m a fellow of lincoln college oxford and charles wesley m a student of christchurch oxford  let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord col iii    london printed by william strahan and sold by james hutton bookseller at the bible and sun without temple bar and at mr brays a brazier in littlebritain  mdccxxxix  the preface   some verses it may be observed in the following collection were wrote upon the scheme of the mystic divines and these it is owned we haa once in great veneration as the best explainers of the gospel of christ but we are now convinced that we therein greatly erred not knowing the scriptures neither the power of god and because this is an error which many serious minds are sooner or later exposed to and which indeed most easily besets those who seek the lord jesus in sincerity we believe ourselves indispensably obliged in the presence of god and angels and men to declare wherein we apprehend those writers not to teach the truth as it is in jesus    and first we apprehend them to lay another foundation they are careful indeed to pull down our own works and to prove that by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified but why is this only to establish our own righteousness in the place of our own works they speak largely and well against expecting to be accepted of god for our virtuous actions and then teach that we are to be accepted for our virtuous habits or tempers still the ground of our acceptance is placed in ourselves the difference is only this common writers suppose we are to be justified for the sake of our outward righteousness these suppose we are to be justified for the sake of our inward righteousness whereas in truth we are no more justified for the sake of one than of the other for neither our own inward nor outward righteousness is the ground of our justification holiness of heart as well as holiness of life is not the cause but the effect of it the sole cause of our acceptance with god or that for the sake of which on the account of which we are accepted is the righteousness and the death of christ who fulfilled gods law and died in our stead and even the condition of it is not as they suppose our holiness either of heart of life but our faith alone faith contradistinguishd from holiness as well as from good works other foundation therefore can no man lay without being an adversary to christ and his gospel than faith alone faith though necessarily producing both yet not including either good works or holiness    but supposing them to have laid the foundation right the manner of building thereon which they advise is quite opposite to that prescribed by christ he commands to build up one another they advise to the desert to the desert and god will build you up numberless are the commendations that occur in all their writings not of retirement intermixed with conversation but of an entire seclusion from men perhaps for months or years in order to purify the soul whereas according to the judgment of our lord and the writings of his apostles it is only when we are knit together that we have nourishment from him and increase with the increase of god neither is there any time when the weakest member can say to the strongest or the strongest to the weakest  i have no need of thee accordingly our blessed lord when his disciples were in their weakest state sent them forth not alone but two by two when they were strengthened a little not by solitude but by abiding with him and one another he commanded them to wait not separate but being assembled together for the promise of the father and they were all with one accord in one place when they received the gift of the holy ghost express mention is made in the same chapter that when there were added unto them three thousand souls all that believed were together and continued steadfastly not only in the apostles doctrine but also in fellowship and in breaking of bread and in praying with one accord agreeable to which is the account the great apostle gives of the manner which he had been taught of god for the perfecting of the saints for the edifying of the body of christ even to the end of the world and according to st paul all who will ever come in the unity of the faith unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ must together grow up into him from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted or strengthened by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love ephesians iv          so widely distant is the manner of building up souls in christ taught by st paul from that taught by the mysticks nor do they differ as to the foundation or the manner of building thereon more than they do with regard to the superstructure for the religion these authors would edify us in is solitary religion if thou will be perfect say they trouble not thyself about outward works it is better to work virtues in the will he has attained the true resignation who has estranged himself from all outward works that god may work inwardly in him without any turning to outward things these are the true worshippers who worship god in spirit and in truth for contemplation is with them the fulfilling of the law even a contemplation that consists in a cessation of all works    directly opposite to this is the gospel of christ solitary religion is not to be found there holy solitaries is a phrase no more consistent with the gospel than holy adulterers the gospel of christ knows of no religion but social no holiness but social holiness faith working by love is the length and breadth and depth and height of christian perfection this commandment have we from christ that he who love god love his brother also and that we manifest our love by doing good unto all men especially to them that are of the household of faith and in truth whosoever loves his brethren not in word only but as christ loved him cannot but be zealous of good works he feels in his soul a burning restless desire of spending and being spent for them my father will he say works hitherto and i work and at all possible opportunities he is like his master going about doing good    this then is the way walk ye in it whosoever ye are that have believed in his name ye know other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid even jesus christ ye feel that by grace ye are saved through faith saved from sin by christ formed in your hearts and from fear by his spirit bearing witness with your spirit that ye are the sons of god ye are taught of god not to forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but to instruct admonish exhort reprove comfort confirm and every way build up one another ye have an unction from the holy one that teaches you to renounce any other or higher perfection than faith working by love faith zealous of good works faith as it has opportunity doing good unto all men as ye have therefore received jesus christ the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and stablishd in the faith and abounding therein more and more only beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for ye are complete in him he is alpha and omega the beginning and the ending the first and the last only continue in him grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel and when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory  the contents part i eupoliss hymn to the creator page   solitude from the latin   the mystery of life   epitaph   virtue altered from herbert ibid upon listening to the

of guilt away and ripens for eternal day hoarded wealth desire who please towers and gilded palaces fraudless silence may i find solitude and peace of mind to all the busy world unknown seen and loved by god alone ye rich ye learned ye great confess this in life is happiness to live unknown to all abroad to myself only and my god the mystery of life i so many years i have seen the sun and called these eyes and hands my own a thousand little acts i have done and childhood have and manhood known o what is life and this dull round to tread why was a spirit bound ii so many airy draughts and lines and warm excursions of the mind have filled my soul with great designs while practice groveld far behind o what is thought and where withdraw the glories which my fancy saw iii so many tender joys and woes have on my quivering soul had power plain life with heightning passions rose the boast or burden of their hour o what is all we feel why fled those pains and pleasures over my head iv so many human souls divine some at one interview displayed some often and freely mixed with mine in lasting bonds my heart have laid o what is friendship why impressed on my weak wretched dying breast v so many wondrous gleams of light and gentle ardors from above have made me sit like seraph bright some moments on a throne of love o what is virtue why had i who am so low a taste so high vi ere long when sovereign wisdom wills my soul an unknown path shall tread and strangely leave who strangely fills this frame and waft me to the dead o what is death  it is lifes last shore where vanities are vain no more where all pursuits their goal obtain and life is all retouchd again where in their bright result shall rise thoughts virtues friendships griefs and joys epitaph ask not who ended here his span his name reproach and praise was man did no great deeds adorn his course no deed of his but showed him worse one thing was great which god supplied he suffered human life  and died what points of knowledge did he gain that life was sacred all  and vain sacred how high and vain how low he knew not here but died to know virtue altered from herbert i sweet day so cool so calm so bright the bridal

thou with all thy sweets must die iii sweet spring so beauteous and so gay storehouse where sweets unnumberd lie not long thy fading glories stay but thou with all thy sweets must die iv only a sweet and virtuous mind when nature all in ruins lies when earth and heaven a period find begins a life that never dies upon listening to the vibrations of a clock instructive sound i am now convinced by thee time in its womb may bear infinity how the past moment dies and throbs no more what worlds of parts compose the rolling hour the least of these a serious care demands for though they are little yet they are golden sands by some great deeds distinguished all in heaven for the same end to me by number given cease man to lavish sums thou never have told angels though deathless dare not be so

heavenly fire with holy conquering zeal inspire iii for zeal i sigh for zeal i pant yet heavy is my soul and faint with steps unwavring undismayed give me in all thy paths to tread iv with outstretchd

thy quickening power and wake me that i sleep no more vi single of heart o may i be nothing may i desire but thee far far from me the world remove and all that holds me from thy love zeal i dead as i am and cold my breast untouched by thee celestial zeal how shall i sing the unwonted guest how paint the joys i cannot feel ii assist me thou at whose command the heart exults from earth set free it is thine to raise the drooping hand thine to confirm the feeble knee iii it is zeal must end this inward strife give me to know that warmth divine through all my verse through all my life the active principle shall shine iv where shall we find its high abode to heaven the sacred ray aspires with ardent love embraces god parent and object of its fires v there its peculiar influence known in

thousands rage  in vain nor tortures can arrest its speed nor worlds its energy restrain xiii that energy which quells the strong which clothes with strength the abject weak looses the stammring

purchased thee with blood divine come holy zeal for thou through him jesus himself through thee is mine on reading monsr de rentys life we deem the saints from mortal flesh released with brighter day and bolder raptures blessed sense now no more precludes the distant thought and naked souls now feel the god they sought but thy great soul which walked with god on earth can scarce be nearer by that second birth by change of place dull bodies may improve but spirits to their bliss advance by love thy change insensible brought no surprise inured to innocence and paradise for earth not heaven thou

on her face a peace beneath appears vii it is in that peace we see and act by instincts from above with finer taste of wisdom fraught and mystic powers of love viii yet ask not in mere ease and pomp of ghostly gifts to shine till death the lownesses of man and decent griefs are thine affliction from herbert i when first thou did entice my heart to thee i thought the service brave so many joys i for my part set down besides what i might have out of my stock of natural delights augmented by thy gracious benefits ii i viewed thy furniture so fine so gay so rich and all for me strongly it spoke the hand divine and lured my ravished soul to thee such stars i counted mine both heaven and earth paid me my wages in a world of mirth iii what pleasures could i want who served a king where joys my fellows were still my fond hopes no place reserved for pining grief or anxious fear thus did my simple soul thy yoke embrace and made her youth and fierceness seek thy face iv at first thou gavst me sweetnesses and strewdst with flowers the narrow way smoothly my soul sunk down to peace my every joyous month was may but with my years sorrow did twist and grow and made a party unawares for woe v my flesh chastisd with torturing pain my soul and sickness clave my bones pale agues dwelt in every vein and sadly tuned my breath to groans sorrow was all my soul i scarce perceived but by the pains i suffered that i lived vi healths slowlylingring vain return a far severer loss attends sudden my ravished life i mourn i lose it in my dying friends defenseless now my every comfort fled while griefs whole sea is emptied on my head vii how thou will now thy servant use not one of all my books can say on thy ignobler works i muse and wish like them my god to obey blessed could i emulate the lifeless mass flow like the stream or flourish like the grass viii yet must i though oppressed submit strongly my misery to sustain  or i will now the service quit and strait some other master gain  ah my dear lord though i am clean forgot let me not love thee if i love thee not frailty from the same i lord how in silence i despise the giddy worldlings snare this beauty riches honor toys not worth a moments care hence painted dust and gilded clay you have no charms for me delusive breath be far away i waste no thought on thee ii but when abroad at once i view both the worlds hosts and thine these simple sad afflicted few these numerous gay and fine lost my resolves my scorn is past i boast my strength no more a willing slave they bind me fast with unresisted power iii o brook not this let not thy foes profane thy hallowed shrine thine is my soul by sacred vows of strictest union thine hear then my just though late request once more the captive free renew thy image in my breast

wishes move through natures wilds they roam loose as the wind ye wandrers rove and bring me pleasure home iii still shall i urge with endless toil yet not obtain my suit still shall i plant the ungrateful soil yet never taste the fruit iv not so my heart  for fruit there is seize it with eager haste riot in joys dissolve in bliss and pamper every taste v on right and wrong thy thoughts no more in cold dispute employ forsake thy cell the bounds pass over and give a loose to joy vi conscience and reasons power deride let stronger nature draw self be thy end and sense thy guide and appetite thy law vii away ye shades while light i rise i tread you all beneath grasp the dear hours my youth supplies nor idly dream of death viii whoever enslaved to grief and pain yet starts from pleasures road still let him weep and still complain and sink beneath his load  ix but as i raved and grew more wild and fierce at every word methought i heard one calling child and i replied  my lord grace from the same i my stock lies dead and no increase does thy past gifts improve o let thy graces without cease drop gently from above ii if still the sun should hide his face earth would a dungeon prove thy works nights captives o let grace drop gently from above iii the dew unsought each morning falls less bounteous is thy dove the dew for which my spirit calls drop gently from above iv death is still digging like a mole my grave wherever i move let grace work too and on my soul drop gently from above v sin is still spreading over my heart a hardness void of love let suppling grace to cross her art drop gently from above vi o come for thou do know the way or if thou will not move translate me where i need not say drop gently from above gratefulness from the same i thou who have given so much to me o give a grateful heart see how thy beggar works on thee by acceptable art ii he makes thy gifts occasion more and says if here he is crossed all thou have given him heretofore thyself and all is lost iii but thou did reckon when at first our wants thy aid did crave what it would come to at the worst such needy worms to save iv perpetual knockings at thy door tears sullying all thy rooms gift upon gift much would have more and still thy suppliant comes v yet thy unwearied love went on allowed us all our noise nay thou have dignified a groan and made a sigh thy joys vi wherefore i cry and cry again nor can thou quiet be till my repeated suit obtain a thankful heart from thee vii hear then and thankfulness impart continual as thy grace o add to all thy gifts a heart whose pulse may be thy praise the method from the same i lament unhappy heart lament since god refuses still to hear thy prayer some discontent unknown must cool his will ii doubtless thy heavenly father could give all thy suit does move for he is power and sure he would give all for he is love iii go then the secret cause explore go search thy inmost soul let earth divide thy care no more since heaven requires the whole iv ha what do i here written see it tells me yesterday cold i preferred my careless plea and only seemed to pray v but stay  what read i written there something i would have done his spirit moved me to forbear yet boldly i went on vi then bend once more thy knees and pray once more lift up thy voice seek pardon first and god will say again glad heart rejoice grieve not the holy spirit from the same i and art thou grieved o sacred dove when i despise or cross thy love grieved for a worm when every tread crushes and leaves the reptile dead ii then mirth be ever banished hence since thou art pained by my offense i sin not to my grief alone the comforter within does groan iii then weep my eyes for god does grieve weep foolish heart and weeping live tears for the living mourner plead but never avail the hopeless dead iv lord i adjudge myself to grief to endless tears without relief yet o to exact thy due forbear and spare a feeble creature spare v still if i wail not still to wail nature denies and flesh would fail lord pardon  for thy son makes good my want of tears with store of blood the sigh from the same i my heart did heave and there came forth o god by that i knew that thou wast in the grief making a golden scepter of thy rod to guide and govern it to my relief had thou not had a more than equal part sure the unruly sigh had broke my heart ii but since thy will my bounds of life assigned thou know my frame and if a single sigh ask so much breath what then remains behind why if some years of life together fly the swiftlywafting sigh then only is a gale to bring me sooner to my bliss iii thy life on earth was grief to this thou still art constant while thy suffering majesty touched with my misery feels whatever i feel adopts my woes and daily grieves in me thy death was but begun on calvary thou every hour do in thy members die the flower from the same i while sad my heart and blasted mourns how chearing lord and thy returns how sweet the life the joys they bring grief in thy presence melts away refreshed i hail the gladsome day as flowers salute the rising spring ii who would have thought my withered heart again should feel thy sovereign art a kindly warmth again should know late like the flower whose drooping head sinks down and seeks its native bed to see the motherroot below iii these are thy wonders lord of power killing and quickening one short hour lifts up to heaven and sinks to hell thy will supreme disposes all we prove thy justice in our fall thy mercy in our rise we feel iv o that my latest change were over o were i placed where sin no more with its attendant grief could come stranger to change i then should rise amidst the plants of paradise and flourish in eternal bloom v many a spring since here i grew i seemed my verdure to renew and higher still to rise and higher watered by tears and fand by sighs i poured my fragrance through the skies and heavnward ever seemed to aspire vi but while i grow as heaven were mine thine anger comes and i decline faded my bloom my glory lost who can the deadly cold sustain or stand beneath the chilling pain when blasted by thine angers frost vii and now in age i bud again once more i feel the vernal rain though dead so often i live and write sure i but dream it cannot be that i my god that i am he on whom thy tempests fell all night viii these are thy wonders lord of love thy mercy thus delights to prove we are but flowers that bloom and die soon as this saving truth we see within thy garden placed by thee time we survive and death defy desertion from the same i joy of my soul when thou art gone and i which cannot be alone it cannot lord for i on thee depend and thou abidst in me ii but when thou do the sense repress the extatic influence of thy grace seem to desert thy loved abode and leave me sunk beneath my load iii o what a damp and deadly shade what horrors then my soul invade less ghastly lowrs the gloomiest night than the eclipse that veils thy light iv o do not do not thus withdraw lest sin surprise me void of awe and when thou do but shine less clear say boldly that thou art not here v thou lord and only thou can tell how dead the life which then i feel pursued by sins insulting boast that i may seek  but thou art lost vi i half believe the deadly cold does all my powers so fast infold that sin says true but while i grieve again i see thy face and live a true hymn from the same i my joy my life my crown of bliss my heart was musing all the day fain would it speak yet only this my joy my life my crown could say ii few as they are and void of art yet slight not lord these humble words fine is that hymn which speaks the heart the heart that to the lines accords iii he who requires his creatures time and all his soul and strength and mind complains if heartless flows the rhyme what makes the hymn is still behind iv the scanty verse himself supplies let but the fervent heart be moved and when it says with longing sighs o could i love god writes loved the temper from the same i o lord how gladly would my rhymes engrave thy love in steel if what my soul does feel sometimes my soul might ever feel ii though there were forty heavens or more sometimes i mount them all sometimes i hardly reach a score sometimes to hell i fall iii rack me not to such vast extent these lengths belong to thee the worlds too little for thy tent a grave too big for me iv o mete not arms with man nor stretch a worm from heaven to hell strive not with dust nor let a wretch thy power almighty feel v yet take thy way thy way is best grant or deny me ease this is but tuning of my breast to make the music please vi rise i to heaven or sink to dust in both thy hands appear thy power and love my love and trust make one place every where i the same i it cannot be is this the heart that swelled so late with mighty joy lord if thou needs must use thy dart spare thy own gifts and sin destroy ii the greater world knows no decay but thy diviner world of grace a new creator every day thou suddenly do rear or raze iii set up thy kingdom in my heart that all my powers thy sway may own for ah my lord if thou depart strait rebel nature mounts thy throne iv though heaven be moved may i remain steadfast and centred firm on thee here six thy court and still maintain a standing majesty in me bittersweet from the same i ah my dear angry lord since thou do love yet strike cast down and yet thy help afford sure i will do the like ii i will complain yet praise bewail and yet approve and all my mournful joyful days i will lament and love a hymn for midnight i while midnight shades the earth overspread and veil the bosom of the deep nature reclines her weary head and care respires and sorrows sleep my soul still aims at nobler rest aspiring to her saviors breast ii aid me ye hovering spirits near angels and ministers of grace who ever while you guard us here behold your heavenly fathers face gently my raptured soul convey to regions of eternal day iii fain would i leave this earth below of pain and sin the dark abode where shadowy joy or solid woe allures or tears me from my god doubtful and insecure of bliss since death alone confirms me his iv till then to sorrow born i sigh and gasp and languish after home upward i send my streaming eye expecting till the bridegroom come come quickly lord thy own receive now let me see thy face and live v absent from thee my exiled soul deep in a fleshly dungeon groans around me clouds of darkness roll and laboring silence speaks my moans come quickly lord thy face display and look my midnight into day vi error and sin and death are over if thou reverse the creatures doom sad rachel weeps her loss no more if thou the god the savior come of thee possessed in thee we prove the light the life the heaven of love after considering some of his friends i why do the deeds of happier men into a mind return which can oppressed by bands of sloth with no such ardors burn ii god of my life and all my powers the everlasting friend shall life so favored in its dawn be fruitless in its end iii to thee o lord my tender years a trembling duty paid with glimpses of the mighty god delighted and afraid iv from parents eye and paths of men thy touch i ran to meet it swelled the hymn and sealed the prayer twas calm and strange and sweet v often when beneath the work of sin trembling and dark i stood and felt the edge of eager thought and felt the kindling blood vi thy dew came down  my heart was thine it knew nor doubt nor strife cool now and peaceful as the grave and strong to second life vii full of myself i often forsook the now the truth and thee for sanguine hope or sensual gust or earthborn sophistry viii the folly thrived and came in sight too gross for life to bear i smote the breast for man too base i smote  and god was there ix still will i hope for voice and strength to glorify thy name though i must die to all that is mine and suffer all my shame religious discourse to speak for god to sound religions praise of sacred passions the wise warmth to raise to infuse the contrite wish to conquest nigh and point the steps mysterious as they lie to seize the wretch in full career of lust and sooth the silent sorrows of the just who would not bless for this the gift of speech and in the tongues beneficence be rich but who must talk not the mere modern sage who suits the softened gospel to the age who never to raise degenerate practice strives but brings the precept down to christians lives not he who maxims from cold reading took and never saw himself but through a book not he who hasty in the morn of grace soon sinks extinguished as a comets blaze not he who strains in scripture phrase to abound deaf to the sense who stuns us with the sound but he who silence loves and never dealt in the false commerce of a truth unfelt guilty you speak if subtle from within blows on your words the selfadmiring sin if unresolved to choose the better part your forward tongue belies your languid heart but then speak safely when your peaceful mind above selfseeking blessed on god reclined feels him at once suggest unlabored sense and open a sluice of sweet benevolence some high behasts of heaven you then fulfill sprung from his light your words and issuing by his will nor yet expect so mystically long till certain inspiration loose your tongue express the precept runs do good to all nor adds whenever you find an inward call it is god commands no farther motive seek speak or without or with reluctance speak to loves habitual sense by acts aspire and kindle till you catch the gospelfire discoveries immature of truth decline nor prostitute the gospel pearl to swine beware too rashly how you speak the whole the vileness or the treasures of your soul if spurned by some where weak on earth you lie if judged a cheat or dreamer where you fly here the sublimer strain the exerted air forego youre at the bar not in the chair to the pert reasner if you speak at all speak what within his cognizance may fall expose not truths divine to reasons rack give him his own beloved ideas back your notions till they look like his dilute blind he must be  but save him from dispute but when we are turned of reasons noontide glare and things begin to show us what they are more free to such your true conceptions tell yet graft them on the arts where they excel if springhtly sentiments detain their taste if paths of various learning they have traced if their cool judgment longs yet fears to fix fire erudition hesitation mix all rules are dead it is from the heart you draw the living luster and unerring law a state of thinking in your manner show nor fiercely soaring nor supinely low others their lightness and each inward fault quench in the stilness of your deeper thought let all your gestures fixed attention draw and wide around diffuse infectious awe present with god by recollection seem yet present by your cheerfulness with them without elation christian glories paint nor by fond amorous phrase assume the saint greet not frail men with compliments untrue with smiles to peace confirmed and conquest due there are who watch to adore the dawn of grace and pamper the young proselyte with praise kind humble souls they with a right good will admire his progress  till he stands stock still speak but to thirsty minds of things divine who strong for thought are free in yours to join the busy from his channel parts with pain the lanquid loathes an elevated strain with these you aim but at goodnatured chat where all except the love is low and flat not one address will different tempers fit the grave and gay the heavy and the wit wits will sift you and most conviction find where least it is urged and seems the least designed slow minds are merely passive and forget truths not inculcated to these repeat avow your counsel nor abstain from heat some gentle souls to gay indiffrence true nor hope nor fear nor think the more for you let love turn babbler here and caution sleep blush not for shallow speech nor muse for deep these to your humor not your sense attend it is not the advice that sways them but the friend others have large recesses in their breast with pensive process all they hear digest here wellweighd words with wary foresight sow for all you say will sink and every seed will grow at first acquaintance press each truth severe stir the whole odium of your character let harshest doctrines all your words engross and nature bleeding on the daily cross then to yourself the ascetic rule enjoin to others stoop surprizingly benign pitying if from themselves with pain they part if stubborn nature long holds out the heart their outworks now are gained forbear to press the more you urge them you prevail the less let speech lay by its roughness to oblige your speaking life will carry on the siege by your example struck to god they strive to live no longer to themselves alive to positive adepts insidious yield to ensure the conquest seem to quit the field large in your grants be their opinion shown approve amend  and wind it to your own couch in your hints if more resigned they hear both what they will be soon and what they are pleasing these words now to their conscious breast the anticipating voice hereafter blessed in souls just waked the paths of light to choose convictions keen and zeal of prayer infuse let them love rules till freed from passions reign till blameless moral rectitude they gain but lest reformed from each extremer ill they should but civilize old nature still the loftier charms and energy display of virtue modeled by the godheads ray the lineaments divine perfections plan and all the grandeur of the inner man commences thus the agonizing strife previous to natures death and second life struck by their own inclement piercing eye their feeble virtues blush subside and die they view the scheme that mimick nature made a fancied goodness and religions shade with angry scorn they now reject the whole unchanged their heart undeifyd their soul till indignation sleeps away to faith and gods own power and peace take root in sacred wrath aim less to teach than love the work begun in words is crowned by artless warmth alone love to your friend a second office owes yourself and him before heavens footstool throws you place his form as suppliant by your side a helpless worm for whom the savior died into his soul call down the eternal beam and longing ask to spend and to be spent for him mans medley from herbert i hark how the woods with music ring how sweet the feathered minstrels sing they have their joys and man has his yet if we judge our state aright the present is not mans delight hereafter brings his perfect bliss ii this life belongs to things of sense justly to this they make pretense angels possess the next by birth man groveling glorious man alone angel and brute unites in one while this hand heaven that touches earth iii glorious in soul he mounts and flies groveling in flesh he sinks and dies his treasure holds in earth confined  the bodys calls forbid to hear born to regard with listening ear the dictates of his nobler mind iv not but his gracious master here allows and bids him taste the cheer as birds that drinking lift their head thankful like them he bids him drink and of those streams of pleasure think that ever cheer the immortal dead v his joys are double  and his pains while of two winters he complains the brute creation feels but one round and within him tempests roll frost chills his veins and thought his soul two deaths he fears and he alone vi yet even the sharpest heaviest grief may with it bring its own relief if right his state the suffrer weighs happy the man who finds the art to turn by thankfulness of heart his double pains to double praise misery from the same i lord let the angels praise thy name man is a feeble foolish thing folly and sin play all his game still burns his house he still does sing to day he is here to morrow gone the madman knows it  and sings on ii how can thou brook his foolishness when heedless of the voice divine himself alone he seeks to please and carnal joys prefers to thine eager through natures wilds to rove nor awed by fear nor charmed by love iii what strange pollutions does he wed slave to his senses and to sin naked of god his guilty head he strives in midnight shades to skreen fondly he hopes from thee to fly unmarked by thine allseeing eye iv the best of men to evil yield if but the slightest trial come they fall by thee no more upheld and when affliction calls them home thy gentle rod they scarce endure and murmur to accept their cure v wayward they haste while nature leads to escape thee but thy gracious dove still mildly over their folly spreads the wings of his expanded love thou bringst them back nor suffrest those who would be to remain thy foes vi my god thy name man cannot praise

care engrossed by groveling appetite is fixed on earth his treasure there his portion and his base delight he starts from virtues thorny road alive to sin but dead to god viii ah foolish man where are thine eyes lost in a crowd of earthly cares thy indolence neglects to rise while husks to heaven thy soul prefers careless the starry crown to seize by pleasure bound or lulled by ease ix to god through all creations bounds the unconscious kinds their homage bring his praise through every grove resounds nor know the warblers whom they sing but man lord of the creatures knows the source from
