on generation  an essay on generation  by j f blumenbach m d  aulic counselor to his britannic majesty and professor of physic in the university of gottingen etc  translated from the german  london printed for t cadell strand faulder bond street murray fleet street and creech at edinburgh  the translators preface the general curiosity which has at times manifested itself among physiologists to discover the nature of that process by which the animal part of the creation is formed and the difficulties which oppose themselves to such researches might be considered as sufficient motives for translating any new work whose principal view consists in endeavoring to correct some prevailing errors or to enlarge our ideas in regard to the subject in question  the following essay claims our attention in both these respects it may be considered not only as an attempt at a refutation of one of the most favorite hypotheses on the subject of generation i mean that of the evolution of preexisting organic germs but also as an attempt to establish upon the basis of experiment a better and more consistent theory  the great knowledge and extensive information which my valuable and learned friend the author possesses not only in physiology and comparative anatomy but in every branch of natural history and which he has sufficiently evinced in his numerous writings at the same time that they prepossess us with the idea that he is well fitted for such an enquiry serve also as a further justification if a justification be necessary of the part which i have taken in it whether i have executed my task faithfully i must leave to others to decide  that the conclusions of spallanzani whose works may be considered as the chief support of the theory of preexisting organic germs require both some degree of restriction and a more accurate examination than they have hitherto met with will appear evident from the second section of the following essay where the doctrine of evolution is particularly noticed  if the admirers of haller bonnet and spallanzani be surprised at the manner in which their doctrines are attacked they are to consider that controversy never yet injured the cause of truth and that by open and candid examination alone we are often able to remove the deceptions of prejudice and error never did a wellfounded theory suffer by the most severe and critical investigation on the contrary nothing is better calculated to discover its value and establish its reputation  i have only to add that in translating the compound word bildungstrieb i have been obliged to make use of a latin expression the word nisus which conveys the full sense of the word trieb does not appear to have any synonyme in the english language  a crichton no  0 spring

after having experienced the most delightful of all sensual pleasures and being duly impregnated form and existence are about to be given to her offspring  few questions hare ever awakened more general and more ardent curiosity than this for however romantic it may appear to attempt to ascertain the observations and thoughts of our first parents yet the supposition is natural that the wonderful effects and as it were repeated creations produced by the indulgence of this instinct must first have excited their surprise and then led them to a train of reflections  considering the innumerable times the phenomena of generation have occurred since the days of adam it becomes a humiliating reproach to the understanding of his descendants that during all that long succession of time they have not been able to give any satisfactory explanation of the matter especially as it appears to have soon become a very early subject of study with speculative men at least most of the physiological fragments of the ancient philosophers and physicians for instance those of orpheus pythagoras anaxagoras etc  which have been handed down to us consist in general of inquiries into the mysteries of generation and indeed since that there is hardly a period in which the same kind of researches have not been more or less prosecuted  even in the darkest times of the middle ages when the spirit of inquiry seemed almost entirely lost in the lethargy of monastic barbarism this subject appears every now and then to have awakened a spark of curiosity and to have stimulated some of the holy fathers of those times to the composition of very sensual and obscene works some of which have reached our days such as that of pope john xxth or bishop abert to great or whatever holy father of the church it was who wrote that vile book de secretis mulierum one may also add mich scotus the scrutinizer of natural things  and serve to prove that their authors were at least interested in the theoretical if not in the practical part of generation  we are not therefore to be surprised that the attempt to solve this great problem of nature increased rapidly beyond the power of numbering leaving no passage untrod which afforded any hopes of leading to a solution of the mystery hence there hardly exists another spot in the whole region of natural knowledge surrounded by more intricate labyrinths or false guides than this  drelingcourt a teacher of boerhaaves collected no less than two hundred and sixtytwo vague hypotheses on generation from the writings of earlier writers  in spite of the astonishing variety and number of paths which seemed to lead to the solution of this physiological problem yet they are all of them but so many branches of two principal roads the one conducting to the doctrine of evolution the other to that of epigenists  it is either supposed that the prepared but at the same time unorganized rudiments of the foetus first begins to be gradually organized when it arrives at its place of destination at a due time and under the necessary circumstances this is the doctrine of epigenisis  or we deny every sort of generation and believe that the germ of every animal and every plant that ever has lived and ever will live were all created at one and the same time namely at the beginning of the world and that all that is necessary is that one generation should be developed after the other such is the celebrated theory of evolution  but the manner in which this evolution happens has been differently accounted for  heraclitus surnamed the gloomy and hippocrates or whoever the author of those books on regimen was which appeared under his name together with many of their followers were of opinion that those germs were scattered up and down the whole globe where they wandered about each in search of the genitals of a ready made relation of their own kind which having once found they took lodgement there threw off their envelopement and now became fit for being themselves evolved  if we except the imposing name of the authors to whom this theory is ascribed it has little else to recommend it to our attention it is so completely built on fanciful suppositions that it would be difficult to say what hypothesis might not be credited were we to yield the smallest faith to such a doctrine the late professor gesner who wrote a commentary on this romance of hippocrates apologizes for himself by adopting the bon mot of queen christina that the chimeras of the ancients were just as good as those of the moderns  more approbation has been given to two other theories of evolution according to each of which the germs did not wander about but those of the same kind were all neatly wrapped up and encased one within another so that the first parent of each animal and plant was supposed to contain all the germs of every succeeding generation copulation only serving to awaken them to their state of evolution the only difference between the two theories was that the one supposed the germs to inhabit the testicles of their father whilst the other would have it that they resided in the ovaria of their mother  no sooner was the art of making magnifying glasses discovered and by that means an opening procured to a new world in the creation than the novelty of the discovery and facility of its application by affording an opportunity to a number of microscopical experiments naturally led to the most unexpected sights  among the great amateurs of this kind of amusement was one ludwig von hammon a young man born at dantzig who during the time of his studying medicine at leyden and in the course of his microscopical pursuits discovered in the month of august      in a drop of the semen of a cock recently dissected a kind of ocean in which swam thousands of little lively active animals  the same unexpected phenomenon was also observed in the ripe semen of other male animals and in these animalculae were immediately thought to be seen the germs of subsequent perfect animals by this discovery a key was supposed to be found which would unlock the whole mystery of generation  now i cannot conceive how some professed philosophers and natural historians have been led to deny life and voluntary motion to those animalculae but i am still more at a loss to imagine how another set of philosophers have been induced to dignify these animalculae of a stagnant animal fluid to the high rank of the organized germs of successive generations  without entering into a long and tedious detail of all the doubts and difficulties which rise up in opposition to so singular a theory i shall content myself with adding a few reflections which to the most uninformed readers will appear sufficient for calling in question this imaginary dignity of the animalculae of the semen of animals  how comes it that the animalculae of the semen of animals the most nearly related differ so much from each other whilst scarce any two things resemble one another so much as the animalculae of animals the most opposite to each other both in nature and form for instance the animalculae in the semen of frogs as represented by mr von gleichen bear no kind of resemblance to those of the common newt as represented by spallanzani whereas on the other hand two drops of water cannot resemble each other more strongly than the animalculae of the semen of a man and those of an ass as represented by the first of these accurate observers  this same modern advocate for the dignity of these animalculae has already discovered two kinds of them in the same drop of semen of a frog and yet both of them are perfectly distinct from those which roesel represents as animalculae of the semen of the same animal besides the former were not only discovered in the vesiculae seminales but also in the kidneys mere appearances as evinced by the irregular and uncertain shape of the inhabitants of the male semen and which irregularity and uncertainty refutes their pretended dignity so completely that one might as well hope with paracelsus on the nature of things addressed to john winkclsteiner von feyburg at

human embryo from male semen or expect to see as the famous academician hartzoeker assures us he did the little embryo sitting in the body of each animalcule in the same crooked and confined posture

appeared to him as if anxiously expecting its deliverance   long before the animalculae of the semen were discovered joseph de aromatariis found out a third way to explain the mystery of generation by means of the theory of evolution i mean that one which supposes the ovaria of every female even before impregnation to contain a whole provision of organized molecules or germs perfectly ready for evolution  swammerdam also adopted this opinion but owing to the great figure which the animalculae of the semen soon afterward made in the world it remained but little known until two very distinguished authors haller and bonnet at once raised its reputation  according to this theory we and indeed all the children of adam were at one time ipso facto pent up in the two ovaria of our common mother eve there we lay as it were asleep and although astonishing little creatures yet completely organized bodies and perfect miniatures of the forms we have since assumed for says haller  all our viscera and the bones themselves were then already formed although in a kind of fluid state that which we call impregnation is nothing else than the action of awakening the germ from its lethargic state by means of the male semen which stimulates the little creatures heart to the first pulsation and so on  the same kind of idea has lately induced a very celebrated naturalist of geneva and a warm advocate of this theory to plan out for us a history of organized bodies previous to the state of impregnation from which we learn first that we are all much older than what we suppose ourselves to be secondly that all mankind are exactly the same age the great grandfather not a second older than the youngest of his great grand children thirdly that this respectable age which we are all of may be about six thousand years the same natural historian also agrees entirely in opinion with bazin that since that charming long series of years when we were all packed together along with cain and abel and the other two hundred thousand million of men which according to the best calculations have since that period gone quo pius aeneas quo tellus dives et ancus in a word since the first creation during which time we have been in a kind of lethargic sleep though not entirely without motion that during the whole fiftyseven centuries i say previous to our being awakened by the abovementioned stimulus we were according to bazins opinion always growing a little and little for instance we were most probably rather a little bigger at the time we lay beside cains nieces than when all their uncles and aunts were of the party as it is very natural to suppose that we must then have been considerably more pinched for room in this manner our apartment became gradually more easy and commodious in proportion as our forefathers were evolved and we agreed with it for we kept continually stretching ourselves more and more until the succession of evolution came at last to our turn  however extravagant and romantic such conclusions must appear yet they follow as natural deductions from the premises of the theory which gave rise to them in support of this theory its most celebrated abettors haller and spallanzani adduced many experiments and observations which we shall examine more particularly in the next section when we consider how conclusive and striking these observations appear to be at first sight we shall not wonder at the general assent which during these thirty years past has been given to the doctrine of the preexistence of complete organized molecules in the ovaria of females before impregnation i myself not only believed in the truth of it but defended it in many of my writings so that in fact the present little volume contains a confession of my former errors in regard to which i wish that may be true which mr de luc says some where or other that an error once detected becomes a more material truth than many positive ones which we immediately acknowledge to be such  the unexpected success of a small experiment which i made however with a view of ascertaining the truth of the doctrine of evolution first brought me back to the point from which i ought to have set out and opened a new road to a very opposite doctrine he who thus fights with nature may from an unexpected sight often discover her most concealed treasures  what gave occasion to the instituting the experiment was as follows in one of my walks during some holidays which i spent in the country i discovered in a stream a sort of green armed polypus which differed from the common green kind by its long spiral body and by having short and rather immovable tentaculae with the wonders of this little animal i intended to amuse my country friends the delightful warm summer weather which then prevailed and the hardy constitution of the polypus itself favored the experiments which we made to discover its power of reproduction so much that the act of renewal of the parts became almost perceptible by the second and third day the maimed and divided animal was so many new ones each with arms body tail etc but we plainly remarked that the regenerated animals although supplied with plenty of proper food were always much smaller than before and a mutilated rump always diminished very evidently both in length and diameter in proportion as the lost parts were renewed it is probable that this circumstance has been either totally overlocked by such as were engaged in observing phenomena of greater magnitude in the history of this animal or if it has been observed by any it does not seem to have appeared to them of sufficient importance to be noticed that attentive and accurate observer roesel however seems to have noticed this fact vide hist der polypen in the third vol of the insectenbelustigungen   soon after my return to town i was called to a patient who had a caries the disease occupied the lower end of the femur immediately above the knee and had caused a pretty extensive and deep ulcer it healed gradually but in proportion as the wound filled up and the cicactrix formed all the surrounding parts sunk so that the edge of the cicatrix being almost on an equality with the neighboring parts the whole formed a broad though rather superficial excavation an observation which has been also made by messrs louis and fabre vide their treatises des plays avec perte de substance in the mem de lacad de chirzrg vol iv p    and  0   this was exactly the same thing mutatis mutandis with what happened to the polypus  i have since that period spent a great deal of my leisure moments in the further investigation of this subject both in experiment and reflection the consequence of which has been to convince me fully  that there is no such thing in nature as preexisting organized germs but that the unorganized matter of generation after being duly prepared and having arrived at its place of destination takes on a particular action or nisus which nisus continues to act through the whole life of the animal and that by it the first form of the animal or plant is not only determined but afterward preserved and when deranged is again restored a nisus which seems therefore to depend on the powers of life but which is as distinct from the other qualities of living bodies sensibility irritability and contractility as from the common properties of dead matter that it is the chief principle of generation growth nutrition and reproduction and that to distinguish it from all others it may be denominated the formative nisus bildungstrieb or nisus formativus  it is to be hoped that there is no necessity for reminding the reader that the expression formative nisus like that of attraction vid newton at the end of his optics what i call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me i use that word here to signify only in general any force by which bodies tend toward one another whatever be the cause  serves only to denote a power whose constant operation is known from experience but whose cause like the causes of most of the qualities of matter is a qualitas occulta to us qualitas occulta  se lon entend par ce mot un principe reel dont on ne peut render raison tout lunivers est dans ce cas etc says voltaire vid his elemeus de la philosphie de newton  and in another place he further adds il falloit respecter les qualites occultes car depuis le brin dherbe que lambre attira jusqua la route que tant dastres suiveut dans lespace depuis la formation dune mite dans un fromage jusqua la galexie soil que vous considerer une pierre qui tomb soil que vous suiviez le course dune comete traversant les deux tout est qualite occulte     we may say of this as of all similar powers what ovid says  causa latet vis est notissima but the great merit in the study of these powers is to ascertain more accurately their effects and to reduce them under general laws one of the most learned and ingenious english physicians of the present time dr g fordyce has very lately said in treating a physiological point something similar to this although the study of causes of original powers be totally absurd and futile yet the laws of their action are capable of investigation by experiment and applicanle to the evolving much useful knowledge philosoph trans v lxxviii p   p      dalemberts successor mr de condorcet in his eulogy on haller and when speaking of irritability says the truth of this doctrine was as usually is the case at first denied but when it was discovered and that could not be done any longer with honor they concluded with observing that it had been discovered long before  when it is considered that some people have been lately possessed of sufficient penetration to discover the doctrine of irritability in the writings of homer and the circulation of the blood described in the books of solomon the preacher it would be really astonishing if this doctrine of the formative principle were allowed the merits of novelty and that nothing of the kind were to be discovered in all the works which have been written on the subject within these two thousand years past no one has given such a clear proof of this as ad mich birkholz philos et med dr et facult med assess in his dissert de respiratione ejusque fine summo atque ultimo lips      after informing us that the animal spirits spiritus vitales which the blood derives from the air is nothing more than the principium vitale of the ancients or the irritability and sensibility of haller he adds veteres philosophi hoc principium agnorerint vicarium dei ministrum et presidentiam superioris agentis et apud graecos quidem sub persona jovis colebatur jovis omnia plena a vetuslissimis philosophis a platone et platonicis arabibus et le cat appellatur anima spiritus et idea mundi vis et natura genetrix et plastica ideae operatrices a rayo flamma vitalis ab eodem et postea imprimis a newtono principium trahens a chemicis humidum radicale et quintum elementum a colonne invisibilia fermenta a blumenbachio nisus formativus a philosophis hermeticis mercurius universalis et philosophorum a thouvenel gas aeroelectricum ab aliis aliter appellatur especially as the vis plastica of the ancients and more particularly of the peripatetic schools would seem as far as the concordance of name goes to attempt one to such a qui pro quo  i should be extremely happy however if any person would name one of the old writers who in describing the vis plastica has given such a distinct idea of it or such a one as corresponds so well with the phenomena of generation of all authors who have treated of this power f bonamica the wellknown disciple of aristotle explains himself perhaps the most correctly de formatiane faetus p     spiritus in aerea seminis substantia comprehensus aspersus autem a calore coelesti et vi a patre accepta et ea quam a caelo participat in uterum faeminae conjectus concoquet materias a faemena infusas et pro ratiom ipsarum variis modis afficiens efficit instrumenta dum vero ea fabicat appellatur facultas  seu  sed ubi extructa fuerint instrumenta ut iis uti queat quae prius erat vis formatrix illis utens degenerat in animam  as that which i have attempted to give especially in the third section of this essay  professor wolff of petersburg a physiologist of great penetration has explained the growth of animals and vegetables by another power which he calls vis essentialis and which one on first hearing might be apt to confound with the nisus formativus  whoever takes the trouble however of perusing the sentiments which professor wolff entertains of the vis essentialis as given in his theoria generationis will soon discern the great difference there is between the two for example p    vis vegetabilium essentialis ea est wis qua humores ex circumjacente terra vel aliis corparibus colliguntur subire radicem coguntur per omnem plantam distribuuntur partem ad diversa loca deponuntur partem for as expelluntur  p    quae cunque vero sit haec vis sive attractrix sive propulsiva sive aeri expanso debita sive composita ex omnibus hisce et pluribus modo praestet enarratos effectus et ponatur posita planta et humoribus nutriciis applicatis id quod experientia confirmatum est sufficient ea praesenti scopo et vocabitur a me vis vegetabilium essentialis  and in respect to the generation of animals p    embryonem hoc tempore ovo sc    horas incubato ex substantia ovi nutrire demonstrant illius volumen auctum perfectones acquisitae absentia cujuscunque alius materae consumtio alluminis et vitelli succedens experimenta inferius recensenda consequenter transire particular nurients ex ovo ad embryonem et existere vin qua id perficitur quae non est sustaltica cordis et arteriarum neque hinc facta pressio in venas vicinas neque harum compressio a motu musculorum dirigentem absque canalibus viam determinatibus adeoque analogam illi    quam aeque vocabo essentialem     according to him the vis essentialis is only that power by which the nourishment is distributed to the different parts of an animal or vegetable this is indeed necessary to the formative principle but it is quite distinct from the principle itself for this vis essentialis exerts itself with equal force in the growth of even the most deformed and unnatural excrescences of plants and trees etc where the formative principle does not seem to act at all or at least with no regularity  on the other hand the vis essentialis may be very weak or deficient as in such organized bodies which are badly nourished whilst the formative principle remains in full force and so on  however unpleasant it may be to me yet i feel myself forced before entering more particularly on the nature of the formative principle to premise a refutation of the arguments which have been brought and especially by baron von haller in favor of evolution of the female egg but in doing so i shall pass over all those arguments against the doctrine of evolution which have lately appeared in a most ingenious and witty publication written expressly for that purpose vide doubts concerning the theory of evolution in a letter addressed to mons sonebier from l p patrin translated form the original french manuscript into german by g forster goettengen       what consoles me however in being thus obliged to dissent from the opinions of a man to whose works and writings i owe so much is partly the reflection that whatever useful may be contained in the present sheets was occasioned by examining into and prosecuting his enquiries and partly my doubts whether he himself might not have altered his ideas and have relinquished in a great degree his old opinions on the subject had he lived to have finished that part of the last edition of his physiology he himself wrote me a letter dated the   th august      in which he says i thank providence for having granted me so long a life as has enabled me to give an improved and corrected edition of my physiology without which i must have left many errors to be detected after my death  which treats of this matter  indeed had haller still persisted to support the doctrine of evolution and oppose that of gradual formation his fame would have suffered as little from it as harveys from his denying the existence of the lacteal vessels or newtons from his disbelief of the possibility of colorless tubes in the fern  sect ii examination of the principal arguments in favor of the supposed preexistence of organized germs in the ovaria of females and refutation of a doctrine on the   th of may      was read before the royal society of sciences at gottingen the celebrated paper of baron von haller then president of the society on the formation of the heart in the embryo in which it was believed an argumentum crucis was offered in support of the doctrine of preexisting germs the author says that he found that not only the membrane of the yolk of an incubated egg but also its blood vessels constituting what was called the figura venosa were a continuation of the membrane and blood vessels of the chick but the yolk of the egg existed in the hen previous to impregnation and therefore most probably the embryo also although too small to be discovered by our eyes the prudent author however expressed himself at first very cautiously and in an undecided manner on this syllogism levolution commence a me pariotre la plus probable   mons bonnet however who soon after published his work on organized bodies and who was previously propossessed in favor of the doctrine of the evolution of preexisting organic germs took hold of this observation of hallers and pronounced it to be absolutely unanswerable and considered the truth of the hypothesis as fully established by it vide his preface to the work alluded to ed  th enfin cette deconverte importante que le germe appartenoit a la femelle quil preexistoit ainsi a la faecondation et que levolution eloit la loi naturelle des etres organizes que jattendois et que javois ose predire me fut annoncee en      par mons le baron de haller qui la tenoit de la nature elle meme la decouverte de mr de haller prouvoit dune maniere incontestable que le poulet appartenoit originairement a la poule et quil preexistoit a la conception  and in his letter to mr von haller dated  0th of october      he says vos poulets menchantent je navois pas espere que le secret de la generation commonceroit sitot a se devoiler cest bien vous monsieur qui avez scu prendre la nature sur le fait     haller also allowed himself to be daily more and more convinced of the force of his own observations insomuch that in his latter writings he made little scruple of declaring them equally decisive as his friend bonnet had done  in acknowledging that i myself as well as some hundred other physiologists and naturalists looked on this celebrated observation as the foundation ston of the theory of evolution i hink i need make the less ceremony in expressing my astonishment how we could have allowed ourselves as in the present case to attribute so much force to an assertion which absolutely proves nothing  for granting it to be fully proved that there existed a continuation between the membrane and vessels of the chick and yolk granting it i say for the fact as the most accurate and scrupulous investigation teaches still remains uncertain as every one will readily acknowledge who has taken the pains of examining fecundated eggs yet it does not follow that the membrane and vessels even if they really were a continuation of each other coexisted from the beginning do we not see many instances in organized bodies where this last mentioned circumstance exists and yet where it is impossible to grant the supposition which has been drawn as a conclusion from it for instance all those singular vegetable productions which are caused by the puncture of certain infects in many plants thus the spongiae cynosbatae are produced entirely in consequence of the puncture of the cynips in the rosebush the bark of this shrub is continued over this spongy and quite accidental production nay if we take and cut any fresh branch which has some of these spongy bodies on it we shall find that the wood of the branch appears to be an evident continuation of the woody part of these substances but shall we from hence conclude that this accidental production originally coexisted with the shrub itself and that in every trunk and every branch of every rosebush in the world the enveloped germs of innumerable spongiae cynosbatae should have always lain there like so much hidden wealth and would have always remained so until the thousand thousandth part of them were by chance excited to evolution by the benevolent puncture of a little cynips  again in the animal kingdom do we not often see after an accidental inflammation of any of the viscera a new membrane formed as it were by the effusion of the lymphatic part of the blood and in the course of a few days do we not observe many blood vessels produced in this membrane which anastomose with the blood vessels of the neighboring viscera and yet it would be ridiculous to suppose that these vessels coexisted from the first with the old ones and for fear that it be objected to us that these are mere preternatural appearances in the diseased state of animals we beg them to recall the late celebrated membrana decidua of dr hunter which after a fruitful impregnation lines the whole cavity of the uterus and whose blood vessels especially where the umbilical chord is inserted in the placenta are most evidently connected and anastomose with the blood vessels of the mother  in all these cases the new formed membranes and their blood vessels are the mere productions of the neighboring viscera which renders it probable that the membrane and vessels of the embryo in a fecundated egg are produced in like manner from the membrane and vessels of the yolk  mr paul in the preface to the  th vol of the collection academique par etrangere p    sqq  a natural historian of great penetration has objected to hallers demonstration that allowing the membranes of the yolk with its invisible vessels to have preexisted in the hen yet it is possible that the embryo is only formed during incubation and that its blood vessels afterward unite with the blood vessels of the membrane of the yolk and thus form an anastomosis  baron von haller immediately declared loudly against this objection and denied it altogether as a thing impossible that the tender vessels of the microscopic embryo should be capable of anastomosing with the large blood vessels of the giant yolk nunquam fieri potest ut inter tubulum millionesies minorem et millionesies majorem continuitas oviatur elenent physiol t viii p   p    compare with his first lines of physiology     and with the opera minora t xi p       but what is rather singular is that this same most ingenious and meritorious author who denies the possibility of such an anastomosis supposes without any hesitation and in the same work elem physiolog  when explaining human conception that the very minute germ as soon as it has arrived at the cavity of the uterus forms an adhesion with it by means of its placenta  and how just in the same way that he denies it to the embryo of the hen that is to say by an anastomosis taking place between the microscopic and tender branches of the umbilical vessels and the giant ones of the maternal uterus  the modern advocates for the theory of evolution have taken this observation of the yolk of the egg as the prop of their hypothesis  long before this however the spawn of the frog had been employed for the same service  near a century indeed before that period swammerdam announced the wonderful discovery that the black points in the spawn of a frog were so many perfectly formed little frogs and that they preexisted in the ovariae although not to be discovered by the eye miracl nature p    admiratione dignum est nigrum illud punctum quod in ovis ranarum videre est ipsum ranunculum omnibus suis partibus absolutum albicantem verum et circumfusum illum liquorem non nisi alimentum ejus esse quod ipsum

ipsum animal sub hac tantula mole delitescat  and a little way further on he draws the general conclusion nullus mihi in rerum naturae generationi sed soli propagatione vel incremento partium locus esse videtur ubi casus omnis excludatur     the good man seemed to have had a presentiment of the uncertainty and instability of all vain worldly honors and he therefore as is well known soon after betook himself to a more solid mysterious enjoyment in which mlle bourignon bore a part and indeed it happened as he appears to have foreseen for the ungrateful world now ascribe the merits of that discovery to the celebrated abbe spallanzani who has maintained it in several of his writings but more particularly in the second volume of his essays dissertazioni di fisica animale e vegetabile t xi in modena    0     he calls the little black points of the fecundated spawn of frogs tadpoles or young frogs a parlare filosofocamente luovo non e che il gerino in se stesso concentrato e ristretto il quale mediante la fecondazione si sviluppa ed acquista le fatezze di animale p    xvii  and as this little black point exactly resembles the same in the unfecundated spawn questi globetti non fecondati non sono per verun conto distinguibili dai fecondati xviii  he reasons agreeably to his logic that the tadpoles must have existed in the mother ma i globetti fecondati non sono che i feti ranini xvii adunque i globetti non fecondati lo saranno altresi e consiguemente nella nostra rana il feto esiste in lei pria che abbiasi la fecondazione del maschio p    xix   i do not know what would be thought of that chemist who assertes that the arbor dianae preexisted in a mass of amalgam of silver because when a weak solution of silver was poured on it a little tree seemed to spring out of it  one ought to be ashamed of wasting much time in the refutation of an assertion the falsity of which any unprejudiced person who is not altogether unaccustomed to observations of the kind may convince himself of every spring  whoever has taken the trouble accurately to examine the spawn of the frog must confess that the idea of demonstrating the little black points contained in it to be so many complete formed tadpoles partakes greatly of brother peterss method of reasoning in the tale of the tub where he demonstrates to his brothers that the brown loaf is a piece of excellent roast mutton  but the abettors of the theory of organized germs have gone a step further in support of their opinions they refer to cases where even young girls in all their maiden innocence have become pregnant from the untimely and premature evolution of one of these organized germs  the concurrence of facts is sometimes most wonderful it happened that in the very same year that swammerdam announced his discovery in the spawn of the frog that a case was published in the ephem rerum not curios delivered to the society by a celebrated courtphysician of those times dr claudius which exactly suited as a confirmation of swammerdams opinion  a millers wife was delivered of a little girl whose belly seemed of an unusual size eight days afterward this little bigbellied child was seized with such violent pains and restlessness that every one who was present thought it could not outlive the next instant the sick infant however in the mean time actually bore a wellformed elegant lively little daughter about the size of ones middle finger which was regularly baptized during the time and after the birth the waters placenta and all other impurities were rightly discharged but both the little mother and daughter died early the following day i adopt the very words of a contemporary physician dr otto who was consulted by the grandmother the millers wife during her pregnancy his nephew has vindicated and illustrated the whole history in a most learned and subtle manner d c j aug ottonis epistola de faetu puerpera sive de faetu in faetu weissenfels       vo that this extraordinary history is also well calculated to interest the casuist is evident from the disquisitionum filiola quam act dierum enfans vivam enixa est babtismi capax     baron von haller very judiciously classes this case with another from the transactions of the academy of sciences of stockholm where on dissecting a young girl bones teeth and hairs were found in a tumor of the mysentery these two cases he looks on as principal evidences for the truth of the doctrine of germs preexisting in the mother  in schmuckers miscellaneous surgical essays an anonymus correspondent sends the history of the dissection of a girl in whom instead of an uterus there was found a hard hairy body of the size of a large walnut and which resembled an illshaped head it had two perfect teeth and contained in its cavity something like brain  now since the abettors of the theory of evolution so loudly remonstrate against and complain of the unfair method of proceeding by opposing mere argument to the facts which they bring forward in support of their opinions i shall for the present totally abstain from all reasoning and endeavor to satisfy these gentlemen by adducing fact for fact observation for observation and those of no less wonderful and entertaining a nature than theirs for they will prove that not only men but male animals have been equally in a thriving way with young virgins and i trust the testimonies of the truth of these stories will be found equally respectable with those of the opposite party  to the case extracted from the memoirs of the academy of stockholm i oppose one from the history of the royal academy of sciences of paris where an abbe was interrupted very mal apropos whilst instituting some experiments on generation he was alarmed by an extraordinary increase of bulk in a certain part which another abbe the unfortunate abelard was deprived of in consequence of a similar experiment  the tumor increased so much that he was obliged to submit to an operation and his surgeon assured the academy that he cut an ossified child on y distinguoit la tete les pieds et les yeux from the part  to the story of the millers wife i beg leave to subjoin one from the philosophical transactions of london where an account is given of a male greyhound that bore a living puppy per anum and in the place of drs otto an claudius who witnessed the truth of the first fact i shall mention two names of which england ought to boast dr wallis and edmund halley  lastly to the anonymous in schmucker i oppose an anonymous in the works of the respectable fr ruysh who was presented with a similar production it was a bony case half as big as a common walnut together with four perfect mollares and a knot of hair which he assured the doctor he had cut from the stomach of a male subject  thus i have adduced authority for authority nor do i believe it possible for any one to go more conscienteously to work than i have done and so far therefore i ust we are quits  were i allowed however to speak my mind freely on this matter i should advise all such auxiliary troops to be withdrawn my only reason for bringing them on the field was merely to oppose those of my antagonists  these therefore are the principal arguments which i have to oppose to what the advocates for the theory of evolution consider as the strongest and most decisive proofs of their theory  but experience supplies me with another source of facts which may be used as arguments against this theory and which to unprejudiced and judicious readers ought to be sufficient whereby to ascertain its true degree of probability  for instance the well established and universal truth that the first appearance of a newly conceived animal or plant is never to be discovered immediately on impregnation even by the most powerful armed eye no such thing is to be seen until a considerable time has elapsed  it is not worth while to enter into a refutation of the fabulous assertion of hippocrates and of so many others of his old and worthy followers that perfectly distinct and well formed human embryos were to be seen in the very first days of conception considering the few aids and little opportunity they had in those days of making such observations great allowance is to be made and the more so when we consider that even modern physicians of much more extensive experience in these matters have been guilty of similar assertions mauriceau has amused us with representations of foetusses of one day and of three days and a half etc and malpighi and croune have assured us that they had seen the embryo of the chick and its appendices in the egg of a trod hen before the egg had been sat upon the last author indeed observed it he says in the addle egg of hens that never had been cocked  it is impossible however to discover any thing before the third week after conception which any cautious and creditable observer would presume to pronounce a human embryo and in the fecundated egg nothing can be observed which has even the most distant resemblance to a chick in the first twelve hours nor indeed until the end of the second day previous to this period of time peculiar to each animal and vegetable in the hare the first traces of the young are not seen until the ninth day in the sheep not before the nineteenth in the deer not before the seventh week it is quite impossible to distinguish the newly conceived offspring which circumstance considering the perfection and powers of our microscopes is by no means favorable to the theory of evolution  nor is it at all easy to comprehend how the advocates for that theory make the phenomena of the accidental origin and growth of certain preternatural parts agree with their doctrine of preexisting organic germs  a few instances of this kind will serve instead of many  a woman conceives but the foetus instead of being in the uterus is situated in one of the fallopean tubes the tube at last bursts from the increase of bulk of this strayed animal and it falls into the cavity of the abdomen what does nature do she pours out a quantity of plastic lymph which forms itself evidently into organized membranes incrusting and inveloping the foetus like a mummy by which it is prevented from putrefaction for were this allowed to take place it would occasion certain death to the mother but who preserved by this contrivance is enabled to carry the troublesome though not dangerous load for a considerable number of years on opening the body after death we evidently perceive this new and accidentally formed membrane to be richly supplied with blood vessels in the eighth volume of the commentaries of the royal society of goitingen i have given the description of a foetus of this kind which had lain eight years within the mother this specimen was presented to the museum of the academy by my very worthy friend mr buchner of gotha which it would be rather difficult to prove had preexisted in the organic germ  a person breaks both bones of the forearm but is so restless as to disturb nature in her usual process of healing them that is by means of a new ossification in this case what does she do she forms a new joint of the broken ends of both bones making as it were a second elbow which can be moved at pleasure without any assistance from the other hand  another person dislocates his thigh bone from it is natural situation in the ilium and nature endeavors to remedy the evil by forming a new socket for it in my osteology i have given numerous examples of this vid page      a child is born with a hydrocephalus occasioned by mere accidental circumstances such for instance as the frequent and too violent connection of the father with the mother during the time of her gestation owing to this disease the cranium becomes preternaturally distended and immence spaces are left between the very thin and greatly distended bones in order to remedy this nature forms detached osseous points in these interstices which points at last become true ossa triquetra filling up all the dangerous voids and uniting all the bones of the head together  these ossa triquetra however do not belong to the natural structure of the foetus and are very seldom to be met with in the sculls of savages or of brute animals it is hardly possible therefore that they should have preexisted in the organic germ and yet they are as perfect bones as any others of the head having true and well formed sutures the sutures of these bones are not always locked in with the sutures of the other bones of the head but it often happens that they are so numerous and so thick together that those in the middle evidently construct their own ones what is there however which exhibits more art than the structure of a true suture its double nay treble row of teeth the corresponding depressions and the astonishing manner in which they are clasped together  the conclusion which naturally follows is that if perfect bones new and preternatural joints new organized and vascular membranes can be formed where there was no ground for supposing a preexisting germ what necessity is there for this doctrine of envelopement  but the phenomena which occur in the generation of mules so completely resute all our ideas of preexisting organic germs that one is at a loss to imagine how after a due attention to this subject such a theory should have found any serious abettors i should suppose that a single experiment such as that of mr koelreuter who by repeatedly producing prolific bastard plants transformed one species of tobacco  nicotiana rustica into another  nicotiana paniculata so completely that it had not the smallest resemblance to its maternal parent that such an experiment i say must cure the most partial advocate for the theory of evolution of his error this excellent observer by artificially impregnating the first species of tobacco with the farina of the last mentioned obtained prolific bastard seeds from it and with the plants which sprung from these he repeated the same experiment impregnating them with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata as the plants which he procured from the seeds of this last combination differed more from the original maternal plant he repeated the same process with it and proceeded to do so with every new offspring until he obtained six plants which in every respect appeared perfectly similar to the paniculata so that in the classical work in which he gives a narrative of this he appears perfectly justifiable in entitling it a complete metamorphosis of one natural species of plants into another  i know perfectly well that the favorers of the theory of evolution endeavor to explain the production of bastards or mules by saying that the male semen besides its stimulating power of awakening the female germs from their state of stupor and inactivity also ascribe to it certain formative powers by which the germ may be altered in a certain degree so as so resemble the father a little but what in the name of heaven is such a subterfuge than the silent acknowledgement of the insufficiency of the germ theory and of the necessity of having recourse to formative powers in order to extricate it if these formative powers however are so strong as totally to change the structure and appearance of the maternal germ and that in the course of a few generations it is rather difficult to conceive the utility of such a theory  sect iii proofs of the formative nisus and an attempt to ascertain some of its laws it is easier to overturn than to establish a theory and the reproach has been often applied to old reformers that they have succeeded better in attempts of the first than of the last kind yet what mons bonnet excellently remarks on this subject may be very true demontrer une errcur cest plus que decouvrir une veite car lon peut ignorer beaucoup mais le peut que lon scait il faut au moins le savoir bien presace de lessai sur lame  that the detection of an error is often of greater consequence than the discovery of a new fact in this respect therefore i trust the present sheets will at least be allowed some merits since they point out the defects of a late beloved and almost universally adopted theory i hope however at the same time that the one which i give in its place will be found more agreeable to what we observe in nature  no one can be more fully persuaded of the immense gap which exists between the organized and unorganised between the animated and the inanimate world than i am and although i have the greatest respect for the penetration of those who discover a gradual scale of ascent and descent in the works of nature yet i confess i am at a loss to guess how they make it pass from organic to inorganic bodies such a reflection however ought by no means to deter us from employing the phenomena of either of these classes of bodies for explaining the phenomena of the other and so far do i consider it as an argument not of the least importance for proving the existence of the formative nisus in organic bodies that even in the inorganic ones there exists traces of a formative power not of a formative nisus however at least in the sense this word is used in this work for here it is considered as one of the properties of the living principle and consequently not to be imagined as belonging to dead matter but that this last formative power is demonstrated by the regularity and invariable shape of certain bodies which we find to be formed of it  for only to adduce one or two instances we find nothing more elegant than certain metallic crystallizations which as to their external aspect bear so striking a resemblance to certain organized bodies that they become a very good example for explaining to us the manner in which bodies are formed from rude and unorganized matter such for instance is that species of native dendritical silver imbeded in a matrix of quarz from mexico farnkrautsilber and which resembles the foliage of the fern or to name something more common that undescribable beautiful mosslooking texture of brass which is observed in breaking a piece of it after the first fusion  these as i have already said are adduced as mere examples of the existence of a formative principle in unorganized bodies  and now for the true formative effort in the animated world  i know no means so well calculated for rendering the existence and activity of this nisus evident to an impartial eye as to observe the origin and progress of such organized bodies which increase so rapidly in bulk that the action of the growth becomes almost evident and which are of so delicate and semitransparent a texture as to be capable of being evidently seen through with the assistance of a microscope and a due degree of light  the vegetable kingdom supplies us with a very good example of this kind in the simple production of a most simple water plant conferva fontinalis which is commonly to be met with every spring in wells ponds and springs or in the wooden pipes through which water flows  the whole plant consists of a single uniform straight fine thread of a bright green color and about half an inch in length and whose under extremity is generally inserted in a bed of slime as these threads however are extremely numerous and grow very close together they look like a very fine fur of the most beautiful green color with which considerable spaces of the places above mentioned are sometimes covered  i have attentively observed the propagation of this water plant in the beginning of the spring and to me it appeared to take place in the following manner the upper end of the fibrile began gradually to swell and divide into a number of small round points which at last disengaged themselves from the parental thread and in the number of some thousands attached themselves to the sides of the glass in which i made the experiment soon afterward these round bodies began to shoot out a small point which almost visibly lengthened till they had acquired their due size all this took place in the space of twice twentyfour hours counting from the first moment that the end of the old thread began to swell  both the rapid growth of this plant and its transparent texture afforded me means of discovering not only its structure but also the slightest changes that took place in it this kind of moss is equally simple internally as externally and under the strongest magnifying powers and by the best light we can discover nothing else than a fine vesicular appearance like a green froth surrounded by a very thin delicate membrane  but in spite of the distinctness of texture of the little green points which adhered to the sides of the vessel there was nothing to be seen like the germ of an enveloped filament in them such as was soon to be produced from it but only when the little round body had attained a certain degree of perfection a small shoot seemed to spring out of it in such a manner that its act of evolution seemed to be promoted merely by that part of the vesicular texture of the round point which was most contiguous to the filament passing gradually over to it as the filament increased in length the little round body gradually decreased in magnitude and became of a paler color so that at last when the filament had arrived at its full growth there remained just a perceptible swelling at the inferior end and which served as a root to the new filament  with an equal degree of distinctness with which the progress of the formative nisus of this plant becomes conspicuous we can also clearly discover it in many animals especially in such as like this kind of moss possess the advantages of a rapid growth and great transparency of texture this is the case with the armed polypi which on account of the miracles they are capable of performing have within these last forty years been an object of general surprise and admiration all the known species of this animal have a kind of gelatinous body which whether it be of a green yellow or brown color etc is still sufficiently transparent to be capable of being distinctly seen through if a proper lens and light be employed its texture is uniform and simple and so homogenous consisting entirely of gelatinous points which seem to be kept together by a still thinner jelly that nothing seems concealed from or obscured to the eye of the observer now when this animal is about to produce its young a swelling or tumefaction takes place on a single spot of its body and from this swelling there shoots out first the cylindrical body and then the tentaculae of the young polypus these are all of so considerable a size as to be observed with the naked eye and when we consider this circumstance and all the others already mentioned there does not appear the smallest probable ground for supposing that an organized germ had preexisted there and was now evolving  i refer it to the internal feelings of every one who has attentively observed this kind of production in animals and plants of so simple a texture as those alluded to and who at the same time have well attended to all the arguments brought forward in the foregoing fection against the doctrine of the preexistence of the embryo of the chick in the yolk of the egg whether in passing in his own mind to the generation of the more perfect or warmblooded animals as for instance by the most accurate investigation of the phenomena of the beginning progress and form of the embryo in the fecundated egg and also of the many other parts nidus pulli bulla amnion figura venosa etc which are never to be found in the unfecunded one whether i say his conviction leads him to believe in the preexistence of enveloped organic germs or in the existence of a nisus by which a new being is formed from the unorganized materials of generation  all the arguments which have hitherto been deduced from the phenomena of generation in support of the existence of a nisus formativus gains new and additional weight from the consideration of the phenomena of reproduction this so wonderful power of organized bodies by which lost and mutilated parts are again renewed  generation and reproduction are both modifications of one and the same power the last being nothing else than a partial repetition of the first whatever tends to elucidate the one must therefore throw light on the other  i have frequently repeated the experiments alluded to in the first section by which i endeavored to discover the power of reproduction in the green armed polypus and have constantly met with the same success the little mutilated animal was always diminished in bulk in proportion as its new arms or new body were pushed out it became evident with what efforts nature hastened to renew the determinate form of the maimed animal and also that from the short period of time and the improbability of the polypus having taken a sufficient quantity of nourishment to supply materials for the new members since all wounded polypi eat less than usual from these circumstances i say it became evident that owing to the force of the formative nisus with which the parts were endowed the remaining portion of the mutilated animal was in some degree converted into the new members and thus the disturbed structure renewed  i am well aware that the advocates for the theory of evolution will in order to help themselves out of this difficulty have recouse to an hypothesis which of all improbable ones may be styled the most romantic and improbable and according to which it is supposed that in every part of the polypus there exists innumerable germs enveloped and torpid as it were which lie like a hidden store until it shall please the fancy of a naturalist to rouse them into action and free them from their state of imprisonment by the enlivening cut of a pair of scissars  now let any one compare this explanation with the naked appearances which take place in the above and many other experiments on the armed polypus the process of which are so easy to be discovered  i shall at present content myself with relating two of these experiments when we take the half of two polypi of different kinds for instance the anterior half of a green one and the posterior half of a brown one and bring them together at the bottom of a proper glass they join together and form in this manner one of these monsters of mythology representing a group composed of different parts of different animals  according to the theory of evolution however very different phenomena must have occurred instead of this junction between the two halves each one ought to have evolved from an organic germ that part of which it had been deprived of but this is not what we observe it was more natural that the two parts should join by the means of their formative powers than that each of the halves should of itself have been metamorphosed to a complete animal by the manner described above  there is a well known experiment however which is admirably calculated to demonstrate both the improbability of the supposed preexisting germs and at the same time the activity of the formative nisus when we take the polypus and do not divide it in pieces but merely slit open its belly longitudinally so as to destroy that cavity and as it were metamorphose the shape of the animal from a cylindrical to a flat form instead of a number of organic germs being set free from the cut edges and of their being each evolved one of the two following occurrences takes place either the animal rolls itself together in the usual form so that the edges of the wound meet and coalesce or if it remains like a piece of flat tape it begins soon after to swell in the middle as if it were blown up and there is gradually formed within it a new belly  in both these cases there is no occasion for new materials all that is done is a mere reparation of the disturbed structure  in man and other warmblooded animals the power of reproduction is much more limited mited not only on account of the great diversity of materials of which they are composed but also the different quantity of living principle peculiar to each of these materials and by the mutual dependence and action which they exercise on each other and yet we often observe in them evident marks of this power of reproduction tending to confirm all that has been said on this head concerning the polypus nails have been observed to grow on the stump of a finger even although the first joint was completely lost pecklin and talp have seen instances of this kind it would be rather a bold conjecture to suppose that nature had foreseen such accidents and had therefore sown all the fingers and toes with the organic germs of nails etc and on the contrary how agreeable to nature is it to deduce the whole phenomenon from the activity of the formative powers whose efforts are sufficiently strong to reproduce nails on the extremities of the fingers nay even in unusual parts  another equally well known and interesting fact of this kind is where nature endeavors to supply the loss of an extremity whose complicated structure it would have been difficult for her to restore by the production of a more simple and uniform substance thus that celebrated surgeon morand gives the description of a hare which a considerable time before its death had had one of its fore legs shot off the place of which nature had endeavored to supply with a kind of bony stump which although not like the original quoad materiem yet resembled taliter qualiter quoad forman cetoit to use his own expression une espece de jambe de bois dont la nature scule avoit faet le pais   if as i flatter myself the few phenomena of generation and reproduction already taken notice of are sufficient to prove the undeniable existence of the formative nisus there remain many others tending to explain its modus operandi and to ascertain some of the laws by which that mode seems to be regulated i look upon the following to be of this kind that is as the mere result of undoubted observation  i the activity of the nisus is in an inverse ratio to the age of the organized body  for however certain it may be as has been formerly remarked that some time is necessary before the first marks of the new conceived fruit becomes visible yet it is equally well ascertained that after this interval the formation proceeds with astonishing celerity  in general the embryos of the earlier months are represented in a very unshapely form but this may be owing either to the person who gives the representation or to this that such abortions generally suffer much by external violence are squeezed compressed or from putrefaction having already begun lose much of their uncommon elegance which otherwise render them objects of admiration i possess some of these beautiful human foetusses of the first months of pregnancy especially those which i received from my dear friend mr buckner of gotha where in one of five weeks old and of the size of a common be all the features of the face every singer complete every toe and the organs of generation were to be distinctly seen  now this early activity of the formative nisus is by no means confined to the external form of the embryo but is still more remarkable in the internal structure i have often been astonished at the early perfection of the vicera which i have discovered in dissecting recent human embryos of the first months thus merely to mention one circumstance in its head which was hardly larger than a pea the whole cartilaginous basis cranii with all its depressions apertures and processes were marked in the most sharp and distinct manner although indeed there was not the smallest point of ossification either in the sphenoid bone or the petrous part of the temporal one  however difficult it may be on the supposition of preexisting germs to explain what becomes of them for so long a time after they arrive at the place of their destination and are fecundated and stimulated to evolution it is equally difficult to imagine why immediately after this interval they should so suddenly acquire so respectable a size on the contrary after it has been fully understood what was said concerning the time necessary for the preparation of the fluids of generation before the formative nisus takes place there remains nothing puzzling in this that then the new awakened action should so soon form the ground work of the new animal  that the inverse ratio between the formative nisus and the increase of age continues even after birth is proved by the remarkable ease with which reproduction takes place in very young animals especially those of the lizard kind as in the common newt  ii the formative nisus is much more active in the embryos of mamelia than in those of oviparous animals  in the chick for instance the first appearance of the ribs is observed one hundred and twentynine hours after impregnation this period is equal to the nineteenth week of gestation in the human species but i have in my possession human foetusses which are not more than six weeks old and yet in which the cartilaginous rudiments of the ribs are to be distinctly discovered it would appear as if nature made greater haste with the formation of viviparous animals to secure them against deformity from acccidental causes such as pressure external violence etc from which causes all oviparous animals are defended by their shell  iii in the formation of some particular parts of any organized body the formative nisus is much more regular in its process than in that of others thus the brain says old conr vict schneider a man much distinguished in physiology is seldom or never found to deviate from the usual structure in corpore humano he says pars faciem suam rarius mutal quam cerebrum  on the contrary how great and frequent are the variations in many other parts such as in the kidneys and thoracic duct etc  amongst the many deviations of the formative process from its usual course these are principally to be mentioned   st where one species of organic body takes on the action of that of another  to this belong some of the most unaccountable phenomena in nature which as far as i am able to judge cannot be explained in any satisfactory manner by the theory of preexisting germs it is a wellknown fact that women have in general and according to the strict laws of nature only one uterus for the reception of the new conceived foetus but that most of the other females in the class of mamalia have a double one yet instances are not wanting where a real uterus bicornis has been found in women this singularity if i am not mistaken is accounted for by the previous reflection in the same manner i would reckon all those hares which have been so frequently observed with small horns like those of deers and also many of those strange deviations which take place now and then in the structure of the vegetable kingdom such as the aldertree with oak leaves described by gleditch betula alnus quercifolia vid gleditch hinterlassene abbandl das practishe fortwesen betreffend    dly where the organs of generation of one sex take on more or less the structure of that of the other  in our skeptical day the possibility of human hermaphrodites and that of other warmblooded animals has been much doubted and yet baron haller of this university and mr john hunter of london have instituted and given relations of the most careful dissections of such animals especially in the cow and goat tribes and which leave no room for further doubts in this matter it is true that in none of the instances the most essential parts of generation for instance the male testicles and female ovaria were to be distinctly discovered in the same individual but though the chief form seemed to be always that of one of the sexes yet there was evidently to be discovered in one part or another the most unequivocal though imperfect marks of the organs of the other sex in general the male organs lay internally whilst the external ones had more the resemblance of the female   dly when the formative process does not as in the former instances take an action which is foreign but one that is completely preternatural to the individual and yet from an attentive consideration of the astonishing uniformity which reigns amongst the different kinds of monsters it would appear as if the causes of the deviation in their formation was regulated by certain fixed laws whoever has seen any considerable number of monsters or only looked into the loose and wretched compilations of representations of them can hardly have escaped being struck by the resemblance which unites even to the most inconsiderable parts certain species of them so that the individuals of that species seem as if they had all been cast in the same mould  to conclude there is still one other phenomenon which the reader is at liberty to explain either on the principle of preexisting organic germs or that of the formative nisus many animal monsters such for instance as those with two bodies and a single head are of that kind according to the express assertion of baron haller and other evolutionists that they cannot have arisen from the accidental growth of two germs but that the fault lies in the original monstrosity of a single germ now it is singular that such monsters are only common in animal which have been domesticated and that they are never or at least seldom to be heard of in their wild state can the author of nature have ordained it that from amongst the involved germs of any one species of animals for instance swine the monsters should arrive at evolution just when taken under the care of men and that the monsters should be produced only by the tame and not by the wild also  on the other hand there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that after the subjection of these animals their whole frame and economy suffer a very great change that then the formative nisus deviates in some degree from its original laws and therefore these animals as they degenerate into endless varieties are also more subjected to monstrosity  such in my opinion are the principal observations and experiments which serve to prove the existence of the formative nisus and to ascertain some of its laws observations which have drawn my conviction more and more from the system of involved germs and confirmed my belief in the very opposite doctrine which i have endeavored to establish  finis errata page line for read     begins begin      of the note sncber sencbier      of the note oriatur oriatur      assertes asserted      of the note
