three essays on picturesque beauty on picturesque travel and on sketching landscape to which is added a poem on landscape painting  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in new forest near lymington  london printed for r blamire in the strand  mdccxcii  to william lock esquire of norburypark in surrey dear sir the following essays and poem i beg leave to inscribe to you indeed i do little more than return your own for the best remarks and observations in them are yours such as may be cavilled at i am persuaded must be mine  a published work is certainly a fair object of criticism but i think my dear sir we picturesque people are a little misunderstood with regard to our general intention i have several times been surprised at finding us represented as supposing all beauty to consist in picturesque beauty  and the face of nature to be examined only by the rules of painting whereas in fact we always speak a different language we speak of the grand scenes of nature tho uninteresting in a picturesque light as having a strong effect on the imagination  often a stronger than when they are properly disposed for the pencil we every where make a distinction between scenes that are beautiful and amusing and scenes that are picturesque we examine and admire both even artificial objects we admire whether in a grand or in a humble style tho unconnected with picturesque beauty  the palace and the cottage  the improved gardenscene and the neat homestall works of tillage also afford us equal delight  the plough the mower the reaper the hayfield and the harvestwane in a word we reverence and admire the works of god and look with benevolence and pleasure on the works of men  in what then do we offend at the expense of no other species of beauty we merely endeavor to illustrate and recommend one species more which tho among the most interesting has never yet so far as i know been made the set object of investigation from scenes indeed of the picturesque kind we exclude the appendages of tillage and in general the works of men which too often introduce preciseness and formality but excluding artificial objects from one species of beauty is not degrading them from all we leave then the general admirer of the beauties of nature to his own pursuits nay we admire them with him all we desire is that he would leave us as quietly in the possession of our amusements  under this apology my dear sir i have ventured in the following essays to enlarge a little both on our theory and practice in the first essay that we may be fairly understood the distinguishing characteristic is marked of such beautiful objects as are suited to the pencil in the second the mode of amusement is pointed out that may arise from viewing the scenes of nature in a picturesque light and in the third a few rules are given for sketching landscape after nature i have practiced drawing as an amusement and relaxation for many years and here offer the result of my experience some readiness in execution indeed it is supposed is necessary before these rules can be of much service they mean to take the young artist up where the drawingmaster leaves him  i have only to add farther that as several of the rules and principles here laid down have been touched in different picturesque works which i have given the public i have endeavored not to repeat myself and where i could not throw new light on a subject i have hastened over it  only in a work of this kind it was necessary to bring all my principles together  with regard to the poem annexed to these essays something more should be said as that small part of the public who personally know me and that still smaller part whom i have the honor to call my friends may think me guilty of presumption in attempting a work of this kind i beg leave to give the following history of it  several years ago i amused myself with writing a few lines in verse on landscapepainting and afterward sent them as a fragment for they were not finished to amuse a friend edward forster esquire of walthamstow i had no other purpose my friend told me he could not say much for my poetry but as my rules he thought were good he wished me to finish my fragment and if i should not like it as a poem i might turn it into an essay in prose  as this was only what i expected i was not disappointed tho not encouraged to proceed so i troubled my head no farther with my verses  some time after another friend rev mr mason finding fault with my mode of describing the lakes and mountains of cumberland and westmoreland as too poetical i told him the fate of my fragment lamenting the hardship of my case  when i wrote verse one friend called it prose and when i wrote prose another friend called it verse in his next letter he desired to see my verses and being pleased with the subject he offered if i would finish my poem however carelessly as to metrical exactness he would adjust the versification but he found he had engaged in a more arduous affair than he expected my rules and tecnical terms were stubborn and would not easily glide into verse and i was as stubborn as they and would not relinquish the scientific part for the poetry my friends goodnature therefore generally gave way and suffered many lines to stand and many alterations to be made which his own good taste could not approve extract of a letter from mr mason   i have inserted conscientiously every word and phrase you have altered except the awkward word clump which i have uniformly discarded whenever it offered itself to me in my english garden which you may imagine it did frequently in it is stead i have always used tuft i have ventured therefore to insert it adjectively and i hope i shall be forgiven except in this single instance i know not that i have deviated in the least from the alterations you sent  i now quit all that relates to the poem not without some selfsatisfaction in thinking it is over for to own the truth had i thought you would have expected such almost mathematical exactitude of terms as i find you do and in consequence turned lines tolerably poetical into prosaic for the sake of precision i should never have ventured to give you my assistance i am afraid therefore i must appear to the world as having spoiled a good poem and must shelter myself and it under those learned reasons which have been given for putting propria quae maribus and as in praesenti into verse if the rules have injured the poetry as rules at least i hope they will meet your approbation i am dear sir with the greatest esteem and regard  your sincere and most obedient humble servant william gilpin vicarshill oct         explanation of the prints two facing page    it is the intention of these two prints to illustrate how very adverse the idea of smoothness is to the composition of landscape in the second of them the great lines of the landscape are exactly the same as in the first only they are more broken  two facing p    the first of these prints is meant to illustrate the idea of simple illumination the light falls strongly on various parts as indeed it often does in nature but as it is the painters business to take nature in her most beautiful form he chooses to throw his light more into a mass as represented in the second print which exhibits the same landscape only better enlightened when we merely take the lines of a landscape from nature and inlighten it as we must often do from our own taste and judgment the massing of the light must be well attended to as one of the great sources of beauty it must not be scattered in spots but must be brought more together as on the rocky side of the hill in the second print and yet it must graduate also in different parts so as not to appear affected  one print facing p    the idea of gradation is here farther illustrated according to the explanation in p     the inscription is that admired one of caecilia metella the daughter of metellus and the wife of crassus in which with so much elegant and tender simplicity her name is divided between her father and her husband  one facing p    this print exemplifies a simple mode of tinting a drawing as explained in the text the coloring of this print which is done by hand has added a little to the expense of the book but it was thought necessary to complete the scheme  it was colored by a relation of mine mr gilpin drawingmaster at paddingtongreen who in all the copies i have seen has illustrated my ideas very satisfactorily and who as far as the recommendation of a partial kinsman may go deserves mine  one facing p    this print is an explanation of a few rules in perspective just sufficient for the use of common landscape  essay i on picturesque beauty essay i disputes about beauty might perhaps be involved in less confusion if a distinction were established which certainly exists between such objects as are beautiful and such as are picturesque  between those which please the eye in their natural state and those which please from some quality capable of being illustrated in painting  ideas of beauty vary with the object and with the eye of the spectator those artificial forms appear generally the most beautiful with which we have been the most conversant thus the stonemason sees beauties in a welljointed wall which escape the architect who surveys the building under a different idea and thus the painter who compares his object with the rules of his art sees it in a different light from the man of general taste who surveys it only as simply beautiful  as this difference therefore between the beautiful and the picturesque appears really to exist and must depend on some peculiar construction of the object it may be worth while to examine what that peculiar construction is we inquire not into the general sources of beauty either in nature or in representation this would lead into a nice and scientific discussion in which it is not our purpose to engage the question simply is what is that quality in objects which particularly marks them as picturesque  in examining the real object we shall find one source of beauty arises from that species of elegance which we call smoothness or neatness for the terms are nearly synonymous the higher the marble is polished the brighter the silver is rubbed and the more the mahogany shines the more each is considered as an object of beauty as if the eye delighted in gliding smoothly over a surface  in the class of larger objects the same idea prevails in a pile of building we wish to see neatness in every part added to the elegance of the architecture and if we examine a piece of improved pleasureground every thing rough and slovenly offends  mr burke enumerating the properties of beauty considers smoothness as one of the most essential a very considerable part of the effect of beauty says he is owing to this quality indeed the most considerable for take any beautiful object and give it a broken and rugged surface and however wellformed it may be in other respects it pleases no longer whereas let it want ever so many of the other constituents if it want not this it becomes more pleasing than almost all the others without it upon the sublime and beautiful p      how far mr burke may be right in making smoothness the most considerable source of beauty i rather doubt mr burke is probably not very accurate in what he farther says on the connection between beauty and diminutives  beauty excites love and a loved object is generally characterized by diminutives but it does not follow that all objects characterized by diminutives tho they may be so because they are loved are therefore beautiful we often love them for their moral qualities their affections their gentleness or their docility beauty no doubt awakens love but it also excites admiration and respect this combination forms the sentiment which prevails when we look at the apollo of belvidere and the niobe no man of nice discernment would characterize these statues by diminutives  there is then a beauty between which and diminutives there is no relation but which on the contrary excludes them and in the description of figures possessed of that species of beauty we seek for terms which recommend them more to our admiration than our love    a considerable one it certainly is  thus then we suppose the matter stands with regard to beautiful objects in general but in picturesque representation it seems somewhat odd yet we shall perhaps find it equally true that the reverse of this is the case and that the ideas of neat and smooth instead of being picturesque in fact disqualify the object in which they reside from any pretensions to picturesque beauty  nay farther we do not scruple to assert that roughness forms the most essential point of difference between the beautiful and the picturesque as it seems to be that particular quality which makes objects chiefly pleasing in painting  i use the general term roughness but properly speaking roughness relates only to the surfaces of bodies when we speak of their delineation we use the word ruggedness both ideas however equally enter into the picturesque and both are observable in the smaller as well as in the larger parts of nature  in the outline and bark of a tree as in the rude summit and craggy sides of a mountain  let us then examine our theory by an appeal to experience and try how far these qualities enter into the idea of picturesque beauty and how far they mark that difference among objects which is the ground of our inquiry  a piece of palladian architecture may be elegant in the last degree the proportion of it is parts  the propriety of it is ornaments  and the symmetry of the whole may be highly pleasing but if we introduce it in a picture it immediately becomes a formal object and ceases to please should we wish to give it picturesque beauty we must use the mallet instead of the chissel we must beat down one half of it deface the other and throw the mutilated members around in heaps in short from a smooth building we must turn it into a rough ruin no painter who had the choice of the two objects would hesitate a moment  again why does an elegant piece of gardenground make no figure on canvas the shape is pleasing the combination of the objects harmonious and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty all this is true but the smoothness of the whole tho right and as it should be in nature offends in picture turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground plant rugged oaks instead of flowering shrubs break the edges of the walk give it the rudeness of a road mark it with wheeltracks and scatter around a few stones and brushwood in a word instead of making the whole smooth make it rough and you make it also picturesque all the other ingredients of beauty it already possessed  you sit for your picture the master at your desire paints your head combed smooth and powdered from the barbers hand this may give it a more striking likeness as it is more the resemblance of the real object but is it therefore a more pleasing picture i fear not leave reynolds to himself and he will make it picturesque he will throw the hair dishevelled about your shoulders virgil would have done the same it was his usual practice in all his portraits in his figure of ascanius we have the fusos crines and in his portrait of venus which is highly finished in every part the artist has given her hair  diffundere ventis the roughness which virgil gives the hair of venus and ascanius we may suppose to be of a different kind from the squalid roughness which he attributes to charon portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat terribili squalore charon cui plurima mento canities inculta jacet  charons roughness is in it is kind picturesque also but the roughness here intended and which can only be introduced in elegant figures is of that kind which is merely opposed to hair in nice order in describing venus virgil probably thought hair when streaming in the wind both beautiful and picturesque from it is undulating form and varied tints and from a kind of life which it assumes in motion tho perhaps it is chief recommendation to him at the moment was that it was a feature of the character which venus was then assuming     that lovely face of youth smiling with all it is sweet dimpling charms how attractive is it in life how beautiful in representation it is one of those objects that please as many do both in nature and on canvas but would you see the human face in it is highest form of picturesque beauty examine that patriarchal head what is it which gives that dignity of character that force of expression those lines of wisdom and experience that energetic meaning so far beyond the rosy hue or even the bewitching smile of youth what is it but the forehead furrowed with wrinkles the prominent cheekbone catching the light the muscles of the cheek strongly marked and losing themselves in the shaggy beard and above all the austere brow projecting over the eye  that feature which particularly struck homer in his idea of jupiter it is much more probable that the poet copied forms from the sculptor who must be supposed to understand them better from having studied them more than that the sculptor should copy them from the poet artists however have taken advantage of the prepossession of the world for homer to secure approbation to their works by acknowledging them to be reflected images of his conceptions so phidias assured his countrymen that he had taken his jupiter from the description of that god in the first book of homer the fact is none of the features contained in that image except the brow can be rendered by sculpture but he knew what advantage such ideas as his art could express would receive from being connected in the mind of the spectator with those furnished by poetry and from the just partiality of men for such a poet he seems therefore to have been as well acquainted with the mind of man as with his shape and face  if by  we understand as i think we may a projecting brow which casts a broad and deep shadow over the eye clarke has rendered it ill by nigris superciliis which most people would construe into black eyebrows nor has pope tho he affected a knowledge of painting translated it more happily by sable brows  but if phidias had had nothing to recommend him except his having availed himself of the only feature in the poet which was accommodated to his art we should not have heard of inquirers wondering from whence he had drawn his ideas nor of the compliment which it gave him an opportunity of paying to homer    and which he had probably seen finely represented in some statue in a word what is it but the rough touches of age  as an object of the mixed kind partaking both of the beautiful and the picturesque we admire the human figure also the lines and surface of a beautiful human form are so infinitely varied the lights and shades which it receives are so exquisitely tender in some parts and yet so round and bold in others it is proportions are so just and it is limbs so fitted to receive all the beauties of grace and contrast that even the face in which the charms of intelligence and sensibility reside is almost lost in the comparison but although the human form in a quiescent state is thus beautiful yet the more it is smooth surface is ruffled if i may so speak the more picturesque it appears when it is agitated by passion and it is muscles swollen by strong exertion the whole frame is shown to the most advantage  but when we speak of muscles swollen by exertion we mean only natural exertions not an affected display of anatomy in which the muscles tho justly placed may still be overcharged  it is true we are better pleased with the usual representations we meet with of the human form in a quiescent state than in an agitated one but this is merely owing to our seldom seeing it naturally represented in strong action even among the best masters we see little knowledge of anatomy one will inflate the muscles violently to produce some trifling effect another will scarce swell them in the production of a labored one the eye soon learns to see a defect tho unable to remedy it but when the anatomy is perfectly just the human body will always be more picturesque in action than at rest the great difficulty indeed of representing strong muscular motion seems to have struck the ancient masters of sculpture for it is certainly much harder to model from a figure in strong momentary action which must as it were be shot flying than from one sitting or standing which the artist may copy at leisure amidst the variety of statues transmitted from their hands we have only three or four in very spirited action tho there are only perhaps two or three of the first antique statues in very spirited action  the laocoon the fighting gladiator and the boxers  yet there are several others which are in action  the apollo belvidere  michael angelos torso  arria and paetus  the pietas militaris sometimes called the ajax of which the pasquin at rome is a part and of which there is a repetition more entire tho still much mutilated at florence  the alexander and bucephalus and perhaps some others which occur not to my memory the paucity however of them even if a longer catalogue could be produced i think shows that the ancient sculptors considered the representation of spirited action as an achievement the moderns have been less daring in attempting it but i believe connoisseurs universally give the preference to those statues in which the great masters have so successfully exhibited animated action   yet when we see an effect of this kind well executed our admiration is greatly increased who does not admire the laocoon more than the antinous  animal life as well as human is in general beautiful both in nature and on canvas we admire the horse as a real object the elegance of his form the stateliness of his tread the spirit of all his motions and the glossiness of his coat we admire him also in representation but as an object of picturesque beauty we admire more the wornout carthorse the cow the goat or the ass whose harder lines and rougher coats exhibit more the graces of the pencil for the truth of this we may examine berghems pictures we may examine the smart touch of rosa of tivoli the lion with his rough mane the bristly boar and the ruffled plumage of the eagle the idea of the ruffled plumage of the eagle is taken from the celebrated eagle of pindar in his first pythian ode which has exercised the pens of several poets and is equally poetical and picturesque he is introduced as an instance of the power of music in grays ode on the progress of poesy we have the following picture of him perching on the sceptered hand of jove thy magic lulls the feathered king with ruffled plumes and flagging wing quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie the terror of his beak and lightening of his eye akensides picture of him in his hymn to the naiads is rather a little stiffly painted  with slackened wings while now the solemn concert breathes around incumbent on the scepter of his lord sleeps the stern eagle by the numbered notes possessed and satiate with the melting tone sovereign of birds  wests picture especially the two last lines is a very good one the birds fierce monarch drops his vengeful ire perched on the scepter of the olympian king the thrilling power of harmony he feels and indolently hangs his flagging wing while gentle sleep his closing eyelid seals and over his heaving limbs in loose array to every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play     are all objects of this kind smoothcoated animals could not produce so picturesque an effect  but when the painter thus prefers the carthorse the cow or the ass to other objects more beautiful in themselves he does not certainly recommend his art to those whose love of beauty makes them anxiously seek by what means it is fleeting forms may be fixed  suggestions of this kind are ungrateful the art of painting allows you all you wish you desire to have a beautiful object painted  your horse for instance led out of the stable in all his pampered beauty the art of painting is ready to accommodate you you have the beautiful form you admired in nature exactly transferred to canvas be then satisfied the art of painting has given you what you wanted it is no injury to the beauty of your arabian if the painter think he could have given the graces of his art more forcibly to your carthorse  but does it not depreciate his art if he give up a beautiful form for one less beautiful merely because he could have given it the graces of his art more forcibly  because it is sharp lines afford him a greater facility of execution is the smart touch of a pencil the grand desideratum of painting does he discover nothing in picturesque objects but qualities which admit of being rendered with spirit  i should not vindicate him if he did at the same time a free execution is so very fascinating a part of painting that we need not wonder if the artist lay a great stress upon it  it is not however entirely owing as some imagine to the difficulty of mastering an elegant line that he prefers a rough one in part indeed this may be the case for if an elegant line be not delicately hit off it is the most insipid of all lines whereas in the description of a rough object an error in delineation is not easily seen however this is not the whole of the matter a free bold touch is in itself pleasing a stroke may be called free when there is no appearance of constraint it is bold when a part is given for the whole which it cannot fail of suggesting this is the laconism of genius but sometimes it may be free and yet suggest only how easily a line which means nothing may be executed such a stroke is not bold but impudent   in elegant figures indeed there must be a delicate outline  at least a line true to nature yet the surfaces even of such figures may be touched with freedom and in the appendages of the composition there must be a mixture of rougher objects or there will be a want of contrast in landscape universally the rougher objects are admired which give the freest scope to execution if the pencil be timid or hesitating little beauty results the execution then only is pleasing when the hand firm and yet decisive freely touches the characteristic parts of each object  if indeed either in literary or in picturesque composition you endeavor to draw the reader or the spectator from the subject to the mode of executing it your affectation language like light is a medium and the true philosophic style like light from a northwindow exhibits objects clearly and distinctly without soliciting attention to itself in painting subjects of amusement indeed language may gild somewhat more and color with the dies of fancy but where information is of more importance than entertainment tho you cannot throw too strong a light you should carefully avoid a colored one the style of some writers resembles a bright light placed between the eye and the thing to be looked at the light shows itself and hides the object and it must be allowed the execution of some painters is as impertinent as the style of such writers   disgusts at the same time if some care and pains be not bestowed on the execution your slovenliness disgusts as much tho perhaps the artist has more to say than the man of letters for paying attention to his execution a truth is a truth whether delivered in the language of a philosopher or a peasant and the intellect receives it as such but the artist who deals in lines surfaces and colors which are an immediate address to the eye conceives the very truth itself concerned in his mode of representing it guidos angel and the angel on a signpost are very different beings but the whole of the difference consists in an artful application of lines surfaces and colors  it is not however merely for the sake of his execution that the artist values a rough object he finds it in many other respects accommodated to his art in the first place his composition requires it if the historypainter threw all his draperies smooth over his figures his groups and combinations would be very awkward and in landscapepainting smooth objects would produce no composition at all in a mountainscene what composition could arise from the corner of a smooth knoll coming forward on one side intersected by a smooth knoll on the other with a smooth plain perhaps in the middle and a smooth mountain in the distance the very idea is disgusting picturesque composition consists in uniting in one whole a variety of parts and these parts can only be obtained from rough objects if the smooth mountains and plains were broken by different objects the composition might be good on a supposition the great lines of it were so before  variety too is equally necessary in his composition so is contrast both these he finds in rough objects and neither of them in smooth variety indeed in some degree he may find in the outline of a smooth object but by no means enough to satisfy the eye without including the surface also  from rough objects also he seeks the effect of light and shade which they are as well disposed to produce as they are the beauty of composition one uniform light or one uniform shade produces no effect it is the various surfaces of objects sometimes turning to the light in one way and sometimes in another that give the painter his choice of opportunities in massing and graduating both his lights and shades  the richness also of the light depends on the breaks and little recesses which it finds on the surfaces of bodies what the painter calls richness on a surface is only a variety of little parts on which the light shining shows all it is small inequalities and roughnesses and in the painters language inriches it  the beauty also of catching lights arises from the roughness of objects what the painter calls a catching light is a strong touch of light on some prominent part of a surface while the rest is in shadow a smooth surface has no such prominences  in coloring also rough objects give the painter another advantage smooth bodies are commonly as uniform in their color as they are in their surface in glossy objects tho smooth the coloring may sometimes vary in general however it is otherwise in the objects of landscape particularly the smooth side of a hill is generally of one uniform color while the fractured rock presents it is gray surface adorned with patches of greensward running down it is guttered sides and the broken ground is every where varied with an okery tint a gray gravel or a leadencoloured clay so that in fact the rich colors of the ground arise generally from it is broken surface  from such reasoning then we infer that it is not merely for the sake of his execution that the painter prefers rough objects to smooth the very essence of his art requires it  as picturesque beauty therefore so greatly depends on rough objects are we to exclude every idea of smoothness from mixing with it are we struck with no pleasing image when the lake is spread upon the canvas the marmoreum aequor pure limpid smooth as the polished mirror  we acknowledge it to be picturesque but we must at the same time recollect that in fact the smoothness of the lake is more in reality than in appearance were it spread upon the canvas in one simple hue it would certainly be a dull fatiguing object but to the eye it appears broken by shades of various kinds by the undulations of the water or by reflections from all the rough objects in it is neighborhood  it is thus too in other glossy bodies tho the horse in a rough state as we have just observed or worn down with labor is more adapted to the pencil than when his sides shine with brushing and highfeeding yet in this latter state also he is certainly a picturesque object but it is not his smooth and shining coat that makes him so it is the apparent interruption of that smoothness by a variety of shades and colors which produces the effect such a play of muscles appears every where through the fineness of his skin gently swelling and sinking into each other  he is all over so lubricus aspici the reflections of light are so continually shifting upon him and playing into each other that the eye never considers the smoothness of the surface but is amused with gliding up and down among these endless transitions which in some degree supply the room of roughness  it is thus too in the plumage of birds nothing can be softer nothing smoother to the touch and yet it is certainly picturesque but it is not the smoothness of the surface which produces the effect  it is not this we admire it is the breaking of the colors it is the bright green or purple changing perhaps into a rich azure or velvet black from thence taking a semitint and so on through all the varieties of color or if the color be not changeable it is the harmony we admire in these elegant little touches of natures pencil the smoothness of the surface is only the ground of the colors in itself we admire it no more than we do the smoothness of the canvas which receives the colors of the picture even the plumage of the swan which to the inaccurate observer appears only of one simple hue is in fact varied with a thousand soft shadows and brilliant touches at once discoverable to the picturesque eye  thus too a piece of polished marble may be picturesque but it is only when the polish brings out beautiful veins which in appearance break the surface by a variety of lines and colors let the marble be perfectly white and the effect vanishes thus also a mirror may have picturesque beauty but it is only from it is reflections in an unreflecting state it is insipid  in statuary we sometimes see an inferior artist give his marble a gloss thinking to atone for his bad workmanship by his excellent polish the effect shows in how small a degree smoothness enters into the idea of the picturesque when the light plays on the shining coat of a pampered horse it plays among the lines and muscles of nature and is therefore founded in truth but the polish of marbleflesh is unnatural on all human flesh held between the eye and the light there is a degree of polish i speak not here of such a polish as this which wrought marble always in a degree possesses as well as human flesh but of the highest polish which can be given to marble and which has always a very bad effect if i wanted an example the bust of archbishop boulter in westminsterabbey would afford a very glaring one    the lights therefore are false and smoothness being here one of the chief qualities to admire we are disgusted and say it makes bad worse  after all we mean not to assert that even a simple smooth surface is in no situation picturesque in contrast it certainly may be nay in contrast it is often necessary the beauty of an old head is greatly improved by the smoothness of the bald pate and the rougher parts of the rock must necessarily be set off with the smoother but the point lies here to make an object in a peculiar manner picturesque there must be a proportion of roughness so much at least as to make an opposition which in an object simply beautiful is unnecessary  some quibbling opponent may throw out that wherever there is smoothness there must also be roughness the smoothest plain consists of many rougher parts and the roughest rock of many smoother and there is such a variety of degrees in both that it is hard to say where you have the precise ideas of rough and smooth  to this it is enough that the province of the picturesque eye is to survey nature not to anatomize matter it throws it is glances around in the broadcast style it comprehends an extensive tract at each sweep it examines parts but never descends to particles  having thus from a variety of examples endeavored to show that roughness either real or apparent forms an essential difference between the beautiful and the picturesque it may be expected that we should point out the reason of this difference it is obvious enough why the painter prefers rough objects to smooth see page    etc  but it is not so obvious why the quality of roughness should make an essential difference between the objects of nature and the objects of artificial representation  to this question we might answer that the picturesque eye abhors art and delights solely in nature and that as art abounds with regularity which is only another name for smoothness and the images of nature with irregularity which is only another name for roughness we have here a solution of our question  but is this solution satisfactory i fear not tho art often abounds with regularity it does not follow that all art must necessarily do so the picturesque eye it is true finds it is chief objects in nature but it delights also in the images of art if they are marked with the characteristics which it requires a painters nature is whatever he imitates whether the object be what is commonly called natural or artificial is there a greater ornament of landscape than the ruins of a castle what painter rejects it because it is artificial  what beautiful effects does vandervelt produce from shipping in the hands of such a master it furnishes almost as beautiful forms as any in the whole circle of picturesque objects  and what could the historypainter do without his draperies to combine contrast and harmonize his figures uncloathed they could never be grouped how could he tell his story without arms religious utensils and the rich furniture of banquets many of these contribute greatly to embellish his pictures with pleasing shapes  shall we then seek the solution of our question in the great foundation of picturesque beauty in the happy union of simplicity and variety to which the rough ideas essentially contribute an extended plain is a simple object it is the continuation only of one uniform idea but the mere simplicity of a plain produces no beauty break the surface of it as you did your pleasureground add trees rocks and declivities that is give it roughness and you give it also variety thus by enriching the parts of a united whole with roughness you obtain the combined idea of simplicity and variety from whence results the picturesque  is this a satisfactory answer to our question  by no means simplicity and variety are sources of the beautiful as well as of the picturesque why does the architect break the front of his pile with ornaments is it not to add variety to smplicity even the very blacksmith acknowledges this principle by forming ringlets and bulbous circles on his tongs and pokers in nature it is the same and your plain will just as much be improved in reality by breaking it as upon canvas  in a gardenscene the idea is different there every object is of the neat and elegant kind what is otherwise is inharmonious and roughness would be disorder  shall we then change our ground and seek an answer to our question in the nature of the art of painting as it is an art strictly imitative those objects will of course appear most advantageously to the picturesque eye which are the most easily imitated the stronger the features are the stronger will be the effect of imitation and as rough objects have the strongest features they will consequently when represented appear to most advantage  is this answer more satisfactory  very little in truth every painter knows that a smooth object may be as easily and as well imitated as a rough one  shall we then take an opposite ground and say just the reverse as men pressed with difficulties will say any thing that painting is not an art strictly imitative but rather deceptive  that by an assemblage of colors and a peculiar art in spreading them the painter gives a semblance of nature at a proper distance which at hand is quite another thing  that those objects which we call picturesque are only such as are more adapted to this art  and that as this art is most concealed in rough touches rough objects are of course the most picturesque  have we now attained a satisfactory account of the matter  just as much so as before many painters of note did not use the rough style of painting and yet their pictures are as admirable as the pictures of those who did nor are rough objects less picturesque on their canvas than on the canvas of others that is they paint rough objects smoothly  thus foiled shall we in the true spirit of inquiry persist or honestly give up the cause and own we cannot search out the source of this difference i am afraid this is the truth whatever airs of dogmatizing we may assume inquiries into principles rarely end in satisfaction could we even gain satisfaction in our present question new doubts would arise the very first principles of our art would be questioned difficulties would start up vestibulum ante ipsum we should be asked what is beauty what is taste  let us step aside a moment and listen to the debates of the learned on these heads they will at least show us that however we may wish to six principles our inquiries are seldom satisfactory  one philosopher will tell us that taste is only the improvement of our own ideas every man has naturally his proportion of taste the seeds of it are innate all depends on cultivation  another philosopher following the analogy of nature observes that as all mens faces are different we may well suppose their minds to be so likewise he rejects the idea therefore of innate taste and in the room of this makes utility the standard both of taste and beauty  another philosopher thinks the idea of utility as absurd as the last did that of innate taste what cries he can i not admire the beauty of a resplendent sunset till i have investigated the utility of that peculiar radiance in the atmosphere he then wishes we had a little less philosophy amongst us and a little more common sense common sense is despised like other common things but in his opinion if we made common sense the criterion in matters of art as well as science we should be nearer the truth  a fourth philosopher apprehends common sense to be our standard only in the ordinary affairs of life the bounty of nature has furnished us with various other senses suited to the objects among which we converse and with regard to matters of taste it has supplied us with what he doubts not we all feel within ourselves a sense of beauty  pooh says another learned inquirer what is a sense of beauty sense is a vague idea and so is beauty and it is impossible that any thing determined can result from terms so inaccurate but if we lay aside a sense of beauty and adopt proportion we shall all be right proportion is the great principle of taste and beauty we admit it both in lines and colors and indeed refer all our ideas of the elegant kind to it is standard  true says an admirer of the antique but this proportion must have a rule or we gain nothing and a rule of proportion there certainly is but we may inquire after it in vain the secret is lost the ancients had it they well knew the principles of beauty and had that unerring rule which in all things adjusted their taste we see it even in their slightest vases in their works proportion tho varied through a thousand lines is still the same and if we could only discover their principles of proportion we should have the arcanum of this science and might settle all our disputes about taste with great ease  thus in our inquiries into first principles we go on without end and without satisfaction the human understanding is unequal to the search in philosophy we inquire for them in vain  in physics  in metaphysics  in morals even in the polite arts where the subject one should imagine is less recondite the inquiry we find is equally vague we are puzzled and bewildered but not informed all is uncertainty a strife of words the old contest empedocles an stertinii deliret acumen  in a word if a cause be sufficiently understood it may suggest useful discoveries but if it be not so and where is our certainty in these disquisitions it will unquestionably mislead  end of the first essay as the subject of the foregoing essay is rather new and i doubted whether sufficiently founded in truth i was desirous before i printed it that it should receive the imprimatur of sir joshua reynolds i begged him therefore to look it over and received the following answer  london april   th      dear sir tho i read now but little yet i have read with great attention the essay which you was so good to put into my hands on the difference between the beautiful and the picturesque and i may truly say i have received from it much pleasure and improvement  without opposing any of your sentiments it has suggested an idea that may be worth consideration  whether the epithet picturesque is not applicable to the excellences of the inferior schools rather than to the higher the works of michael angelo raphael etc appear to me to have nothing of it whereas reubens and the venetian painters may almost be said to have nothing else  perhaps picturesque is somewhat synonymous to the word taste which we should think improperly applied to homer or milton but very well to pope or prior i suspect that the application of these words are to excellences of an inferior order and which are incompatible with the grand style  you are certainly right in saying that variety of tints and forms is picturesque but it must be remembered on the other hand that the reverse of this  uniformity of color and a long continuation of lines produces grandeur  i had an intention of pointing out the passages that particularly struck me but i was afraid to use my eyes so much  the essay has lain upon my table and i think no day has passed without my looking at it reading a little at a time whatever objections presented themselves at first view sir joshua reynolds had seen this essay several years ago through mr mason who showed it to him he then made some objections to it particularly he thought that the term picturesque should be applied only to the works of nature his concession here is an instance of that candor which is a very remarkable part of his character and which is generally one of the distinguishing marks of true genius   were done away on a closer inspection and i am not quite sure but that is the case in regard to the observation which i have ventured to make on the word picturesque  i am etc joshua reynolds to the revd mr gilpin vicarshill  the answer may  d      dear sir i am much obliged to you for looking over my essay at a time when the complaint in your eyes must have made an intrusion of this kind troublesome but as the subject was rather novel i wished much for your sanction and you have given it me in as flattering a manner as i could wish  with regard to the term picturesque i have always myself used it merely to denote such objects as are proper subjects for painting so that according to my definition one of the cartoons and a flowerpiece are equally picturesque  i think however i understand your idea of extending the term to what may be called taste in painting  or the art of fascinating the eye by splendid coloring and artificial combinations which the inferior schools valued and the dignity of the higher perhaps despised but i have seen so little of the higher schools that i should be very ill able to carry the subject farther by illustrating a disquisition of this kind except the cartoons i never saw a picture of raphaels that answered my idea and of the original works of michael angelo i have little conception  but tho i am unable through ignorance to appreciate fully the grandeur of the roman school i have at least the pleasure to find i have always held as a principle your idea of the production of greatness by uniformity of color and a long continuation of line and when i speak of variety i certainly do not mean to confound it is effects with those of grandeur  i am etc william gilpin to sir joshua reynolds leicestersquare  essay ii on picturesque travel essay ii enough has been said to show the difficulty of assigning causes let us then take another course and amuse ourselves with searching after effects this is the general intention of picturesque travel we mean not to bring it into competition with any of the more useful ends of traveling but as many travel without any end at all amusing themselves without being able to give a reason why they are amused we offer an end which may possibly engage some vacant minds and may indeed afford a rational amusement to such as travel for more important purposes  in treating of picturesque travel we may consider first it is object and secondly it is sources of amusement  it is object is beauty of every kind which either art or nature can produce but it is chiefly that species of picturesque beauty which we have endeavored to characterize in the preceding essay this great object we pursue through the scenery of nature and examine it by the rules of painting we seek it among all the ingredients of landscape  trees  rocks  brokengrounds  woods  rivers  lakes  plains  valleys  mountains  and distances these objects in themselves produce infinite variety no two rocks or trees are exactly the same they are varied a second time by combination and almost as much a third time by different lights and shades and other aerial effects sometimes we find among them the exhibition of a whole but oftener we find only beautiful parts as some of these topics have been occasionally mentioned in other picturesque works which the author has given the public they are here touched very slightly only the subject required they should be brought together     that we may examine picturesque objects with more ease it may be useful to class them into the sublime and the beautiful tho in fact this distinction is rather inaccurate sublimity alone cannot make an object picturesque however grand the mountain or the rock may be it has no claim to this epithet unless it is form it is color or it is accompaniments have some degree of beauty nothing can be more sublime than the ocean but wholly unaccompanied it has little of the picturesque when we talk therefore of a sublime object we always understand that it is also beautiful and we call it sublime or beautiful only as the ideas of sublimity or of simple beauty prevail  the curious and fantastic forms of nature are by no means the favorite objects of the lovers of landscape there may be beauty in a curious object and so far it may be picturesque but we cannot admire it merely for the sake of it is curiosity the lusus naturae is the naturalists province not the painters the spiry pinnacles of the mountain and the castlelike arrangement of the rock give no peculiar pleasure to the picturesque eye it is fond of the simplicity of nature and sees most beauty in her most usual forms the giants causeway in ireland may strike it as a novelty but the lake of killarney attracts it is attention it would range with supreme delight among the sweet vales of switzerland but would view only with a transient glance the glaciers of savoy scenes of this kind as unusual may please once but the great works of nature in her simplest and purest style open inexhausted springs of amusement  but it is not only the form and the composition of the objects of landscape which the picturesque eye examines it connects them with the atmosphere and seeks for all those various effects which are produced from that vast and wonderful storehouse of nature nor is there in traveling a greater pleasure than when a scene of grandeur bursts unexpectedly upon the eye accompanied with some accidental circumstance of the atmosphere which harmonizes with it and gives it double value  besides the inanimate face of nature it is living forms fall under the picturesque eye in the course of travel and are often objects of great attention the anatomical study of figures is not attended to we regard them merely as the ornament of scenes in the human figure we contemplate neither exactness of form nor expression any farther than it is shown in action we merely consider general shapes dresses groups and occupations which we often find casually in greater variety and beauty than any selection can procure  in the same manner animals are the objects of our attention whether we find them in the park the forest or the field here too we consider little more than their general forms actions and combinations nor is the picturesque eye so fastidious as to despise even less considerable objects a flight of birds has often a pleasing effect in short every form of life and being has it is use as a picturesque object till it become too small for attention  but the picturesque eye is not merely restricted to nature it ranges through the limits of art the picture the statue and the garden are all the objects of it is attention in the embellished pleasureground particularly tho all is neat and elegant  far too neat and elegant for the use of the pencil yet if it be well laid out it exhibits the lines and principles of landscape and is well worth the study of the picturesque traveller nothing is wanting but what his imagination can supply  a change from smooth to rough see page     but among all the objects of art the picturesque eye is perhaps most inquisitive after the elegant relics of ancient architecture the ruined tower the gothic arch the remains of castles and abbeys these are the richest legacies of art they are consecrated by time and almost deserve the veneration we pay to the works of nature itself  thus universal are the objects of picturesque travel we pursue beauty in every shape through nature through art and all it is various arrangements in form and color admiring it in the grandest objects and not rejecting it in the humblest  from the objects of picturesque travel we consider it is sources of amusement  or in what way the mind is gratified by these objects  we might begin in moral style and consider the objects of nature in a higher light than merely as amusement we might observe that a search after beauty should naturally lead the mind to the great origin of all beauty to the  first good first perfect and first fair but tho in theory this seems a natural climax we insist the less upon it as in fact we have scarce ground to hope that every admirer of picturesque beauty is an admirer also of the beauty of virtue and that every lover of nature reflects that nature is but a name for an effect whose cause is god  if however the admirer of nature can turn his amusements to a higher purpose if it is great scenes can inspire him with religious awe or it is tranquil scenes with that complacency of mind which is so nearly allied to benevolence it is certainly the better apponat lucro it is so much into the bargain for we dare not promise him more from picturesque travel than a rational and agreeable amusement yet even this may be of some use in an age teeming with licentious pleasure and may in this light at least be considered as having a moral tendency  the first source of amusement to the picturesque traveller is the pursuit of his object  the expectation of new scenes continually opening and arising to his view we suppose the country to have been unexplored under this circumstance the mind is kept constantly in an agreeable suspense the love of novelty is the foundation of this pleasure every distant horizon promises something new and with this pleasing expectation we follow nature through all her walks we pursue her from hill to dale and hunt after those various beauties with which she every where abounds  the pleasures of the chase are universal a hare started before dogs is enough to set a whole country in an uproar the plough and the spade are deserted care is left behind and every human faculty is dilated with joy  and shall we suppose it a greater pleasure to the sportsman to pursue a trivial animal than it is to the man of taste to pursue the beauties of nature to follow her through all her recesses to obtain a sudden glance as she flits past him in some airy shape to trace her through the mazes of the cover to wind after her along the vale or along the reaches of the river  after the pursuit we are gratified with the attainment of the object our amusement on this head arises from the employment of the mind in examining the beautiful scenes we have found sometimes we examine them under the idea of a whole we admire the composition the coloring and the light in one comprehensive view when we are fortunate enough to fall in with scenes of this kind we are highly delighted but as we have less frequent opportunities of being thus gratified we are more commonly employed in analyzing the parts of scenes which may be exquisitely beautiful tho unable to produce a whole we examine what would amend the composition how little is wanting to reduce it to the rules of our art what a trifling circumstance sometimes forms the limit between beauty and deformity or we compare the objects before us with other objects of the same kind  or perhaps we compare them with the imitations of art from all these operations of the mind results great amusement  but it is not from this scientifical employment that we derive our chief pleasure we are most delighted when some grand scene tho perhaps of incorrect composition rising before the eye strikes us beyond the power of thought  when the vox faucibus haeret and every mental operation is suspended in this pause of intellect this deliquium of the soul an enthusiastic sensation of pleasure overspreads it previous to any examination by the rules of art the general idea of the scene makes an impression before any appeal is made to the judgment we rather feel than survey it  this high delight is generally indeed produced by the scenes of nature yet sometimes by artificial objects here and there a capital picture will raise these emotions but oftener the rough sketch of a capital master this has sometimes an astonishing effect on the mind giving the imagination an opening into all those glowing ideas which inspired the artist and which the imagination only can translate in general however the works of art affect us coolly and allow the eye to criticize at leisure  having gained by a minute examination of incidents a complete idea of an object our next amusement arises from enlarging and correcting our general stock of ideas the variety of nature is such that new objects and new combinations of them are continually adding something to our fund and enlarging our collection while the same kind of object occurring frequently is seen under various shapes and makes us if i may so speak more learned in nature we get it more by heart he who has seen only one oaktree has no complete idea of an oak in general but he who has examined thousands of oaktrees must have seen that beautiful plant in all it is varieties and obtains a full and complete idea of it  from this correct knowledge of objects arises another amusement that of representing by a few strokes in a sketch those ideas which have made the most impression upon us a few scratches like a shorthand scrawl of our own legible at least to ourselves will serve to raise in our minds the remembrance of the beauties they humbly represent and recall to our memory even the splendid coloring and force of light which existed in the real scene some naturalists suppose the act of ruminating in animals to be attended with more pleasure than the act of grosser mastication it may be so in traveling also there may be more pleasure in recollecting and recording from a few transient lines the scenes we have admired than in the present enjoyment of them if the scenes indeed have peculiar greatness this secondary pleasure cannot be attended with those enthusiastic feelings which accompanied the real exhibition but in general tho it may be a calmer species of pleasure it is more uniform and uninterrupted it flatters us too with the idea of a sort of creation of our own and it is unallayed with that fatigue which is often a considerable abatement to the pleasures of traversing the wild and savage parts of nature  after we have amused ourselves with our sketches if we can in any degree contribute to the amusement of others also the pleasure is surely so much inhanced  there is still another amusement arising from the correct knowledge of objects and that is the power of creating and representing scenes of fancy which is still more a work of creation than copying from nature the imagination becomes a camera obscura only with this difference that the camera represents objects as they really are while the imagination impressed with the most beautiful scenes and chastened by rules of art forms it is pictures not only from the most admirable parts of nature but in the best taste  some artists when they give their imagination play let it loose among uncommon scenes  such as perhaps never existed whereas the nearer they approach the simple standard of nature in it is most beautiful forms the more admirable their fictions will appear it is thus in writing romances the correct taste cannot bear those unnatural situations in which heroes and heroines are often placed whereas a story naturally and of course affectingly told either with a pen or a pencil tho known to be a fiction is considered as a transcript from nature and takes possession of the heart the mavelous disgusts the sober imagination which is gratified only with the pure characters of nature   beauty best is taught by those the favored few whom heaven has lent the power to seize select and reunite her loveliest features and of these to form one archetype complete of sovereign grace here nature sees her fairest forms more fair owns them as hers yet owns herself excelled by what herself produced  but if we are unable to embody our ideas even in a humble sketch yet still a strong impression of nature will enable us to judge of the works of art nature is the archetype the stronger therefore the impression the better the judgment  we are in some degree also amused by the very visions of fancy itself often when slumber has halfclosed the eye and shut out all the objects of sense especially after the enjoyment of some splendid scene the imagination active and alert collects it is scattered ideas transposes combines and shifts them into a thousand forms producing such exquisite scenes such sublime arrangements such glow and harmony of coloring such brilliant lights such depth and clearness of shadow as equally foil description and every attempt of artificial coloring  it may perhaps be objected to the pleasureable circumstances which are thus said to attend picturesque travel that we meet as many disgusting as pleasing objects and the man of taste therefore will be as often offended as amused  but this is not the case there are few parts of nature which do not yield a picturesque eye some amusement   believe the muse she does not know that unauspicious spot where beauty is thus niggard of her store believe the muse through this terrestrial waste the seeds of grace are sown profusely sown even where we least may hope  it is true when some large tract of barren country interrupts our expectation wound up in quest of any particular scene of grandeur or beauty we are apt to be a little peevish and to express our discontent in hasty exaggerated phrase but when there is no disappointment in the case even scenes the most barren of beauty will furnish amusement  perhaps no part of england comes more under this description than that tract of barren country through which the great military road passes from newcastle to carlisle it is a waste with little interruption through a space of forty miles but even here we have always something to amuse the eye the interchangeable patches of heath and greensward make an agreeable variety often too on these vast tracts of intersecting grounds we see beautiful lights softening off along the sides of hills and often we see them adorned with cattle flocks of sheep heathcocks grous plover and flights of other wildfowl a group of cattle standing in the shade on the edge of a dark hill and relieved by a lighter distance beyond them will often make a complete picture without any other accompaniment in many other situations also we find them wonderfully pleasing and capable of making pictures amidst all the deficiences of landscape even a winding road itself is an object of beauty while the richness of the heath on each side with the little hillocs and crumbling earth give many an excellent lesson for a foreground when we have no opportunity of examining the grand scenery of nature we have every where at least the means of observing with what a multiplicity of parts and yet with what general simplicity she covers every surface  but if we let the imagination loose even scenes like these administer great amusement the imagination can plant hills can form rivers and lakes in valleys can build castles and abbeys and if it find no other amusement can dilate itself in vast ideas of space  but although the picturesque traveller is seldom disappointed with pure nature however rude yet we cannot deny but he is often offended with the productions of art he is disgusted with the formal separations of property  with houses and towns the haunts of men which have much oftener a bad effect in landscape than a good one he is frequently disgusted also when art aims more at beauty than she ought how flat and insipid is often the gardenscene how puerile and absurd the banks of the river how smooth and parrallel the lawn and it is boundaries how unlike nature even in the capital collection of pictures how seldom does he find design composition expression character or harmony either in light or coloring and how often does he drag through saloons and rooms of state only to hear a catalogue of the names of masters  the more refined our taste grows from the study of nature the more insipid are the works of art few of it is efforts please the idea of the great original is so strong that the copy must be very pure if it do not disgust but the varieties of natures charts are such that study them as we can new varieties will always arise and let our taste be ever so refined her works on which it is formed at least when we consider them as objects must always go beyond it and furnish fresh sources both of pleasure and amusement  end of the second essay essay iii on the art of sketching landscape essay iii the art of sketching is to the picturesque traveller what the art of writing is to the scholar each is equally necessary to fix and communicate it is respective ideas  sketches are either taken from the imagination or from nature  when the imaginary sketch proceeds from the hands of a master it is very valuable it is his first conception which is commonly the strongest and the most brilliant the imagination of a painter really great in his profession is a magazine abounding with all the elegant forms and striking effects which are to be found in nature these like a magician he calls up at pleasure with a wave of his hand bringing before the eye sometimes a scene from history or romance and sometimes from the inanimate parts of nature and in these happy moments when the enthusiasm of his art is upon him he often produces from the glow of his imagination with a few bold strokes such wonderful effusions of genius as the more sober and correct productions of his pencil cannot equal  it will always however be understood that such sketches must be examined also by an eye learned in the art and accustomed to picturesque ideas  an eye that can take up the halfformed images as the master leaves them give them a new creation and make up all that is not expressed from it is own storehouse  i shall however dwell no longer on imaginary sketching as it has but little relation to my present subject let me only add that although this essay is meant chiefly to assist the picturesque traveller in taking views from nature the method recommended as far as it relates to execution may equally be applied to imaginary sketches  your intention in taking views from nature may either be to fix them in your own memory  or to convey in some degree your ideas to others  with regard to the former when you meet a scene you wish to sketch your first consideration is to get it in the best point of view a few paces to the right or left make a great difference the ground which folds awkwardly here appears to fold more easily there and that long blank curtain of the castle which is so unpleasing a circumstance as you stand on one side is agreeably broken by a buttress on another  having thus fixed your point of view your next consideration is how to reduce it properly within the compass of your paper for the scale of nature being so very different from your scale it is a matter of difficulty without some experience to make them coincide if the landscape before you is extensive take care you do not include too much it may perhaps be divided more commodiously into two sketches  when you have fixed the portion of it you mean to take fix next on two or three principal points which you may just mark on your paper this will enable you the more easily to ascertain the relative situation of the several objects  in sketching blacklead is the first instrument commonly used nothing glides so volubly over paper and executes an idea so quickly  it has besides another advantage it is gray tint corresponds better with a wash than black or red chalk or any other pastile  it admits also of easy correction  the virtue of these hasty blacklead sketches consists in catching readily the characteristic features of a scene light and shade are not attended to it is enough if you express general shapes and the relations which the several intersections of a country bear to each other a few lines drawn on the spot will do this half a word says mr gray fixed on or near the spot is worth all our recollected ideas when we trust to the picture that objects draw of themselves on the mind we deceive ourselves without accurate and particular observation it is but illdrawn at first the outlines are soon blurred the colors every day grow fainter and at last when we would produce it to any body we are obliged to supply it is defects with a few strokes of our own imagination letter to mr palgrave p      to  what mr gray says relates chiefly to verbal description but in lineal description it is equally true the leading ideas must be fixed on the spot if left to the memory they soon evaporate  the lines of blacklead and indeed of any one instrument are subject to the great inconvenience of confounding distances if there are two or three distances in the landscape as each of them is expressed by the same kind of line the eye forgets the distinction even in half a days traveling and all is confusion to remedy this a few written references made on the spot are necessary if the landscape be at all complicated the traveller should be accurate in this point as the spirit of his view depends much on the proper observance of distances  at his first leisure however he will review his sketch add a few strokes with a pen to mark the near grounds and by a slight wash of indian ink throw in a few general lights and shades to keep all fixed and in it is place  a sketch need not be carried farther when it is intended merely to assist our own memory  but when a sketch is intended to convey in some degree our ideas to others it is necessary that it should be somewhat more adorned to us the scene familiar to our recollection may be suggested by a few rough strokes but if you wish to raise the idea where none existed before and to do it agreeably there should be some composition in your sketch  a degree of correctness and expression in the outline  and some effect of light a little ornament also from figures and other circumstances may be introduced in short it should be so far dressed as to give some idea of a picture i call this an adorned sketch and should sketch nothing that was not capable of being thus dressed an unpicturesque assemblage of objects and in general all untractable subjects if it be necessary to represent them may be given as plans rather than as pictures  in the first place i should advise the traveller by no means to work his adorned sketch upon his original one his first sketch is the standard to which in the absence of nature he must at least recur for his general ideas by going over it again the original ideas may be lost and the whole thrown into confusion great masters therefore always set a high value on their sketches from nature on the same principle the picturesque traveller preserves his original sketch tho in itself of little value to keep him within proper bounds  this matter being settled and the adorned sketch begun anew the first point is to fix the composition  but the composition you say is already fixed by the original sketch  it is true but still it may admit many little alterations by which the forms of objects may be assisted and yet the resemblance not disfigured as the same piece of music performed by different masters and graced variously by each may yet continue still the same we must ever recollect that nature is most defective in composition and must be a little assisted her ideas are too vast for picturesque use without the restraint of rules liberties however with truth must be taken with caution tho at the same time a distinction may be made between an object and a scene if i give the striking features of the castle or abbey which is my object i may be allowed some little liberty in bringing appendages which are not essential features within the rules of my art but in a scene the whole view becomes the portrait and if i flatter here i must flatter with delicacy  but whether i represent an object or a scene i hold myself at perfect liberty in the first place to dispose the foreground as i please restrained only by the analogy of the country i take up a tree here and plant it there i pare a knoll or make an addition to it i remove a piece of paling  a cottage  a wall  or any removeable object which i dislike in short i do not so much mean to exact a liberty of introducing what does not exist as of making a few of those simple variations of which all ground is easily susceptible and which time itself indeed is continually making all this my art exacts  she rules the foreground she can swell or sink it is surface here her leafy skreen oppose and there withdraw here part the varying greens and crowd them there in one promiscuous gloom as best befits the genius of the scene the foreground indeed is a mere spot compared with the extension of the distance in itself it is of trivial consequence and cannot well be called a feature of the scene and yet tho so little essential in giving a likeness it is more so than any other part in forming a composition it resembles those deep tones in music which give a value to all the lighter parts and harmonize the whole  as the foreground therefore is of so much consequence begin your adorned sketch with fixing this very material part it is easier to ascertain the situation of your foreground as it lies so near the bottom of your paper than any other part and this will tend to regulate every thing else in your rough sketch it has probably been inaccurately thrown in you could not so easily ascertain it till you had gotten all your landscape together you might have carried it too high on your paper or have brought it too low as you have now the general scheme of your landscape before you you may adjust it properly and give it it is due proportion  i shall add only on the subject of foregrounds that you need not be very nice in finishing them even when you mean to adorn your sketches in a finished picture the foreground is a matter of great nicety but in a sketch little more is necessary than to produce the effect you desire  having fixed your foreground you consider in the same way tho with more caution the other parts of your composition in a hasty transcript from nature it is sufficient to take the lines of the country just as you find them but in your adorned sketch you must grace them a little where they run false you must contrive to hide offensive parts with wood to cover such as are too bald with ushes and to remove little objects which in nature push themselves too much in sight and serve only to introduce too many parts into your composition in this happy adjustment the grand merit of your sketch consists no beauty of light coloring or execution can atone for the want of composition it is the foundation of all picturesque beauty no finery of dress can set off a person whose figure is awkward and uncouth  having thus digested the composition of your adorned sketch which is done with blacklead you proceed to give a stronger outline to the foreground and nearer parts some indeed use no outline but what they freely work with a brush on their blacklead sketch this comes nearest the idea of painting and as it is the most free it is perhaps also the most excellent method but as a blacklead outline is but a feeble termination it requires a greater force in the wash to produce an effect and of course more the hand of a master the hand of a master indeed produces an effect with the rudest materials but these precepts aim only at giving a few instructions to the tyroes of the art and such will perhaps make their outline the most effectually with a pen as the pen is more determined than blacklead it leaves less to the brush which i think the more difficult instrument  indian ink which may be heightened or lowered to any degree of strength or weakness so as to touch both the nearer and more distant grounds is the best ink you can use you may give a stroke with it so light as to confine even a remote distance tho such a distance is perhaps best left in blacklead  but when we speak of an outline we do not mean a simple contour which however necessary in a correct figure would in landscape be formal it is enough to mark with a few free touches of the pen here and there some of the breaks and roughnesses in which the richness of an object consists but you must first determine the situation of your lights that you may mark these touches on the shadowy side  of these free touches with a pen the chief characteristic is expression or the art of giving each object that peculiar touch whether smooth or rough which best expresses it is form the art of painting in it is highest perfection cannot give the richness of nature when we examine any natural form we find the multiplicity of it is parts beyond the highest finishing and indeed generally an attempt at the highest finishing would end in stiffness the painter is obliged therefore to deceive the eye by some natural tint or expressive touch from which the imagination takes it is cue how often do we see in the landscapes of claude the full effect of distance which when examined closely consists of a simple dash tinged with the hue of nature intermixed with a few expressive touches  if then these expressive touches are necessary where the master carries on the deception both in form and color how necessary must they be in mere sketches in which color the great vehicle of deception is removed  the art however of giving those expressive marks with a pen which impress ideas is no common one the inferior artist may give them by chance but the master only gives them with precision  yet a sketch may have it is use and even it is merit without these strokes of genius  as the difficulty of using the pen is such it may perhaps be objected that it is an improper instrument for a tyro it loses it is grace if it have not a ready and offhand execution  it is true but what other instrument shall we put into his hands that will do better his blacklead his brush whatever he touches will be unmasterly but my chief reason for putting a pen into his hands is that without a pen it will be difficult for him to preserve his outline and distances his touches with a pen may be unmasterly we allow but still they will preserve keeping in his landscape without which the whole will be a blot of confusion  nor is it perhaps so difficult to obtain some little freedom with a pen i have seen assiduity attended with but little genius make a considerable progress in the use of this instrument and produce an effect by no means displeasing  if the drawing be large i should recommend a reedpen which runs more freely over paper  when the outline is thus drawn it remains to add light and shade in this operation the effect of a wash is much better than of lines hatched with a pen a brush will do more in one stroke and generally more effectually than a pen can do in twenty i have seldom seen any drawings etched with a pen that pleased me the most masterly sketches in this way i ever saw were taken in the early part of the life of a gentleman now very high in his profession mr mitford of lincolns inn they were taken in several parts of italy and england and tho they are mere memorandumsketches the subjects are so happily chosen  they are so characteristic of the countries they represent  and executed with so free and expressive a touch that i examined them with pleasure not only as faithful portraits which i believe they all are but as masterpieces as far as they go both in composition and execution   for this purpose we need only indian ink and perhaps a little bistre or burnt umber with the former we give that greyish tinge which belongs to the sky and distant objects and with the latter mixed more or less with indian ink those warm touches which belong to the foreground indian ink however alone makes a good wash both for the foreground and distance  but mere light and shade are not sufficient something of effect also should be aimed at in the adorned sketch mere light and shade propose only the simple illumination of objects effect by balancing large masses of each gives the whole a greater force  now tho in the exhibitions of nature we commonly find only the simple illumination of objects yet as we often do meet with grand effects also we have sufficient authority to use them for under these circumstances we see nature in her best attire in which it is our business to describe her  as to giving rules for the production of effect the subject admits only the most general there must be a strong opposition of light and shade in which the sky as well as the landscape must combine but in what way this opposition must be varied  where the full tone of shade must prevail  where the full effusion of light  or where the various degrees of each  depends entirely on the circumstance of the composition all you can do is to examine your drawing yet in it is naked outline with care and endeavor to find out where the force of the light will have the best effect but this depends more on taste than on rule  one thing both in light and shade should be observed especially in the former  and that is gradation which gives a force beyond what a glaring display of light can give the effect of light which falls on the stone produced as an illustration of this idea would not be so great unless it graduated into shade  in the following stanza mr gray has with great beauty and propriety illustrated the vicissitudes of life by the principles of picturesque effect  still where rosy pleasure leads see a kindred grief pursue behind the steps which misery treads approaching comfort view the hues of bliss more brightly glow chastised by sabler tints of woe and blended form with artful strife the strength and harmony of life   i may farther add that the production of an effect is particularly necessary in drawing in painting color in some degree makes up the deficency but in simple clairobscure there is no succedaneum it is force depends on effect the virtue of which is such that it will give a value even to a barren subject like striking the chords of a musical instrument it will produce harmony without any richness of composition  it is farther to be observed that when objects are in shadow the light as it is then a reflected one falls on the opposite side to that on which it falls when they are enlightened  in adorning your sketch a figure or two may be introduced with propriety by figures i mean moving objects as wagons and boats as well as cattle and men but they should be introduced sparingly in profusion they are affected their chief use is to mark a road  to break a piece of foreground  to point out the horizon in a seaview  or to carry off the distance of retiring water by the contrast of a dark sail not quite so distant placed before it but in figures thus designed for the ornament of a sketch a few slight touches are sufficient attempts at finishing offend see the preceding essay   among trees little distinction need be made unless you introduce the pine or the cypress or some other singular form the oak the ash and the elm which bear a distant resemblance to each other may all be characterized alike in a sketch it is enough to mark a tree one distinction indeed is often necessary even in sketches and that is between fullleaved trees and those of straggling ramification in composition we have often occasion for both and therefore the hand should be used readily to execute either if we have a general idea of the oak for instance as a light tree and of the beech as a heavy one it is sufficient  it adds i think to the beauty of a sketch to stain the paper slightly with a reddish or yellowish tinge the use of which is to give a more pleasing tint to the ground of the drawing by taking away the glare of the paper it adds also if it be not too strong a degree of harmony to the rawness of black and white this tinge may be laid on either before or after the drawing is made in general i should prefer the latter method because while the drawing is yet on white paper you may correct it with a sponge dipped in water which will in a good degree efface indian ink but if you rub out any part after the drawing is stained you cannot easily lay the stain again upon the rubbed part without the appearance of a patch  some choose rather to add a little color to their sketches my instructions attempt not the art of mixing a variety of tints and finishing a drawing from nature which is generally executed in colors from the beginning without any use of indian ink except as a gray tint uniting with other colors this indeed when chastely executed which is not often the case exceeds in beauty every other species of drawing it is however beyond my skill to give any instruction for this mode of drawing all i mean is only to offer a modest way of tinting a sketch already finished in indian ink by the addition of a little color i mean only to give some distinction to objects and introduce rather a gayer style into a landscape  when you have finished your sketch therefore with indian ink as far as you propose tinge the whole over with some light horizon hue it may be the rosy tint of morning or the more ruddy one of evening or it may incline more to a yellowish or a greyish cast as a specimen an evening hue is given the first tint you spread over your drawing is composed of light red and oker which make an orange it may incline to one or the other as you choose in this example it inclines rather to the former by washing this tint over your whole drawing you lay a foundation for harmony when this wash is nearly dry repeat it in the horizon softening it off into the sky as you ascend  take next a purple tint composed of lake and blue inclining rather to the former and with this when your first wash is dry form your clouds and then spread it as you did the first tint over your whole drawing except where you leave the horizontint this still strengthens the idea of harmony your sky and distance are now finished  you proceed next to your middle and foregrounds in both which you distinguish between the soil and the vegetation wash the middle grounds with a little umber this will be sufficient for the soil the soil of the foreground you may go over with a little light red the vegetation of each may be washed with a green composed of blue and oker adding a little more oker as you proceed nearer the eye and on the nearest grounds a little burnt terra sienna this is sufficient for the middle grounds the foreground may farther want a little heightening both in the soil and vegetation in the soil it may be given in the lights with burnt terra sienna mixing in the shadows a little lake and in the vegetation with gallstone touched in places and occasionally varied with a little burnt terra sienna  trees on the foreground are considered as a part of it and their foliage may be colored like the vegetation in their neighborhood their stems may be touched with burnt terra sienna  trees in middle distances are darker than the lawns on which they stand they must therefore be touched twice over with the tint which is given only once to the lawn  if you represent clouds with bright edges the edges must be left in the first orange while the tint over the other part of the horizon is repeated as was mentioned before  a lowering cloudy sky is represented by what is called a gray tint composed of lake blue and oker as the shadow deepens the tint should incline more to blue  the several tints mentioned in the above process may perhaps the most easily be mixed before you begin especially if your drawing be large rub the raw colors in little saucers keep them clean and distinct and from them mix your tints in other little vessels  i shall only add that the strength of the coloring you give your sketch must depend on the height to which you have carried the indian ink finishing if it be only a slight sketch it will bear only a light wash of color  this mode however of tinting a drawing even when you tint it as high as these instructions reach is by no means calculated to produce any great effect of coloring but it is at least sufficient to preserve harmony this you may preserve an effect of coloring you cannot easily attain it is something however to avoid a disagreeable excess and there is nothing surely so disagreeable to a correct eye as a tinted drawing such as we often see in which greens and blues and reds and yellows are daubed without any attention to harmony it is to the picturesque eye what a discord of harsh notes is to a musical ear  but the advocate for these glaring tints may perhaps say he does not make his sky more blue than nature nor his grass and trees more green  perhaps so but unless he could work up his drawing with the finishing of nature he will find the effect very unequal nature mixes a variety of semitints with her brightest colors and tho the eye cannot readily separate them they have a general chastizing effect and keep the several tints of landscape within proper bounds which a glare of deep colors cannot do besides this chastizing hue is produced in nature by numberless little shadows beyond the attention of art which she throws on leaves and piles of grass and every other minute object all which tho not easily distinguished in particulars tells in the whole and is continually chastening the hues of nature  before i conclude these remarks on sketching it may be useful to add a few words and but a few on perspective the nicer parts of it contain many difficulties and are of little use in common landscape but as a building now and then occurs which requires some little knowledge of perspective the subject should not be left wholly untouched  if a building stand exactly in front none of it is lines can go off in perspective but if it stand with a corner to the eye as picturesque buildings commonly do it is lines will appear to recede in what manner they recede the following mechanical method may explain  hold horizontally between your eye and the building you draw a flat ruler till you see only the edge of it where it cuts the nearest perpendicular of the building which you have already just traced on your paper make a mark and draw a slight line through that part parallel with the bottom of your paper this is called the horizontal line and regulates the whole perspective observe next the angle which the uppermost of these receding lines makes with the nearest perpendicular of the building and continue that receding line till it meet the horizontal line from the point where it intersects draw another line to the bottom of the nearest perpendicular this gives you the perspective of the base in the same manner all the lines which recede on both sides of the building as well above as below the horizontal line  windows doors and projections of every kind on the same plane  are regulated the points on the horizontal line in which these receding lines unite are called points of sight  after all however from the mode of sketching here recommended which is as far as i should wish to recommend drawing landscape to those who draw only for amusement no great degree of accuracy can be expected general ideas only must be looked for not the peculiarities of portrait it admits the winding river  the shooting promontory  the castle  the abbey  the flat distance  and the mountain melting into the horizon it admits too the relation which all these parts bear to each other but it descends not to the minutiae of objects the fringed bank of the river  the gothic ornaments of the abbey  the chasms and fractures of the rock and castle  and every little object along the vale it pretends not to delineate with exactness all this is the province of the finished drawing and the picture in which the artist conveys an idea of each minute feature of the country he delineates or imagines but high finishing as i have before observed belongs only to a master who can give expressive touches the disciple whom i am instructing and whom i instruct only from my own experience must have humbler views and can hardly expect to please if he go farther than a sketch adorned as has been here described  many gentlemen who draw for amusement employ their leisure on human figures animal life portrait perhaps history here and there a man of genius makes some proficiency in these difficult branches of the art but i have rarely seen any who do distorted faces and dislocated limbs i have seen in abundance and no wonder for the science of anatomy even as it regards painting is with difficulty attained and few who have studied it their whole lives have acquired perfection  others again who draw for amusement go so far as to handle the pallet but in this the success of the illjudging artist seldom answers his hopes unless utterly void of taste he happen to be such an artist as may be addressed in the sarcasm of the critic  sine rivali teque et tua solus amares painting is both a science and an art and if so very few attain perfection who spend a lifetime on it what can be expected from those who spend only their leisure the very few gentlemenartists who excel in painting scarce afford encouragement for common practice  but the art of sketching landscape is attainable by a man of business and it is certainly more useful and i should imagine more amusing to attain some degree of excellence in an inferior branch than to be a mere bungler in a superior even if you should not excel in execution which indeed you can hardly expect you may at least by bringing home the delineation of a fine country dignify an indifferent sketch you may please yourself by administering strongly to recollection and you may please others by conveying your ideas more distinctly in an ordinary sketch than in the best language  the end contents of the following poem line   introduction and address line    a close attention to the various scenes of nature recommended and to the several circumstances under which they appear line    a facility also in copying the different parts of nature should be attained before the young artist attempts a whole line  0 this process will also be a kind of test no one can make any progress whose imagination is not fired with the scenes of nature line  0  on a supposition that the artist is enamoured with his subject and is well versed in copying the parts of nature he begins to combine and form those parts into the subjects of landscape he pays his first attention to design or to the bringing together of such objects as are suited to his subject not mixing trivial objects with grand scenes but preserving the character of his subject whatever it may be line     the different parts of his landscape must next be studiously arranged and put together in a picturesque manner this is the work of disposition or as it is sometimes called composition no rules can be given for this arrangement but the experience of a nice eye for tho nature seldom presents a complete composition yet we every where see in her works beautiful arrangements of parts which we ought to study with great attention line     in general a landscape is composed of three parts  a foreground  a middle ground  and a distance line     yet this is not a universal rule a balance of parts however there should always be tho sometimes those parts may be few line     it is a great error in landscapepainters to lose the simplicity of a whole under the idea of giving variety line     some particular scene therefore or leading subject should always be chosen to which the parts should be subservient line     in balancing a landscape a spacious foreground will admit a small thread of distance but the reverse is a bad proportion in every landscape there must be a considerable foreground line  0  this theory is illustrated by the view of a disproportioned distance line     an objection answered why vast distances tho unsupported by foregrounds may please in nature and yet offend in representation line     but tho the several parts of landscape may be well balanced and adjusted yet still without contrast in the parts there will be a great deficiency at the same time this contrast must be easy and natural line     such pictures as are painted from fancy are the most pleasing efforts of genius but if an untoward subject be given the artist must endeavor to conceal and vary the unaccommodating parts the foreground he must claim as his own line     but if nature be the source of all beauty it may be objected that imaginary views can have little merit the objection has weight if the imaginary view be not formed from the selected parts of nature but if it be it is nature still line     the artist having thus adjusted his forms and disposition conceives next the best effect of light and when he has thus laid the foundation of his picture proceeds to coloring line     the author avoids giving rules for coloring which are learned chiefly by practice line     he just touches on the theory of colors line     artists with equally good effect sometimes blend them on their pallet and sometimes spread them raw on their canvas line     in coloring the sky gives the ruling tint to the landscape and the hue of the whole whether rich or sober must be harmonious line  0  a predominancy of shade has the best effect line     but light tho it should not be scattered should not be collected as it were into a focus line     the effect of gradation illustrated by the coloring of cattle line     of the disposition of light line     of the general harmony of the whole line     a method proposed of examining a picture with regard to it is general harmony line     the scientific part being closed all that can be said with regard to execution is that as there are various modes of it every artist ought to adopt his own or else he becomes a servile imitator on the whole the bold free method recommended which aims at giving the character of objects rather than the minute detail line     rules given with regard to figures history in miniature introduced in landscape condemned figures should be suited to the scene line  00

genius fire thee if thy heart glow palpitate with transport at the fight if emulation seize thee to transfuse these splendid visions on thy vivid chart if the big thought seem more than art can paint haste snatch thy pencil bounteous nature yields to thee her choicest stores and the glad muse sits by assistant aiming but to fan the promethean flame conscious her rules can only guide not give the warmth divine first learn with objects suited to each scene thy landscape to adorn if some rude view thy pencil culls of lake or mountain range where nature walks with proud majestic step give not her robe the formal folds of art but bid it flow with ample dignity mix not the mean and trivial is the whole sublime let each accordant part be grand yet if through dire necessity for that alone should force the deed some polished scene employ thy pallet dressed by human art the lawn so level and the bank so trim yet still preserve thy subject let the oak be elegant of form that mantles over thy shaven foreground the rough forester whose peeled and withered boughs and knarled trunk have stood the rage of many a winters blast might ill such cultured scenes adorn not less would an old briton rough with martial scars and bearing stern defiance on his brow seem fitly stationed at a gallic feast this choice of objects suited to the scene we name design a choice not more required from raffael than from thee whether his hand give all but motion to some group divine or thine inglorious picture woods and streams with equal rigor disposition claims thy close attention would thou learn its laws examine nature when combined with art or simple mark how various are her forms mountains enormous rugged rocks clear lakes castles and bridges aqueducts and fanes of these observe how some united please while others illcombind disgust the eye that principle which rules these various parts and harmonizing all produces one is disposition by its plastic power those rough materials which design selects are nicely balanced thus with friendly aid these principles unite design presents the general subject disposition culls and recombines the various forms anew yet here true taste to three distinguished parts confines her aim brought nearest to the eye she forms her foregrounds then the midway space ever the blue distance melt in liquid air but though full often these parts with blending tints are softened so as wakes a frequent doubt where each begins where ends yet still she keeps a general balance so when europes sons sound the alarm of war some potent hand now thine again my albion poises true the scale of empire curbs each rival power and checks each lawless tyrants wild career not but there are of fewer parts who plan a pleasing picture these a forestglade suffices often behind which just removed one tuft of foliage waterlo like thine gives all we wish of dear variety for even variety itself may pall if to the eye when pausing with delight on one fair object it presents a mass of many which disturb that eyes repose all hail simplicity to thy chaste shrine beyond all other let the artist bow often have i seen arrangd by hands that well could pencil natures parts landscapes that knew no leading subject here a forest rose a river there ran dimpling and beyond the portion of a lake while rocks and towers and castles intermixed spread over the whole in multiform confusion ancient dames thus often compose of various silken shreds some gaudy patched unmeaning tawdry thing where bucks and cherries ships and flowers unite in one rich compound of absurdity choose then some principal commanding theme be it lake valley winding stream cascade castle or seaport and on that exhaust thy powers and make to that all else conform who paints a landscape is confined by rules as fixed and rigid as the tragic bard to unity of subject is the scene a forest nothing there save woods and lawns must rise conspicuous episodes of hills and lakes be far removed all that obtrudes on the chief theme how beautiful soever seen as a part disgusts us in the whole thus in the realms of landscape to preserve proportion just is dispositions task and though a glance of distance it allows even when the foreground swells upon the sight yet if the distant scenry wide extend the foreground must be ample take free scope art must have space to stand on like the sage who boasted power to shake the solid globe this thou must claim and if thy distance spread profuse must claim it amply uncombind with foreground distance loses power to please where rising from the solid rock appear those ancient battlements there lived a knight that often surveying from his castle wall the wide expanse before him distance vast interminable wilds savannahs deep dark woods and village spires and glittering streams just twinkling in the sunbeam wished the view transferrd to canvass and for that sage end led some obedient son of art to where his own unerring taste had previous fixed the point of amplest prospect take thy stand just here he cried and paint me all thou see omit no single object it was done and soon the livelong landscape clothes his hall and spreads from base to ceiling all was there as to his guests while dinner cooled the knight full often would prove and with uplifted cane point to the distant spire where slept entombed his ancestry beyond where lay the town skirted with wood that gave him place and voice in britains senate nor untracd the stream that fed the goodly trout they soon should taste nor every scattered seat of friend or foe he calls his neighbors heedless he meanwhile that what he deems the triumph of his taste is but a painted survey a mere map which light and shade and perspective misplaced but serve to spoil yet why methinks i hear some critic say do ample scenes like this in picture fail to please when every eye confesses they transport on natures chart why but because where she displays the scene the roving sight can pause and swift select from all she offers parts whereon to six and form distinct perceptions each of these producing separate pictures and as bees condense within their hives the varying sweets so does the eye a lovely whole collect from parts disjointed nay perhaps deformed then deem not art defective which divides rejects or recombines but rather say it is her chief excellence there is we know a charm unspeakable in converse free of lover or of friend when soul with soul mixes in social intercourse when choice of phrase and rules of rhetric are disdained yet say adopted by the tragic bard if jaffier thus with belvidera talked so vague so rudely would not want of skill selection and arrangement damn the scene thy forms though balanced still perchance may want the charm of contrast sing we then its power it is beautys surest source it regulates shape color light and shade forms every line by opposition just whatever is rough with skill delusive counteracts by smooth sinuous or concave by its opposite yet ever covertly should art appear that art were affectation then alone we own the power of contrast when the lines unite with natures freedom then alone when from its careless touch each part receives a pleasing form the lakes contracted bounds by contrast varied elegantly flow the unwieldy mountain sinks here to remove offensive parallels the hill deprest is lifted there the heavy beech expunged gives place to airy pines if two bare knolls rise to the right and left a castle here and there a wood diversify their form thrice happy he who always can indulge this pleasing feast of fancy who replete with rich ideas can arrange their charms as his own genius prompts and plan and paint a novel whole but tasteless wealth often claims the faithful portrait and will fix the scene where natures lines run falsely or refuse to harmonize artist if thus employed i pity thy mischance yet there are means even here to hide defects the human form portrayed by reynolds often abounds with grace he saw not in his model which nor hurts resemblance nor fictitious skill betrays why then if over the limb uncouth he flings the flowing vest may not thy honest art veil with the foliage of some spreading tree unpleasing objects or remote or near an ample license for such needful change the foregrounds give thee there both mend and make whoever opposes tell them it is the spot where fancy needs must sport where if restrained to close resemblance thy best art expires what if they plead that from thy general rule that rests on nature as the only source of beauty thou revoltst tell them that rule thou holdst still sacred nature is its source yet natures parts fail to receive alike the fair impression view her varied range each form that charms is there yet her best forms must be selected as the sculptured charms of the famed venus grew so must thou cull from various scenes such parts as best create one perfect whole if nature never arrayed her most accomplished work with grace complete think will she waste on desert rocks and dells what she denies to womans charming form and now if on review thy chalked design brought into form by dispositions aid displease not trace thy lines with pencil free add lightly too that general mass of shade which suits the form and fashion of its parts there are who studious of the best effects first sketch a slight cartoon such previous care is needful where the artists fancy fails precisely to foresee the future whole this done prepare thy pallet mix thy tints and call on chaste simplicity again to save her votary from whateever of hue discordant or abrupt may flaunt or glare yet here to bring materials from the mine from animal or vegetable dies and sing their various properties and powers the muse descends not to mechanic rules to prose and practice which can only teach the use of pigments she resigns the toil one truth she gives that natures simple loom weaves but with three distinct or mingled hues the vest that clothes creation these are red azure and yellow pure and unstained white if color deemed rejects her general law and is by her rejected do thou deem the glossy surface of yon heifers coat a perfect white or yon vast heaving cloud that climbs the distant hill with ceruse bright attempt to catch its tint and thou will fail some tinge of purple or some yellowish brown must first be blended ever thy toil succeed pure white great nature wishes to expunge from all her works and only then admits when with her mantle broad of fleecy snow she wraps them to secure from chilling frost conscious mean while that what she gives to guard conceals their every charm the stole of night not more eclipses yet that sable stole may by the skilful mixture of these hues be shadowed even to dark cimmerian gloom draw then from these as from three plenteous springs thy brown thy purple crimson orange green nor load thy pallet with a useless tribe of pigments when commixd with needful white as suits thy end these native three suffice but if thou do still cautious keep in view that harmony which these alone can give yet still there are who scorning all the rules of dull mechanic art with random hand fling their unblended colors and produce bolder effects by oppositions aid the sky whatever its hue to landscape gives a correspondent tinge the morning ray spreads it with purple light in dewdrops steeped the evening fires it with a crimson glow blows the bleak north it sheds a cold blue tint on all it touches do light mists prevail a soft gray hue oerspreads the general scene and makes that scene like beauty viewed through gauze more delicately lovely choose thy sky but let that sky whatever the tint it takes oerrule thy pallet frequent have i seen in landscapes well composed aerial hues so illpreservd that whether cold or heat tempest or calm prevailed was dubious all not so thy pencil claude the season marks thou make us pant beneath thy summer noon and shiver in thy cool autumnal eve such are the powers of sky and therefore art selects what best is suited to the scenes it means to form to this adapts a morn to that an evening ray light mists full often give mountainviews an added dignity while tame impoverished scenery claims the force of splendid lights and shades nor claims in vain thy sky adjusted all that is remote first color faintly leaving to the last thy foreground easier it is thou know to spread thy floating foliage over the sky than mix that sky amid the branches venture still on warmer tints as distances approach nearer the eye nor fear the richest hues if to those hues thou givst the meet support of strong opposing shade a canvas once i saw on which the artist dared to paint a scene in indostan where gold and pearl barbaric flamed on many a broiderd vest profusely splendid yet chaste art was there opposing hue to hue each shadow deep so spread that all with sweet accord produced a bright yet modest whole thus blend thy tints be they of scarlet orange green or gold harmonious till one general glow prevail unbroken by abrupt and hostile glare let shade predominate it makes each light more lucid yet destroys offensive glare mark when in fleecy showers of snow the clouds seem to descend and whiten over the land what unsubstantial unity of tinge involves each prospect vision is absorbed or wandering through the void finds not a point to rest on all is mockery to the eye thus light diffused debases that effect which shade improves behold what glorious scenes arise through natures works from shade yon lake with all its circumambient woods far less would charm the eye did not the dusky mist creeping along its eastern shores ascend those towering cliffs mix with the ruddy beam of opening day just damp its fires and spread over all the scene a sweet obscurity but would thou see the full effect of shade well massd at eve mark that upheaving cloud which charged with all the artillery of jove in awful darkness marching from the east ascends see how it blots the sky and spreads darker and darker still its dusky veil till from the east to west the cope of heaven it curtains closely round happily thou standst expectant of the loud convulsive burst when lo the sun just sinking in the west pours from the horizons verge a splendid ray which tenfold grandeur to the darkness adds far to the east the radiance shoots just tips those tufted groves but all its splendor pours on yonder castled cliff which chiefly owes its glory and supreme effect to shade thus light enforced by shadow spreads a ray still brighter yet forbid that light to shine a glittering speck for this were to illume thy picture as the unequal glass collects all to one dazzling point the solar rays whatever the force of opposition still in soft gradation equal beauty lies when the mild luster glides from light to dark the eye wellpleased pursues it mid the herds of variegated hue that graze our lawns often may the artist trace examples just of this sedate effect and often remark its opposite behold yon lordly bull his sable head his lighter shoulders tinged with flakes of brown at length still lighter tints prevailing graduate over his flank and loins in tawny orange what if on his front a star of white appear the general mass of color spreads unbroken and the mark gives his stern front peculiar character ah how degenerate from her wellcloathd sire that heifer see her sides with white and black so studded so distinct each justling each the groundworkcolour hardly can be known of lights if more than two thy landscape boast it boasts too much but if two lights be there give one preeminence with that be sure illume thy foreground or thy midway space but rarely spread it on the distant scene yet there if level plains or fens appear and meet the sky a lengthened gleam of light discreetly thrown will vary the flat scene but if that distance be abruptly closed by mountains cast them into total shade ill suit gay robes their hoary majesty sober be all their hues except perchance approaching nearer in the midway space one of the giantbrethren tower sublime to him thy art may aptly give a gleam of radiance twill befit his awful head alike when rising through the morningdews in misty dignity the pale wan ray invests him or when beaming from the west a fiercer splendor opens to our view all his terrific features rugged cliffs and yawning chasms which vapors through the day had veiled dens where the lynx or pard might dwell in noontide safety meditating there his next nocturnal ravage through the land are now thy lights and shades adjusted all yet pause perhaps the perspective is just perhaps each local hue is duly placed perhaps the light offends not harmony

observation justly formed on natures best examples and effects approve thy landscape if judicious lock see not an error he would wish removed then boldly deem thyself the heir of fame notes on the foregoing poem line    some perhaps may object to the word glimmering but whoever has observed the playing lights and colors which often invest the summits of mountains will not think the epithet improper line    what it is leading feature that is the particular character of the tree the different shape of the leaves and the different mode of spreading it is branches give every tree a distinct form or character at a little distance you easily distinguish the oak from the ash and the ash from the beech it is this general form not any particular detail which the artist is instructed to get by heart the same remark holds with regard to other parts of nature these general forms may be called the painters alphabet by these he learns to read her works and also to make them intelligible to others line    with light of curling foam contrasted the progress of each wave is this beneath the frothy curl when it rises between the eye and the light the color is pale green which brightens from the base toward the summit when a wave subsides the summit falling into the base extends and raises it and the sides running off from the center that part of the water which meets the succeeding wave springs upward from the shock the top forms into foam and rolling over falls down the side which has been shocked presenting if the water be much agitated the idea of a cascade line    the eveningshadow less opaquely falls it is not often observed by landscapepainters tho it certainly deserves observation that the morningshadows are darker than those of the evening line  0  if the big thought seem more than art can paint it is always a sign of genius to be dissatisfied with our own efforts and to conceive more than we can express line     design presents the general subject disposition etc some writers on the art of painting have varied this division but it seems most proper i think to give the selection of the elements of landscape  the assembling of rocks mountains cataracts and other objects to design while disposition is properly employed in the local arrangement of them line     the general composition of a landscape consists of three parts  the foreground  the second ground  and the distance no rule can be given for proportioning these parts to each other there are ten thousand beautiful proportions from which the eye of taste must select a good one the foreground must always be considerable  in some cases ample it is the very basis and foundation of the whole  nor is it a bad rule i think that some part of the foreground should be the highest part of the picture in rocky and mountainous views this is easy and has generally a good effect and sometimes even when a country is more level a tree on the foreground carried higher than the rest of the landscape answers the end at the same time in many species of landscape this rule cannot easily be adapted nor is it by any means essential line     waterlo like thine the subjects of this master seldom went beyond some little forestview he has etched a great number of prints in this style of landscape which for the beauty of the trees in particular are much admired line     landscapes that knew no leading subject there is not a rule in landscapepainting more neglected or that ought more to be observed than what relates to a leadingsubject by the leading subject we mean what characterizes the scene we often see a landscape which comes under no denomination is it the scenery about a ruin is it a lakescene is it a riverscene no but it is a jumble of all together some leading subject therefore is required in every landscape which forms it is character and to which the painter  is confined by rules as fixed and rigid as the tragic bard when the landscape takes it is character from a ruin or other object on the foreground the distance introduced is merely an appendage and must plainly appear to be an underpart not interfering with the subject of the piece but most commonly the scene or leadingsubject of the picture occupies the middle distance in this case the foreground becomes the appendage and without any striking object to attract the eye must plainly show that it is intended only to introduce the leadingsubject with more advantage line   0 thus in a forestscene the woods and lawns are the leadingsubject if the piece will admit it a hill or a lake may be admitted in remote distance but they must be introduced only as the episodes in a poem to set off the main subject they must not interfere with it but be far removed line     and tho a glance it is certain in fact that a considerable foreground with a glance of distance will make a better picture than a wide distance set off only with a meagre foreground and yet i doubt whether an adequate reason can be given unless it be founded on what has already been advanced that we consider the foreground as the basis and foundation of the whole picture so that if it is not considerable in all circumstances and extensive in some there seems a defect line   0 a novel whole the imaginaryview formed on a judicious selection and arrangement of the parts of nature has a better chance of making a good picture than a view taken in the whole from any natural scene not only the lines and objects of the natural scene rarely admit a happy composition but the character of it is seldom throughout preserved whether it be sublime or beautiful there is generally something mixed with it of a nature unsuitable to it all this the exhibition of fancy rectifies when in the hands of a master nor does he claim any thing but what the poet and he are equally allowed where is the story in real life on which the poet can form either an epic or a drama unless heightened by his imagination at the same time he must take care that all his imaginary additions are founded in nature or his work will disgust such also must be the painters care but under this restriction he certainly may bring together a more consistent whole culled from the various parts of nature than nature herself exhibits in any one scene line     trace thy lines with pencil free the master is discovered even in his chalk or blacklead lines  so free firm and intelligent we often admire these first rude touches the story of the two old masters will be remembered who left cards of compliments to each other on which only the simple outline of a figure was drawn by one and corrected by the other but with such a superior elegance in each that the signature of names could not have marked them more decisively line     first sketch a slight cartoon it is the practice indeed of the generality of painters when they have any great design to execute to make a slight sketch sometimes on paper and sometimes on canvas and these sketches are often greatly superior to the principal picture which has been labored and finished with the exactest care king william on horseback at hampton court by sir godfrey kneller is a striking example of this remark the picture is highly finished but is a tame and unmasterly performance at houghtonhall i have seen the original sketch of this picture which i should have valued not only greatly beyond the picture itself but beyond any thing i ever saw from the pencil of sir godfrey line     one truth she gives etc from these three virgin colors red blue and yellow all the tints of nature are composed greens of various hues are composed of blue and yellow orange of red and yellow purple and violet of red and blue the tints of the rainbow seem to be composed also of these colors they lie in order thus violet  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  violet  red in which assortment we observe that orange comes between red and yellow that is it is composed of those colors melting into each other green is in the same way composed of yellow and blue and violet or purple of blue and red  nay even browns of all kinds may in a degree be effected by a mixture of these original colors so may gray and even a kind of black tho not a perfect one  as all pigments however are deficient and cannot approach the rainbow colors which are the purest we know the painter must often even in his splendid tints call in different reds blues and yellows thus as vermilion tho an excellent red on many occasions cannot give the rosy crimson hue he must often call in lake nor will he find any yellow or blue that will answer every purpose in the tribe of browns he will be still more at a loss and must have recourse to different earths  in oilpainting one of the finest earths is known at the colourshops by the name of castleearth or vandykesbrown as it is supposed to have been used by that master line     and is by her rejected scarce any natural object but snow is purely white the chalkcliff is generally in a degree discolored the petals of the snowdrop indeed and of some other flowers are purely white but seldom any of the larger parts of nature line     keep in view that harmony etc tho it will be necessary to use other colors besides yellow red and blue this union should however still be kept in view as the leading principle of harmony a mixture indeed of these three will produce nearly the color you want but the more colors are mixed the muddier they grow it will give more clearness therefore and brightness to your coloring to use simple pigments of which there are great abundance in the painters dispensatory line     this mode of coloring is the most difficult to attain as it is the most scientific it includes a perfect knowledge of the effects of colors in all their various agreements and oppositions when attained it is the most easy in practice the artist who blends his colors on his pallet depends more on his eye than on his knowledge he works out his effect by a more labored process and yet he may produce a good picture in the end line   0 nobody was better acquainted with the effects of sky nor studied them with more attention than the younger vanderveldt not many years ago an old thameswaterman was alive who remembered him well and had often carried him out in his boat both up and down the river to study the appearances of the sky the old man used to say they went out in all kinds of weather fair and foul and mr vanderveldt took with him large sheets of blue paper which he would mark all over with black and white the artist easily sees the intention of this process these expeditions vanderveldt called in his dutch manner of speaking going a skoying line  0  the most remarkable instance of ingenious coloring i ever heard of is in guidos st michael the whole picture is composed of blue red and black by means of which colors the ideas of heaven and hell are blended together in a very extraordinary manner and the effect exceedingly sublime while both harmony and chasteness are preserved in the highest degree line  0  let shade predominate as a general rule the halftints should have more extent than the lights and the shadows should equal both put together  yet why a predominancy of shade should please the eye more than a predominancy of light would perhaps be difficult to explain i can easily conceive that a balance of light and shade may be founded in some kind of reason but am at a loss to give a reason for a predominancy of either the fact however is undoubted and we must skreen our ignorance of the principle as well as we can line   0 this rule respects an affected display of light if it be introduced as a focus so as not to fall naturally on the several objects it touches it disgusts rembrandt i doubt is sometimes chargeable with this fault he is commonly supposed to be a master of this part of painting and we often see very beautiful lights in his pictures and prints but as in many of them we see the reverse he appears to have had no fixed principle indeed few parts of painting are so much neglected so easily transgressed and so little understood as the distribution of light line     opposition and gradation are the two grand means of producing effect by light in the picture just given l     etc of the eveningray the effect is produced by opposition beautiful effects too of the same kind arise often from catching lights  the power of producing effect by gradation is not less forcible indeed without a degree of gradation opposition itself would be mute in the picture just given of the eveningray the grand part of the effect no doubt arises from the opposition between the gloom and the light but in part it arises also from the gradation of the light till it reach it is point it just tips the tufted groves but all it is splendour pours on yonder castled cliff  line     the colors of animals often strongly illustrate the idea of gradation when they soften into each other from light to dark or from one color into another the mixture is very picturesque it is as much the reverse when white and black or white and red are patched over the animal in blotches without any intermediate tints domestic cattle cows dogs swine goats and cats are often disagreeably patched tho we sometimes see them pleasingly colored with a graduating tint wild animals in general are more uniformly colored than tame except the zebra and two or three of the spotted race i recollect none which are not more or less tinted in this graduating manner the tiger the panther and other variegated animals have their beauty but the zebra i think is rather a curious than a picturesque animal it is streaked sides injure it both in point of color and in the delineation of it is form line     but rarely spread it on the distant scene in general perhaps a landscape is best enlightened when the light falls on the middle parts of the picture and the foreground is in shadow this throws a kind of natural retiring hue throughout the landscape and tho the distance be in shadow yet that shadow is so faint that the retiring hue is still preserved this however is only a general rule in historypainting the light is properly thrown upon the figures on the foreground which are the capital part of the picture in landscape the middle grounds commonly form the scene or the capital part and the foreground is litttle more than an appendage sometimes however it happens that a ruin or some other capital object on the foreground makes the principal part of the scene when that is the case it should be distinguished by light unless it be so situated as to receive more distinction from shade line     a fiercer splendour opens to our view all his terrific features it is very amusing in mountainous countries to observe the appearance which the same mountain often makes under different circumstances when it is invested with light mists or even when it is not illumined we see it is whole summit perhaps under one gray tint but as it receives the sun especially an eveningsun we see a variety of fractures and chasms gradually opening of which we discovered not the least appearance before line     tho the objects may lessen in due proportion which is called keeping tho the graduating hue of retiring objects or the aerial perspective may be just and tho the light may be distributed according to the rules of art yet still there may not be that general result of harmony which denotes the picture one object and as the eye may be misled when it has the several parts before it the best way of examining it as a perfect whole is to examine it in such a light as will not admit the investigation of parts line     others etc some painters copy exactly what they see in this there is more mechanical precision than genius others take a general comprehensive view of their object and marking just the characteristic points lead the spectator if he be a man of taste and genius likewise into a truer knowledge of it than the copier can do with all his painful exactness line     why then degrade etc if by bringing the figures forward on the foreground you give room for character and expression you put them out of place as appendages for which they were intended line     often slowly winding etc the machine itself here described is picturesque and when it is seen in winding motion or in other words when half of it is seen in perspective it receives additional beauty from contrast in the same manner a cavalcade or an army on it is march may be considered as one object and derive beauty from the same source mr gray has given us a very picturesque view of this kind in describing the march of edward i as down the steep of snowdons shaggy side he wound with toilsome march his long array stout gloucester stood aghast in speechless trance to arms cried mortimer and couched his quivering lance through a passage in the mountain we see the troops winding round at a great distance among those nearer the eye we distinguish the horse and foot and on the foreground the action and expression of the principal commanders the ancients seem to have known very little of that source of the picturesque which arises from perspective every thing is introduced in front before the eye and among the early painters we see very little more attention paid to it raphael is far from making a full use of the knowledge of it and i believe julio romano makes still less i do not remember meeting any where with a more picturesque description of a line of march than in vaillants travels into the interior parts of africa he was passing with a numerous caravan along the borders of caffraria i first says he made the people of the hord which accompanied me set out with their cattle and a little after my cattle followed cows sheep and goats with all the women of the hord mounted on oxen with their children my wagons with the rest of my people closed the rear i myself mounted on horseback rode backwards and forewards this caravan on it is march exhibited often a singular and amusing spectacle the turns it was obliged to make in following the windings of the woods and rocks continually gave it new forms sometimes it entirely disappeared then suddenly at a distance from the summit of a hill i again discovered my vanguard slowly advancing perhaps toward a distant mountain while the main body following the track were just below me line     this rule indeed applies to all other objects but as the ship is so large a machine and at the same time so complicated a one it is character is less obvious than that of most other objects it is much better therefore where a vessel is necessary to put in a few touches for a skiff than to insert some disagreeable form for a ship to which it has no resemblance at the same time it is not at all necessary to make your ship so accurate that a seaman could find no fault with it it is the same in figures as appendages of landscape there is no necessity to have them exactly accurate but if they have not the general form and character of what they represent the landscape is better without them line  0  they seem etc rapid motion alone and that near the eye is here censured we should be careful not to narrow too much the circumscribed sphere of art there is an art of seeing as well as of painting the eye must in part enter into the deception the art of painting must in some degree be considered as an act of convention general forms only are imitated and much is to be supplied by the imagination of the spectator  it is thus in drama how absurdly would the spectator act if instead of assisting the illusion of the stage he should insist on being deceived without being a party in the deception  if he refused to believe that the light he saw was the sun or the scene before him the roman capital because he knew the one was a candlelight and the other a painted cloth the painter therefore must in many things suppose deception and only avoid it where it is too palpably gross for the eye to suffer line     guidos air no doubt is often very pleasing he is thought to have excelled in imagining the angelic character and as if aware of this superiority was fond of painting angels after all however they whose taste is formed on the simplicity of the antique think guidos air in general somewhat theatrical line     skilful they etc the greatest obstruction to the progress of art arises from the prejudices of conceited judges who in fact know less about the matter than they who know nothing inasmuch as truth is less obvious to error than it is to ignorance till they can be prevailed on to return upon their steps and look for that criterion in nature which they seek in the halfperished works of great names the painter will be discouraged from pursuing knowledge in those paths where raphael and titian found it line     what if these compare etc bruyere observes that the inferior critic judges only by comparison in one sense all judgment must be formed on comparison but bruyere who is speaking of poetry means that the inferior critic has no scale of judging of a work of art but by comparing it with some other work of the same kind he judges of virgil by a comparison with homer and of spencer by comparing him with tasso by such criticism he may indeed arrive at certain truths but he will never form that masterly judgment which he might do by comparing the work before him with the great archetypes of nature and the solid rules of his art  what bruyere says of the critic in poetry is very applicable to the critic in painting the inferior critic who has traveled and seen the works of many great masters supposes he has treasured up from them the ideas of perfection and instead of judging of a picture by the rules of painting and it is agreement with nature he judges of it by the arbitrary ideas he has conceived and these too very probably much injured in the conception from this comparative mode of criticizing the art receives no advancement all we gain is that one artist paints better than another end of the notes
