undergo a stricter scrutiny that of the closet a scrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided i know your ladyship will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the author and such errors as are incident to human inperfection but this is an indulgence which i doubt the critic will not so readily show him but however he may censure i must ever think myself happy in having already acquired your ladyships good opinions i am also flattered as often as i think of the near resemblance my heroine has of your ladyship had i been earlier honored with your ladyships acquaintance i

whatever ill  would he had waited the return of morn  eleanor the night is dark indeed the tempest high but hear me lady hear a pious lesson which thy own lips to me have often repeated there is a power unseen whose charge it is with ever wakeful eye to watch the good and peaceful ever is that breast which trusts in his angelic guard  the hand of heaven that hitherto has been his shield will minister safe convoy to his steps though night and darkness shed their thickest gloom  lady salisbury misdeem not of my fears or think i speak as over diffident of that same power thou namst whose all surveying eye wakes ever clear unobstructed either when the sun shrowds in nights shadowy veil or when at noon he shines revealed on his meridian throne but where is the bosom throbs not if it hope
