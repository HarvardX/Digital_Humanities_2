the perplexities a comedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  conamur tenues grandia horat  london printed for w griffin in catharinestreet in the strand and g kearsly in ludgate street       price    d  advertisement the editor of this comedy thinks it his duty to declare that in point of fable he is entirely indebted to an old play wrote by sir samuel tuke called the adventures of five hours of which piece echard in the preface to his translation of terence after noticing some particular excellencies gives this general character viz  this is one of the pleasantest stories that ever appeared upon our stage and has as much variety of plots and intrigues without any thing being precipitated improper or unnatural as to the main action this encomium and the request of a particular friend induced an attempt to restore so excellent a story to the stage finding on examination of the original the language to consist entirely of measure and rhyme a style by no means suited to the use of comedy it appeared indispensably necessary to newwrite it this arduous task was not undertaken without much fear and diffidence if the piece as it now stands should be fortunate enough to meet the least favor the editor will with the utmost readiness charge such success to his having in general adhered closely to the original pursued the same disposition of scenery and preserved as many of the sentiments as could be introduced without clogging or interrupting the action what particular alterations he has presumed to make are with great deference submitted to the candor of the public  since the copy was delivered to the press some few passages have been shortened in representation which are easily distinguishable by the attentive reader   this comedy having been treated with very distinguished marks of candor and encouragement in the representation the editor thinks it his duty to return his most grateful thanks to the public  prologue mr beard enters hastily i speak a prologue  what strange whim i wonder could lead the author into such a blunder  i asked the man as much  but he poor devil fancied a manager might make you civil garrick says he can with a prologue tame the critics rage  why cannot you do the same because quoth i the case is different quite garrick you know can prologues speak and write if like that roscius i could write and speech it i might command applause and not beseech it but sure for one who all his livelong days has dealt in crotchets minims and solfas a singer to stand forth in wits defense and plead against sound the solemn cause of sense persuade an audience that a play has merit without a single air to give it spirit it is so much out of character  so wrong  no prologue sir for me  unless in song the fame quoth i you poets reap and all your gains are owing to sounds that even measure keep and stanzas smoothly flowing but me the lyre would better suit than verses of apollo the fiddle hautboy horn or flute i am always used to follow sir says he you will mar my verse and meaning too  sir must i turn fool to humor such as you i will sing it if you please  sing cries he in huff of you and your solfas the town has had enough  oh then i bouncd and swore  was i much to blame had you been in my place why you would have done the same if for oldfashioned tunes he is not too nice i would give him fifty of em in a trice with words more fitted to his purpose here than all the rhimes he would jingle in a year he challenged me to show a single sample of what i bragged  i did  as for example the scene is prepared the critics are met the judges all ranged  a terrible show ere trial begins the prologues a debt a debt on demand  so take what we owe and this is the way mr author to trick a plain muse up with art in modish fallals you must cloathe her and warm a cold critics hard heart with a fallallal etc wherefore i thus entreat with due submission between the bard and me you would make decision the whole now on your arbitration we rest and prologues henceforward shall surely be dressed in what mode soever your taste shall like best which none of us dare deny for however cruel critics and witlings may sneer that at times i alas somewhat dunny appear if to you my best friends i ever turn my deaf ear may you your indulgence deny then for his sake and mine for we are both in a fright till a treat of more gout shall your palates delight let a poor humble comedy please you tonight which surely you will not deny characters men don antonio mr  don henriquez mr ross don florio

macklin felicia miss wilford rosa mrs green the perplexities act i scene i scene don henriquez and don juan henriquez no more cousin i beseech you all your rhetoric will not persuade me to leave so important a care as the honor of our family to the caprice of a giddy girl it was a charge committed absolutely to me by our parents on their deathbed and i alone must be answerable for any blemish on that honor   juan i have no doubt don henriquez but that this your extreme haste takes it is rise from prudence but may not even our virtues be sometimes overstraind and have their dangerous effects it is from this fear that i have often presumed to interpose and must repeat it would it not be better to let your sister see and make herself acquainted with the disposition of the man with whom she is to pass her life   hen which is in other words to give her more opportunity for devices and to try whether she cannot frustrate my designs  no no  an agreeable young girl should never be left to her own direction  tricks plots and contrivances are so innate in them they will cousen themselves rather than their imaginations should want employment i have seen too many instances of their vanity giddiness ingratitude well  well  i have within this hour received intelligence from the marquis dolivera through whose generous intervention my designs are at last come to maturity that the person to whom she has been so long contracted don antonio de mendoza    juan is he the man the very name removes half my objections why has it been so long concealed   hen because i would not give my sisters enterprising genius either time or means to counteract my purposes  but now the prospect of a speedy conclusion of the whole affair renders that secrecy no longer necessary this evening he will arrive from flanders and so well convinced am i of the propriety of my conduct i will not sleep till they are married   juan notwithstanding his undoubted merit i cannot yet be reconciled to that unreasonable custom of contracting persons who never saw each other compelling them to be of the same opinion in the most important concern of life before you know whether they could agree about the most insignificant   hen i would only compel her to her good and think i am the best judge what measures to pursue  opinions indeed  if you don juan delay the disposal of your sister in marriage till she is able to determine what her opinion is or to express myself conformably to your easy temper till she has fixed her affections she may give you a brotherinlaw very ill suited to your choice and judgment   juan strange that your understanding education and travels should not have allayed that severe opinion of women by strangers imputed to us as a national fault and indeed with too much justice   hen persons who cannot comprehend the motives which actuate such as are wiser than themselves ever make strange interpretations of their conduct i am determined no longer to endure the daily the hourly anxieties and fears which a solicitude for honorias conduct has given me this night they end   juan i have had the like charge of a sister you know these thirteen years and cannot recollect a pain mine ever gave to me   hen the comparison dont hold their dispositions are different yet i wish don juan you may not suffer for your easiness of temper you give the reins too much into your sisters hands the thoughtlessness of youth and passions uncontrolled may lead her far astray it is too much to be feared i have strong reasons have nicely weighed her conduct  you may repent    juan i know what you allude to but the transactions of that fatal night are far from alarming me about felicias conduct it is true don pedro was killed under my balcony you throw the deed on florio and his flight seems to justify the accusation yet what reproach does this cast on her for when i offered in consequence of your assertion that he had dishonorable designs on her to interfere with you in his behalf to stop the prosecution and give her hand to him if her happiness consisted therein she utterly declined it assuring me she had no one motive to wish for such an event but many to avoid it   hen you are too blind   juan and you too suspicious why should she deceive me have i not ever assured her i would consult her inclination   hen ay there is the curse that ties my tongue  aside juan i therefore cannot will not doubt her her heart is generous and honest on such dispositions indulgence weighs more than severity and could you be induced to alter your conduct toward honoria  but i ask pardon your own judgment must be your director short as my absence has been events may have occurred which may render me now an incompetent adviser  your sister is mistress of many virtues and fame speaks loudly of antonio as a man a scholar and a soldier   hen on those considerations let our argument die i am determined will you accompany me to our friend and kinsman the corregidor i would require him to be a witness and partaker of our ceremonies tonight   juan i will but conduct my sister to her cousin honoria to whom she has devoted this evening and attend you   hen shall i expect you in the piazza   juan you may  exit hen a man with a heart at ease like his may well preach such doctrine but i carry a load of inquietude in mine  my sister married one weighty care is removed but a far heavier remains  ungrateful blind felicia  what sufferings am i doomed to undergo yet know not how to utter or relieve them to love adore doubt fear suspect despair yet still persist to love i blush at my own weakness  to apply and be refused were a perpetual thorn to me and that from her blind prepossession to another and juans passive acquiescence to her choice is almost certain rivalld too in her affections by a man who but a short time before had asked my sister of me my pride my honor is insulted revenge is my only remedy in that i will persist and experience its utmost efficacy  exit scene honoria s apartment enter honoria hon would felicia were come her kind and cheerful temper might give me some relief  yet how can i expect it this tyrant brother can i call him less to compel me to marry a man i never saw while the chosen of my heart is forced to avoid me  is rejected my brothers hatred could scarce entail on me a greater misery than his care  yet what can i do his power over me is unlimited  no alternative left but what is desperate yet something must be done i cannot thus tamely subscribe to my own unhappiness  enter juan introducing felicia juan with pleasure i escort my sister to so dear and amiable a friend  methinks it is pity even a wall should make the houses two of neighbors so entirely one   fell yes and the houses are more entirely one than you imagine my dear brother thanks to our private door  aside hon we have ever thought the slightest separation inconsistent with our friendship  you oblige me with a most welcome favor in uniting us now it is a degree of charity and i thank you am i to be honored with your company too   juan i could with great pleasure stay but an engagement with your brother calls me and the least trespass on his punctilious temper you know    hon shall i call my cousin mine for the night   juan her own inclination is her ruler your most obedient  exit fell there is a brother for you  upon my word if he were not so related i should be apt to mistake him for a lover   hon and give him encouragement perhaps   fell undoubtedly if my heart were free and i could be convinced that same politeness would not abate on marriage a little of that you know goes a great way in a husband  but am i never to see my sweet friend smile again    hon i would willingly put off my grief to avoid disturbing your gaiety but am not able   fell then let me put off my gaiety that i may not interrupt your grief there is often ease in the indulgence of it and i am too giddy for you tell me my dear honoria how can i metamorphose myself so as to suit your feelings i would be or do any thing that might give you pleasure   hon you never fail to do that  your every look and word has affection in it and that agreeable manner of setting them off makes what would be styled levity in others a virtue in you as it is only spring is from a desire to entertain   fell delivered with singular judgment and politeress yours to the very ground   hon engaging playfulness how can so tender so susceptible a heart as yours be so much at ease in it is present doubtful and anxious situation   fell why that is true  and it is sometimes otherwise but as i have not to charge fortune or friends with any actual affliction i bear accidental ills as well as i am able and endeavor to keep sorrow at arms length my hopes i think grow faster than my fears and i trust to the great midwife time to bring forth the fruits of em   hon and may they answer your deserts i have almost lost a part of my grief in my amazement at the adventures you were relating to me last night when my lordly brother interrupted us   fell yes absence is a pretty whet to affection now and then he is ten times worse than ever there is no getting a moment now his love and jealousy together keep him in a perpetual fidget   hon i could not sleep for thinking of your story   fell ay is it not a fine one since the days of don quixotte to this present seven oclock in the evening sure never was a better subject for romance  let me see i will enumerate the particulars travels  surprises  wars  drums  trumpets  taken prisoner  attacked by a ruffian  saved by a heroic selfdefence  swooning  recovery  and such a recovery in the arms of a handsome young fellow o lud cousin   hon who had killed the attempter of your honor too   fell oh no  you forget  i had the credit of the victory over him  as soon as he began to use violence i seized his dagger and menaced his destruction ay and meant it too when a sudden alarm and fear for his own safety relieved me from the monster   hon but how came you deprived of your brothers assistance   fell i was coming to that when don henriquez interrupted us  in defending himself and me which he did a long time with great galantry ere we were taken prisoners he received some slight wounds and was lodged in an upper apartment of the house  i was taken to a pavilion in the garden which i presume the wretch who assaulted me thought most fit for his wicked purposes   hon your attachments to your relation the count doniate and the concern your brother had in his embassy to the emperor threatened surely a longer absence what occasioned your return   fell my brother was suddenly recalled to his regiment by royal command and the necessity for using dispatch in our return to sevil induced him to take the nearest road  too near the enemies quarters  and thence we were made prisoners   hon i am sure i have sensibly partaken every fear and distress during your relation and lament the necessity that involved you in such perplexities though it restored so much of my happiness to me  and you dearly love the noble soldier who offered to revenge your injuries or die beside you   fell most entirely  i always speak truth you know if a sudden passion a firstsight love is justifiable in any one it is surely so in me i suppose gratitude may have some share but then such a person such looks such words  however i am mistaken if i did not leave him as much cause to remember the adventure as he did me   hon why then did he leave you so abruptly   fell what could the poor soul do the trumpets summoned him his men called loudly for their commander there was to be sure a notable combat between love and honor but honor got the better and i honor him for it   hon and what was this gallant heros name   fell i know not i had neither means nor time to enquire the moment my brother had recovered some few hours strength we were obliged to set off  but enough of my affairs how stand my sweet friends   hon worse and worse felicia  so near a crisis that my brother is determined on my marrying this night   fell my brother hinted as much as we came here but i could scarce believe it   hon it is too true  henriquez has just received advice that the person to whom i am contracted will arrive this evening   fell how absurd and cruel and poor florio    hon now doubly banished first from my brothers positive forbiddance of his addresses and visits on account of this unhappy contract and then from the illfated death of don pedro whom in selfdefence you know he killed if he is found my brothers evidence must condemn him to the law and his resentment seeks all occasions to compass the most severe gratifications   fell rash inconsiderate unfeeling man was not his savage love of me the cause which drives him hourly to some mad extreme then that unlucky similitude of dress which led him to believe florio was entertaining me that fatal evening in our balcony nay allowing his suspicions had been grounded in truth could nothing appease him but assassinating florio and hazarding his friend don pedro in so bafe a cause can he suppose such desperate such terrifying proofs of passion which while his pride will not suffer him to own he weakly fancies is unseen would not disgust my heart   hon however he has disdained to trust a woman i wonder his friendship with your brother has not induced him to ask your hand of him   fell oh my dear two most weighty reasons are against it first his pride lest he should be refused secondly my brothers strong dislike of forced marriages to which he is no stranger though between you and me my dear my brother is as well convinced of his passion as we are and proceeded so far as to apply to me thereon but finding my aversion my horror at the very mention of it according to his accustomed tenderness he has never since reassumd the topic but has henriquez at last graciously been pleased to tell you your intended husbands name   hon he has felicia this day at dinner not a moment sooner   fell may not i know it   hon he is called antonio de mendoza  enter henriquez hen i am pleased honoria to hear you talking of your husband it gives me hope your conduct will deserve the happiness i am providing for you  have you the letter ready which i enjoined you to write to him i will send a servant with it to meet him on the way and give him entire possession of that range of apartments designed for him to show how absolutely next to myself he is master here  it is a respect which persons of condition reciprocally challenge  enter sylvio syl a servant from don antonio is just alighted at the gate with letters to your lordship   hen i could not have received more welcome news admit him sister conduct your lovely friend within exeunt honoria and felicia exquisite enchanting misjudging woman  enter sylvio with ernesto ern sir don antonio kisses your hands with this letter  servants salute hen i am glad to find he is in health yet he seems to think the hour of his arrival uncertain else i would myself meet and conduct him hither   ern though the hour is uncertain signor yet he will undoubtedly be here to night for he has appointed the very place where i am to wait for him   hen you are returning thither now   ern as soon as i have received your commands signor   hen i will answer this forthwith then give you your whole commission while i write make the meenger welcome exit sylvio with ernesto i hope nothing will prevent his coming this evening i grow more and more impatient  there is danger in delay  however honoria may put on a speous complaisance i know her her head is quick to contrive and her heart desperate to execute let but antonio come and she shall not remain unmarried a single hour  exit enter honoria felicia and rosa hon you see how arrogant and absolute he is   fell yet his proud heart felt a smart twinge from my keen eyes just now or i am mistaken   hon watched like a culprit commanded like a slave torn from the man i love forced to a man i have not an idea of   fell ods my life girl dont stand enumerating our distresses but think how we may remove em we shall mend nothing by complaining something must be contrived   hon but they come so quick upon us    fell if they come too quick for a womans invention they are such as never came before   hon i have it   fell i knew it   hon lend me your veil cousin rosa run and see whether my brother is settled to dispatch antonios man  exit rosa fell what is your scheme quick   hon if my brother is set down to write i think i may say an hour is securely mine for his extravagant suspicion makes him distrust the sense of his own words and he will weigh a subscription to a scruple lest he should degrade his dignity by his style therefore i will to florio let him know the straits to which i am driven and that all hopes are over unless he can devise some prompt expedient to relieve us   fell but where do you think to see him   hon at the house where he is concealed it is not far off i will venture   fell do you know the way   hon no but rosa can conduct me she has been often there  enter rosa rosa your brother maam  coming already   fell provoking   hon into my chamber  quick  exeunt honoria and felicia enter henriquez with ernesto hen since you are so desirous friend you shall be indulged in seeing her   ern i should be glad to have it in my power signor to tell my master i had that honor   hen where is your lady rosa   rosa in her chamber sir   hen acquaint her that antonios man requests to pay his duty to her before he goes exit rosa wait here she will come to you you will probably find a kinswoman with her but may distinguish your future mistress by being in her homedress without her veil i will go and complete my letter  exit henriquez enter honoria felicia and rosa ernesto addresses felicia ern i have been bold to request the honor of seeing your ladyship that i may be more welcome to my lord at my return   hon an odd mistake  further it my dear girl it may lead to something no matter what drowning people catch at straws   fell friend in what state left you your lord and mine   ern as happy madam as the hopes of being yours could make him   fell i pray present my service to him and say i shall be rejoiced to hear he has completed his journey safely and in health my good wishes attend him friend farewell  exeunt honoria felicia and rosa ern egad she is a lovely creature my master will be ravished when he sees her i begin to hope this blind bargain made by proxy may prove as good as the old ones made by love and that those pretty eyes of here is may coax his wits back again which i think he has lost raving eternally about some unknown damsel whom he fancies in his fielderrantry he recovered from a trance and he has dreamt of it ever since  i will go wake him with this good news  exit ern enter honoria felicia and rosa fell and yet for the soul of me notwithstanding our vexations i could hardly forbear laughing at the formal fools mistake  did not i prim myself up with a pretty prudish reserve was it like you cousin   hon there is no saying what may be the consequence of the mistake but it was a lucky thing for me i am sure for i should not have known how to speak for myself   rosa madam do we go what do you resolve   fell that is true your brother cannot be much longer and if when he returns he should miss you from your apartment  i dont think you can venture now   hon what is the hour rosa   rosa near eight madam the clock struck seven before donna felicia entered the chamber   hon i dare not venture now indeed run rosa fetch your veil exit rosa i will appoint him in my tablets time and place where he shall meet me and rosa shall carry em   fell that is well but where do you design your interview   hon in the remotest part of the garden which fronts my apartment you know where i have often met him since your absence deprived us of the advantages of your friendly assistance and the private door to your portion of don juans house rosa has a key to the backdoor of our garden   fell and how could she get that not by fair means i am sure  henriquez used to be as tenacious of his keys as of his longspun pedigree and even opened a door himself with as much cautious fear as if he apprehended a piece of his ancestry should make it is escape at it   hon rosa artfully procured me an impression of my brothers key one day when some sudden intelligence hurried him abroad in search of florio and by that we got one made   fell well contrived my notable girl  enter rosa veiled hon shall i beg your patience while i write   fell this was a lucky accident for you rosa you may chance to fee your fond lover guzman   rosa he is a fond lover of himself i believe madam and without a rival   fell are you sure your words and thoughts agree   rosa i am not so very old to be in my dotage maam   fell nor so very young but you may be in love dotage and love are cousingermans rosa   rosa they may when we encourage a passion at first sight madam and indulge it without a chance of success  otherwise not quite so nearly related   fell pert and witty enough that i have provoked a wasp and am stung by it   hon my dear rosa make all the haste you are able   rosa i will fly maam has florio the other key of the tablets   hon yes yes  pray dispatch   rosa never doubt me madam for all my own fortune is betted on your game  exit rosa fell there she goes which is nimblest her heels or her tongue i wonder come my dear girl try to wear a more cheerful aspect if we are reduced to desperate measures why let the person who causes it be blamed   hon he justly would deserve it though nothing but the last distress i think should urge me to such measures as the world might censure yet were not my affections so strongly preengagd to a delicate feeling surely it is no trifling wound to be obliged to give a worthy man a hand without a heart   fell come come hope well  and do not torment your mind any further  let us retire to your chamber and while we wait rosas return i will try to raise your spirits with your favorite song   hon my sweet friend i fear the cold regard i shall pay will ill deserve such a kind and agreeable offer  in vain we seek relief from outward things  it is from within alone sort quiet springs  exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i scene a marketplace enter antonio and sancho in ridingsuits sancho what a confounded pace we have come but you are always the same sir you proceed in the attack of a mistress with as much vigor and activity as you storm a garrison   ant dispatch is the soul of every undertaking i hate all that savours of coldness and delay in a pursuit so insipidly carried on the spirits relax and though you gain your ends you scarce relish the success  what do you smile at sancho   san you expect the truth sir   ant you know i do i cannot brook falsehood even in the veriest trifles lest the mind be insensibly led on to practice it in material affairs and thereby entail on itself such a reproach as most disgraces manhood   san why then sir i smiled at the oddity of your amors first to fall in love with one you hardly ever saw and then make such haste to marry one you never saw we poor mortals have another method   ant your reflections like those of the world in general are too hasty and superficial not knowing my motives you wonder at my conduct how many faultless characters through too severe and premature conclusions have had a shade drawn over them which time and reason have at last wholly removed   san sir i ask pardon if i have offended   ant you cannot easily offend you have gained on my temper and won an indulgence which your courage and fidelity well deserve   san but sir you are earlier than you expected by an hour almost   ant it is true   san then suppose sir you return to the posthouse and lay aside these unnecessary implements for walking then if you please you may relieve your legs a little more i can stay in the house to be ready when ernesto comes according to your orders   ant i like your counsel well  follow me  exeunt scene a street representing the house where florio dwells enter from his house florio with guzman both cloaked flo come guzman now we may venture to quit our dens take a little fresh air and begin chase   guz chase now the sun is set of what sir owls or bats call you this making love  it is much more like making war  marching all night in arms as if we were going to beat up the enemies quarters on a forlorn hope   flo would not you venture as much for rosa   guz no in good faith sir i shall venture enough if i marry her i will run no hazards before hand   flo that is from your fear not your prudence   guz sir you may call it what you please but i dare boldly say there lives not a more valiant man in the world than myself while danger keeps at distance but when faucily it presses on me then i confess i have a certain tenderness for life which checks my ardour and inclines my prudence to make a timely retreat   flo how civil your style is to yourself  and how prettily you soften that harsh word cowardice  but i think i have seen your valor pleased to run away when danger has not been so very pressing   guz it may not have appeared so sir to common eyes but i have such a piercing sight that i can discover perils at a greater distance than any man in spain  other people poor souls not being blessed with such perspicuity do not descry dangers time enough to shun em and then their struggling is by the injudicious world called courage   flo a man truly valiant will always remain so   guz a man wisely valiant will avoid all the danger he can   flo you have more light than heat i will allow guzman but your humor and honesty make amends for your want of courage   guz i have courage enough for the profession my parents designed me for   flo what was that   guz a lawyer i could have put on rare anger in my clients sight and when he was gone have hugged the advocate of the opposite party and if i dont mistake sir those gentry sell their breath much dearer than you gentlemen soldiers sell your blood it is true you get honor  a fine light food for delicate appetites  yet i have known some captains of plain stomachs fast upon it   flo the knaves right  but how i trifle time what is this to my embarrassments in love  how shall i contrive to hear from my honoria  shall i venture to my old haunts  i dare not  to what purpose should i unless she were preadvised of it this last unhappy accident left to solitude and thought  and that loaded with the disagreeable reflection of having shed anothers blood  which though it chanced in selfdefence my reason and education will not let me easily digest  yet honoria she must be mine and i will leave no peril unencounterd to obtain her  if after all i fail  if i must lose her at least i will deserve her  enter

name of any place i see it is so long since i was in this city i have lost all my measures of it   flo do my eyes cheat me or is that my comrade when i first bore arms my friend antonio if it be he as sure it must i cannot dread to know him   ant florio   flo my honored friend    ant you were too long in recollecting me  your friendship cannot cool   flo never  but your presence here so unexpected made me disbelieve my sight  when came you to town   ant i just now arrived   flo i rejoice to see you but should have thought it more likely to hear of you at court pursuing the recompense due to your deserts   ant an employment i am neither fond nor capable of i cannot sue even for my right it is myambition to merit but not solicit reward the dignity of honor suffers in it if praise and advancement do not follow our services we must learn to pay ourselves by a noble contempt of worldly favors   flo a severe rule indeed which virtue prescribes to herself  to be so backward in claiming a reward she is so eager to deserve   ant by no means she is more hurt in being reduced to beg reward than she can be in the want of it  besides a true subject hazards his life in the service of his king and country for the advancement of their honor and interest solely he who does it with a view to his own deserves neither praise nor reward   flo the same great and generous spirit as ever i honor the day which introduced me to the knowledge of so much worth   ant what merit i have i can but faintly call my own  i inherit it from a father whose example of courage and integrity it had been scandalous in a son not to have imitated   flo this is my house at present antonio  will you honor it by calling it yours though you must excuse many deficiencies in your entertainment i am but in an ill condition at present to receive the honor of such a guest having by an unhappy accident been obliged lately to change my usual place of residence and keep myself concealed   ant concealed  but that is for a future hour and more suitable place  i must however decline your kind offer a while being forced to remain hereabouts lest i should miss the return of one whom i sent to my brotherinlaws   flo you surprise me  have you a brotherinlaw in seville   ant i have i came hither a married man as far as friends could make me   flo since then it so imports you not to miss your servant i will keep you company here till his arrival then lead you to some refreshment  you have had a tedious and perilous campaign in flanders  i long methinks antonio to hear some account of your actions therein of which fame speaks loudly but not distinctly  could you not oblige me while you are waiting for your servant    ant excuse me  i cannot  if there be any merit in my behavior my own breath would fully it  if not the report is not fit for a friends ear  but if you choose to fill up the time i will give you an adventure of mine which i fancy will repay your attention   flo you will oblige me   ant and when it is finished you will wonder how with such a prepossession in my heart i should be induced to come here to marry a stranger   flo your preface awakes my curiosity  to the story i beseech you   ant on the evening following that glorious day whereon the duke of alva gained such distinguished reputation i was dispatched with some horse to cover the limbourg frontiers which were too much exposed to the enemys inroads  we were scarce arrived when i received intelligence that a party of them about  00 cavalry were newly lodged in a village three leagues off we instantly sounded to horse and not to trouble you with particulars so great was our expedition that by daybreak their quarters were on fire   flo you experienced the utility of your own maxim that diligence in execution is the mistress of success   ant our foes made but faint resistance  some were slain  some fled to give alarm to their reserves in quarters remote  the tumult nigh over i  to a lofty structure supposing it was their leaders quarter  with intention to preserve him from the soldiers rage and his building from the fire  but what was my surprise when entering a pavilion in the garden i beheld a woman of a matchless form stretched on the marble floor   flo your heart suffered then i am sure  pity and bravery always dwell together   ant i felt what i cannot describe  though at first i believed her dead yet her appearance inspired me with such awe and reverence that i could not without trembling venture to approach her  i knelt and raised her in my arms when strait a sigh stole from her i knew it not for a sound of grief while it was a sign of life at last she opened her lovely eyes and beamed such looks spite of her sad situation as i had never experienced awhile i was held mute with wonder and delight when a poniard fell from her fair hand  as if she only wanted arms asleep and waking trusted to her eyes  my sensations increased each moment  when i recovered power to

oppressed by numbers   all how   flo pedro deserved his death and i am blameless   hen my shame my eternal shame what shall i say you see me overwhelmed with confusion if i have acted in a manner unbecoming my name and honor attribute it to love  i seek not longer to conceal it a hurt a desperate jealous love for that ungrateful creature   juan cousin i will now own i have perceived it long and in justice to our friendship and alliance have even addressed my sister on the subject but found such insurmountable objections to your but violence of temper that in consideration of what your pride might suffer i concealed my knowledge of your passion even from yourself   fell how could a man of don henriquez sense and penetration suppose his tyrannic treatment of so amiable a sister such everlasting doubts suspicions jealousies restrictions and severities must not disgust rather than win a womans heart could you but have subdued those passions perhaps ere i had seen that gentleman i might have been induced to think of you in such a light as your person and natural endowments deserved if a disappointment herein be painful to your self alone you are indebted for it   hen forbear i pray you show not the happiness i might have reached nor add the weight of your reproaches to my selfcondemnation my punishment is sufficient without it  i have justly railed when such a heart as mine concedes the pangs it suffers are not trivial   fell i am sorry and ask pardon   hen yet to convince you that my sorrow is not selfish as i have been the source of general uneasiness i will endeavor to make a general amends let my own heart suffer what it may first madam may you enjoy more happiness if possible than i have wished to partake with you and sir to you unasked i thus resign this contract which love and justice both forbid me now to claim   ant noble henriquez i thank and honor you   juan sir take from me her hand whose heart your worth and bravery has merited   ant thus i receive the sum of happiness this world can give and sir since you have generously resigned the name of brother allow me that of friend which while i live i will deserve and suffer me to entreat your concurrence for your sisters happiness where destiny seems to lead  i will answer with my life my friend will merit her   hen sir she is yours  and here dies all my animosity   flo we are now all your debtors i am peculiarly so   hon my brother now you are indeed my brother noble generous and kind you have set my heart at ease and i am myself again   fell that is more than i am i am sure i have seen so many wonders i shall not be myself again this twelvemonth   rosa they have had a rare comeoff sure twoud make a good plot for a play   guz that would be bad for me for by the laws of comedy i should be obliged to marry you   flo well thought of guzman though spoke in jest you seem well fitted for each other and your faithful services deserve our general encouragement what say you rosa   rosa sir i say i have had so many frights to night i am even afraid to lie alone   guz thy hand sweet rosa it is a bargain if i dont repent first i dont care   juan this union being in my house let me entreat your stay to unite in woadring at these events and enjoying general congratulations cousin you will not refuse me   hen i will not be a means to thwart your mirth but endeavor as well as i am able to partake it  my heart has now a new a difficult and painful lesson set it but it must be learned for our adventures prove that womens mild and gentle hearts must be soothed by indulgence not frighted by severity and that easy frank and confiding tempers bid fairest for a generous return  since such and such alone deserve to share the confidence and favor of the fair  epilogue spoken by mrs mattocks ay  ay  they are at it  in a dainty tew have you the epilogue  not i   have you miss macklin and miss wilford there i mean i  i dont know that any has been seen lud where is the author  i am in such a fright the author child  not ventured here tonight what shall we do my dear  i cannot guess  to palliate this ridiculous distress will you permit me to apologize for this hard tax on new formed comedies  in short these epilogues are grown so trite so few the subjects left whereon to write so few the authors with this knack endued perhaps my nonsense may be quite as good i have been in front  and if with leave i may i will give my inferences from this play see mr garricks epilogue to the earl of warwick the beauteous margret of the rivalhouse to lower the grandeur of despotic spouse has taught the ladies in true comic vein rules to maintain and use their power over men my hints although in homelier style than those to you ye lords of nature i will disclose would you high potentates throughout your lives preserve obedient sisters daughters wives avoid henriquez faults  be never proud distrustful jealous arrogant or loud where ever we go what ever we do or say make it your rule  to give us our own way neither attempt to lead us nor restrain but let us have the length of all the rein in shoppings auctions jauntings or quadrille leave us to spend and lose what ever we will let all our favorite foibles take their course for every breather has some hobbyhorse with whatsoever whims or freaks you meet still let your words and looks alike be sweet  lord when thus left to our own tempers free the sweetest creatures in the world are we  hence this important maxim is defined ye wise ones keep it ever in your mind  we women never frown if never teased and always humored  we are always pleased the end
