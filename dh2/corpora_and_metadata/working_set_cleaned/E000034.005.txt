to m dubourg  i am apprehensive that i shall not be able to find leisure for making all the disquisitions and experiments which would be desirable on this subject i must therefore content myself with a few remarks the specific gravity of some human bodies in comparison to that of water has been examined by mr robinson in our philosophical transactions volume l page  0 for the year      he asserts that fat persons with small bones float most easily upon the water the divingbell is accurately described in our transactions when i was a boy i made two oval palettes each about ten inches long and six broad with a hole for the thumb in order to retain it fast in the palm of my hand they much resembled a painters palettes   in swimming i pushed the edges of these forward and i struck the water with their flat surfaces as i drew them back i remember i swam faster by means of these palettes but they fatigued my wrists i also fitted to the soles of my feet a kind of sandals but i was not satisfied with them because i observed that the stroke is partly given by the inside of the feet and the ankles and not entirely with the soles of the feet we have here waistcoats for swimming which are made of double sailcloth with small pieces of cork quilted in between them i know nothing of the scaphandre of m de la chapelle i know by experience that it is a great comfort to a swimmer who has a considerable distance to go to turn himself sometimes on his back and to vary in other respects the means of procuring a progressive motion when he is seized with the cramp in the leg the method of driving it away is to give to the parts affected a sudden vigorous and violent shock which he may do in the air as he swims on his back during the great heats of summer there is no danger in bathing however warm we may be in rivers which have been thoroughly warmed by the sun but to throw ones self into cold spring water when the body has been heated by exercise in the sun is an imprudence which may prove fatal i once knew an instance of four young men who having worked at harvest in the heat of the day with a view of refreshing themselves plunged into a spring of   cold water two died upon the spot a third the next morning and the fourth recovered with great difficulty a copious draught of cold water in similar circumstances is frequently attended with the same effect in north america the exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy and agreeable in the world after having swam for an hour or two in the evening one sleeps coolly the whole night even during the most ardent heat of summer perhaps the pores being cleansed the insensible perspiration increases and occasions this coolness it is certain that much swimming is the means of stopping a diarrhœa and even of producing a constipation with respect to those who do not know how to swim or who are affected with a diarrhœa at a season which does not permit them to use that exercise a warm bath by cleansing and purifying the skin is found very salutary and often effects a radical cure i speak from my own experience frequently repeated and that of others to whom i have recommended this you will not be displeased if i conclude these hasty remarks by informing you that as the ordinary method of swimming is reduced to the act of rowing with the arms and legs and is consequently a laborious and fatiguing operation when the space of water to be crossed is considerable there is a method in which a swimmer may pass to a great distance with much facility by means of a sail this discovery i fortunately made by accident and in the following manner when i was a boy i amused myself one day with   flying a paper kite and approaching the bank of a pond which was near a mile broad i tied the string to a stake and the kite ascended to a very considerable height above the pond while i was swimming in a little time being desirous of amusing myself with my kite and enjoying at the same time the pleasure of swimming i returned and loosing from the stake the string with the little stick which was fastened to it went again into the water where i found that lying on my back and holding the stick in my hands i was drawn along the surface of the water in a very agreeable manner having then engaged another boy to carry my clothes round the pond to a place which i pointed out to him on the other side i began to cross the pond with my kite which carried me quite over without the least fatigue and with the greatest pleasure imaginable i was only obliged occasionally to halt a little in my course and resist its progress when it appeared that by following too quick i lowered the kite too much by doing which occasionally i made it rise again i have never since that time practised this singular mode of swimming though i think it not impossible to cross in this manner from dover to calais the packetboat however is still preferable b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london john winthrop cccxxxv to john winthrop london   july      dear sir— you must needs think the time long that your instruments have been in hand sundry   circumstances have occasioned the delay mr short who undertook to make the telescope was long in a bad state of health and much in the country for the benefit of the air he however at length finished the material parts that required his own hand and waited only for something about the mounting that was to have been done by another workman when he was removed by death i have put in my claim to the instrument and shall obtain it from the executors as soon as his affairs can be settled it is now become much more valuable than it would have been if he had lived as he excelled all others in that branch the price agreed for was one hundred pounds the equal altitudes and transit instrument was undertaken by mr bird who doing all his work with his own hands for the sake of greater truth and exactness one must have patience that expects any thing from him he is so singularly eminent in his way that the commissioners of longitude have lately given him five hundred pounds merely to discover and make public his method of dividing instruments i send it you herewith but what has made him longer in producing your instrument is the great and hasty demand on him from france and russia and our society here for instruments to go to different parts of the world for observing the next transit of venus some to be used in siberia some for the observers that go to the south seas some for those that go to hudsons bay these are now all completed and mostly gone it being necessary on account of the distance that they should go this year to be ready   on the spot in time and now he tells me he can finish yours and that i shall have it next week possibly he may keep his word but we are not to wonder if he does not mr martin when i called to see his panopticon had not one ready but was to let me know when he should have one to show me i have not since heard from him but will call again mr maskelyne wishes much that some of the governments in north america would send an astronomer to lake superior to observe this transit i know no one of them likely to have a spirit for such an undertaking unless it be the massachusetts or that have a person and instruments suitable he presents you one of his pamphlets which i now send you together with two letters from him to me relating to that observation if your health and strength were sufficient for such an expedition i should be glad to hear you had taken it possibly you may have an élève that is capable the fitting you out to observe the former transit was a public act for the benefit of science that did your province great honor we expect soon a new volume of the transactions in which your piece will be printed i have not yet got the separate ones which i ordered it is perhaps not so extraordinary that unlearned men such as commonly compose our church vestries should not yet be acquainted with and sensible of the benefits of metal conductors in averting the stroke of lightning and preserving our houses from its violent effects or that they should be still prejudiced against the use of such conductors when we   see how long even philosophers men of extensive science and great ingenuity can hold out against the evidence of new knowledge that does not square with their preconceptions  and how long men can retain a practice that is conformable to their prejudices and expect a benefit from such practice though constant experience shows its inutility a late piece of the abbé nollet printed last year in the memoirs of the french academy of sciences affords strong instances of this for though the very relations he gives of the effects of lightning in several churches and other buildings show clearly that it was conducted from one part to another by wires gildings and other pieces of metal that were within or connected with the building yet in the same paper he objects to the providing metalline conductors without the building as useless or dangerous  he cautions people not to  0 ring the church bells during a thunderstorm lest the lightning in its way to the earth should be conducted down to them by the bellropes  which are but bad conductors and yet is against fixing metal rods on the outside of the steeple which are known to be much better conductors and which it would certainly choose to pass in rather than in dry hemp and though for a thousand years past bells have been solemnly consecrated by the romish church  in expectation that the sound of such blessed bells would drive away the storms and secure our buildings from the stroke of lightning and during so long a period    it has not been found by experience that places within the reach of such blessed sound are safer than others where it is never heard but that on the contrary the lightning seems to strike steeples of choice and that at the very time the bells are ringing  yet still they continue to bless the new bells and jangle the old ones whenever it thunders one would think it was now time to try some other trick and ours is recommended whatever this able philosopher may have been told to the contrary by more than twelve years experience wherein among the great number of houses furnished with iron rods in north america not one so guarded has been materially hurt with lightning and several have evidently been preserved by their means while a number of houses churches barns ships c in different places unprovided with rods have been struck and greatly damaged demolished or burnt probably the vestries of our english churches are not generally well acquainted with these facts otherwise since as good protestants they have no faith in the blessing of bells they would be less excusable in not providing this other security for their respective churches and for the good people that may happen to be assembled in them during a tempest especially as those buildings from their greater height are more exposed to the stroke of lightning than our common dwellings i have nothing new in the philosophical way to communicate to you except what follows when i    was last year in germany i met with a singular kind of glass being a tube about eight inches long half an inch in diameter with a hollow ball of near an inch diameter at one end and one of an inch and a half at the other hermetically sealed and half filled with water if one end is held in the hand and the other a little elevated above the level a constant succession of large bubbles proceeds from the end in the hand to the other end making an appearance that puzzled me much till i found that the space not filled with water was also free from air and either filled with a subtile invisible vapor continually rising from the water and extremely rarefiable by the least heat at one end and condensable again by the least coolness at the other or it is the very fluid of fire itself which parting from the hand pervades the glass and by its expansive force depresses the water till it can pass between it and the glass and escape to the other end where it gets through the glass again into the air i am rather inclined to the first opinion but doubtful between the two an ingenious artist here mr nairne mathematical instrumentmaker has made a number of them from mine and improved them for his are much more sensible than those i brought from germany i bored a very small hole through the wainscot in the seat of my window through which a little cold air constantly entered while the air in the room was kept warmer by fires daily made in it being winter time i    placed one of his glasses with the elevated end against this hole and the bubbles from the other end which was in a warmer situation were continually passing day and night to the no small surprise of even philosophical spectators each bubble discharged is larger than that from which it proceeds and yet that is not diminished and by adding itself to the bubble at the other end the bubble is not increased which seems very paradoxical when the balls at each end are made large and the connecting tube very small and bent at right angles so that the balls instead of being at the ends are brought on the side of the tube and the tube is held so that the balls are above it the water will be depressed in that which is held in the hand and rise in the other as a jet or fountain when it is all in the other it begins to boil as it were by the vapor passing up through it and the instant it begins to boil a sudden coldness is felt in the ball held a curious experiment this first observed and shown by mr nairne there is something in it similar to the old observation i think mentioned by aristotle that the bottom of a boiling pot is not warm and perhaps it may help to explain the fact if indeed it be a fact when the water stands at an equal height in both these balls and all at rest if you wet one of the balls by means of a feather dipped in spirit though that spirit is of the same temperament as to heat and cold with the water in the glasses yet the cold occasioned by the evaporation of the spirit from the wetted ball will so condense the vapor over the water contained in that ball as that the water of the other ball will be    pressed up into it followed by a succession of bubbles till the spirit is all dried away perhaps the observations on these little instruments may suggest and be applied to some beneficial uses it has been thought that water reduced to vapor by heat was rarefied only fourteen thousand times and on this principle our engines for raising water by fire are said to be constructed but if the vapor so much rarefied from water is capable of being itself still farther rarefied to a boundless degree by the application of heat to the vessels or parts of vessels containing the vapor as at first it is applied to those containing the water perhaps a much greater power may be obtained with little additional expense possibly too the power of easily moving water from one end to the other of a movable beam suspended in the middle like a scalebeam by a small degree of heat may be applied advantageously to some other mechanical purposes the magic square and circle i am told have occasioned a good deal of puzzling among the mathematicians here but no one has desired me to show him my method of disposing the numbers it seems they wish rather to investigate it themselves when i have the pleasure of seeing you i will communicate it with singular esteem and respect i am dear sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin    cccxxxvi petition of the letter z from the tatler no      to the worshipful isaac bickerstaff esquire censorgeneral the petition of the letter z commonly called ezzard zed or izard most humbly showeth that your petitioner is of as high extraction and has as good an estate as any other letter of the alphabet that there is therefore no reason why he should be treated as he is with disrespect and indignity that he is not only actually placed at the tail of the alphabet when he had as much right as any other to be at the head but it is by the injustice of his enemies totally excluded from the word wise and his place injuriously filled by a little hissing crooked serpentine venomous letter called s when it must be evident to your worship and to all the world that w i s e do not spell wize but wise your petitioner therefore prays that the alphabet may by your censorial authority be reversed and that in consideration of his longsuffering and patience he may be placed at the head of it that s may be turned out of the word wise and the petitioner employed instead of him and your petitioner as in duty bound shall ever pray c c mr bickerstaff having examined the allegations of the above petition judges and determines that z be    admonished to be content with his station forbear reflections upon his brother letters and remember his own small usefulness and the little occasion there is for him in the republic of letters since s whom he so despises can so well serve instead of him benjamin franklin   july      london william franklin cccxxxvii to william franklin london   july      dear son— since my last i have received yours of may  0th dated at amboy which i shall answer particularly by next weeks packet i purpose now to take notice of that part wherein you say it was reported at philadelphia i was to be appointed to a certain office here which my friends all wished but you did not believe it for the reasons i had mentioned instead of my being appointed to a new office there has been a motion made to deprive me of that i now hold  and i believe for the same reason though that was not the reason given out viz my being too much of an american but as it came from lord sandwich our new postmastergeneral who is of the bedford party and a friend of mr grenville i have no doubt that the reason he gave out viz my nonresidence was only the pretence and that the other was the true reason especially as it is the practice in many other instances to allow the nonresidence of american officers who spend their    salaries here provided care is taken that the business be done by deputy or otherwise the first notice i had of this was from my fast friend mr cooper secretary of the treasury he desired me by a little note to call upon him there which i did when he told me that the duke of grafton had mentioned to him some discourse of lord sandwichs as if the office suffered by my absence and that it would be fit to appoint another as i seemed constantly to reside in england that mr todd secretary of the postoffice had also been with the duke talking to the same purpose c that the duke wished him mr cooper to mention this to me and to say to me at the same time that though my going to my post might remove the objection yet if i choose rather to reside in england my merit was such in his opinion as to entitle me to something better here and it should not be his fault if i was not well provided for i told mr cooper that without having heard any exception had been taken to my residence here i was really preparing to return home and expected to be gone in a few weeks that however i was extremely sensible of the dukes goodness in giving me this intimation and very thankful for his favorable disposition towards me that having lived long in england and contracted a friendship and affection for many persons here it could not but be agreeable to me to remain among them some time longer if not for the rest of my life and that there was no nobleman to whom i could from sincere respect for his great abilities and amiable qualities so cordially attach myself or to whom i    should so willingly be obliged for the provision he mentioned as to the duke of grafton if his grace should think i could in any station where he might place me be serviceable to him and to the public mr cooper said he was very glad to hear i was still willing to remain in england as it agreed so perfectly with his inclinations to keep me here wished me to leave my name at the duke of graftons as soon as possible and to be at the treasury again the next board day i accordingly called at the dukes and left my card and when i went next to the treasury his grace not being there mr cooper carried me to lord north chancellor of the exchequer who said very obligingly after talking of some american affairs i am told by mr cooper that you are not unwilling to stay with us i hope we shall find some way of making it worth your while i thanked his lordship and said i should stay with pleasure if i could any ways be useful to government he made me a compliment and i took my leave mr cooper carrying me away with him to his countryhouse at richmond to dine and stay all night he then told me that mr todd had been again at the duke of graftons and that upon his mr coopers speaking in my behalf mr todd had changed his style and said i had to be sure a great deal of merit with the office having by my good management regulated the posts in america so as greatly to increase the revenue that he had had great satisfaction in corresponding with me while i was there and he believed they never had a better officer c the thursday following being the birthday    i met with mr todd at court he was very civil took me with him in his coach to the kings arms in the city where i had been invited to dine by mr trevor with the gentlemen of the postoffice we had a good deal of chat after dinner between us two in which he told me lord sandwich who was very sharp had taken notice of my stay in england and said if one could do the business why should there be two on my telling mr todd that i was going home which i still say to everybody not knowing but that what is intimated above may fail of taking effect he looked blank and seemed disconcerted a little which makes me think some friend of his was to have been vested with my place but this is surmise only we parted very good friends that day i received another note from mr cooper directing me to be at the duke of graftons next morning whose porter had orders to let me in i went accordingly and was immediately admitted but his grace being then engaged in some unexpected business with much condescension and politeness made that apology for his not discoursing with me then but wished me to be at the treasury at twelve the next tuesday i went accordingly when mr cooper told me something had called the duke into the country and the board was put off which was not known till it was too late to send me word but was glad i was come as he might then fix another day for me to go again with him into the country the day fixed was thursday i returned yesterday should have stayed till monday but for writing by  0 these vessels he assures me the duke has it at heart to do something handsome for me sir john pringle who is anxious for my stay says mr cooper is the honestest man of a courtier that he ever knew and he is persuaded they are in earnest to keep me the piece i wrote against smuggling in the chronicle of november last and one in april on the laboring poor which you will find in the gentlemans magazine for that month have been lately shown by mr cooper to the chancellor of the exchequer and to the duke who have expressed themselves much pleased with them i am to be again at the treasury on tuesday next by appointment of mr cooper thus particular i have been that you may judge of this affair for my own thoughts i must tell you that though i did not think fit to decline any favor so great a man expressed an inclination to do me because at court if one shows an unwillingness to be obliged it is often construed as a mark of mental hostility and one makes an enemy yet so great is my inclination to be at home and at rest that i shall not be sorry if this business falls through and i am suffered to retire with my old post nor indeed very sorry if they take that from me too on account of my zeal for america in which some of my friends have hinted to me that i have been too open i shall soon be able i hope by the next packet to give you farther light in the meantime as no one but sir john knows of the treaty i talk daily of going in the august packet at farthest and when the late georgia appointment of me to be their agent is mentioned    as what may detain me i say i have yet received no letters from that assembly acquainting me what their business may be that i shall probably hear from them before that packet sails that if it is extraordinary and of such a nature as to make my stay another winter necessary i may possibly stay because there would not be time for them to choose another but if it is common business i shall leave it with mr jackson and proceed i do not by the way know how that appointment came about having no acquaintance that i can recollect in that country it has been mentioned in the papers some time but i have only just now received a letter from governor wright informing me that he had that day given his assent to it and expressing his desire to correspond with me on all occasions saying the committee as soon as they could get their papers ready would write to me and acquaint me with their business  we have lost lord clare from the board of trade he took me home from court the sunday before his removal that i might dine with him as he said alone and talk over american affairs he seemed as attentive to them as if he was to continue ever so long he gave me a great deal of flummery saying that though at my examination i answered some of his questions a little pertly yet he liked me from that    day for the spirit i showed in defence of my country and at parting after we had drunk a bottle and a half of claret each he hugged and kissed me protesting he never in his life met with a man he was so much in love with this i write for your amusement you see by the nature of this whole letter that it is to yourself only it may serve to prepare your mind for any event that shall happen if mr grenville comes into power again in any department respecting america i must refuse to accept of any thing that may seem to put me in his power because i apprehend a breach between the two countries and that refusal might give offence so that you see a turn of a die may make a great difference in our affairs we may be either promoted or discarded one or the other seems likely soon to be the case but it is hard to divine which i am myself grown so old as to feel much less than formerly the spur of ambition and if it were not for the flattering expectation that by being fixed here i might more effectually serve my country i should certainly determine for retirement without a moments hesitation i am as ever your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london joseph galloway cccxxxviii to joseph galloway london   july      dear sir— since my last nothing material has occurred here relating to american affairs except the    removal of lord clare from the head of the board of trade to the treasury of ireland and the return of lord hillsborough to the board of trade as first commissioner retaining the title and powers of secretary of state for the colonies this change was very sudden and unexpected my lord clare took me home from court to dine with him but two days before saying he should be without other company and wanted to talk with me on sundry american businesses we had accordingly a good deal of conversation on our affairs in which he seemed to interest himself with all the attention that could be supposed in a minister who expected to continue in the management of them this was on sunday and on the tuesday following he was removed whether my lord hillsboroughs administration will be more stable than others have been for a long time is quite uncertain but as his inclinations are rather favorable towards us so far as he thinks consistent with what he supposes the unquestionable rights of britain i cannot but wish it may continue especially as these perpetual mutations prevent the progress of all business but another change is now talked of that gives me great uneasiness several of the bedford party being now got in it has been for some time apprehended that they would sooner or later draw their friend mr grenville in after them it is now said he is to be secretary of state in the room of lord shelburne if this should take place or if in any other shape he comes again into power i fear his sentiments of the americans and theirs of him will occasion    such clashings as may be attended with fatal consequences the last accounts from your part of the world of the combinations relating to commerce with this country and resolutions concerning the duties here laid upon it occasion much serious reflection and it is thought the points in dispute between the two countries will not fail to come under the consideration of parliament early in next session our friends wonder that i persist in my intention of returning this summer alleging that i might be of much more service to my country here than i can be there and wishing me by all means to stay the ensuing winter as the presence of persons well acquainted with america and of ability to represent these affairs in a proper light will then be highly necessary my private concerns however so much require my presence at home that i have not yet suffered myself to be persuaded by their partial opinion of me the tumults and disorders that prevailed here lately have now pretty well subsided wilkes outlawry is reversed but he is sentenced to twentytwo months imprisonment and one thousand pounds fine which his friends who feared he would be pilloried seem rather satisfied with the importation of corn a pretty good hay harvest now near over and the prospect of plenty from a fine crop of wheat make the poor more patient in hopes of an abatement in the price of provisions so that unless want of employment by the failure of american orders should distress them they are like to be tolerably quiet i purpose writing to you again by the packet that goes next saturday and therefore now only add that    i am with sincere esteem dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    july      london m dubourg cccxxxix to m dubourg  london    july      i greatly approve the epithet which you give in your letter of the  th of june to the new method of treating the smallpox which you call the tonic or bracing method i will take occasion from it to mention a practice to which i have accustomed myself you know the cold bath has long been in vogue here as a tonic but the shock of the cold water has always appeared to me generally speaking as too violent and i have found it much more agreeable to my constitution to bathe in another element i mean cold air with this view i rise almost every morning and sit in my chamber without any clothes whatever half an hour or an hour according to the season either reading or writing this practice is not in the least painful but on the contrary agreeable and if i return to bed afterwards before i dress myself as sometimes happens i make a supplement to my nights rest of one or two hours of the most pleasing sleep that can be imagined i find no ill consequences whatever resulting from it and that at least it does not injure my health if it does not in fact contribute much to its perservation i shall therefore call it for the future a bracing or tonic bath b franklin    benjamin franklin    july      london dupont de nemours cccxl to dupont de nemours  london    july      i received your obliging letter of the  0th may with the most acceptable present of your physiocratie which i have read with great pleasure and received from it a great deal of instruction there is such a freedom from local and national prejudices and partialities so much benevolence to mankind in general so much goodness mixt with the wisdom in the principles of your new philosophy that i am perfectly charmed with them and wish i could have stayed in    france for some time to have studied in your school that i might by conversing with its founders have made myself quite a master of that philosophy    i had before i went into your country seen some letters of yours to dr templeman that gave me a high opinion of the doctrines you are engaged in cultivating and of your personal talents and abilities which made me greatly desirous of seeing you since i had not that good fortune the next best thing is the advantage you are so good to offer me of your correspondence which i shall ever highly value and endeavor to cultivate with all the diligence i am capable of i am sorry to find that that wisdom which sees the welfare of the parts in the prosperity of the whole seems yet not to be known in this country     we are so far from conceiving that what is best for mankind or even for europe in general may be best for us that we are even studying to establish and extend a separate interest of britain to the prejudice of even ireland and our own colonies    it is from your philosophy only that the maxims of a contrary and more happy conduct are to be drawn which i therefore sincerely wish may grow and increase till it becomes the governing philosophy of the human species as it must be that of superior beings in better worlds i take the liberty of sending you a little fragment that has some tincture of it which on that account i hope may be acceptable be so good as to present my sincere respect to that venerable apostle dr quesnay and to the illustrious ami des hommes of whose civilities to me at paris i    retain a grateful remembrance and believe me to be with real and very great esteem sir your obliged and most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   august      john alleyne cccxli to john alleyne esq craven street   august      dear jack— you desire you say my impartial thoughts on the subject of an early marriage by way of answer to the numberless objections that have been made by numerous persons to your own you may remember when you consulted me on the occasion that i thought youth on both sides to be no objection indeed from the marriages that have fallen under my observation i am rather inclined to think that early ones stand the best chance of happiness the temper and habits of the young are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying as when more advanced in life they form more easily to each other and hence many occasions of disgust are removed and if youth has less of that prudence which is necessary to manage a family yet the parents and elder friends of young married persons are generally at hand to afford their advice which amply supplies that defect and by early marriage youth is sooner formed to regular and useful life and possibly some of those accidents or connexions that might have injured the constitution or reputation or both are thereby happily prevented particular circumstances of particular persons may    possibly sometimes make it prudent to delay entering into that state but in general when nature has rendered our bodies fit for it the presumption is in natures favor that she has not judged amiss in making us desire it late marriages are often attended too with this further inconvenience that there is not the same chance that the parents shall live to see their offspring educated late children says the spanish proverb are early orphans a melancholy reflection to those whose case it may be with us in america marriages are generally in the morning of life our children are therefore educated and settled in the world by noon and thus our business being done we have an afternoon and evening of cheerful leisure to ourselves such as our friend at present enjoys by these early marriages we are blessed with more children and from the mode among us founded by nature every mother suckling and nursing her own child more of them are raised thence the swift progress of population among us unparalleled in europe in fine i am glad you are married and congratulate you most cordially upon it you are now in the way of becoming a useful citizen and you have escaped the unnatural state of celibacy for life the fate of many here who never intended it but who having too long postponed the change of their condition find at length that it is too late to think of it and so live all their lives in a situation that greatly lessens a mans value an odd volume of a set of books bears not the value of its proportion to the set what think you of the odd half of a pair of scissors it  0 cannot well cut any thing it may possibly serve to scrape a trencher pray make my compliments and best wishes acceptable to your bride i am old and heavy or i should ere this have presented them in person i shall make but small use of the old mans privilege that of giving advice to younger friends treat your wife always with respect it will procure respect to you not only from her but from all that observe it never use a slighting expression to her even in jest for slights in jest after frequent bandyings are apt to end in angry earnest be studious in your profession and you will be learned be industrious and frugal and you will be rich be sober and temperate and you will be healthy be in general virtuous and you will be happy at least you will by such conduct stand the best chance for such consequences i pray god to bless you both being ever your affectionate friend b franklin cccxlii a scheme for a new alphabet and reformed mode of spelling with remarks and examples concerning the same and an enquiry into its uses in a correspondence between miss stevenson and dr franklin written in the characters of the alphabet  i hope i shall be forgiven for observing that even our present printed and written characters are fundamentally the same the roman printed one is    certainly the neatest simplest and most legible of the two but for the sake of ease and rapidity in our writing it seems we there insert a number of joining or terminating strokes substitute curves for angles and give the letters a small inclination to which rules even the letters a g r and w are easily reconcilable this will cease to appear a remark of mere curiosity if applied to the deciphering of foreign correspondence but for this purpose i would add that the french in particular seem to treat the small upstroke in the letters h p and c as proceeding originally in an angle from the bottom of the downstroke they therefore begin it with a curve from the bottom and keep it all the way distinct hence forming their written r much like our written v this last letter v they again distinguish by a loop at the bottom which loop they often place where we place an outward curve the remarkable terminating s which they sometimes use seems intended for our printed s begun from the bottom but from corrupt writing inverted and put horizontally instead of vertically it is rather from bad writing than system that their n and m appear like u and w i could go on to speak of the formation of written and printed capitals but as this would be a work of mere curiosity i leave it for the readers amusement    table of the reformed alphabet sounded respectively as in the words in the column below characters  o old awphon john

asterisk  to distinguish them and show how few new sounds are proposed    table of the reformed alphabet names of letters as expressed in the reformed sounds and characters manner of pronouncing the sounds o the first vowel naturally and deepest sound requires only to open the mouth and breathe through it awphon the next requiring the mouth opened a little more or hollower a the next a little more e the next requires the tongue to be a little more elevated i the next still more u the next requires the lips to be gathered up leaving a small opening uhphon the next a very short vowel the sound of which we should express in our present letters thus uh a short and not very strong aspiration huh a stronger or more forcible aspiration gi the first consonant being formed by the root of the tongue this is the present hard g ki a kindred sound a little more acute to be used instead of the hard c ish a new letter wanted in our language our sh separately taken not being proper elements of the sound ing a new letter wanted for the same reason—these are formed back in the mouth en formed more forward in the mouth the tip of the tongue to the roof of the mouth r the same the tip of the tongue a little loose or separate from the roof of the mouth and vibrating ti the tip of the tongue more forward touching and then leaving the roof di the same touching a little fuller el the same touching just about the gums of the upper teeth es this sound is formed by the breath passing between the moist end of the tongue and the upper teeth ez the same a little denser and duller ethphon the tongue under and a little behind the upper teeth touching them but so as to let the breath pass between edhphon the same a little fuller ef formed by the lower lip against the upper teeth ev the same fuller and duller b the lips full together and opened as the air passes out pi the same but a thinner sound em the closing of the lips while the e here annexed is sounding    remarks on the alphabetical table o  it is endeavoured to give the alphabet a more natural order beginning first with the simple sounds formed by the breath with none or very little help of tongue teeth and lips and produced chiefly in the windpipe to  y huh  g k  then coming forward to those formed by the roof of the tongue next to the windpipe r n  then to those formed more forward by the fore part of the tongue against the roof of the mouth t d  l  then those formed still more forward in the mouth by the tip of the tongue applied first to the roots of the upper teeth s z  thphon th  then to those formed by the tip of the tongue applied to the ends or edges of the upper teeth dhphon dh  f  then to those formed still more forward by the under lip applied to the upper teeth v  b  then to those formed yet more forward by the upper and under lip opening to let out the sounding breath p  m  and lastly ending with the shutting up of the mouth or closing the lips while any vowel is sounding in this alphabet c is omitted as unnecessary k supplying its hard sound and s the soft k also supplies    well the place of q and with an s added the place of x q and x are therefore omitted the vowel u being sounded as oo makes the w unnecessary the y where used simply is supplied by i and where as a diphthong by two vowels that letter is therefore omitted as useless the jod j is also omitted its sound being supplied by the new letter shphon ish which serves other purposes assisting in the formation of other sounds thus the shphon with a d before it gives the sound of the jod j and soft g as in james january giant gentle dshphoneems dshphonanueri dshphonyiant dshphonentel with a t before it it gives the sound of ch as in cherry chip tshphoneri tshphonip and with a z before it the french sound of the jod j as in jamais zshphoname thus the g has no longer two different sounds which occasioned confusion but is as every letter ought to be confined to one the same is to be observed in all the letters vowels and consonants that wherever they are met with or in whatever company their sound is always the same it is also intended that there be no superfluous letters used in spelling that is no letter that is not sounded and this alphabet by six new letters provides that there be no distinct sounds in the language without letters to express them as to the difference between short and long vowels it is naturally expressed by a single vowel where short a double one where long as for mend write mend but for remaind write remeend for did write did but for deed write diid c what in our common alphabet is supposed the    third vowel i as we sound it is as a diphthong consisting of two of our vowels joined viz uhphon as sounded in into and i in its true sound any one will be sensible of this who sounds those two vowels uhphon i quick after each other the sound begins uhphon and ends ii the true sound of the i is that we now give to e in the words deed keep though a single vowel appears to be put in the table for did and deed equally yet in the remarks—above—the latter is made to require two is perhaps the same doubling of the vowel is meant for name and lane for certainly name is not pronounced as nem in the expression nem con corresponding to the sound in men some critics may probably think that these two sets of sounds are so distinct as to require different characters to express them since in mem pronounced affectedly for maam—madam—and corresponding in sound to men the lips are kept close to the teeth and perpendicular to each other but in maim corresponding in sound to name the lips are placed poutingly and flat towards each other a remark that might be applied with little variation to did and deed compared as this is a subject i have never much examined it becomes me only to add that spelling may be considered as an analysis of the operations of the organs of speech where each separate letter has to represent a different movement and that among these organs of speech we are to enumerate the epiglottis and perhaps even the lungs themselves not merely as furnishing air for sound but as modifying the sound of that air both in inhaling and expelling it    examples   so huen suhphonm endshphonel buhphoni divuhphonin kamand   uidhphon ruhphonizingphon tempests shphoneeks e gilti land   suhphontshphon az awphonv leet or peel

child— it feels very strange to have ships and packets come in and no letters from you but i do not complain of it because i know the reason is my having written to you that i was coming home that you may not have the same disagreeable sensation i write this line though i have written largely by the late ship and therefore have little left to say i have lately been in the country to spend a few days at friends houses and to breathe a little fresh air i have made no very long journey this summer as usual finding myself in very good health a greater share of which i believe few enjoy at my time of life but we are not to expect it will be always sunshine cousin folger who is just arrived from boston tells me he saw our son and daughter bache at that place and that they were going farther being very well which i was glad to hear my love to them and all friends from your ever affectionate husband b franklin    joseph galloway    october      philadelphia benjamin franklin cccxliv from joseph galloway to b franklin philadelphia    october      dear sir— i have for some time omitted to write to you from an apprehension that my letters might not meet you in england but finding by your favor of august   th now before me that you have altered your intention of seeing america this fall i again resume my pen the new assembly of this province chiefly composed of the old members adjourned on saturday last to the  d of january they have again appointed yourself and mr jackson their agents to whom i enclose a letter from the committee of correspondence you will perceive by it that they have a sixth time renewed the instructions relating to a change of government every member now approving of the measure save the chiefjustice so that you are not to judge of the desire of the house to have the measure accomplished by the brevity of the letter which was occasioned by the shortness of their sitting and the fulness of the instructions of former houses which rendered much on the subject unnecessary i am much obliged by the particular account of the situation in which this matter stands no part of it which you wish to be concealed shall transpire you really judge right should the petitions be rejected or neglected the crown will never have the like request made by the people nor such another opportunity of resuming one of the most beneficial governments in    america their own welfare will oblige them to court the proprietary favor and should they continue to gratify the people by the lenient measures adopted during the last year they will place all their confidence in them and lose all ideas of loyalty or affection to the person where alone they ought to be fixed the revenues of our proprietaries are immense not much short at this time of one hundred thousand pounds per annum and had they as much policy as money they might easily find means with their vast treasure so to endear themselves to the people as to prevail on them to forget all duty and affection to others as to the peoples paying it never can be done nor is it just they should nor would they ever agree to establish fixed salaries on governors for the reasons you have mentioned it is truly discouraging to a people who wish well to the mother country and by their dutiful behaviour during these times of american confusion have recommended themselves to the crown to have an application so honorable and beneficial to the latter so much neglected would the ministry coolly attend to the matter it would certainly be otherwise however i am convinced should the people once despair of the change either the greatest confusion or the consequence you have pointed out will assuredly ensue two regiments commanded by colonel dalrymple are arrived at boston and we learn the town is providing quarters for them so that i hope the mischiefs which some have thought would attend that measure will not follow great pains have been    taken in this city by some hotheaded indiscreet men to raise a spirit of violence against the late act of parliament but the design was crushed in its beginning by our friends so effectually that i think we shall not soon have it renewed your continuance in london this winter gives the assembly much satisfaction as there is a great probability that american affairs will come before the present parliament and they have the fullest confidence in you my good friend governor franklin is now at fort stanwix with sir william johnson where a treaty is holding respecting a general boundary i have had a letter from him since his arrival there and he is well i write in much hurry which will apologize for incorrectness believe me my dear friend with the most perfect esteem c joseph galloway benjamin franklin october      london mary stevenson cccxlv to miss mary stevenson london october      i see very clearly the unhappiness of your situation and that it does not arise from any fault in you i pity you most sincerely i should not however have thought of giving you advice on this occasion if you had not requested it believing as i do that your own good sense is more than sufficient to direct you in every point of duty to others and yourself if then i should advise you to any thing that may    be contrary to your own opinion do not imagine that i shall condemn you if you do not follow such advice i shall only think that from a better acquaintance with circumstances you form a better judgment of what is fit for you to do now i conceive with you that —— both from her affection to you and from the long habit of having you with her would really be miserable without you her temper perhaps was never of the best and when that is the case age seldom mends it much of her unhappiness must arise from thence and since wrong turns of mind when confirmed by time are almost as little in our power to cure as those of the body i think with you that her case is a compassionable one if she had through her own imprudence brought on herself any grievous sickness i know you would think it your duty to attend and nurse her with filial tenderness even were your own health to be endangered by it your apprehension therefore is right that it may be your duty to live with her though inconsistent with your happiness and your interest but this can only mean present interest and present happiness for i think your future greater and more lasting interest and happiness will arise from the reflection that you have done your duty and from the high rank you will ever hold in the esteem of all that know you for having persevered in doing that duty under so many and great discouragements my advice then must be that you return to her as soon as the time proposed for your visit is expired and that you continue by every means in your power    to make the remainder of her days as comfortable to her as possible invent amusements for her be pleased when she accepts of them and patient when she perhaps peevishly rejects them i know this is hard but i think you are equal to it not from any servility of temper but from abundant goodness in the meantime all your friends sensible of your present uncomfortable situation should endeavour to ease your burden by acting in concert with you and to give her as many opportunities as possible of enjoying the pleasures of society for your sake nothing is more apt to sour the temper of aged people than the apprehension that they are neglected and they are extremely apt to entertain such suspicions it was therefore that i proposed asking her to be of our late party but your mother disliking it the motion was dropped as some others have been by my too great easiness contrary to my judgment not but that i was sensible her being with us might have lessened our pleasure but i hoped it might have prevented you some pain in fine nothing can contribute to true happiness that is inconsistent with duty nor can a course of action conformable to it be finally without an ample reward for god governs and he is good i pray him to direct you and indeed you will never be without his direction if you humbly ask it and show yourself always ready to obey it farewell my dear friend and believe me ever sincerely and affectionately yours b franklin    benjamin franklin    november      london cccxlvi to a friend london    november      dear sir— i received your obliging favor of the   th instant your sentiments of the importance of the present dispute between great britain and the colonies appear to me extremely just there is nothing i wish for more than to see it amicably and equitably settled but providence will bring about its own ends by its own means and if it intends the downfall of a nation that nation will be so blinded by its pride and other passions as not to see its danger or how its fall may be prevented being born and bred in one of the countries and having lived long and made many agreeable connexions of friendship in the other i wish all prosperity to both but i have talked and written so much and so long on the subject that my acquaintance are weary of hearing and the public of reading any more of it which begins to make me weary of talking and writing especially as i do not find that i have gained any point in either country except that of rendering myself suspected by my impartiality —in england of being too much an american and in america of being too much an englishman your opinion however weighs with me and encourages me to try one effort more in a full though concise statement of facts accompanied with arguments drawn from those facts to be published about the meeting of parliament    after the holidays if any good may be done i shall rejoice but at present i almost despair have you ever seen the barometer so low as of late the   d instant mine was at      and yet the weather fine and fair with sincere esteem i am dear friend yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    december      london deborah franklin cccxlvii to mrs deborah franklin london    december      my dear child— i wonder to hear that my friends were backward in bringing you my letters when they arrived and think it must be a mere imagination of yours the effect of some melancholy humor you happened then to be in i condole with you sincerely on poor debbys account and i hope she got well to her husband with her two children you say in yours of october   th for me to give you any uneasiness about your affairs here would be of no service and i shall not at this time enter on it i am made by this to apprehend that something is amiss and perhaps have more uneasiness from the uncertainty than i should have had if you had told me what it was i wish therefore you would be explicit in your next i rejoice that my good old friend mr coleman is got safe home and continues well remember me respectfully to mr rhoads mr wharton mr roberts mr and mrs duffield neighbour    thomson dr and mrs redman mrs hopkinson mr duché dr morgan mr hopkinson and all the other friends you have from time to time mentioned as inquiring after me as you ask me i can assure you that i do really intend god willing to return in the summer and that as soon as possible after settling matters with mr foxcroft whom i expect in april or may i am glad that you find so much reason to be satisfied with mr bache i hope all will prove for the best captain falconer has been arrived at plymouth some time but the winds being contrary could get no farther so i have not yet received the apples meal c and fear they will be spoiled i send with this some of the new kind of oats much admired here to make oatmeal of and for other uses as being free from husks and some swiss barley six rows to an ear perhaps our friends may like to try them and you may distribute the seed among them give some to mr roberts mr rhoads mr thomson mr bartram our son and others i hope the cold you complain of in two of your letters went off without any ill consequences we are as you observe blest with a great share of health considering our years now sixtythree for my own part i think of late that my constitution rather mends i have had but one touch of the gout and that a light one since i left you it was just after my arrival here so that this is the fourth winter i have been free walking a great deal tires me less than it used to do i feel stronger and more active yet i would not have you think that i fancy i shall  0 grow young again i know that men of my bulk often fail suddenly i know that according to the course of nature i cannot at most continue much longer and that the living even of another day is uncertain i therefore now form no schemes but such as are of immediate execution indulging myself in no future prospect except one that of returning to philadelphia there to spend the evening of life with my friends and family mr and mrs strahan and mr and mrs west when i last saw them desired to be kindly remembered to you mrs stevenson and our polly send their love mr coombe who seems a very agreeable young man lodges with us for the present adieu my dear debby i am as ever your affectionate husband b franklin benjamin franklin michael collinson cccxlviii to michael collinson esq date uncertain dear sir— understanding that on account of our dear departed friend mr peter collinson  is intended    to be given to the public i cannot omit expressing my approbation of the design the characters of good men are exemplary and often stimulate the welldisposed to an imitation beneficial to mankind and honorable to themselves and as you may be unacquainted with the following instance of his zeal and usefulness in promoting knowledge which fell within my observation i take the liberty of informing you that in    0 a subscription library being set on foot at philadelphia he encouraged the design by making several very valuable presents to it and procuring others from his friends and as the library company had a considerable sum arising annually to be laid out in books and needed a judicious friend in london to transact the business for them he voluntarily and cheerfully undertook that service and executed it for more than thirty years successively assisting in the choice of books and taking the whole care of collecting and shipping them without ever charging or accepting any consideration for his trouble the success of this library greatly owing to his kind countenance and good advice encouraged the erecting others in different places on the same plan and it is supposed there are now upwards of thirty subsisting in the several colonies which have contributed greatly to the spreading of useful knowledge in that part of the world the books he recommended being all of that kind and the catalogue of    the first library being much respected and followed by those libraries that succeeded during the same time he transmitted to the directors of the library the earliest account of every new european improvement in agriculture and the arts and every philosophical discovery among which in      he sent over an account of the new german experiments in electricity together with a glass tube and some directions for using it so as to repeat those experiments this was the first notice i had of that curious subject which i afterwards prosecuted with some diligence being encouraged by the friendly reception he gave to the letters i wrote to him upon it please to accept this small testimony of mine to his memory for which i shall ever have the utmost respect and believe me with sincere esteem dear sir your most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   january      london lord kames cccxlix to lord kames london   january      my dear friend— it is always a great pleasure to me to hear from you and would be a much greater to be with you to converse with you on the subjects you mention or any other possibly i may one day enjoy that pleasure in the meantime we may use the privilege that the knowledge of letters affords us of conversing at a distance by the pen    i am glad to find you are turning your thoughts to political subjects and particularly to those of money taxes manufactures and commerce the world is yet much in the dark on these important points and many mischievous mistakes are continually made in the management of them most of our acts of parliament for regulating them are in my opinion little better than political blunders owing to the ignorance of science or to the designs of crafty men who mislead the legislature proposing something under the specious appearance of public good while the real aim is to sacrifice that to their private interest i hope a good deal of light may be thrown on these subjects by your sagacity and acuteness i only wish i could first have engaged you in discussing the weighty points in dispute between britain and the colonies but the long letter i wrote you for that purpose in february or march      perhaps never reached your hand for i have not yet had a word from you in answer to it  the act you inquire about had its rise thus during the war virginia issued great sums of paper money for the payment of their troops to be sunk in a number of years by taxes the british merchants trading thither received these bills in payment for their goods purchasing tobacco with them to send home the crop of tobacco one or two years falling short the factors who were desirous of making a speedy remittance sought to pay with the paper money bills of exchange the number of bidders for these bills raised the price of them thirty per cent    above par this was deemed so much loss to the purchasers and supposed to arise from a depreciation of the paper money the merchants on this supposition founded a complaint against that currency to the board of trade lord hillsborough then at the head of that board took up the matter strongly and drew a report which was presented to the king in council against all paper currency in the colonies and though there was no complaint against it from any merchants but those trading to virginia all those trading to the other colonies being satisfied with its operation yet the ministry proposed and the parliament came into the making a general act forbidding all future emissions of paper money that should be a legal tender in any colony whatever the virginia merchants have since had the mortification to find that if they had kept the paper money a year or two the abovementioned loss would have been avoided for as soon as tobacco became more plenty and of course bills of exchange also the exchange fell as much as it before had risen i was in america when the act passed on my return to england i got the merchants trading to new york pennsylvania maryland virginia c to meet to consider and join in an application to have the restraining act repealed to prevent this application a copy was put into the merchants hands of lord hillsboroughs report by which it was supposed they might be convinced that such an application would be wrong they desired my sentiments on it which i gave in the paper i send you enclosed i have no copy by me of the report itself but in my answer    you will see a faithful abridgment of all the arguments or reasons it contained lord hillsborough has read my answer but says he is not convinced by it and adheres to his former opinion we know nothing can be done in parliament that the minister is absolutely against and therefore we let that point rest for the present and as i think a scarcity of money will work with our other present motives for lessening our fond extravagance in the use of the superfluous manufactures of this country which unkindly grudges us the enjoyment of common rights and will tend to lead us naturally into industry and frugality i am grown more indifferent about the repeal of the act and if my countrymen will be advised by me we shall never ask it again  there is not as i conceive any new principle wanting to account for the operations of air and all the affections of smoke in rooms and chimneys but it is difficult to advise in particular cases at a distance where one cannot have all the circumstances under view if two rooms and chimneys are perfectly similar in situation dimension and all other circumstances it seems not possible that in summer when no fire had been in either of them for some months and in a calm day a current of air should at the same time go up the chimney of the one and down the chimney of the other but such difference may and often does take place from circumstances in which they are dissimilar and which dissimilarity is not very obvious to those who have little studied the subject as to your particular case which you describe to    be that after a whole days fire which must greatly heat the vent yet when the fire becomes low so as not to emit any smoke neighbour smoke immediately begins to descend and fill the room this if not owing to particular winds may be occasioned by a stronger fire in another room communicating with yours by a door the outer air being excluded by the outward doors being shut whereby the stronger fire finds it easier to be supplied with air down through the vent in which the weak fire is and thence through the communicating door than through the crevices if this is the circumstance you will find that a supply of air is only wanting that may be sufficient for both vents if this is not the circumstance send me if you please a complete description of your room its situation and connexion and possibly i may form a better judgment though i imagine your professor of natural philosophy mr russel or mr george clark may give you as good advice on the subject as i can but i shall take the liberty of sending you by the first convenient opportunity a collection of my philosophical papers lately published in which you will find something more relating to the motions of air in chimneys  to commence a conversation with you on your new project i have thrown some of my present sentiments into the concise form of aphorisms to be examined between us if you please and rejected or    corrected and confirmed as we shall find most proper i send them enclosed  with thanks for your good wishes and with unalterable esteem i remain my dear friend affectionately yours b franklin benjamin franklin   january      london john bartram cccl to john bartram london   january      my dear old friend— i received your kind letter of november  th and the box directed to the king is since come to hand i have written a line to our late dear friends son  who must be best acquainted with the usual manner of transacting your affairs here to know whether he will take charge of the delivery of it if not to request he would inform me how or to whom it is to be sent for the king i expect his answer in a day or two and i shall when i see him inquire how your pension is    hereafter to be applied for and received though i suppose he has written to you before this time  i hope your health continues as mine does hitherto but i wish you would now decline your long and dangerous peregrinations in search of new plants and remain safe and quiet at home employing your leisure hours in a work that is much wanted and which no one besides is so capable of performing i mean the writing a natural history of our country i imagine it would prove profitable to you and i am sure it would do you honor my respects and best wishes attend mrs bartram and your family with sincere esteem i am as ever your affectionate friend b franklin p s—january   th—the box is delivered according to mr michael collinsons directions at lord butes i have sent over some seed of naked oats and some of swiss barley six rows to one ear if you would choose to try some of it call on mrs franklin benjamin franklin    january      london m le roy cccli to m le roy london    january      dear sir— i received your obliging favor of november   th i presented your compliments to sir john pringle who was glad with me to hear of    your welfare and desired me to offer his best respects whenever i wrote to you the farmers letters were written by one mr dickinson of philadelphia and not by me as you seem to suppose i only caused them to be reprinted here with that little preface and had no other hand in them except that i see some of my sentiments formerly published are collected and interwoven with those of others and his own by the author i am glad they afforded you any amusement it is true as you have heard that troops are posted in boston on the pretence of preventing riots and protecting the customhouse officers but it is also true that there was no intention among the people there to oppose the landing of those troops or to resist the execution of the law by arms the riots talked of were sudden unpremeditated things that happened only among a few of the lower sort their plan of making war on this country is of a different kind it is to be a war on commerce only and consists in an absolute determination to buy and use no more of the manufactures of britain till the act is repealed this is already agreed to by four provinces and will be by all the rest in the ensuing summer eleven ships now here from boston and new york which would have carried one with another fifty thousand pounds sterling each in goods are going away in their ballast as the parliament seems determined not to repeal i am inclined to think however that it will alter its mind before the end of the session otherwise it is to be feared the breach will grow wider by successive indiscretions on both sides  0 the subject you propose to me the consequences of allowing a free exportation of corn the advantages or disadvantages of the concurrence c is a very extensive one and i have been and am at present so much occupied with our american affairs as that if i were ever so capable of handling it i have not time to engage in it at present to any purpose i think however with you that the true principles of commerce are yet but little understood and that most of the acts of parliament arrêts and edicts of princes and states relating to commerce are political errors solicited and obtained by particulars for private interest under the pretext of public good the bearer of this captain overy is a particular friend of mine who now only passes through paris for lyons and nice but in his return may stay in your city some time he is a gentleman of excellent character and great merit and as such i beg leave to recommend him to your civilities and advice which may be of great service to him as he is quite a stranger in paris with the greatest esteem and respect i am dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin p s—your english is extremely good but if it is more easy for you to write in french do not give yourself the trouble of writing in english as i understand your french perfectly well    benjamin franklin    february      london lord kames ccclii to lord kames london    february      my dear friend— i received your excellent paper on the preferable use of oxen in agriculture and have put it in the way of being communicated to the public here i have observed in america that the farmers are more thriving in those parts of the country where horned cattle are used than in those where the labor is done by horses the latter are said to require twice the quantity of land to maintain them and after all are not good to eat at least we do not think them so here is a waste of land that might afford subsistence for so many of the human species perhaps it was for this reason that the hebrew lawgiver having promised that the children of israel should be as numerous as the sands of the sea not only took care to secure the health of individuals by regulating their diet that they might be fitter for producing children but also forbade their using horses as these horses would lessen the quantity of subsistence for men thus we find when they took any horses from their enemies they destroyed them and in the commandments where the labor of the ox and ass is mentioned and forbidden on the sabbath there is no mention of the horse probably because they were to have none and by the great armies suddenly raised in that small territory they inhabited it appears to have been very full of people food is always necessary to all and much the    greatest part of the labor of mankind is employed in raising provisions for the mouth is not this kind of labor then the fittest to be the standard by which to measure the values of all other labor and consequently of all other things whose value depends on the labor of making or procuring them may not even gold and silver be thus valued if the labor of the farmer in producing a bushel of wheat be equal to the labor of the miner in producing an ounce of silver will not the bushel of wheat just measure the value of the ounce of silver the miner must eat the farmer indeed can live without the ounce of silver and so perhaps will have some advantage in settling the price but these discussions i leave to you as being more able to manage them only i will send you a little scrap i wrote some time since on the laws prohibiting foreign commodities i congratulate you on your election as president of your edinburgh society i think i formerly took notice to you in conversation that i thought there had been some similarity in our fortunes and the circumstances of our lives this is a fresh instance for by letters just received i find that i was about the same time chosen president of our american philosophical society established at philadelphia  i have sent by sea to the care of mr alexander a little box containing a few copies of the late editions of my books for my friends in scotland one is directed for you and one for your society which i    beg that you and they would accept as a small mark of my respect with the sincerest esteem and regard i am my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—i am sorry my letter of      concerning the american disputes miscarried i now send you a copy of it from my book the examination mentioned in it you have probably seen things daily wear a worse aspect and tend more and more to a breach and final separation benjamin franklin    february      london jane mecom cccliii to mrs jane mecom london    february      your political disputes i have no objection to if they are carried on with tolerable decency and do not become outrageously abusive they make people acquainted with their rights and the value of them but your squabbles about a bishop i wish to see speedily ended they seem to be unnecessary at present as the design of sending one is dropped and if it were not dropped i cannot think it a matter of such moment as to be a sufficient reason for division among you when there never was more need of your being united i do not conceive that bishops residing in america would either be of such advantage to episcopalians or such disadvantage to antiepiscopalians as either seem to imagine    each party abuses the other the profane and the infidel believe both sides and enjoy the fray the reputation of religion in general suffers and its enemies are ready to say not what was said in the primitive times behold how these christians love one another—but mark how these christians hate one another indeed when religious people quarrel about religion or hungry people about their victuals it looks as if they had not much of either among them b franklin benjamin franklin    february      london samuel cooper cccliv to samuel cooper at boston london    february      dear sir— i received your favor by mr jeffries i should have been glad if in any thing i could have served him here the part i took in the application for your degree  was merely doing justice to merit which is the duty of an honest man whenever he has the opportunity i did that duty indeed with pleasure and satisfaction to myself which was sufficient but i own the pleasure is greatly increased by finding that you are so good as to accept my endeavours kindly i was about to return home last summer and had some thoughts of doing it by way of boston but the untoward situation of american affairs here induced    my friends to advise my staying another winter i should have been happy in doing any service to our country the tide is yet strong against us and our endeavours to turn it have hitherto had but little effect but it must turn if your frugal and industrious resolutions continue your old governor mr pownall appears a warm and zealous friend to the colonies in parliament but unfortunately he is very ill heard at present i have been in constant pain since i heard of troops assembling at boston lest the madness of mobs or the insolence of soldiers or both should when too near each other occasion some mischief difficult to be prevented or repaired and which might spread far and wide i hope however that prudence will predominate and keep all quiet a great cause between the city of london and the dissenters was decided here the year before last in the house of lords no account of it has been printed but one having been taken in writing i obtained a copy of it which i send you supposing it may afford you and your friends some pleasure  please to present my respectful compliments to mrs cooper and to mr bowdoin when you see him with sincere and great esteem i am c b franklin    benjamin franklin    march      london john winthrop ccclv to john winthrop london    march      dear sir— at length after much delay and difficulty i have been able to obtain your telescope that was made by mr short before his death his brother who succeeds in the business has fitted it up and completed it he has followed the business many years at edinburgh is reckoned very able and therefore i hope every thing will be found all right but as it is only just finished i have no time left to get any philosophical or astronomical friends to examine it as i intended the ship being on the point of sailing and a future opportunity uncertain enclosed is his directionpaper for opening and fixing it i have not yet got the bill of the price it is to be made from the deceased mr shorts book of memorandums and orders in which he entered this order of ours and as it is supposed the price i do not remember it is so long since whether it was one hundred pounds or one hundred guineas and the book is in the hands of the executor as i understand when i have the account i shall pay it as i did birds for the transit instrument which was forty guineas and then shall apply for the whole to mr mauduit by the way i wonder that i have not heard from you of the receipt of that instrument which went from hence in september by captain watt i hope it got safe to hand and gave satisfaction    the ship was the same that mr rogers went in who i hear is arrived and by him too i sent the philosophical transactions with a number of copies of your paper as printed separately but i have no letter from you since that by the young gentleman you recommended to me grandson to sir william pepperell which i think was dated about the beginning of october when you could not have received them by a late ship i sent your college a copy of the new edition of my philosophical papers and others i think for yourself and for mr bowdoin i should apologize to you for inserting therein some part of our correspondence without first obtaining your permission but as mr bowdoin had favored me with his consent for what related to him i ventured to rely upon your good nature as to what related to you and i hope you will forgive me i have got from mr ellicot the glasses c of the long galilean telescope which he presents to your college i put them into the hands of mr nairne the optician to examine and put them in order i thought to have sent them by this ship but am disappointed they shall go by the next if possible there is nothing new here in the philosophical way at present with great and sincere esteem i am dear sir your most obedient and humble servant b franklin ps—there is no prospect of getting the duty acts repealed this session if ever your steady resolutions    to consume no more british goods may possibly if persisted in have a good effect another year i apprehend the parliamentary resolves and addresses will tend to widen the breach enclosed i send you governor pownalls speech against those resolves his name is not to be mentioned he appears to me a hearty friend of america though i find he is suspected by some on account of his connexions ccclvi positions to be examined concerning national wealth dated april          all food or subsistence for mankind arises from the earth or waters   necessaries of life that are not food and all other conveniences have their values estimated by the proportion of food consumed while we are employed in procuring them   a small people with a large territory may subsist on the productions of nature with no other labor than that of gathering the vegetables and catching the animals   a large people with a small territory find these insufficient and to subsist must labor the earth to make it produce greater quantities of vegetable food suitable for the nourishment of men and of the animals they intend to eat   from this labor arises a great increase of    vegetable and animal food and of materials for clothing as flax wool silk c the superfluity of these is wealth with this wealth we paid for the labor employed in building our houses cities c which are therefore only subsistence metamorphosed   manufactures are only another shape into which so much provisions and subsistence are turned as were equal in value to the manufactures produced this appears from hence that the manufacturer does not in fact obtain from the employer for his labor more than a mere subsistence including raiment fuel and shelter all which derive their value from the provisions consumed in procuring them   the produce of the earth thus converted into manufactures may be more easily carried to distant markets than before such conversion   fair commerce is where equal values are exchanged for equal the expense of transport included thus if it costs a in england as much labor and charge to raise a bushel of wheat as it costs b in france to produce four gallons of wine then are four gallons of wine the fair exchange for a bushel of wheat a and b meeting at half distance with their commodities to make the exchange the advantage of this fair commerce is that each party increases the number of his enjoyments having instead of wheat alone or wine alone the use of both wheat and wine   where the labor and expense of producing both commodities are known to both parties bargains will generally be fair and equal where they are known  0 to one party only bargains will often be unequal knowledge taking its advantage of ignorance  0 thus he that carries one thousand bushels of wheat abroad to sell may not probably obtain so great a profit thereon as if he had first turned the wheat into manufactures by subsisting therewith the workmen while producing those manufactures since there are many expediting and facilitating methods of working not generally known and strangers to the manufactures though they know pretty well the expense of raising wheat are unacquainted with those short methods of working and thence being apt to suppose more labor employed in the manufactures than there really is are more easily imposed on in their value and induced to allow more for them than they are honestly worth     thus the advantage of having manufactures in a country does not consist as is commonly supposed in their highly advancing the value of rough materials of which they are formed since though six    pennyworth of flax may be worth twenty shillings when worked into lace yet the very cause of its being worth twenty shillings is that besides the flax it has cost nineteen shillings and sixpence in subsistence to the manufacturer but the advantage of manufactures is that under their shape provisions may be more easily carried to a foreign market and by their means our traders may more easily cheat strangers  few where it is not made are judges of the value of lace the importer may demand forty and perhaps get thirty shillings for that which cost him but twenty    finally there seem to be but three ways for a nation to acquire wealth the first is by war as the romans did in plundering their conquered neighbours this is robbery the second by commerce which is generally cheating the third by agriculture the only honest way wherein man receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the ground in a kind of continual miracle wrought by the hand of god in his favor as a reward for his innocent life and his virtuous industry    benjamin franklin    april      london samuel cooper ccclvii to samuel cooper london    april      dear sir— i received your favor of february   th by captain carver and thank you for giving me an opportunity of being acquainted with so great a traveller i shall be glad if i can render him any service here  the parliament remain fixed in their resolution not to repeal the duty acts this session and will rise next tuesday i hope my country folks will remain as fixed in their resolutions of industry and frugality till these acts are repealed and if i could be sure of that i should almost wish them never to be repealed being persuaded that we shall reap more solid and extensive advantages from the steady practice of those two great virtues than we can possibly suffer damage from all the duties the parliament of this    kingdom can levy on us they flatter themselves you cannot long subsist without their manufactures they believe you have not virtue enough to persist in such agreements they imagine the colonies will differ among themselves deceive and desert one another and quietly one after the other submit to the yoke and return to the use of british fineries they think that though the men may be contented with homespun stuffs the women will never get the better of their vanity and fondness for english modes and gewgaws the ministerial people all talk in this strain and many even of the merchants i have ventured to assert that they will all find themselves mistaken and i rely so much on the spirit of my country as to be confident i shall not be found a false prophet though at present not believed i hope nothing that has happened or may happen will diminish in the least our loyalty to our sovereign or affection for this nation in general i can scarcely conceive a king of better dispositions of more exemplary virtues or more truly desirous of promoting the welfare of all his subjects the experience we have had of the family in the two preceding mild reigns and the good temper of our young princes so far as can yet be discovered promise us a continuance of this felicity  the body of this people    too is of a noble and generous nature loving and honoring the spirit of liberty and hating arbitrary power of all sorts we have many very many friends among them but as to the parliament though i might excuse that which made the acts as being surprised and misled into the measure i know not how to excuse this which under the fullest conviction of its being a wrong one resolves to continue it it is decent indeed in your public papers to speak as you do of the wisdom and the justice of parliament but now that the subject is more thoroughly understood if this new parliament had been really wise it would not have refused even to receive a petition against the acts and if it had been just it would have repealed them and refunded the money perhaps it may be wiser and juster another year but that is not to be depended on if under all the insults and oppressions you are now exposed to you can prudently as you have lately done continue quiet avoiding tumults but still resolutely keeping up your claims and asserting your rights you will finally establish them and this military cloud that now blusters over you will pass away and do no more harm than a summer thunder shower    but the advantages of your perseverance in industry and frugality will be great and permanent your debts will be paid your farms will be better improved and yield a greater produce your real wealth will increase in a plenty of every useful home production and all the true enjoyments of life even though no foreign trade should be allowed you and this handicraft shopkeeping state will for its own sake learn to behave more civilly to its customers  your late governor mr pownall appears a hearty friend to america he moved last week for a repeal of the acts and was seconded by general conway sir george saville mr jackson mr trecothick and others but did not succeed a friend has favored me with a copy of the notes taken of mr pownalls speech which i send you believing it will be agreeable to you and some other of our friends to see them you will observe in some parts of it the    language a member of parliament is obliged to hold on american topics if he would at all be heard in the house he has given notice that he will renew the motion at the next and every session all ireland is strongly in favor of the american cause they have reason to sympathize with us i send you four pamphlets written in ireland or by irish gentlemen here in which you will find some excellent wellsaid things with the greatest esteem i am my dear friend c b franklin benjamin franklin    april      london jane mecom ccclviii to mrs jane mecom london    april      —— mrs stevenson has executed your order and sends the things in a bandbox directed to you a newfashioned something that was not ready when the box was packed up is enclosed in her letter i am now grown too old to be ambitious of such a station as that which you say has been mentioned to you repose is more fit for me and much more suitable to my wishes there is no danger of such a thing being offered to me and i am sure i shall never ask it but if it were offered i certainly could not accept it to act under such instructions as i know must be given with it so you may be quite easy on that head     the account you write of the growing industry frugality and good sense of my countrywomen gives me more pleasure than you can imagine for from thence i presage great advantages to our country i should be sorry that you are engaged in a business which happens not to coincide with the general interest if you did not acquaint me that you are now near the end of it b franklin ccclxix to the london chronicle  mr chronicle sir— while the public attention is so much turned towards america every letter from thence that    promises new information is pretty generally read it seems therefore the more necessary that care should be taken to disabuse the public when those letters contain facts false in themselves and representations injurious to bodies of people or even to private persons in your paper no   0 i found an extract of a letter said to be from a gentleman in general abercrombies army as there are several strokes in it tending to render the colonies despicable and even odious to the mother country which may have ill consequences and no notice having been taken of the injuries contained in that letter other letters of the same nature have since been published permit me to make a few observations on it the writer says new england was settled by presbyterians and independents who took shelter there from the persecutions of archbishop laud they still retain their original character they generally hate the church of england says he it is very true that if some resentment still remained for the hardships their fathers suffered it might perhaps be not much wondered at but the fact is that the moderation of the present church of england towards dissenters in old as well as new england had quite effaced those impressions the dissenters too are become less rigid and scrupulous and the goodwill between those different bodies in that country is now both mutual and equal he goes on they came out with a levelling spirit and they retain it they cannot bear to think that one man should be exorbitantly rich and another    poor so that except in the seaport towns there are few great estates among them this equality produces also a rusticity of manners for their language dress and in all their behaviour they are more boorish than any thing you ever saw in a certain northern latitude one would imagine from this account that those who were growing poor plundered those who were growing rich to preserve this equality and that property had no protection whereas in fact it is nowhere more secure than in the new england colonies the law is nowhere better executed or justice obtained at less expense the equality he speaks of arises first from a more equal distribution of lands by the assemblies in the first settlement than has been practised in the other colonies where favourites of governors have obtained enormous tracts for trifling considerations to the prejudice both of the crown revenues and the public good and secondly from the nature of their occupation husbandmen with small tracts of land though they may by industry maintain themselves and families in mediocrity having few means of acquiring great wealth especially in a young colony that is to be supplied with its clothing and many other expensive articles of consumption from the mother country their dress the gentleman may be a more critical judge of than i can pretend to be all i know of it is that they wear the manufacture of britain and follow its fashions perhaps too closely every remarkable change in the mode making its appearance there within a few months after its invention here a natural effect of their constant intercourse with england by ships  0 arriving almost every week from the capital their respect for the mother country and admiration of every thing that is british but as to their language i must beg this gentlemans pardon if i differ from him his ear accustomed perhaps to the dialect practised in the certain northern latitude he mentions may not be qualified to judge so nicely what relates to pure english and i appeal to all englishmen here who have been acquainted with the colonists whether it is not a common remark that they speak the language with such an exactness both of expression and accent that though you may know the natives of several of the counties of england by peculiarities in their dialect you cannot by that means distinguish a north american all the new books and pamphlets worth reading that are published here in a few weeks are transmitted and found there where there is not a man or woman born in the country but what can read and it must i think be a pleasing reflection to those who write either for the benefit of the present age or of posterity to find their audience increasing with the increase of our colonies and their language extending itself beyond the narrow bounds of these islands to a continent larger than all europe and to future empire as fully peopled which britain may one day probably possess in those vast western regions but the gentleman makes more injurious comparisons than these that latitude he says has this advantage over them that it has produced sharp acute men fit for war or learning whereas the others are remarkably    simple or silly and blunder eternally we have six thousand of their militia which the general would willingly exchange for two thousand regulars they are forever marring some one or other of our plans when sent to execute them they can indeed some of them at least range in the woods but three hundred indians with their yell throw three thousand of them in a panic and then they will leave nothing for the enemy to do for they will shoot one another and in the woods our regulars are afraid to be on a command with them on that very account i doubt mr chronicle that this paragraph when it comes to be read in america will have no good effect and rather increase that inconvenient disgust which is too apt to arise between the troops of different corps or countries who are obliged to serve together will not a new england officer be apt to retort and say what foundation have you for this odious distinction in favour of the officers from your certain northern latitude they may as you say be fit for learning but surely that return of your first general with a wellappointed and sufficient force from his expedition against louisbourg without so much as seeing the place is not the most shining proof of his talents for war and no one will say his plan was marred by us for we were not with him was his successor who conducted the blundering attack and inglorious retreat from ticonderoga a new england man or one of that certain latitude then as to the comparison between regulars and provincials will not the latter remark that it was two thousand new england provincials with about one hundred and fifty regulars    that took the strong fort of beaudejour in the beginning of the war though in the accounts transmitted to the english gazette the honor was claimed by the regulars and little or no notice taken of the others that it was the provincials who beat general dieskau with his regulars canadians and yelling indians and sent him prisoner to england that it was a provincialborn officer with american batteauxmen that beat the french and indians on oswego river that it was the same officer with provincials who made that long and admirable march into the enemys country took and destroyed fort frontenac with the whole french fleet on the lakes and struck terror into the heart of canada that it was a provincial officer with provincials only who made another extraordinary march into the enemys country surprised and destroyed the indian town of kittanning bringing off the scalps of their chiefs that one ranging captain of a few provincials rogers has harassed the enemy more on the frontiers of canada and destroyed more of their men than the whole army of regulars that it was the regulars who surrendered themselves with the provincials under their command prisoners of war almost as soon as they were besieged with the forts fleets and all the provisions and stores that had been provided and amassed to so immense expense at oswego that it was the regulars who surrendered fort william henry and suffered themselves to be butchered and scalped with arms in their hands that it was the regulars under braddock who were thrown into a panic by the yells of three or four hundred indians in their confusion    shot one another and with five times the force of the enemy fled before them destroying all their own stores ammunition and provisions these regular gentlemen will the provincial rangers add may possibly be afraid as they say they are to be on a command with us in the woods but when it is considered that from all past experience the chance of our shooting them is not as one to a hundred compared with that of their being shot by the enemy may it not be suspected that what they give as the very account of their fear and unwillingness to venture out with us is only the very excuse and that a concern for their scalps weighs more with them than a regard for their honor such as these sir i imagine may be the reflections extorted by such provocation from the provincials in general but the new england men in particular will have reason to resent the remarks on their reduction of louisbourg your writer proceeds indeed they are all very ready to make their boast of taking louisbourg in      but if people were to be acquitted or condemned according to the propriety and wisdom of their plans and not according to their success the persons that undertook the siege merited little praise for i have heard officers who assisted at it say never was any thing more rash for had one single part of their plan failed or had the french made the fortieth part of the resistance then that they have made now every soul of the new englanders must have fallen in the trenches the garrison was weak sickly and destitute of provisions and disgusted and therefore became a ready prey    and when they returned to france were decimated for their gallant defence where then is the glory arising from thence after denying his facts that the garrison was weak wanted provisions made not a fortieth part of the resistance were decimated c the new england men will ask this regular gentleman if the place was well fortified and had as it really had a numerous garrison was it not at least brave to attack it with a handful of raw undisciplined militia if the garrison was as you say sickly disgusted destitute of provisions and ready to become a prey was it not prudent to seize the opportunity and put the nation in possession of so important a fortress at so small an expense so that if you will not allow the enterprise to be as we think it was both brave and prudent ought you not at least to grant it was either one or the other but is there no merit on this score in the people who though at first so greatly divided as to the making or forbearing the attempt that it was carried in the affirmative by the small majority of one vote only yet when it was once resolved on unanimously prosecuted the design and prepared the means with the greatest zeal and diligence so that the whole equipment was completely ready before the season would permit the execution is there no merit or praise in laying and executing their plan so well that as you have confessed not a single part of it failed if the plan was destitute of propriety and wisdom would it not have required the sharp acute men of the northern latitude to execute it that by supplying its deficiencies they might give it some chance of success but    if such remarkably silly simple blundering mar plans as you say we are could execute this plan so that not a single part of it failed does it not at least show that the plan itself must be laid with some wisdom and propriety is there no merit in the ardour with which all degrees and ranks of people quitted their private affairs and ranged themselves under the banners of their king for the honor safety and advantage of their country is there no merit in the profound secrecy guarded by a whole people so that the enemy had not the least intelligence of the design till they saw the fleet of transports cover the sea before their port is there none in the indefatigable labour the troops went through during the siege performing the duty of both men and horses the hardship they patiently suffered for want of tents and other necessaries the readiness with which they learnt to move direct and manage cannon raise batteries and form approaches the bravery with which they sustained sallies and finally in their consenting to stay and garrison the place after it was taken absent from their business and families till troops could be brought from england for that purpose though they undertook the service on a promise of being discharged as soon as it was over were unprovided for so long an absence and actually suffered ten times more loss by mortal sickness through want of necessaries than they suffered from the arms of the enemy the nation however had a sense of this undertaking different from the unkind one of this gentleman at the treaty of peace the possession of louisbourg was found of great advantage to our    affairs in europe and if the brave men that made the acquisition for us were not rewarded at least they were praised envy may continue a while to cavil and detract but public virtue will in the end obtain esteem and honest impartiality in this and future ages will not fail doing justice to merit your gentleman writer thus decently goes on the most substantial men of most of the provinces are children or grandchildren of those that came here at the kings expense—that is thieves highwaymen and robbers being probably a military gentleman this and therefore a person of nice honour if any one should tell him in the plainest language that what he here says is an absolute falsehood challenges and cutting of throats might immediately ensue i shall therefore only refer to his own account in this same letter of the peopling of new england which he says with more truth was by puritans who fled thither for shelter from the persecutions of archbishop laud is there not a wide difference between removing to a distant country to enjoy the exercise of religion according to a mans conscience and his being transported thither by a law as a punishment for his crimes this contradiction we therefore leave the gentleman and himself to settle as well as they can between them one would think from his account that the provinces were so many colonies from newgate the truth is not only lauds persecution but the other public troubles in the following reigns induced many thousand families to leave england and settle in the plantations during the predominance of the parliament many royalists removed    or were banished to virginia and barbadoes who afterwards spread into other settlements the catholics sheltered themselves in maryland at the restoration many of the deprived nonconformist ministers with their families friends and hearers went over towards the end of charles the seconds reign and during james the seconds the dissenters again flocked into america driven by persecution and dreading the introduction at home then the high price or reward of labour in the colonies and want of artisans there drew over many as well as the occasion of commerce and when once people begin to migrate every one has his little sphere of acquaintance and connections which he draws after him by invitation motives of interest praising his new settlement and other encouragements the most substantial men are descendants of those early settlers new comers not having yet had time to raise estates the practice of sending convicts thither is modern and the same indolence of temper and habits of idleness that make people poor and tempt them to steal in england continue with them when they are sent to america and must there have the same effects where all who live well owe their subsistence to labour and business and where it is a thousand times more difficult than here to acquire wealth without industry hence the instances of transported thieves advancing their fortunes in the colonies are extremely rare if there really is a single instance of it which i very much doubt but of their being advanced there to the gallows the instances are plenty might they not as well have been hanged    at home we call britain the mother country but what good mother would introduce thieves and criminals into the company of her children to corrupt and disgrace them and how cruel is it to force by the high hand of power a particular country of your subjects who have not deserved such usage to receive your outcasts repealing all the laws they make to prevent their admission and then reproach them with the detested mixture you have made their emptying their jails into our settlements says a writer of that country is an insult and contempt the cruellest perhaps that ever one people offered to another and would not be equalled even by emptying their jakes on tables the letter i have been considering mr chronicle is followed by another in your paper of tuesday the   th past said to be from an officer who attended brigadiergeneral forbes in his march from philadelphia to fort du quesne but written probably by the same gentleman who wrote the former as it seems calculated to raise the character of the officers of the certain northern latitude at the expense of the reputation of the colonies and the provincial forces according to this letterwriter if the pennsylvanians granted large supplies and raised a great body of troops for the last campaign this was not on account of mr pitts zeal for the kings service or even a regard for their own safety but it was owing to the generals proper management of the quakers and other parties in the province the withdrawing the indians from the french interest by negotiating a peace is all ascribed to the general and not a word    said of the honour of the poor quakers who first set these negotiations on foot or of honest frederick post that completed them with so much ability and success even the little merit of the assemblys making a law to regulate carriages is imputed to the generals multitude of letters then he tells us innumerable scouting parties had been sent out during a long period both by the general and colonel bouquet towards fort du quesne to catch a prisoner if possible for intelligence but never got any how happened that why it was the provincial troops that were constantly employed in that service and they it seems never do any thing they are ordered to do that however one would think might be easily remedied by sending regulars with them who of course must command them and may see that they do their duty no the regulars are afraid of being shot by the provincials in a panic then send all regulars aye that was what the colonel resolved upon intelligence was now wanted says the letterwriter col bouquet whose attention to business was only very considerable that is not quite so great as the generals for he was not of the northern latitude was determined to send no more provincials ascouting and how did he execute his determination why by sending major grant of the highlanders with seven hundred men three hundred of them highlanders the rest americans virginians and pennsylvanians no blunder this in our writer but a misfortune and he is nevertheless one of those acute sharp men who are fit for learning and how did this major  0 and seven hundred men succeed in catching the prisoner why their march to fort du quesne was so conducted the surprise was complete perhaps you may imagine gentle reader that this was a surprise of the enemy no such matter they knew every step of his motions and had every man of them left their fires and huts in the fields and retired into the fort but the major and his seven hundred men they were surprised—first to find nobody there at night and next to find themselves surrounded and cut to pieces in the morning two or three hundred being killed drowned or taken prisoners and among the latter the major himself those who escaped were also surprised at their own good fortune and the whole army was surprised at the majors bad management thus the surprise was indeed complete but not the disgrace for provincials were there to lay the blame on the misfortune we must not call it misconduct of the major was owing it seems to an unnamed and perhaps unknown provincial officer who it is said disobeyed his orders and quitted his post whence a formal conclusion is drawn that a planter is not to be taken from the plough and made an officer on a day unhappy provincials if success attends where you are joined with the regulars they claim all the honour though not a tenth part of your number if disgrace it is all yours though you happen to be a small part of the whole and have not the command as if regulars were in their nature invincible when not mixed with provincials and provincials of no kind of value without regulars happy is it for you that you were    neither present at prestonpans nor falkirk at the faint attempt against rochfort the rout of st cas or the hasty retreat from martinico every thing that went wrong or did not go right would have been ascribed to you our commanders would have been saved the labour of writing long apologies for their conduct it might have been sufficient to say provincials were with us a new englandman may        benjamin franklin    june      mary stevenson ccclx to miss mary stevenson tuesday morning    june      dear polly— agreeably to your orders delivered to me very punctually by temple i return you enclosed voltaires verses the translation i think full as good as the original remember that i am to have them again i take this opportunity to send you also a late paper containing a melancholy account of the distresses of some seamen you will observe in it the advantages they received from wearing their clothes constantly wet with salt water under the total want of fresh water to drink you may remember i recommended this practice many years ago do you know dr len and did you communicate it to him i fancy his name is wrong spelt in this paper and that it should be lind having seen in the review some extracts from a book on sea diseases published within these two or three years by one dr lind but    i have not seen the book and know not whether such a passage be in it i need not point out to you an observation in favor of our doctrine that you will make on reading this paper that having little to eat these poor people in wet clothes day and night caught no cold my respects to your aunt and love to all that love you yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london ccclxi to the committee of merchants in philadelphia london   july      gentlemen— i received yours of the   th of april enclosing copies of the articles of your agreements with respect to importation and of your letter to the merchants here the letter was published and universally spoken well of as a wellwritten sensible manly and spirited performance and i believe the publication has been of service to our cause you are in my opinion perfectly right in your supposition that the redress of american grievances likely to be proposed by the ministry will at first only be partial and that it is intended to retain some of the revenue duties in order to establish a right of parliament to tax the colonies but i hope that by persisting steadily in the measure you have so laudably entered into you will if backed by the general honest resolution of the people to buy british goods of no others but to manufacture for themselves or use    colony manufactures only be the means under god of recovering and establishing the freedom of our country entire and of handing it down complete to posterity and in the meantime the country will be enriched by its industry and frugality these virtues will become habitual farms will be more improved better stocked and rendered more productive by the money that used to be spent in superfluities our artificers of every kind will be enabled to carry on their business to more advantage gold and silver will become more plenty among us and trade will revive after things shall be well settled and become better and safer than it has lately been for an industrious frugal people are best able to buy and pay best for what they purchase with great regard i have the honor to be c b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london john bartram ccclxii to john bartram london   july      dear friend— it is with great pleasure i understand by your favor of april  0th that you continue to enjoy so good a share of health i hope it will long continue and although it may not now be suitable for you to make such wide excursions as heretofore you may yet be very useful to your country and to mankind if you sit down quietly at home digest the knowledge you have acquired and compile and publish the many observations you have made    and point out the advantages that may be drawn from the whole in public undertakings or particular private practice it is true many people are fond of accounts of old buildings and monuments but there is a number who would be much better pleased with such accounts as you could afford them and for one i confess that if i could find in any italian travels a receipt for making parmesan cheese it would give me more satisfaction than a transcript of any inscription from any old stone whatever i suppose mr michael collinson or dr fothergill has written to you what may be necessary for your information relating to your affairs here i imagine there is no doubt but the kings bounty to you will be continued and that it will be proper for you to continue sending now and then a few such curious seeds as you can procure to keep up your claim and now i mention seeds i wish you would send me a few of such as are least common to the value of a guinea which mr foxcroft will pay you for me they are for a particular friend who is very curious if in any thing i can serve you here command freely your affectionate friend b franklin benjamin franklin    july      london james bowdoin ccclxiii to james bowdoin london    july      dear sir— i am honored with yours of may  0th and agree with you perfectly in your sentiments of public affairs government here seems now to be    growing more moderate with regard to america and i am persuaded that by a steady prudent conduct we shall finally obtain all our important points and establish american liberty on a clearer and firmer foundation the folly of the late measures begins to be seen and understood at court their promoters grow out of credit and the trading part of the nation with the manufacturers are become sensible how necessary it is for their welfare to be on good terms with us the petitioners of middlesex and of london have numbered among their grievances the unconstitutional taxes on america and similar petitions are expected from all quarters so that i think we need only be quiet and persevere in our schemes of frugality and industry and the rest will do itself your governor  is recalled and it is said the commissioners  will follow soon or be new modelled with some more men of discretion among them i am just setting out on a journey of five or six weeks and have now only time to add that i am with the greatest esteem and regard dear sir c b franklin benjamin franklin  0 august      london m dubourg ccclxiv to m dubourg  london  0 august      this letter will be forwarded to you by dr lettsom a young american physician of much merit and    one of the peaceable sect of quakers you will therefore at least regard him as a curiosity even though you should have embraced all the opinions of the majority of your countrymen concerning these people b franklin mary stevenson   september      margate benjamin franklin ccclxv from miss mary stevenson to b franklin margate   september      welcome to england my dear my honored friend just as i began a letter to my mother i received the news of your arrival  i have the same confidence in my parent that the esquimaux woman had in hers for if my mother did not know i always speak truth i could not venture to say what she might be apt to doubt i confess she has some reason to complain of me i must not complain of her i have written to her but once since i came hither and she —— a blank will conclude that sentence i have had the satisfaction to hear of her by several of my correspondents i hope you will intercede for me that i may not be severely rebuked indeed my expedition has afforded me so little entertainment that i could not have given her any by my letters and i know she is not so well affected to the government as to wish to increase the revenue without some advantage to herself she is a very good subject notwithstanding    and a faithful disciple of yours in all points but that of tribute there her daughter exceeds her for convinced by your arguments i turn a deaf ear to all invitations to smuggling and in such a place as this it is well to have ones honesty guarded as i have cast a censure upon the inhabitants of this place i must for the honor of my landlord and his family tell you that they condemn and avoid those illicit practices which are too common here indeed the exemplary conduct of these good people would make me join their sect if reason would qualify me for it but they are happily got into the flights of enthusiasm which i cannot reach they are certainly the happiest people and i should be glad to be like them but my reason will not suffer me and my heart prevents my playing the hypocrite so your polly must remain as she is neither in the world nor out of it how strangely i let my pen run on to a philosopher but that philosopher is my friend and i may write what i please to him i met with a very sensible physician yesterday who prescribes abstinence for the cure of consumptions he must be clever because he thinks as we do i would not have you or my mother surprised if i should run off with this young man to be sure it would be an imprudent step at the discreet age of thirty but there is no saying what one should do if solicited by a man of an insinuating address and good person though he may be too young for one and not yet established in his profession he engaged me so deeply in conversation and i was so much pleased with him that i thought it necessary to give you    warning though i assure you he has made no proposal  how i rattle this flight must be owing to this new acquaintance or to the joy of hearing my old one is returned to this country i know which i attribute it to for i can tell when my spirits were enlivened but you may think as you please if you will believe me to be dear sir your truly affectionate humble servant mary stevenson benjamin franklin   september      mary stevenson ccclxvi to miss mary stevenson saturday evening   september      just come home from a venison feast where i have drunk more than a philosopher ought i find my dear pollys cheerful chatty letter that exhilarates me more than all the wine your good mother says there is no occasion for any intercession of mine in your behalf she is sensible that she is more in fault than her daughter she received an affectionate tender letter from you and she has not answered it though she intended to do it but her head not her heart has been bad and unfitted her for writing she owns that she is not so good a subject as you are and that she is more unwilling to pay tribute to cæsar and has less objection to smuggling but it is not she says mere selfishness    or avarice it is rather an honest resentment at the waste of those taxes in pensions salaries perquisites contracts and other emoluments for the benefit of people she does not love and who do not deserve such advantages because—i suppose— because they are not of her party present my respects to your good landlord and his family i honor them for their conscientious aversion to illicit trading there are those in the world who would not wrong a neighbour but make no scruple of cheating the king the reverse however does not hold for whoever scruples cheating the king will certainly not wrong his neighbour you ought not to wish yourself an enthusiast they have indeed their imaginary satisfactions and pleasures but these are often balanced by imaginary pains and mortification you can continue to be a good girl and thereby lay a solid foundation for expected future happiness without the enthusiasm that may perhaps be necessary to some others as those beings who have a good sensible instinct have no need of reason so those who have reason to regulate their actions have no occasion for enthusiasm however there are certain circumstances in life sometimes where it is perhaps best not to hearken to reason for instance possibly if the truth were known i have reason to be jealous of this same insinuating handsome young physician but as it flatters more my vanity and therefore gives me more pleasure to suppose you were in spirits on account of my safe return i shall turn a deaf ear to reason in this case as i have done with success in twenty others but  00 i am sure you will always give me reason enough to continue your ever affectionate friend b franklin p s—our love to mrs tickell we shall long for your return your dolly was well last tuesday the girls were there on a visit to her i mean at bromley adieu no time now to give you any account of my french journey benjamin franklin   september      london cadwallader evans ccclxvii to cadwallader evans london   september      dear sir— i now have before me your favors of june   th and june   th i thank you for communicating to me the observations of the transit made by messrs biddle and bayley i gave them immediately to mr maskelyne the astronomer royal who will compare and digest the whole received from different parts of the world and report thereon to the royal society they are the only ones i have received from our society those made by the others were sent to mr penn being last week with mr maskelyne at flamsteed house i found he had got them i shall send him today the corrected account which i have since received from you by way of liverpool i should be very sorry that any thing of party remained in the american philosophical society after the union here the royal society is of all parties  0  but party is entirely out of the question in all our proceedings  it grieves me to hear that our friend galloway is in so bad a state of health he should make a long  0  journey or take a sea voyage i wish he would come to london for the winter mr henrys register which you communicated to me last year is thought a very ingenious one and will be published here though it has long been delayed i have not seen mrs dowell i suppose she is not yet come to town at least i have not heard of her being here though possibly she might while i was in france our friend w—— who is always complaining of a constant fever looks nevertheless fresh and jolly and does not fall away in the least he was saying the other day at richmond where we were together dining with governor pownall that he had been pestered with a fever almost continually for these three years past and that it gave way to no medicines all he had taken advised by different physicians having never any effect towards removing it on which i asked him if it was not now time to inquire whether he had really any fever at all he is indeed the only instance i ever knew of a man growing fat upon a fever but i see no occasion for reading him the lecture you desired for he appears to me extremely temperate in his eating and drinking his affairs here are i think in a good train but every thing to be transacted in our great offices requires time i suppose he will hardly be able to return before the spring by a ship just sailed from hence the captain a stranger whose name i have forgotten i send you a a late french treatise on the management of silkworms it is said to be the best hitherto published  0  being written in the silk country by a gentleman well acquainted with the whole affair it seems to me to be like many other french writings rather too much drawn out in words but some extracts from it of the principal directions might be of use if you would translate and publish them i think the bounty is offered for silk from all the colonies in general i will send you the act but i believe it must be wound from the cocoons and sent over in skeins the cocoons would spoil on the passage by the dead worm corrupting and staining the silk a public filature should be set up for winding them there or every family should learn to wind their own in italy they are all brought to market from the neighbouring country and bought up by those that keep the filatures in sicily each family winds its own silk for the sake of having the remains to card and spin for family use if some provision were made by the assembly for promoting the growth of mulberry trees in all parts of the provinces the culture of silk might afterwards follow easily for the great discouragement to breeding worms at first is the difficulty of getting leaves and the being obliged to go far for them there is no doubt with me but that it might succeed in our country it is the happiest of all inventions for clothing wool uses a good deal of land to produce it which if employed in raising corn would afford much more subsistence for man than the mutton amounts to flax and hemp require good land impoverish it and at the same time permit it to produce no food at all but mulberry trees may  0  be planted in hedgerows on walks or avenues or for shade near a house where nothing else is wanted to grow the food for the worms which produce the silk is in the air and the ground under the trees may still produce grass or some other vegetable good for man or beast then the wear of silken garments continues so much longer from the strength of the materials as to give it greatly the preference hence it is that the most populous of all countries china clothes its inhabitants with silk while it feeds them plentifully and has besides a vast quantity both raw and manufactured to spare for exportation raw silk here in skeins well wound sells from twenty to twentyfive shillings per pound but if badly wound is not worth five shillings well wound is when the threads are made to cross each other every way in the skein and only touch where they cross badly wound is when they are laid parallel to each other for so they are glued together break in unwinding them and take a vast deal of time more than the other by losing the end every time the thread breaks when once you can raise plenty of silk you may have manufactures enough from hence with great esteem i am my dear friend yours affectionately b franklin   0  benjamin franklin  0 september      london samuel cooper ccclxviii to samuel cooper london  0 september      dear sir— your favor of august  d has given me great pleasure i have only time now to acknowledge the receipt of it but purpose to write fully by the next opportunity i am just returned from france where i found our dispute much attended to several of our pamphlets being translated and printed there among the rest my examination  and the farmers letters  with two of my pieces annexed of which last i send you a copy in short all europe except britain appears to be on our side of the question but europe has its reasons it fancies itself in some danger from the growth of british power and would be glad to see it divided against itself our prudence will i hope long postpone the satisfaction our enemies expect from our dissensions with sincere and great esteem i am dear sir c b franklin ccclxix on ventilation i do not know that we have in any author particular and separate directions concerning the ventilating  0  of hospitals crowded rooms or dwellinghouses or the making of proper drains for carrying off stagnant or putrid water the want of such general information on these subjects has induced me to endeavour to recollect all i can of the many instructive conversations i have had upon these matters with that judicious and most accurate observer of nature dr benjamin franklin i do this in hopes that either the doctor himself or some other person well qualified for the task may follow the example set in so masterly a manner by sir john pringle baronet when speaking on the preservation of the health of seamen it has long been observed that if a number of persons are shut up in a small room of which the internal air has little or no communication with the external the respiration of those who are so confined renders by degrees the air of that room effete and unfit for the support of life dr franklin was if i mistake not the first who observed that respiration communicated to the air a quality resembling the mephitic such as the grotto del cane near naples the air impressed with this quality rises only to a certain height beyond which it gradually loses it the amendment begins in the upper part and descends gradually until the whole becomes capable of sustaining life the doctor confirmed this by the following experiment he breathed gently through a tube into a deep glass mug so as to impregnate all the air in the mug with this quality he then put a lighted bougie into the mug and upon touching the air therein the flame was  0  instantly extinguished by frequently repeating this operation the bougie gradually preserved its light longer in the mug so as in a short time to retain it to the bottom of it the air having totally lost the bad quality it had contracted from the breath blown into it at the same time that the lower part of the air is thus affected an acrid noxious quality may be communicated to its upper part in the room occasioned by the volatile putrescent effluvia of the persons enclosed therein it is surprising says sir john pringle in his observations on the diseases of the army fourth edition p  0  in how few days the air will be corrupted in close and crowded wards and what makes it hard to remedy the evil is the difficulty of convincing either nurses or the sick themselves of the necessity of opening the windows and doors at any time for a supply of fresh air it may be inferred from the above account of mephitic air that such air can be but little altered by a ventilator in the ceiling of a room and dr franklin justly concluded that in crowded rooms and especially in bedrooms in dwellinghouses a current of air should be kept up in the lower part of the rooms to carry off what is thus affected he approved of the use of chimneys for this purpose especially when the current is quickened by a fire even when there is not any fire in the chimney a current of air is constantly kept up in it by its ascending or descending in the flue as the weight of the internal or external air preponderates this creates a kind of tide in the flue conducing much to the healthiness of air in  0  rooms and hence we may see the injudiciousness of having chimneyboards which fit closely and thereby prevent a salutary circulation in the air hence also in warm weather we may account for liquors or other things kept in a chimney being cooled and more so if means are used to create an evaporation around them every person has an atmosphere of his own heated by the warmth of his body which can be dissipated only by motion in the circumambient air thus in warm weather wind cools the body by carrying off the personal atmosphere and promoting at the same time a more free evaporation of the effluvia arising from the body this creates a great degree of coolness on the skin the personal atmosphere can be but little affected by a ventilator in the ceiling of a room unless the admission of external air is so directed as to act principally on the air surrounding those in the room dr franklin when consulted on ventilating the house of commons represented that the personal atmosphere surrounding the members might be carried off by making outlets in the perpendicular parts of the seats through which the air might be drawn off by ventilators so placed as to accomplish this without admitting any by the same channels it will appear from what has been said that windows placed high in the walls of churches or rooms intended for large assemblies can contribute but little towards correcting the mephitic quality of the lower part of the air or towards carrying off the personal atmospheres the experiments made for ventilating crowded  0  rooms by that most beneficent of men the reverend dr stephen hales bring evident proof how much the upper part of the air in such places is vitiated by the volatile putrescent effluvia arising from the persons present in such rooms he at the same time showed an easy and effectual way to carry off such vitiated air his ventilators were however attended with the inconveniency of occasioning smoky chimneys by drawing off so much air that there was not a sufficiency left to keep a current strong enough to carry the smoke up the chimney unless a door or window was left open the circulating ventilators in windows were intended for refreshing the air in rooms without affecting the current of air up the chimney but they did not affect the mephitic air nor the higher air near the ceiling of lofty rooms which is most vitiated with putrescent particles and they were besides often out of repair instead of either of these dr franklin proposed that openings should be made close to the ceilings of rooms communicating with a flue which should ascend in the wall close to the flues of the chimneys and where it can be done conveniently close to the flue of the kitchen chimney because the fire burning pretty constantly there would keep the sides of that flue warmer than those of the other chimneys whereby a quicker current of air would be kept up in the ventilating flue such a flue might be carried from the vaults or under ground offices this would render them drier without altering their temperature much as to heat or cold these ventilating flues would cause a constant discharge of the volatile   0 putrescent effluvia without interfering with the current of air up the chimneys while the current towards the chimney would carry off the mephitic air below these ventilating flues would be peculiarly beneficial in bedrooms of which the ceilings are low dr franklin mentioned an instance of a number of germans who on their arrival in pennsylvania were obliged to live in a large barn there being at that time no other place of residence fit for them several small windows were made on both sides of the barn under the eaves these windows were kept constantly open even during a severe frost in the winter and this without any detriment to the health of the germans prejudice said he has raised so great a dread against cold air in england that such openings would make every person shudder at the thought of being exposed to so great a degree of cold and therefore i did not dare to recommend a practice the good effects of which i had known the dormitory for the youths of westminster school is a similar instance for the glass put in their high lofty windows is soon broken but seldom repaired yet without prejudice to the health of the youths there is a channel by which much of the vitiated air escapes and is but little attended to whoever looks at the ceilings of rooms in old houses will soon discover the traces of the rafters by a difference in color in parts of the ceiling for wherever there is not a solid resistance to the passage of the air much of it gets off through the ceiling and deposits in it part of its contents which discolors the intervals between the joists in the british museum there is a remarkable     instance of the inconveniency of the want of this outlet the ceiling of one of the rooms in that house is covered with a picture or painted cloth the room continues warm with little fire but the air soon affects the respiration of valetudinarians as was often remarked by that accurate observer dr g knight late principal librarian vaulted rooms may be considered in this light because the materials of which the arch is built must generally be solid if the arch is built of stones and these are exposed to the air as they cannot so soon as wood or brick become of the temperature of the air as to heat and cold the vault must become wet on every change of the air from cold to warm as every one may observe in the walls and furniture of rooms in which fire is not kept the vault may thus become a frequent source of moisture which mixing with the air may gradually descend into the room and become very prejudicial to the health of persons of weak constitutions who may inhabit such rooms an attentive observer will soon be convinced that there is a current of warm air which ascends in the room from the chimney while a fire burns dr franklin showed that this was the case by the following experiment he suspended by a thread a piece of pasteboard cut in a spiral form the thread was fastened to the chimneypiece so that the pasteboard drawn out in a spiral form came near to the edge of the chimney the constant current of warm air heated by the fire gave a continued circular motion to the pasteboard this warm air ascending to the ceiling there spread and kept a constant     motion in the upper part of the air the warm air thus ascending coming into contact with the cool walls and being thereby condensed becomes heavier and so falls along the sides of the walls also the glass in windows being exposed to the temperature of the external air in cold weather becomes colder than any other part of the room therefore the internal air more sensibly descends as may be seen by approaching a lighted bougie to a window the flame is then carried downwards by the air or if the flame is extinguished the smoke will more clearly show this truth by descending along the window till it meets the air of an equal temperature this will be the case however tight the window and the more so the brighter and stronger the fire is and the colder the external air the circulation of the air being thereby quickened this accounts for the familiar caution of avoiding to sit in or near a window this circulation of the air is yet more evidently proved by the following instance when there is a bright strong fire in a close room open the door and present immediately a lighted candle to the upper part of the doorway the flame will bend outward though warm air in the higher part rushes out lower the candle gradually and the strength of the current outward will lessen by degrees as the candle is lowered till it comes to a space in which the flame shall rise upright continue to lower the candle gradually and then the current of cold air inward will gradually increase and more strongly bend the flame of the candle inward this will be the case even in frosty and windy weather may it not be     inferred from this circumstance of so strong a current of air outwards in the upper part of the doorway that an opening over or in the upper part of the door in the ward of a hospital might be of advantage especially if there is no ventilating flue in the ceiling by such means a circulation of the air in the upper part of the ward could be constantly kept up and thereby a vent would be given to the volatile putrescent particles this vent might be left open at all times without any prejudice to the patients what is said on this subject by dr john armstrong a gentleman no less remarkable for his benevolence than for his judgment and fine taste may be properly mentioned here a constant circulation of fresh air is so necessary so important in fevers and in all feverish disorders that it ought to be particularly considered in the construction of houses it would be well if in all the apartments of every house but especially in bedchambers the upper sashes of every window were contrived to let down for by this means the admission of fresh air would at all times be perfectly safe except during a raw damp foggy night as the body even when under such a sweat as could not without danger be interrupted may receive all the refreshing restorative and invigorating influence of the air without being exposed to a stream of it meantime where this is wanting the best method to supply it is by drawing the bedcurtains close now and then for a few minutes at a time while a free passage is made to the foul air by opening the doors and windows—medical essays p        the noxious vapors that fill a sickroom are not only offensive but dangerous to those who continue in it for any time if dangerous to people then in health how detrimental must they be to one oppressed and struggling under an enfeebling disease it is a common thing in a campaign to distribute the sick soldiers ill of malignant fevers in open barns where the putrid volatile poison is in a short time dissipated there is in a volume of the mémoires et observations recueillies par la société economique de berne a letter concerning the health of the inhabitants of the pays de vaud part of which i beg to present here as bearing a near analogy to this subject the letter is written by a most accurate and judicious clergyman one fact says he deserves to be noticed taking one year with another a greater proportional number always die in towns than in villages but whence comes it that when epidemic diseases prevail the mortality takes quite a different road that is it is much more considerable in villages than in towns i have taken great pains to find out the cause of this phenomenon and am apt to impute the difference to the difference of habitations the poor in cities and great towns dwell in houses not originally intended for them but which being so old and past repairing as to be no longer tenantable by persons at their ease fall to the lot of the lower class of people in these houses the rooms are spacious cold as ice where the air plays freely around with doors and windows that do not half shut the inhabitants of these shattered houses are pitied and yet the very circumstance of their being out of repair is what contributes     to the health of those who live in them and facilitates their cure when diseases reign the more i see of hospitals the more i am convinced of the great want of instructions on duly ventilating them it is surprising to see what little attention has been paid in some hospitals about london to this article which have been built since the importance of ventilation has been well known in all of them there is too great a distance between the windows and the ceilings where the volatile putrescent particles may remain till they become very acrid with pleasure i here do justice to the judgment and precaution of messrs adam in the manner of ventilating the great room built by them for the meeting of the society for the encouragement of arts c by leaving spaces between the panes of glass in the skylights the panes overlaying each other these spaces being concealed from the eye do not alarm those fearful of cold air and keep the room constantly sweet the hospitals most judiciously built in this respect which i have seen are those in philadelphia and in lyons in the hospital in philadelphia the wards are two stories high with two rows of windows in each the upper row being kept generally open and the windows in the hospital at lyons are very lofty so that the upper sashes may be for the most part kept open both hospitals are by this means perfectly sweet so sweet that a military gentleman who went with me into the hospital at lyons and was unaccustomed to sickrooms declared that the air in the ward was not disagreeable to him though     it contained a considerable number of sick indeed they were kept very clean i am sorry to say this is not the case in any one of our hospitals the naval hospital at gibraltar is a square which in a hot climate is itself a great imperfection as the air within the square must in summer especially be greatly heated and as if they had studied to keep the cool air out of the wards the windows open into the square only whereas if the west side had been left open the wards might have received the cool breezes from the bay the sick are lodged in long galleries not sufficiently divided to have the patients in separate wards and no openings to carry off the putrid air lodged among the rafters which support the roof on my arrival in the island of minorca as surgeon to the royal artillery there i was surprised at the neglect of my predecessors in that office in regard to ventilating the hospital there were no openings in the wards in which the sick lay but the windows and doors which were necessarily shut every night to prevent the irregularities soldiers might be guilty of where chimneys had been they were built up to prevent the expense of fires and thus during the night the sick lay in absolutely confined air the consequence was that when the nurse opened the wards in the morning she was obliged to withdraw instantly for the highly infected air often brought on vomiting in this case i applied to our most worthy and ingenious chief engineer the late colonel mackellar for leave to use such means as might create a circulation of air in all the wards in this he readily concurred and ordered the necessary alterations     in each ward in which the flue of the chimney remained an opening of about four or five inches square was made through the wall into the flue as near the ceiling as possible round holes of about three inches diameter were cut low in each door covered with a sliding flap to shut the holes occasionally in some of the wards there never had been chimneys in these holes were cut through the wall close to the ceiling which opened into a common passage and when two such wards were contiguous a hole was cut through the dividing wall as well as in the door of each ward one of the wards in which there had not been a chimney and which was arched with stones was constantly so damp that no use was made of it the walls and arch were covered with green moss they were afterwards scraped to clear them of the moss which retained moisture and then covered with lime this room became so dry that though locked up for three months during which i was confined with the gout books and papers which had remained in it were at the end of that time perfectly dry the generally agreeable effects of this opening can scarcely be conceived the wards and indeed the whole hospital being rendered perfectly sweet greatly to the benefit of the sick as well as to the pleasure of the attendants the barracks in the square of the castle st philip in which are lodged the detachment of the regiment of artillery doing duty there are dry except that being built of stone they collect moisture on every sudden change of the air from cold to warm each barrack opens into the square and is divided into     three apartments the part next the door has the whole height and in it their arms and necessaries are kept the inner part being about one half is divided into two floors in the lower room they cook each barrack having a mess or family in it some of whom sleep in it the fire and the free access between it and the door keep up a due circulation here in the upper room most of the men sleep under a stone arch the room being little more than six feet high in the centre and therefore much lower in the sides under that arch from four to six or eight persons sleep especially when there are children this room is very stifling there being little circulation of air in it more especially in calm warm weather such as the nights generally are there in summer in order to create a circulation of air in this upper room openings were made into the flues of the chimneys of the lower room as near the centre of the arch as possible the chimneys being in the corner of the rooms below in general these openings drew very well and gave great relief especially to those who had weak or diseased lungs the proper remedy here would have been to have had small flues made near the flues of the chimneys below could it have been done this measure is too much neglected in all barracks whoever may on any future occasion have the direction of military hospitals is already furnished with such judicious directions by my learned friends sir john pringle baronet and dr donald munro that were i to say any thing on that subject i could only copy whole pages from them sir john pringles     speech on giving the gold medal of the royal society to captain cook in which he took occasion to point out the means of preserving the health of seamen is equally deserving of commendation the healthiness of buildings does not perhaps depend more on the due ventilation of the rooms than it does on the dryness of the situation and of the foundation sir john pringle in the first part of his observations on the diseases of the army has given several instances of this truth but as every man who regards his own life and health or the lives and health of others should be well acquainted with that work i shall refer to the original i have often lamented that the first part of that book describing the natural consequences of the situation of places and their effects on health has not been published separately because it might thereby become of more general use to every man who leads country life or resorts thither frequently to enjoy quiet for being part of a book professedly treating of diseases few think of consulting it except whose business it is to cure diseases however inviting the situation may be and whatever may be the quality of the ground on which houses are built generally drains should be made all around the house deeper than the foundation of the building to carry off the superfluous moisture even the moisture that may be lodged under the ground for it is essentially necessary that the lower part of the house be kept continually dry the advantages of drains or sewers are remarkably felt in london which before the fire of london   0 was frequently afflicted with contagious malignant fevers before that period all the waste water and filth remained above ground and the people as erasmus complained were very inattentive to keeping their houses clean the wooden houses projected so much over the then very narrow streets that the air became almost stagnant and must have been loaded with putrid effluvia there being very little circulation or current in the air thus confined to carry off these effluvia before the city was rebuilt that ingenious architect sir christopher wren planned and built the common sewers as they continue to this day and they are a lasting monument of his judgment and attention to the health and welfare of its inhabitants these together with the removal of signs and signposts new paving and cleansing the streets have been attended with such happy effects that london and westminster are now ranked among the most healthy spots in the island for grown persons whose lungs can bear the cloud of smoke which generally hovers over them and thus the apparent great calamity of a fire became a singular blessing to the city of london the quantity or water brought into the city by the new river and other waterworks which runs daily to waste helps to cleanse and keep the common sewers sweet and thereby contributes much to the healthiness of the city though foreign to the subject it may be observed that till the restoration there were few gardens about london for supplying kitchen herbs these became more numerous after     that period and still more so after the revolution a number of dutch gardeners coming to england at that time the quantity of vegetables supplied by these gardens contribute greatly to the healthiness of the citizens rome would not perhaps have become mistress of so extraordinary an empire situated as that city is near marshy grounds had not the common sewers which still attract the admiration of all travellers been so early and judiciously built by tarquinius priscus who may for that reason be called a second founder of rome the ancient romans were particularly attentive to the draining and cultivating of these marshes and they soon became the granary of ancient rome but being neglected during the invasions of the barbarous nations they are now the reproach and just chastisement of the supine indolence and inactivity of the modern romans gravel which is generally reckoned a dry and healthy foundation to build upon is found by experience not to deserve that character at all times unless deep drains are made to carry off the water of heavy rains long continued for by such rains the gravel may be so charged with water especially in flat grounds that the lower parts of the houses erected on such soils may prove damp in all the flat grounds along the thames the cellars are often filled with water after heavy rains and if the water continues there stagnant till the animal or vegetable substances mixed with it begin to putrefy aches agues and putrid fevers are the natural consequences though kensington palace stands high     and on a declivity yet when king george the second continued there till late in october the lower parts of the house became damp occasioned by the want of drains and the servants became aguish stones which absorb and retain water as the cantoon stone in minorca does are in this respect similar to gravel there was a remarkable instance of this in a magazine cut out of a solid rock of cantoon stone in georgetown in minorca the magazine was covered with a welllimed arch and roof yet when the winter rains began to fall in november the magazine was filled with water as high as it was cut out of the rock when drains were made to carry off the water the magazine then became and continued to be sufficiently dry might not low grounds on the banks of rivers similar to those in flanders and so justly and judiciously complained of by sir john pringle be rendered more healthy by drains dug as deep as lowwater mark in the adjacent rivers sluices might be made in the banks of the river to prevent the tides or floods from entering into the drains it would be advisable to cover the drains to prevent the noxious vapors arising from putrid vegetable or animal substances which generally rot in open ditches the earth thrown out of the drains might serve to cover them when the channels for carrying off the water are properly constructed by these means no surface would be lost for the growth of vegetables willows alders and such trees as delight in a moist or wet soil may be planted on the banks of ditches if any such are permitted to remain open     that their leaves may correct the putrid vapors arising from the stagnant water in the ditches i fear however that in the autumn when the effects of putrid vapors are most severely felt the leaves of these trees being then hardened by age may in a great measure lose the power of correcting the putrid vapors the late summer shoots may afford aid till the equinoxial rains clear the ditches of all filth that trees have not the power of proving an effectual remedy against these putrid exhalations the frequency of agues in the low countries in every season is a sufficient proof if such trees grow on the banks of ditches they should be kept in a pollard state to admit of a free circulation of air an observation of dr franklins deserves a place here especially as it is not generally attended to the opinion is indeed against it the banks of rivers which have a quick motion and run on a clear sandy bottom are very agreeable and healthy situations but the sides of rivers which have oozy bottoms or marshy banks or which are in the neighbourhood of extensive marshes are to be avoided when necessity or any peculiar advantage obliges people to build near such bad neighbours the south side says the doctor is the most eligible because the warm southerly winds which promote a tendency to putrefaction and are the most frequent blow the noxious vapors from the buildings whereas the northerly winds which blow but seldom compared with the former and which generally blow strongly check putrefaction and speedily carry off noxious vapors it is now well known that the stench arising from     stationary privies may be prevented by a cheap and easy method the excrements may be received in tubs so closely connected with the seat that no air can pass the lower ends of the tub should be sunk below the surface of water contained in proper cisterns the excrements are soon dissolved in water and so carried off every time the privy is washed which should be as often as it is used in towns the stench of the common sewers is sometimes very offensive this may be prevented by interrupting the current of air through them by means of sinktraps the construction and utility of which are of late years well known in london as sand or other filth may be apt to lodge in the deepened place it should be so contrived as to be easily come at in order to clear away every obstruction let me add here to the method of correcting bad water proposed by dr munro in his essay on the means of preserving the health of soldiers the following easy method of keeping water clear and sweet ascertained by several experiments made some years ago by the society for the encouragement of arts c in london the method is to mix clay with the water in such quantities that when the clay is dissolved the hand immersed under the surface of the water shall not be seen the clay subsiding carries down with it all the impurities and in a manner burying them prevents their communicating any bad taste or smell to the water which thereby continues long clear and sweet clay may probably correct stagnant water and thereby preserve it clear and good in dry seasons and may thus become very useful     where there is no running water if any bad taste or smell remains after the use of the clay it may be carried off by one of the ventilators recommended for that purpose by the reverend dr hales the clear water may be drawn off by a siphon or a cock placed high enough not to touch the clay a s benjamin franklin mary stevenson ccclxx to miss mary stevenson craven street saturday evening past ten the question you ask me is a very sensible one and i shall be glad if i can give you a satisfactory answer there are two ways of contracting a chimney one by contracting the opening before the fire the other by contracting the funnel above the fire if the funnel above the fire is left open in its full dimensions and the opening before the fire is contracted then the coals i imagine will burn faster because more air is directed through the fire and in a stronger stream that air which before passed over it and on each side of it now passing through it this is seen in narrow stove chimneys when a sacheverell or blower is used which still more contracts the narrow opening but if the funnel only above the fire is contracted then as a less stream of air is passing up the chimney less must pass through the fire and consequently it should seem that the consuming of the coals would rather be checked than augmented by such contraction and this will also be the case when     both the opening before the fire and the funnel above the fire are contracted provided the funnel above the fire is more contracted in proportion than the opening before the fire so you see i think you had the best of the argument and as you notwithstanding gave it up in complaisance to the company i think you had also the best of the dispute there are few though convinced that know how to give up even an error they have been once engaged in maintaining there is therefore the more merit in dropping a contest where one thinks ones self right it is at least respectful to those we converse with and indeed all our knowledge is so imperfect and we are from a thousand causes so perpetually subject to mistake and error that positiveness can scarce ever become even the most knowing and modesty in advancing any opinion however plain and true we may suppose it is always decent and generally more like to procure assent popes rule to speak though sure with seeming diffidence is therefore a good one and if i had ever seen in your conversation the least deviation from it i should earnestly recommend it to your observation i am c b franklin     ccclxxi queries by mr strahan respecting american affairs and dr franklins answers william strahan    november      benjamin franklin w strahan to b franklin     november      dear sir— in the many conversations we have had together about our present disputes with north america we perfectly agreed in wishing they may be brought to a speedy and happy conclusion how this is to be done is not so easily ascertained two objects i humbly apprehend his majestys servants have now in contemplation first to relieve the colonies from the taxes complained of which they certainly had no hand in imposing secondly to preserve the honor the dignity and the supremacy of the british legislature over all his majestys dominions as i know your singular knowledge of the subject in question and am as fully convinced of your cordial attachment to his majesty and your sincere desire to promote the happiness equally of all his subjects i beg you would in your own clear brief and explicit manner send me an answer to the following questions i make this request now because this matter is of the utmost importance and must very quickly be agitated and i do it with more freedom as you know me and my motives too     well to entertain the most remote suspicion that i will make an improper use of any information you shall hereby convey to me  —will not a repeal of all the duties that on tea excepted which was before paid here on exportation and of course no new imposition fully satisfy the colonists  if you answer in the negative  —your reasons for that opinion  —do you think the only effectual way of composing the present differences is to put the americans precisely in the situation they were in before the passing of the late stamp act if that is your opinion  —your reasons for that opinion  —if this last method is deemed by the legislature and his majestys ministers to be repugnant to their duty as guardians of the just rights of the crown and of their fellow subjects can you suggest any other way of terminating these disputes consistent with the ideas of justice and propriety conceived     by the kings subjects on both sides of the atlantic  —and if this method was actually followed do you not think it would actually encourage the violent and factious part of the colonists to aim at still farther concessions from the mother country  —if they are relieved in part only what do you as a reasonable and dispassionate man and an equal friend to both sides imagine will be the probable consequences the answers to these questions i humbly conceive will include all the information i want and i beg you will favor me with them as soon as may be every wellwisher to the peace and prosperity of the british empire and every friend to our truly happy constitution must be desirous of seeing even the most trivial causes of dissension among our fellow subjects removed our domestic squabbles in my mind are nothing to what i am speaking of this you know much better than i do and therefore i need add nothing farther to recommend this subject to your serious consideration i am with the most cordial esteem and attachment dear sir your faithful and affectionate humble servant w strahan benjamin franklin    november      william strahan the answer craven street    november      dear sir— being just returned to town from a little excursion i find yours of the   st containing a number of queries that would require a pamphlet   0 to answer them fully you however desire only brief answers which i shall endeavour to give previous to your queries you tell me that you appreciate his majestys servants have now in contemplation first to relieve the colonists from the taxes complained of secondly to preserve the honor the dignity and the supremacy of the british legislature over all his majestys dominions i hope your information is good and that what you suppose to be in contemplation will be carried into execution by repealing all the laws that have been made for raising a revenue in america by authority of parliament without the consent of the people there the honor and dignity of the british legislature will not be hurt by such an act of justice and wisdom the wisest councils are liable to be misled especially in matters remote from their inspection it is the persisting in an error not the correcting it that lessens the honor of any man or body of men the supremacy of that legislature i believe will be best preserved by making a very sparing use of it never but for the evident good of the colonies themselves or of the whole british empire never for the partial advantage of britain to their prejudice by such prudent conduct i imagine that supremacy may be gradually strengthened and in time fully established but otherwise i apprehend it will be disputed and lost in the dispute at present the colonies consent and submit to it for the regulations of general commerce but a submission to acts of parliament was no part of their original constitution our former kings governed     their colonies as they had governed their dominions in france without the participation of british parliaments the parliament of england never presumed to interfere in that prerogative till the time of the great rebellion when they usurped the government of all the kings other dominions ireland scotland c the colonies that held for the king they conquered by force of arms and governed afterwards as conquered countries but new england not having opposed the parliament was considered and treated as a sisterkingdom in amity with england as appears by the journals march  0th       —will not a repeal of all the duties that on tea excepted which was before paid here on exportation and of course no new imposition fully satisfy the colonists i think not  —your reasons for that opinion because it is not the sum paid in that duty on tea that is complained of as a burden but the principle of the act expressed in the preamble viz that those duties were laid for the better support of government and the administration of justice in the colonies  this the colonists think unnecessary unjust     and dangerous to their most important rights unnecessary because in all the colonies two or three new ones excepted  government and the administration of justice were and always had been well supported without any charge to britain unjust as it has made such colonies liable to pay such charge for others in which they had no concern or interest dangerous as such mode of raising money for those purposes tended to render their assemblies useless for if a revenue could be raised in the colonies for all the purposes of government by act of parliament without grants from the people there governors who do not generally love assemblies would never call them they would be laid aside and when nothing should depend on the peoples goodwill to government their rights would be trampled on they would be treated with contempt another reason why i think they would not be satisfied with such a partial repeal is that their agreements not to import till the repeal takes place include the whole which shows that they object to the whole and those agreements will continue binding on them if the whole is not repealed  —do you think the only effectual way of composing the present differences is to put the americans precisely in the situation they were in before the passage of the late stamp act i think so  —your reasons for that opinion     other methods have been tried they have been rebuked in angry letters their petitions have been refused or rejected by parliament they have been threatened with the punishments of treason by resolves of both houses their assemblies have been dissolved and troops have been sent among them but all these ways have only exasperated their minds and widened the breach their agreements to use no more british manufactures have been strengthened these measures instead of composing differences and promoting a good correspondence have almost annihilated your commerce with those countries and greatly endanger the national peace and general welfare  —if this last method is deemed by the legislature and his majestys ministers to be repugnant to their duty as guardians of the just rights of the crown and of their fellow subjects can you suggest any other way of terminating these disputes consistent with the ideas of justice and propriety conceived by the kings subjects on both sides of the atlantic i do not see how that method can be deemed repugnant to the rights of the crown if the americans are put into their former situation it must be by an act of parliament in the passing of which by the king the rights of the crown are exercised not infringed it is indifferent to the crown whether the aids received from america are granted by parliament here or by the assemblies there provided the quantum be the same and it is my opinion that more will be generally granted there voluntarily     than can ever be exacted or collected from thence by authority of parliament as to the rights of fellow subjects i suppose you mean the people of britain i cannot conceive how those will be infringed by that method they will still enjoy the right of granting their own money and may still if it pleases them keep up their claim to the right of granting ours a right they can never exercise properly for want of a sufficient knowledge of us our circumstances and abilities to say nothing of the little likelihood there is that we should ever submit to it therefore a right that can be of no good use to them and we shall continue to enjoy in fact the right of granting our money with the opinion now universally prevailing among us that we are free subjects of the king and that fellow subjects of one part of his dominions are not sovereigns over fellow subjects in any other part if the subjects on the different sides of the atlantic have different and opposite ideas of justice and propriety no one method can possibly be consistent with both the best will be to let each enjoy their own opinions without disturbing them when they do not interfere with the common good  —and if this method were actually followed do you not think it would encourage the violent and factious part of the colonists to aim at still farther concessions from the mother country i do not think it would there may be a few among them that deserve the name of factious and violent as there are in all countries but these would     have little influence if the great majority of sober reasonable people were satisfied if any colony should happen to think that some of your regulations of trade are inconvenient to the general interest of the empire or prejudicial to them without being beneficial to you they will state these matters to parliament in petitions as heretofore but will i believe take no violent steps to obtain what they may hope for in time from the wisdom of government here i know of nothing else they can have in view the notion that prevails here of their being desirous to set up a kingdom or commonwealth of their own is to my certain knowledge entirely groundless i therefore think that on a total repeal of all duties laid expressly for the purpose of raising a revenue on the people of america without their consent the present uneasiness would subside the agreements not to import would be dissolved and commerce flourish as heretofore and i am confirmed in this sentiment by all the letters i have received from america and by the opinions of all the sensible people who have lately come from thence crown officers excepted i know indeed that the people of boston are grievously offended by the quartering of troops among them as they think contrary to law and are very angry with the board of commissioners who have calumniated them to government but as i suppose the withdrawing of those troops may be a consequence of reconciliating measures taking place and that the commission also will be either     dissolved if found useless or filled with more temperate and prudent men if still deemed useful and necessary i do not imagine these particulars would prevent a return of the harmony so much to be wished   —if they are relieved in part only what do you as a reasonable and dispassionate man and an equal friend to both sides imagine will be the probable consequences i imagine that repealing the offensive duties in part will answer no end to this country the commerce will remain obstructed and the americans go on with their schemes of frugality industry and manufactures to their own great advantage how much that may tend to the prejudice of britain i cannot say perhaps not so much as some apprehend since she may in time find new markets but i think if the union of the two countries continues to subsist it will not hurt the general interest for whatever wealth britain loses by the failing of its trade with the colonies america will gain and the     crown will receive equal aids from its subjects upon the whole if not greater and now i have answered your questions as to what may be in my opinion the consequence of this or that supposed measure i will go a little farther and tell you what i fear is more likely to come to pass in reality i apprehend that the ministry at least the american part of it being fully persuaded of the right of parliament think it ought to be enforced whatever may be the consequences and at the same time do not believe there is even now any abatement of the trade between the two countries on account of these disputes or that if there is it is small and cannot long continue they are assured by the crown officers in america that manufactures are impossible there that the discontented are few and persons of little consequence that almost all the people of property and importance are satisfied and disposed to submit quietly to the taxing power of parliament and that if the revenue acts are continued and those duties only that are called anticommercial be repealed and others perhaps laid in stead the power ere long will be patiently submitted to and the agreements not to import be broken when they are found to produce no change of measures here from these and similar misinformations which seem to be credited i think it likely that no thorough redress of grievances will be afforded to america this session this may inflame matters still more in that country farther rash measures there may create more resentment here that may produce     not merely illadvised dissolutions of their assemblies as last year but attempts to dissolve their constitution  more troops may be sent over which will create more uneasiness to justify the measures of government your writers will revile the americans in your newspapers as they have already begun to do treating them as miscreants rogues dastards rebels c to alienate the minds of the people here from them and which will tend farther to diminish their affections to this country possibly too some of their warm patriots may be distracted enough to expose themselves by some mad action to be sent for hither and government here be indiscreet enough to hang them on the act of henry the eighth  mutual provocations will thus go on to complete the separation and instead of that cordial affection that once and so long existed and that harmony so suitable to the circumstances and so necessary to the happiness strength safety and welfare of both countries an implacable malice and mutual hatred such as we now see subsisting between the spaniards and portuguese the genoese and corsicans from the same original misconduct in the superior governments will take place the sameness of nation the similarity of religion manners and language not in the least preventing in our case more than it did in theirs     i hope however that this may all prove false prophecy and that you and i may live to see as sincere and perfect a friendship established between our respective countries as has so many years subsisted between mr strahan and his truly affectionate old friend b franklin ccclxxii state of the constitution of the colonies  by governor pownall with remarks by dr franklin   wherever any englishmen go forth without the realm and make settlements in partibus exteris these settlements as english settlements and these inhabitants as english subjects carrying with them the laws of the land wherever they form colonies and receiving his majestys protection by virtue of his royal charter  or commissions of government have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever as if they and every of them were born within the realm    0 and are bound by the like allegiance as every other subject of the realm remark—the settlers of colonies in america did not carry with them the laws of the land as being bound by them wherever they should settle they left the realm to avoid the inconveniences and hardships they were under where some of those laws were in force particularly ecclesiastical laws those for payment of tithes and others had it been understood that they were to carry these laws with them they had better have stayed at home among their friends unexposed to the risk and toils of a new settlement they carried with them a right to such parts of laws of the land as they should judge advantageous or useful to them a right to be free from those they thought hurtful and a right to make such others as they should think necessary not infringing the general rights of englishmen and such new laws they were to form as agreeable as might be to the laws of england   therefore the common law of england and all such statutes as were enacted and in force at the time which such settlers went forth and such colonies and plantations were established except as hereafter excepted together with all such alterations and amendments as the said common law may have received is from time to time and at all times the law of those colonies and plantations so far as they have adopted it by express laws or by practice       therefore all statutes touching the right of the succession and settlement of the crown with the statutes of treason relating thereto all statutes regulating or limiting the general powers and authority of the crown and the exercise of jurisdiction thereof all statutes declaratory of the rights and liberty of the subject do extend to all british subjects in the colonies and plantations as of common right and as if they and every of them were born within the realm it is doubted whether any settlement of the crown by parliament takes place in the colonies otherwise than by the consent of the assemblies there had the rebellion in      succeeded so far as to settle the stuart family again on the throne by act of parliament i think the colonies would not have thought themselves bound by such an act they would still have adhered to the present family as long as they could observation in reply—they are bound to the king and his successors and we know no succession but by act of parliament—t p   all statutes enacted since the establishment of colonies and plantations do extend to and operate within the said colonies and plantations in which statutes the same are specially named it is doubted whether any act of parliament should of right operate in the colonies in fact several of them have and do operate   statutes and customs which respect only the special and local circumstances of the realm do not extend to     and operate within said colonies and plantations where no such special and local circumstances are found thus the ecclesiastical and canon law and all statutes respecting tithes the laws respecting courts baron and copyholds the game acts the statutes respecting the poor and settlements and all other laws and statutes having special reference to special and local circumstances and establishments within the realm do not extend to and operate within these settlements in partibus exteris where no such circumstances or establishments exist these laws have no force in america not merely because local circumstances differ but because they have never been adopted or brought over by acts of assembly or by practice in the courts   no statutes made since the establishment of said colonies and plantations except as above described in articles   and   do extend to and operate within said colonies and plantations query—would any statute made since the establishment of said colonies and plantations which statute imported to annul and abolish the powers and jurisdictions of their respective constitutions of government where the same was not contrary to the laws or any other wise forfeited or abated or which statute imported to take away or did take away the rights and privileges of the settlers as british subjects would such statute as of right extend to and operate within said colonies and plantations no the parliament has no such power the charters cannot be altered but by consent of both parties the king and the colonies     upon the matters of fact right and law as above stated it is that the british subjects thus settled in partibus exteris without the realm so long as they are excluded from an entire union with the realm as parts of and within the same have a right to have as they have and be governed by as they are a distinct entire civil government of the like powers preeminences and jurisdictions conformable to the like rights privileges immunities franchises and civil liberties as are to be found and are established in the british government respecting the british subject within the realm right hence also it is that the rights of the subject as declared in the petition of rights that the limitation of the prerogative by the act for abolishing the starchamber and for regulating the privy council c that the habeas corpus act the statute of frauds the bill of rights do of common right extend to and are in force within said colonies and plantations several of these rights are established by special colony laws if any are not yet so established the colonies have right to such laws and the covenant having been made in the charters by the king for himself and his successors such laws ought to receive the royal assent as of right hence it is that the freeholders within the precincts of these jurisdictions have as of right they ought to have a share in the power of making those laws which they are to be governed by by the right which they have of sending their representatives to act for them and to consent for them in all matters of legislation which representatives     when met in general assembly have together with the crown a right to perform and do all the like acts respecting the matters things and rights within the precincts of their jurisdiction as the parliament hath respecting the realm and british dominions hence also it is that all the executive offices from the supreme civil magistrate as locum tenens to the king down to that of constable and headborough must of right be established with all and the like powers neither more nor less than as defined by the constitution and law as in fact they are established hence it is that the judicial offices and courts of justice established within the precincts of said jurisdictions have as they ought of right to have all those jurisdictions and powers as fully and amply to all intents and purposes whatsoever as the courts of kings bench common pleas and exchequer within his majestys kingdom of england have and ought to have and are empowered to give judgment and award execution thereupon  hence it is that by the possession enjoyment and exercise of his majestys great seal delivered to his majestys governor there is established within the precincts of the respective jurisdictions all the same and like powers of chancery except where by charters specially excluded as his majestys chancellor within his majestys kingdom of england hath and of right ought to have by delivery of the great seal of england and hence it is that all the like rights privileges and powers follow the use exercise and application of the great seal of each colony and plantation within the precincts of said jurisdiction as doth and ought of right to follow the use exercise and applications of the great seal hence also it is that appeals in real actions whereby     the lands tenements and hereditaments of british subjects may be drawn into question and disposed of  do not lie as of right and by law they ought not to lie to the king in council hence also it is that there is not any law now in being whereby the subject within said colonies and plantations can be removed  from the jurisdiction to which he is amenable in all his rights and through which his service and allegiance must be derived to the crown and from which no appeal lies in criminal causes so as that such     subject may become amenable to a jurisdiction foreign to his natural and legal resiancy to which he may be thereby transported and under which he may be brought to trial and receive judgment contrary to the rights and privileges of the subject as declared by the spirit and intent and especially by the   th section of the habeas corpus act and if the person of any subject within the said colonies and plantations should be seized or detained by any power issuing from any court without the jurisdiction of the colony where he then had his legal resiancy it would become the duty of the courts of justice within such colony it is undoubtedly of their jurisdiction so to do to issue the writ of habeas corpus  hence also it is that in like manner as the command and disposition of the militia and of all forces by sea and land and of all forts and places of strength is and by the laws of england ever was the undoubted right of his majesty and his royal predecessors kings and queens of england within all his majestys realms and dominions  in like manner as the supreme military power and command     so far as the constitution knows of and will justify its establishment is inseparably annexed to and forms an essential part of the office of supreme civil magistrate the office of king in like manner in all governments under the king where the constituents are british subjects and of full and perfect right entitled to the british laws and constitution the supreme military command within the precincts of such jurisdictions must be inseparably annexed to the office of supreme civil magistrate his majestys regent viceregent lieutenant or locum tenens in what form soever established so that the king cannot by any  commission of regency by any commission or charter of government separate or withdraw the supreme command of the military from the office of supreme civil magistrate either by reserving this command in his own hands to be exercised and executed independent of the civil power or by granting a distinct commission to any military commanderinchief so as to be exercised and executed but more especially not within such jurisdictions where such supreme military power so far as the constitution knows and will justify the same is already annexed and granted to the office of supreme civil magistrate and hence it is that the king cannot erect or establish any law martial or military command by any commission     which may supersede and not be subject to the supreme civil magistrate within the respective precincts of the civil jurisdiction of said colonies and plantations otherwise than in such manner as the said law martial and military commissions are annexed or subject to the supreme civil jurisdiction within his majestys realms and dominions of great britain and ireland and hence it is that the establishment and exercise of such commands and commissions would be illegal  the king has the command of all military force in his dominions but in every distinct state of his dominions there should be the consent of the parliament or assembly the representative body to the raising and keeping up such military force he cannot even raise troops and quarter them in another without the consent of that other he cannot of right bring troops raised in ireland and quarter them in britain but with the consent of the parliament of britain nor carry to ireland and quarter there soldiers raised in britain without the consent of the irish parliament unless in time of war and cases of extreme exigency in      when the speaker went up to present the money bills he said among other things that england was     capable of fighting her own battles and defending herself and although ever attached to your majestys person ever at ease under your just government they cannot forbear taking notice of some circumstances in the present situation of affairs which nothing but the confidence in your justice could hinder from alarming their most serious apprehensions subsidies to foreign princes when already burdened with a debt scarce to be borne cannot but be severely felt an army of foreign troops a thing unprecedented unheard of unknown brought into england cannot but alarm c c see the speech nb—these foreign troops were part of the kings subjects hanoverians and all in his service which is the same thing as    ccclxxiii observations on passages in an inquiry into the nature and causes of the disputes between the british colonies in america and their mother country london      extract—supreme power and authority must not cannot reside equally everywhere throughout an empire observation—writers on this subject often confuse themselves with the idea that all the kings dominions make one state which they do not nor   0 ever did since the conquest our kings have ever had dominions not subject to the english parliament at first the provinces of france of which jersey and guernsey remain always governed by their own laws appealing to the king in council only and not to our courts or the house of lords scotland was in the same situation before the union it had the same king but a separate parliament and the parliament of england had no jurisdiction over it ireland the same in truth though the british parliament has usurped a dominion over it the colonies were originally settled in the idea of such extrinsic dominions of the king and of the king only hanover is now such a dominion if each assembly in this case were absolute they would it is evident form not one only but so many different governments perfectly independent of one another this is the only clear idea of their real present condition their only bond of union is the king now that of great britain being exactly the kind of government i have been speaking of the absolute impossibility of vesting the american assemblies with an authority in all respects equal to that of the mother country without actually dismembering the british empire must naturally occur to every one it would not be dismembering it if it never was united as in truth it never yet has been breaking the present union between england and scotland would be dismembering the empire but no     such union has yet been formed between britain and the colonies where divers remote and distant countries are united under one government an equal and fair representation becomes almost impracticable or at least extremely inconvenient here appears the excellency of the invention of colony government by separate independent legislatures by this means the remotest parts of a great empire may be as well governed as the centre misrule oppressions of proconsuls and discontents and rebellions thence arising prevented by this means the power of a king may be extended without inconvenience over territories of any dimensions how great soever america was thus happily governed in all its different and remote settlements by the crown and their own assemblies till the new politics took place of governing it by one parliament which have not succeeded and never will should we carry our supposition much farther the inconveniencies attending such long journeys would be very great although not interrupted by water water so far from being an obstruction is a means of facilitating such assemblies from distant countries a voyage of three thousand miles by sea is more easily performed than a journey of one thousand by land it is in my opinion by no means impracticable to bring representatives conveniently from america to britain but i think the present mode of letting     them govern themselves by their own assemblies much preferable they will always be better governed and the parliament has business enough here with its own internal concerns whether they should not be allowed such a form of government as will best secure to them their just rights and natural liberties they have it already all the difficulties have arisen from the british parliament attempting to deprive them of it is it not let me ask most egregious folly so loudly to condemn the stuart family who would have governed england without a parliament when at the same time we would almost all of us govern america upon principles not at all more justifiable very just only that the arbitrary government of a single person is more eligible than the arbitrary government of a body of men a single man may be afraid or ashamed of doing injustice a body is never either one or the other if it is strong enough it cannot apprehend assassination and by dividing the shame among them it is so little apiece that no one minds it and consistently with our rights of sovereignty over them i am surprised that a writer who in other respects appears often very reasonable should talk of our sovereignty over the colonies as if every individual     in england was a part of a sovereign over america the king is the sovereign of all the americans think that while they can retain the right of disposing of their own money they shall thereby secure all their other rights they have therefore not yet disputed your other pretensions that england has an undeniable right to consider america as a part of her dominions is a fact i presume which can never be questioned you do indeed presume too much america is not part of the dominions of england but of the kings dominion england is a dominion itself and has no dominions i will only observe at present that it was england in some sense which at first gave them being in some sense in what sense they were not planted at her expense as to defence all parts of the kings dominion have mutually always contributed to the defence one of the other the man in america who contributes sixpence towards an armament against the common enemy contributes as much to the common protection as if he lived in england they have always been ready to contribute but by voluntary grants according to their rights nor has any englishman yet had the effrontery to deny this truth if they are at liberty to choose what sums to raise as     well as the manner of raising them it is scarcely to be doubted that their allowance will be found extremely short and it is evident they may upon this footing absolutely refuse to pay any taxes at all and if so it would be much better for england if it were consistent with her safety to disclaim all further connexion with them than to continue her protection to them solely at her own expense why is it to be doubted that they will not grant what they ought to grant no complaint was ever yet made of their refusal or deficiency he says if they are not without reserve obliged to comply with the requisitions of the ministry they may absolutely refuse to pay any taxes at all let him apply this to the british parliament and the reasoning will equally prove that the commons ought likewise to comply absolutely with the requisitions of the ministry yet i have seen lately the ministry demand four shillings in the pound and the parliament grant but three but parliaments and provincial assemblies may always be safely trusted with this power of refusing or granting in part ministers will often demand too much but assemblies being acquainted properly with the occasion will always grant what is necessary as protection is as i said before mutual and equal in proportion to every mans property the colonies have been drawn into all british wars and have annoyed the enemies of britain as much in proportion as any other subjects of the king equal in numbers and property therefore this account has always balanced itself     it may further be observed that their proceedings are not quite so rapid and precipitate as those of the privy council so that should it be found necessary they will have more time to petition or make remonstrances for this privilege the least which a subject can enjoy is not to be denied them late experience has fully shown that american petitions and remonstrances are little regarded in britain the privilege of petitioning has been attempted to be wrested from them the assemblies uniting to petition has been called a flagitious attempt in the ministers letters and such assemblies as would persist in it have therefore been dissolved it is a joke to talk thus to us when we know that parliament so far from solemnly canvassing our petitions have refused to receive or read them our right of legislation over the americans unrepresented as they are is the point in question this right is asserted by most doubted by some and wholly disclaimed by a few i am one of those few but am persuaded the time is not far distant when the few will become the many for magna est veritas et prevalebit but to put the matter in a stronger light the question i think should be whether we have a general right of making slaves or not a very proper state of the question and the americans may be treated with as much equity and even tenderness by the parliament of great     britain as by their own assemblies this at least is possible though perhaps not very probable how can we americans believe this when we see almost half the nation paying but one shilling and sixpence in the pound while others pay full four shillings and that there is not virtue and honesty enough in parliament to rectify this iniquity how can we suppose they will be just to us at such a distance when they are not just to one another it is not indeed as the author says very probable the unequal representation too that prevails in this kingdom they are so far from having virtue enough to attempt to remedy that they make use of it as an argument why we should have no representation at all to the equity of this measure an american representation in parliament the americans themselves i presume could have nothing fairly to object provided they had an equitable number of representatives allowed them as to those indeed which attend only the choosing a new parliament they may perhaps by proper means be considerably lessened though not wholly removed let the old members continue till superseded by new ones from america but should the king at any time be disposed to dissolve his parliament and convene a new one as hath often been done only at a few weeks notice this upon the same footing could not be effected     by the above it might the method however of examining and deciding contested elections when necessary must undoubtedly with respect to america be set in a great measure upon a different footing from that at present practised in this kingdom let the members be chosen by the american assemblies and disputed elections settled there if any but there would be none it is not in the least at this time probable that an american representation will ever be convened in england i think so too where neither side approves a match it is not likely to be made they will be almost wholly excluded the benefit of private acts by reason of immoderate expense they may make them at home the expense of private acts in england is shamefully great the repairing of highways making rivers navigable and cutting canals with a variety of other things of the like kind wherein recourse must be had to parliament and yet the expense be supplied chiefly if not wholly by private persons all this may be done by their own laws at home this mode of compromise may as well be waived as it cannot be effected it is evident without immense trouble very little     and if they should be divided in their sentiments upon it and uncertain what measures to adopt and follow it cannot be matter of just wonder and censure then leave it as it is it was very well till you attempted alterations and novelties in respect to the article of levying taxes it should be deemed only a matter of grace to be resumed at pleasure your humble servant we thank you for nothing keep up your claim and make the most of it to be placed upon a level with the rest of the subjects of the british crown is the utmost the colonies can challenge no they may challenge all that was promised them by charters to encourage them to settle there they have performed their part of the contract and therefore have a right to expect a performance of the other part they have by the risks and expenses they have incurred additional merit and are therefore to be considered as above the level of other subjects we cannot otherwise maintain our sovereignty over it unless our safety were actually at stake and absolutely required it i am quite sick of our sovereignty your safety is only endangered by quarrelling with the colonies not by leaving them to the free enjoyment of their own liberties     they who first migrated from england to settle in america well knew i presume they were still to continue the subjects of the same government they well knew the contrary they would never have gone if that had been the case they fled from your government which oppressed them if they carried your government with them and of course your laws they had better have stayed and endured the oppression at home and not have added to it all the hardships of making a new settlement they carried not your laws but had they carried your government and laws they would now have been subject to spiritual courts tithes church acts of parliament game acts c c which they are not and never were since their being out of the realm they knew they were not to be independent they were to depend on the king only for no one i imagine would doubt if their charters granted them an inconsistent power but that they might be justly cancelled as no government can be supposed to alienate prerogatives necessary to its safe existence every government is supposed to be compos mentis when it grants charters and shall not be allowed to plead insanity if you break the charters or violate them you dissolve all ties between us however a right of sovereignty in this case we may undeniably claim and vindicate though we might safely grant them independency   0 you may claim it but you have not never had nor i trust ever will have it you that is the people of england cannot grant the americans independency of the king it can never be but with his consent and theirs preserving our sovereignty over them although at the expense of some portion of their natural prerogatives they partly consist of our own plantations and partly of the conquests we have made from a nation in whose hands it would have been dangerous for us to have continued our sovereignty our sovereignty for ever of their not our plantations the conquests may be yours partly but they are partly conquests belonging to the colonies who joined their forces with yours in equal proportion our very being therefore at least as a free people depends upon our retention of them take care then how you use them they are now treated as children their complaints are heard and grievances redressed but then they would be treated rather as slaves having the swords of their masters perpetually held at their throats if they should presume to offer half the indignities to the officers of the french crown which they have often with impunity done to those of the british the direct contrary is true they are not redressed they are refused to be heard fresh oppressions and insults are continually added english     swords are now held at our throats every step is taking to convince us that there is no difference in government nay they have assemblies of their own to redress their grievances it is well they have and if that should be done what marks of sovereignty will they allow us to enjoy what sort of a claim will they indulge us with only i suppose a mere titular one and if so would they then expect that we should still protect them with our forces by sea and land or will they themselves maintain an army and navy sufficient for that purpose this they certainly at present are not able to do if they were not sheltered by the wings of great britain what would you have would you the people of england be subjects and kings at the same time dont be under any apprehensions for them they will find allies and friends somewhere and it will be worth no ones while to make them enemies or to attack so poor a people so numerous and so well armed nor is there any reason to apprehend that they should be at all formidable to england as the number of american representatives in parliament might be properly limited as those of scotland were at the union a proper limitation can only be this that they shall from time to time have such a number of additional members as are proportioned to their     increasing share of the taxes and numbers of the people an exact estimate can scarcely be made of what expense their protection stands in to great britain the protection is mutual they are always in time of war at as much expense as would be necessary to protect themselves first by the troops and armed ships they raise and equip secondly by the higher price they pay for all commodities when drawn into war by english european quarrels thirdly by obstructions to the vent of their produce by general embargo they are justly chargeable with a certain portion of the civil list for this most indubitably constitutes a part of government how this article at present is managed in england is not now my business to inquire i will tell you how it is managed the colonies maintain their governors who are the kings representatives and the king receives a quitrent from the lands in most of the colonies in many parts they are little perhaps or nothing at all inferior in respect of their conveniences to the mother country as these differences cannot be known in parliament here how can you proportion and vary your taxes of america so as to make them equal and fair it would be undertaking what you are not qualified for as well as doing what you have no right to do     yet it must be granted that they know the best state of their own funds and what taxes they can afford to pay and yet you would be meddling it is very certain that england is entitled to a great deal of gratitude from her colonies the english are eternally harping on this strain the great obligation the colonies are under for protection from the french i have shown already that the defence was mutual every man in england and every mans estate have been defended from the french but is it sense to tell any particular man the nation has incurred a debt of one hundred and fortyeight millions to protect you and your estate and therefore you owe a great deal of gratitude to the nation he will say and justly i paid my proportion and i am under no obligation the colonies as i have shown in preceding notes have always paid more in various ways and besides extending your trade sometimes from which you exclude the colonies and for whims about the balance of power and for the sake of continental connexions in which they were separately unconcerned on the other hand they have from their first settlement had wars in america in which they never engaged you the french have never been their enemies but on your account that the late war was chiefly kindled and carried on on your account can scarcely be denied it is denied     by the steps they seem to take to shake off our sovereignty our sovereignty again this writer like the genoese queens of corsica deems himself a sprig of royalty for as soon as they are no longer dependent upon england they may be assured they will immediately become dependent upon france we are assured of the contrary weak states that are poor are as safe as great ones that are rich they are not objects of envy the trade that may be carried on with them makes them objects of friendship the smallest states may have great allies and the mutual jealousies of great nations contribute to their security and whatever reasons there might exist to dispose them in our favor in preference to the french yet how far these would operate no one can pretend to say then be careful not to use them ill it is a better reason for using them kindly that alone can retain their friendship your sovereignty will be of no use if the people hate you keeping them in obedience will cost you more than your profits from them will amount to it is not indeed for their jealousy of their rights and liberties but for their riotous and seditious manner of asserting them do you englishmen then pretend to censure the colonies for riots look at home i have seen     within a year riots in the country about corn riots about elections riots about workhouses riots of colliers riots of weavers riots of coalheavers riots of sawyers riots of sailors riots of wilkesites riots of government chairmen riots of smugglers in which customhouse officers and excisemen have been murdered the kings armed vessels and troops fired at c in america if one mob rises and breaks a few windows or tars and feathers a single rascally informer it is called rebellion troops and fleets must be sent and military execution talked of as the decentest thing in the world here indeed one would think riots part of the mode of government and if she had not thought proper to centre almost all her care as she has done upon making the late peace in procuring them a safe establishment and to sacrifice to it in a manner every other object she might at least expect from them a more decent and dutiful demeanour in the last war america kept up twentyfive thousand men at her own cost for five years and spent many millions her troops were in all battles all service thousands of her youth fell a sacrifice the crown gained an immense extent of territory and a great number of new subjects britain gained a new market for her manufactures and recovered and secured the old one among the indians which the french had interrupted and annihilated but what did the americans gain except that safe establishment which they are now so taunted with lands were divided among none of them the very fishery which they fought to obtain they are now restrained in     the plunder of the havana was not for them and this very safe establishment they might as well have had by treaty with the french their neighbours who would probably have been easily made and continued their friends if it had not been for their connexion with britain and it seldom happens that any one fares the better for his insolence then dont be insolent with your power for should matters on all sides as i hope they never will be carried to extremities i cannot take upon me to say but england may yet produce both a ministry and parliament that would rather share them once more with the french than relinquish her present pretensions we have been often threatened with this wise measure of returning canada to france do it when you please had the french power which you were five years subduing with twentyfive thousand regulars and twentyfive thousand of us to help you continued at our backs ready to support and assist us whenever we might think proper to resist your oppressions you would never have thought of a stamp act for us you would not have dared to use us as you have done if it be so politic a measure to have enemies at hand as the notion is to keep your subjects in obedience then give part of ireland to the french to plant plant another french colony in the highlands to keep rebellious scotland in order plant another on tower hill to restrain your own mobs there never was a notion more ridiculous dont     you see the advantage you may have if you preserve our connexion the fifty thousand men and the fleet employed in america during the last war are now so much strength at liberty to be employed elsewhere the legislative power of every kingdom or empire should centre in one supreme assembly distinguish here what may be convenient from what is fact before the union it was thought convenient and long wished for that the two kingdoms should join in one parliament but till that union was formed the fact was that their parliaments were distinct and the british parliaments would not make laws for scotland the same fact now subsists in america the parliament and states are distinct but the british parliament has taken advantage of our minority and usurped powers not belonging to it it would not be amiss perhaps to ask them what bounds they would be content to fix to their claims and demands upon us as hitherto they seem to be at a loss where to stop they only desire that you would leave them where you found them repeal all your taxing laws and return to requisitions when you would have aids from them i must freely own that whatever opinion i may have of their right i certainly have not quite as favorable one of their conduct which often is neither consistent nor prudent     they think the same of yours if they are really willing we should exercise any acts of sovereignty among them at all the imposition they have so riotously resisted might not improperly perhaps have been allowed better quarter leave the king who alone is the sovereign to exercise his acts of sovereignty in appointing their governors and in approving or disapproving their laws but do you leave it to their choice to trade elsewhere for commodities to go to another shop no you say they shall buy of you or nobody nor should mere custom nor any charter or law in being be allowed any great weight in the decision of this point the charters are sacred violate them and then the present bond of union the kingly power over us will be broken the americans may insist upon the same rights privileges and exemptions as are allowed the irish because of the similarity if not identity of their connexions with us surely the americans deserve a little more they never put you to the trouble and expense of conquering them as ireland has done three times over they never were in rebelllion i speak now of the native irish the english families settled there lost no rights by their merit in conquering that country but if any distinction were to be made most certainly of the two nations the americans are least entitled to any lenity on that score     i wonder much at this most certainly the terms she may not think safe and proper to grant the irish she may judge full as dangerous and imprudent to grant the americans it is very imprudent to deprive america of any of her privileges if her commerce and friendship are of any importance to you they are to be had on no other terms than leaving her in the full enjoyment of her rights long before we could send among them any considerable number of forces they might do a great deal of mischief if not actually overturn all order and government they will take care to preserve order and government for their own sakes several other reasons might be offered why the same measures in regard to both nations might not be altogether alike convenient and advisable where you cannot so conveniently use force there you should endeavour to secure affection ccclxxiv observations on passages in a pamphlet entitled the true constitutional means for putting an end to the disputes between great britain and the american colonies extract every british subject must acknowledge that the directive influence of the british state remains with the british legislature who are the only proper judges of what concerns the general welfare of the whole empire   0 observation the british state is only the island of great britain the british legislature are undoubtedly the only proper judges of what concerns the welfare of that state but the irish legislature are the proper judges of what concerns the irish state and the american legislature of what concerns the american states respectively by the whole empire does this writer mean all the kings dominions if so the british parliament should also govern the isles of jersey and guernsey and hanover but this is not so but the land tax which i have proposed is in its very nature unoppressive and is equally well suited to the poorest as to the richest province of the british empire this writer seems ignorant that every colony has its own civil and military establishment to provide for new roads and bridges to make churches and all public edifices to erect and would he separately tax them moreover with a tax on lands equal to what is paid in britain the colonists must possess a luxuriant abundance to be able to double their inhabitants in so short a space how does this appear is not a mere competence sufficient for this purpose if america will consent to pay thus its proportion of british taxes will britain pay out of the whole all the american taxes or is america to pay both the produce of the planters purchases for them what others buy with gold and silver but even several of the     colonists of the rank of good livers have often been seen to pay the price of a negro with gold as instances of virginian luxury i have been assured that there are few families there without some plate and at some entertainments the attendants have appeared almost as numerous as the guests was not the gold first purchased by the produce of his land obtained by hard labor does gold drop from the clouds in virginia into the laps of the indolent their very purchasing plate and other superfluities from england is one means of disabling them from paying taxes to england would you have it both in meal and malt it has been a great folly in the americans to entertain english gentlemen with a splendid hospitality ill suited to their circumstances by which they excited no other grateful sentiments in their guests than that of a desire to tax the landlord it cannot be deemed exorbitant considering their traffic with the french sugar islands as well as with our own and this will make the whole of their importations four millions per annum this is arguing the riches of a people from their extravagance—the very thing that keeps them poor the inhabitants of great britain pay above thirteen millions sterling every year including turnpikes and the poors rates two articles which the colonists are exempt from a turnpike tax is no burden as the turnpike gives more benefit than it takes and ought the rich in     britain who have made such numbers of poor by engrossing all the small divisions of land and who keep the laborers and working people poor by limiting their wages—ought those gentry to complain of the burden of maintaining the poor that have worked for them at unreasonably low rates all their lives as well might the planter complain of being obliged to maintain his poor negroes when they grow old or sick or lame and unable to provide for themselves for though all pay by the same law yet none can be required to pay beyond his ability and the fund from whence the tax is raised is in the colonies that are least inhabited just as able to bear the burden imposed as in the most populous county of great britain the colonies are almost always considered by these ignorant flimsy writers as unwilling to contribute to the general exigencies of the state which is not true they are always willing but will have the granting of their own money themselves in which they are right for various reasons they would be content to take land from us gratuitously what land have they ever taken from you the lands did not belong to the crown but to the indians of whom the colonists either purchased them at their own expense or conquered them without assistance from britain the engagement to settle the american lands and the expense of settlement are more than equivalent for what was of no value to britain without a first settlement     the rental of the lands in great britain and ireland amounts to about twentytwo millions but the rental of the same extent of lands in america is not probably one million sterling what signifies extent of unsettled lands that produce nothing i beg to know if the returns of any traffic on earth ever produced so many per cent as the returns of agriculture in a fertile soil and favorable climate how little this politician knows of agriculture is there any country where ten bushels of grain are generally got in for one sown and are all the charges and advances for labor to be nothing no farmer of america in fact makes five per cent of his money his profit is only being paid for his own labor and that of his children the opulence of one english or dutch merchant would make the opulence of a hundred american farmers it may i think be safely concluded that the riches of the colonists would not increase so fast were the inhabitants to leave off enlarging their settlements and plantations and run eagerly upon manufactures there is no necessity of leaving their plantations they can manufacture in their families at spare times depend upon it the americans are not so impolitic as to neglect settlements for unprofitable manufactures but some manufactures may be more advantageous to some persons than the cultivation of land and these will prosecute such manufactures notwithstanding your oratory     benjamin franklin m dubourg ccclxxv to m dubourg     i am persuaded as well as you that the sea coal has a vegetable origin and that it has been formed near the surface of the earth but as preceding convulsions of nature had served to bring it very deep in many places and covered it with many different strata we are indebted to subsequent convulsions for having brought within our view the extremities of its veins so as to lead us to penetrate the earth in search of it i visited last summer a large coal mine at whitehaven in cumberland and in following the vein and descending by degrees towards the sea i penetrated below the ocean where the level of its surface was more than eight hundred fathoms above my head and the miners assured me that their works extended some miles beyond the place where i then was continually and gradually descending under the sea the slate which forms the roof of this coal mine is impressed in many places with the figures of leaves and branches of fern which undoubtedly grew at the surface when the slate was in the state of sand on the banks of the sea thus it appears that this vein of coal has suffered a prodigious settlement    b franklin     benjamin franklin

obliged to you i cannot make you adequate returns in kind but i send you however some of the true rhubarb seed which you desire i had it from mr english who lately received a medal of the society of arts for propagating it i send also some green dry peas highly esteemed here as the best for making pea soup and also some chinese caravances with father navarettes account of the universal use of a cheese made of them in china which so excited my curiosity that i caused inquiry to be made of mr flint who lived many years there in what manner the cheese was made and i send you his answer i have since learned that some runnings of salt i suppose runnet is put into water when the meal is in it to turn it to curds i think we have caravances with us but i know not whether they are the same with these which actually came from china they are said to be of great increase i shall inquire of mr collinson for your journal i see that of east florida is printed with storks account my love to good

complained more of her head since you left us than ever before if she stoops or looks or bends her neck downwards on any occasion it is with great pain and difficulty that she gets her head up again she has therefore borrowed a breast and neck collar of mrs wilkes such as misses wear and now uses it to keep her head up mr strahan has invited us all to dine there tomorrow but she has excused herself will you come and go with me if you cannot well do that you will at least be with us on friday as to my own head which you so kindly inquire after its swimming has gradually worn off and today for the first time i felt nothing of it on getting out of bed but as this speedy recovery is as i am fully persuaded owing to the extreme abstemiousness i have observed for some days past at home i am not without apprehensions that being to dine abroad this day tomorrow and next day i may inadvertently bring it on again if i do not think of my little monitor and guardian angel and make use of the proper and very pertinent clause she proposes in my grace here comes a morning visitor adieu my     best respects to mrs tickell i am my dear friend yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin

winthrop dated december  th containing the following account viz on thursday the  th of november i had an opportunity of observing a transit of mercury i had carefully adjusted my clock to the apparent time by correspondent altitudes of the sun taken with the quadrant for several days before and with the same reflecting telescope as i used for the transit of venus  i first perceived the little planet making an impression on the suns limb at  h   ′   ″ and he appeared wholly within at   ′   ″ apparent time the sun set before the planet reached the middle of his course and for a considerable time before sunset it was so cloudy that the planet could not be discerned so that i made no observations of consequence except that of the beginning at which time the sun was perfectly clear this transit completes three periods of fortysix years since the first observation of gassendi at paris in      i am sir with great esteem your most obedient servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    march    0 london michael hillegas ccclxxix to michael hillegas london    march    0 dear sir— i received your favor of november   th and have made inquiries as you desired concerning the copper covering of houses it has been used here in a few instances only and the practice does not seem to gain ground the copper is about the thickness of a common playingcard and though a dearer metal than lead i am told that as less weight serves on account of its being so much thinner and as slighter woodwork in the roof is sufficient to support it the roof is not dearer on the whole than one covered with lead it is said that hail and rain make a disagreeable drumming noise on copper but this i suppose is rather fancy for the plates being fastened on the rafters must in a great measure deaden such sound the first cost whatever it is will be all as a copper covering must last for ages and when the house decays the plates will still have intrinsic worth in russia i am informed many houses are covered with plates of iron tinned such as our tin pots and other vases are made of laid on over the edges of one another like tiles and which it is said last very long the tin preserving the iron from much decay by rusting in france and the low countries i have seen many spouts or pipes for conveying the water down from the roofs of houses made of the same     kind of tin plates soldered together and they seem to stand very well with sincere regard i am yours c b franklin benjamin franklin    march    0 london ccclxxx to a friend in america london    march    0 dear sir— your very judicious letter of november   th being communicated by me to some member of parliament was handed about among them so that it was some time before i got it again into my hands it had due weight with several and was of considerable use you will see that i printed it at length in the london chronicle with the merchants letter when the american affairs came to be debated in the house of commons the majority notwithstanding all the weight of ministerial influence was only sixtytwo for continuing the whole last act and would not have been so large nay i think the repeal would have been carried but that the ministry were persuaded by governor bernard and some lying letters said to be from boston that the associations not to import were all breaking to pieces that america was in the greatest distress for want of the goods that we could not possibly subsist any longer without them and must of course submit to any terms parliament should think fit to impose upon us this with the idle notion of the dignity and sovereignty   0 of parliament which they are so fond of and imagine will be endangered by any further concessions prevailed i know with many to vote with the ministry who otherwise on account of the commerce wish to see the difference accommodated but though both the duke of grafton and lord north were and are in my opinion rather inclined to satisfy us yet the bedford party are so violent against us and so prevalent in the council that more moderate measures could not take place this party never speak of us but with evident malice rebels and traitors are the best names they can afford us and i believe they only wish for a colorable pretence and occasion of ordering the soldiers to make a massacre among us on the other hand the rockingham and shelburne people with lord chathams friends are disposed to favor us if they were again in power which at present they are not like to be though they too would be for keeping up the claim of parliamentary sovereignty but without exercising it in any mode of taxation besides these we have for sincere friends and wellwishers the body of dissenters generally throughout england with many others not to mention ireland and all the rest of europe who from various motives join in applauding the spirit of liberty with which we have claimed and insisted on our privileges and wish us success but whose suffrage cannot have much weight in our affairs the merchants here were at length prevailed on to present a petition but they moved slowly and some of them i thought reluctantly perhaps from a     despair of success the city not being much in favor with the court at present the manufacturing towns absolutely refused to move at all some pretending to be offended with our attempting to manufacture for ourselves others saying that they had employment enough and that our trade was of little importance to them whether we continued or refused it those who began a little to feel the effects of our forbearing to purchase were persuaded to be quiet by the ministerial people who gave out that certain advices were received of our beginning to break our agreements of our attempts to manufacture proving all abortive and ruining the undertakers of our distress for want of goods and dissensions among ourselves which promised the total defeat of all such kind of combinations and the prevention of them for the future if the government were not urged imprudently to repeal the duties but now that it appears from late and authentic accounts that agreements continue in full force that a ship is actually returned from boston to bristol with nails and glass articles that were thought of the utmost necessity and that the ships which were waiting here for the determination of parliament are actually returning to north america in their ballast the tone of the manufacurers begins to change and there is no doubt that if we are steady and persevere in our resolutions these people will soon begin a clamor that much pains has hitherto been used to stifle in short it appears to me that if we do not now persist in this measure till it has had its full effect it can never again be used on any future occasion with     the least prospect of success and that if we do persist another year we shall never afterwards have occasion to use it with sincere regards i am dear sir your obedient servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april    0 london samuel cooper ccclxxxi to samuel cooper london    april    0 dear sir— i suppose governor pownall acquaints you with what has passed this session relating to our american affairs all europe is attentive to the dispute between britain and the colonies and i own i have a satisfaction in seeing that our part is taken everywhere because i am persuaded that that circumstance will not be without its effect here in our favor at the same time the malignant pleasure which other powers take in british divisions may convince us on both sides of the necessity of our uniting in france they have translated and printed the principal pieces that have been written on the american side of the question and as french is the political language of europe it has communicated an acquaintance with our affairs very extensively m beaumont a famous advocate of paris the defender of the family of calas wrote the reflexions dun etranger désintéressé which i send you the manuscript is an original letter from a gentleman of note i am told as far off as the austrian silesia who being     concerned for us wrote it to the parliament directing it to the late speaker the speaker read only the first side was offended at the freedom and impertinence as he called it and returned the letter to the office refusing to pay the postage accept it as a curiosity i send you also a late edition of molineuxs case of ireland with a new preface shrewdly written our part is warmly taken by the irish in general there being in many points a similarity in our cases my respects to mr bowdoin and believe me ever dear sir yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    may    0 mary stevenson ccclxxxii to miss mary stevenson tuesday    may    0 dear polly— i received your letter early this morning and as i am so engaged that i cannot see you when you come today i write this line just to say that i am sure you are a much better judge in this affair of your own than i can possibly be  in that confidence it was that i forebore giving my advice when you mentioned it to me and not from any disapprobation my concern equal to any fathers for your happiness makes me write this lest having more regard for my opinion than you ought and imagining it against the proposal because i did not immediately advise accepting it you should let that weigh any thing in your deliberations     i assure you that no objection has occurred to me his person you see his temper and understanding you can judge of his character for any thing i have ever heard is unblemished his profession with the skill in it he is supposed to have will be sufficient to support a family and therefore considering the fortune you have in your hands though any future expectation from your parent should be disappointed i do not see but that the agreement may be a rational one on both sides i see your delicacy and your humility too for you fancy that if you do not prove a great fortune you will not be loved but i am sure were i in his situation in every respect knowing you so well as i do and esteeming you so highly i should think you a fortune sufficient for me without a shilling having thus more explicitly than before given my opinion i leave the rest to your sound judgment of which no one has a greater share and i shall not be too inquisitive after your particular reasons your doubts your fears and the like for i shall be confident whether you accept or refuse that you do right i only wish you may do what will most contribute to your happiness and of course to mine being ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—do not be angry with me for supposing your determination not quite so fixed as you fancy it     benjamin franklin   june    0 london jonathan williams ccclxxxiii to jonathan williams london   june    0 dear cousin— your favor of january  th came duly to hand but i have been so much engaged during the sitting of parliament that i could not correspond regularly with all my friends and have of course trespassed most with those on whose good nature and indulgence i could most rely i am however ashamed of being so long silent it was but the other day that i inquired after the fate of your tickets when i received the enclosed answer whereby you will see that the whole cost has not been lost i only wished to see three ciphers more following the sum i have not any further orders from you but think to take at a venture two tickets more on your account if you disapprove and choose to rest where you are signify it by a line before the drawing directed to messrs smith wright and grey who may then dispose of the tickets i am glad to hear the old gentleman your father is still alive and happy please to remember me to him respectfully probably he can recollect but little of me as it is a good deal more than half a century since he has seen me but i remember him well a lively active handsome young man with a fine full flowing head of hair i suppose he must how be near fourscore if i could have given you any intimation of the intentions of government with regard to america that     might be depended upon you should have had them in good time for use in the views of trade you hint at but there have been this winter such changes of men and of minds and such continual expectations of more and other changes that nothing was certain and i believe that to this day the ministry are not all of a mind or determined what are the next steps proper to be taken with us some are said to be for severe others for lenient measures others for leaving things as they now are in confidence that we shall soon be tired of our nonimportation agreements manufacturing schemes and selfdenying frugalities submit to the duties and return by degrees to our dear luxuries and idleness with our old course of commercial extravagance folly and good humor which of these opinions will prevail and be acted on it is impossible yet to say i only know that generally the dispute is thought a dangerous one and that many wish to see it well compromised in time lest by a continuance of mutual provocations the breach should become past healing i am much obliged to you and cousin hubbard for your kindness to my friend hughes of which he informed me with many expressions of gratitude for your civilities he would have been very happy in that station and in your acquaintance so nigh him but he is now removed to carolina my love to your good wife and children and believe me ever your affectionate uncle b franklin     benjamin franklin   june    0 london samuel cooper ccclxxxiv to samuel cooper  london   june    0 dear sir— i received duly your favor of march   th with this i send you two speeches in parliament on our affairs by a member that you know the repeal of the whole late act would undoubtedly have been a prudent measure and i have reason to believe that lord north was for it but some of the other ministers could not be brought to agree to it so the duty on tea with that obnoxious preamble remains to continue the dispute but i think the next session will hardly pass over without repealing them for the parliament must finally comply with the sense of the nation as to the standing army kept up among us in time of peace without the consent of our assemblies i am clearly of opinion that it is not agreeable to the constitution should the king by the aid of his parliaments in ireland and the colonies raise an army and bring it into england quartering it here in time of peace without the consent of the parliament of great britain i am persuaded he would soon be told that he had no right so to do and the nation would ring with clamors against it i own that i see no difference in the cases and while we continue so many distinct and separate states our having the same head or sovereign the king will not justify such an invasion     of the separate right of each state to be consulted on the establishment of whatever force is proposed to be kept up within its limits and to give or refuse its consent as shall appear most for the public good of that state that the colonies were originally constituted distinct states and intended to be continued such is clear to me from a thorough consideration of their original charters and the whole conduct of the crown and nation towards them until the restoration since that period the parliament here has usurped an authority of making laws for them which before it had not we have for some time submitted to that usurpation partly through ignorance and inattention and partly from our weakness and inability to contend i hope when our rights are better understood here we shall by prudent and proper conduct be able to obtain from the equity of this nation a restoration of them and in the meantime i could wish that such expressions as the supreme authority of parliament subordinacy of our assemblies to the parliament and the like which in reality mean nothing if our assemblies with the king have a true legislative authority i say i could wish that such expressions were no more seen in our public pieces they are too strong for compliment and tend to confirm a claim of subjects in one part of the kings dominions to be sovereigns over their fellowsubjects in another part of his dominions when in truth they have no such right and their claim is founded only in usurpation the several states having equal rights and liberties and being only connected as england and     scotland were before the union by having one common sovereign the king this kind of doctrine the lords and commons here would deem little less than treason against what they think their share of the sovereignty over the colonies to me those bodies seem to have been long encroaching on the rights of their and our sovereign assuming too much of his authority and betraying his interests by our constitution he is with his plantation parliaments the sole legislator of his american subjects and in that capacity is and ought to be free to exercise his own judgment unrestrained and unlimited by his parliament here and our parliaments have a right to grant him aids without the consent of this parliament a circumstance which by the way begins to give it some jealousy let us therefore hold fast our loyalty to our king who has the best disposition towards us and has a family interest in our prosperity as that steady loyalty is the most probable means of securing us from the arbitrary power of a corrupt parliament that does not like us and conceives itself to have an interest in keeping us down and fleecing us if they should urge the inconvenience of an empires being divided into so many separate states and from thence conclude that we are not so divided i would answer that an inconvenience proves nothing but itself england and scotland were once separate states under the same king the inconvenience found in their being separate states did not prove that the parliament of england had a right to govern scotland a formal union was thought necessary   0 and england was a hundred years soliciting it before she could bring it about if great britain now thinks such a union necessary with us let her propose her terms and we may consider them were the general sentiment of this nation to be consulted in the case i should hope the terms whether practicable or not would at least be equitable for i think that except among those with whom the spirit of toryism prevails the popular inclination here is to wish us well and that we may preserve our liberties i unbosom myself thus to you in confidence of your prudence and wishing to have your sentiments on the subject in return mr pownall i suppose will acquaint you with the event of his motions and therefore i say nothing more of them than that he appears very sincere in his endeavors to serve us on which account i sometime since republished with pleasure the parting addresses to him of your assembly with some previous remarks to his honor as well as in justification of our people i hope that before this time those detestable murderers have quitted your province and that the spirit of industry and frugality continues and increases with sincerest esteem and affection i am dear sir c b franklin p s—just before the last session of parliament commenced a friend of mine who had connexion with some of the ministry wrote me a letter purposely     to draw from me my sentiments in writing on the then state of affairs i wrote a pretty free answer which i know was immediately communicated and a good deal handed about among them for your private amusement i send you copies i wish you may be able to read them as they are very badly written by a very blundering clerk  benjamin franklin   june    0 london samuel franklin ccclxxxv to samuel franklin london   june    0 loving cousin— i received your kind letter of the   d of march i was happy to find that neither you nor any of your family were in the way of those murderers  i hope that before this time the town is quite freed from such dangerous and mischievous inmates i rejoice to hear that you and your good wife and children continue in health my love to them i still enjoy a considerable share of that blessing thanks to god and hope once more to see boston and my friends there before i die i left it first in      i made a visit there in      another in      another in      another in      perhaps if i live to      i may then call again and take my leave     our relation sally franklin is

to hear from you when i have no letter from any one else by captain falconer i answered sallys letter about her sons being inoculated and told her sir john pringles opinion as to the probability of his not having the smallpox hereafter i think he advised as no eruption appeared to make sure of the thing by inoculating him again i rejoice much in the pleasure you appear to take in him it must be of use to your health the having such an amusement my love to him and to his father and mother captain ourry is gone abroad as a travelling tutor to lord galways son mrs strahan is at bath mr strahan and children mr and mrs west and their son are all well at present though mr west himself has had a long illness they always inquire after you and i present your compliments poor nanny was drawn in to marry a worthless fellow who got all her money and then ran away and left her so she is     returned to her old service with mrs stevenson poorer than ever but seems pretty patient only looks dejected sighs sometimes and wishes she had never left philadelphia mr montgomery died at sea as we have lately heard as to myself i had from christmas till easter a disagreeable giddiness hanging about me which however did not hinder me from being about and doing business in the easter holidays being at a friends house in the country i was taken with a sore throat and came home half strangled from monday till friday i could swallow nothing but barley water and the like on friday came on a fit of the gout from which i had been free five years immediately the inflammation and swelling in my throat disappeared my foot swelled greatly and i was confined about three weeks since which i am perfectly well the giddiness and every other disagreeable symptom having quite left me i hope your health is likewise by this time quite reëstablished being as ever my dear child your affectionate husband b franklin benjamin franklin    june    0 london samuel rhoads ccclxxxvii to samuel rhoads london    june    0 dear friend— it is a long time since i had the pleasure of hearing from you directly mrs franklin has indeed now and then acquainted me of your welfare which i am always glad to hear of it is i fear     partly if not altogether my fault that our correspondence has not been regularly continued one thing i am sure of that it has been from no want of regard on either side but rather from too much business and avocations of various kinds and my having little of importance to communicate one of our good citizens mr hillegas anxious for the future safety of our town wrote to me some time since desiring i would inquire concerning the covering of our houses here with copper i sent him the best information i could then obtain but have since received the enclosed from an ingenious friend who is what they call here a civil engineer i should be glad you would peruse it think of the matter a little and give me your sentiments of it when you have done with the paper please to give it to mr hillegas i am told by lord despencer who has covered a long piazza or gallery with copper that the expense is charged in this account too high for his cost but one shilling and ten pence per foot all charges included i suppose his copper must have been thinner and indeed it is so strong a metal that i think it may well be used very thin it appears to me of great importance to build our dwellinghouses if we can in a manner more secure from danger by fire we scarcely ever heard of fire in paris when i was there i took particular notice of the construction of their houses and i did not see how one of them could well be burnt the roofs are slate or tile the walls are stone the walls generally lined with stucco or plaster instead of wainscot the floors of stucco or of six square tiles painted brown     or of flag stone or of marble if any floors were of wood it was of oak wood which is not so inflammable as pine carpets prevent the coldness of stone or brick floors offending the feet in winter and the noise of treading on such floors overhead is less inconvenient than on boards the stairs too at paris are either stone or brick with only a wooden edge or corner for the step so that on the whole though the parisians commonly burn wood in their chimneys a more dangerous kind of fuel than that used here yet their houses escape extremely well as there is little in a room that can be consumed by fire except the furniture whereas in london perhaps scarcely a year passes in which half a million of property and many lives are not lost by this destructive element of late indeed they begin here to leave off wainscoting their rooms and instead of it cover the walls with stucco often formed into pannels like wainscot which being painted is very strong and warm stone staircases too with iron rails grow more and more into fashion here but stone steps cannot in some circumstances be fixed and there methinks oak is safer than pine and i assure you that in many genteel houses here both old and new the stairs and floors are oak and look extremely well perhaps solid oak for the steps would be still safer than boards and two steps might be cut diagonally out of one piece excuse my talking to you on a subject with which you must be so much better acquainted than i am it is partly to make out a letter and partly in hope that by turning your attention to the point some     methods of greater security in our future building may be thought of and promoted by you whose judgment i know has deservedly great weight with our fellowcitizens for though our town has not hitherto suffered greatly by fire yet i am apprehensive that some time or other by a concurrence of unlucky circumstances such as dry weather hard frost and high winds a fire then happening may suddenly spread far and wide over our cedar roofs and do us an immense mischief i am yours c b franklin paper referred to in the above letter the carpentry of the roof being formed with its proper descents is in the first place sheeted or covered with deals nailed horizontally upon the rafters after the same manner as when intended to be covered with lead the sheets of the copper for this covering are two feet by four and for covering the slopes of the roof are cast so thin as to weigh eight or nine pounds and for covering the flats or gutters ten or eleven pounds each or about one pound or a pound and a quarter to the superficial foot a string of strong cartridge paper overlapping a little at its joints is regularly tacked down upon the sheeting under the copper covering as the work proceeds from eaves to ridge it prevents the jingling sound of hail or rain falling upon the roof and answers another purpose to be mentioned by and by in order to show the regular process of laying down the roof we must begin with fastening two sheets together     lengthwise the edges of two sheets are laid down so as to lap or cover each other an inch and a slip of the same copper about three inches and a half broad called the reeve is introduced between them four oblong holes or slits are then cut or punched through the whole and they are fastened or riveted together by copper nails with small round shanks and flat heads indents are then cut one inch and three quarters deep upon the seam at top and bottom the right hand sheet and the reeve are then folded back to the left the reeve is then folded to the right and the sheets being laid on the roof in their place it is nailed down to the sheeting with flatheaded short copper nails the righthand sheet is then folded over the reeve to the right and the whole beat down flat upon the cartridge paper covering the sheeting and thus they are fastened and laid in their places by nailing down the reeve only and by reason of the oblong holes through them and the reeve have a little liberty to expand or contract with the heat and cold without raising themselves up from the sheeting or tearing themselves or the fastening to pieces two other sheets are then fixed together according to the first and second operations above and their seam with the reeve introduced under the upper ends of the seam of the former so as to cover down about two inches upon the upper ends of the former sheets and so far the cartridge paper is allowed to cover the two first sheets this edge of the paper is dipped in oil or in turpentine so far before its application and thus a body between the sheets is formed impenetrable to wet and the reeve belonging to the     two last sheets is nailed down to the sheeting as before and the lefthand sheet is turned down to the right four sheets are now laid down with the seam or joint rising to the ridge and thus the work is continued both vertically and horizontally till the roof is covered the sides and ends of each sheet being alternately each way undermost and uppermost the price for copper nails and workmanship runs at about eight pounds ten shillings per hundred weight or two shillings and three pence per foot superficial exclusive of the lappings and about two shillings and eight pence per foot upon the whole which is rather above half as much more as the price of doing it well with lead benjamin franklin    july    0 london mary hewson ccclxxxviii to mrs mary hewson  london    july    0 dear polly— i wrote a few lines to you last week in answer to yours of the   th since which i have been in the country and returning yesterday found your good mother was come home and had got a letter from you of the  0th she has just put it into my hands and desired me to write to you as she is going into the city with miss barwell to buy things whether she will have time to write herself or whether if she had she would get over her natural aversion to writing i cannot say i rather think she will content herself with your knowing what she     should say and would say if she wrote and with my letting you know that she is well and very happy in hearing that you are so your friends are all much pleased with your account of the agreeable family their kind reception and entertainment of you and the respect shown you only dolly and i though we rejoice and shall do so in every thing that contributes to your happiness are now and then in low spirits supposing we have lost each a friend barwell says she conceives nothing of this and that we must be two simpletons to entertain such imaginations i showed her your letter to your mother wherein you say dolly is a naughty girl and if she does not mend i shall turn her off for i have got another dolly now and a very good dolly too she begged me not to communicate this to dolly for though said in jest yet in her present state of mind it would hurt her i suppose that it was for the same goodnatured reason that she refused to show me a paragraph of your letter to dolly that had been communicated by dolly to her july   th the above was written yesterday but being interrupted i could not finish my letter in time for the post though i find i had little to add your mother desires me to express abundance of affection for you and for mr hewson and to say all the proper things for her with respect to the rest of your friends there but you can imagine better than i can write sally and little temple  join in best wishes  00 of prosperity to you both make my sincerest respects acceptable to mr hewson whom exclusive of his other merits i shall always esteem in proportion to the regard he manifests for you barwell tells me that your aunt had received his letter and was highly pleased with it and him so i hope all will go well there and i shall take every opportunity of cultivating her good disposition in which i think you used to be sometimes a little backward but you always had your reasons i am apt to love everybody that loves you and therefore i suppose i shall in time love your new mother and new sister and new dolly i find i begin to like them already and if you think proper you may tell them so but your old dolly and i have agreed to love each other better than ever we did to make up as much as we can our supposed loss of you we like your assurance of continued friendship unimpaired by your change of condition and we believe you think as you write but we fancy we know better than you you know i once knew your heart better than you did yourself as a proof that i am right take notice—that you now think this the silliest letter i ever wrote to you and that mr hewson confirms you in that opinion however i am still what i have been so many years my dear good girl your sincerely affectionate friend and servant b franklin  0  benjamin franklin    august    0 london cadwallader evans ccclxxxix to cadwallader evans london    august    0 dear doctor— i am favored with yours of june  0th with this i send you our last volume of philosophical transactions wherein you will see printed the observations of messrs biddle and bayley on the transit as well as those of messrs mason and dixon relating to the longitude of places when you and your friends have perused it please to deliver it to mrs franklin to be put among my books thanks for the books on the silk affair it will give me great pleasure to see that business brought to perfection among us the subscription is a noble one and does great honor to our public spirit if you should not procure from georgia as you expected one that understands the reeling i believe i can procure you such a hand from italy a great silk merchant here having offered me his assistance for that purpose if wanted i am happy beyond expression to see the virtue and firmness of our country with regard to the nonimportation it does us great honor and new york is in great disgrace with all the friends of liberty in the kingdom who are i assure you no contemptible number and who applaud the stand we have made and wish us success i am my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin  0  cccxc the cravenstreet gazette  saturday september       0 this morning queen margaret accompanied by her first maid of honor miss franklin set out for rochester immediately on their departure the whole street was in tears—from a heavy shower of rain it is whispered that the new family administration which took place on her majestys departure promises like all other new administrations to govern much better than the old one we hear that the great person so called from his enormous size of a certain family in a certain street is grievously affected at the late changes and could hardly be comforted this morning though the new ministry promised him a roasted shoulder of mutton and potatoes for his dinner it is said that the same great person intended to pay his respects to another great personage this day at st jamess it being coronationday hoping thereby a little to amuse his grief but was prevented by an accident queen margaret or her maid of honor having carried off the key of the drawers so that the lady of the bedchamber could not come at a laced shirt for his highness great clamors were made on this occasion against her majesty other accounts say that the shirts were afterwards  0  found though too late in another place and some suspect that the wanting a shirt from those drawers was only a ministerial pretence to excuse picking the locks that the new administration might have every thing at command we hear that the lady chamberlain of the household went to market this morning by her own self gave the butcher whatever he asked for the mutton and had no dispute with the potatowoman to their great amazement at the change of times it is confidently asserted that this afternoon the weather being wet the great person a little chilly and nobody at home to find fault with the expense of fuel he was indulged with a fire in his chamber it seems the design is to make him contented by degrees with the absence of the queen a project has been under consideration of government to take the opportunity of her majestys absence for doing a thing she was always averse to namely fixing a new lock on the street door or getting a key made to the old one it being found extremely inconvenient that one or other of the great officers of state should whenever the maid goes out for a hapenny worth of sand or a pint of porter be obliged to tend the door to let her in again but opinions being divided which of the two expedients to adopt the project is for the present laid aside we have good authority to assure our readers that a cabinet council was held this afternoon at tea the subject of which was a proposal for the reformation of manners and a more strict observation of the lords day the result was a unanimous resolution that no  0  meat should be dressed tomorrow whereby the cook and the first minister will both be at liberty to go to church the one having nothing to do and the other no roast to rule it seems the cold shoulder of mutton and the applepie were thought sufficient for sundays dinner all pious people applaud this measure and it is thought the new ministry will soon become popular we hear that mr wilkes was at a certain house in craven street this day and inquired after the absent queen his good lady and the children are well the report that mr wilkes the patriot made the above visit is without foundation it being his brother the courtier sunday september   d it is now found by sad experience that good resolutions are easier made than executed notwithstanding yesterdays solemn order of council nobody went to church today it seems the great persons broadbuilt bulk lay so long abed that the breakfast was not over till it was too late to dress at least this is the excuse in fine it seems a vain thing to hope reformation from the example of our great folks the cook and the minister however both took advantage of the order so far as to save themselves all trouble and the clause of cold dinner was enforced though the going to church was dispensed with just as common working folks observe the commandment the seventh day thou shalt rest they think a sacred injunction but the other six days thou shalt labor is  0  deemed a mere piece of advice which they may practise when they want bread and are out of credit at the alehouse and may neglect whenever they have money in their pockets it must nevertheless be said in justice to our court that whatever inclination they had to gaming no cards were brought out today lord and lady hewson walked after dinner to kensington to pay their duty to the dowager and dr fatsides made four hundred and sixtynine turns in his diningroom as the exact distance of a visit to the lovely lady barwell whom he did not find at home so there was no struggle for and against a kiss and he sat down to dream in the easychair that he had it without any trouble monday september   th we are credibly informed that the great person dined this day with the club at the cat and bagpipes in the city on cold round of boiled beef this it seems he was under some necessity of doing though he rather dislikes beef because truly the ministers were to be all abroad somewhere to dine on hot roast venison it is thought that if the queen had been at home he would not have been so slighted and though he shows outwardly no marks of dissatisfaction it is suspected that he begins to wish for her majestys return it is currently reported that poor nanny had nothing for dinner in the kitchen for herself and puss but the scrapings of the bones of saturdays mutton  0  this evening there was high play at cravenstreet house the great person lost money it is supposed the ministers as is usually supposed of all ministers shared the emoluments among them tuesday september   th this morning the good lord hutton called at cravenstreet house and inquired very respectfully and affectionately concerning the welfare of the queen he then imparted to the big man a piece of intelligence important to them both which he had just received from lady hawkesworth namely that their amiable and excellent companion miss dorothea blount had made a vow to marry absolutely him of the two whose wife should first depart this life it is impossible to express with words the various agitations of mind appearing in both their faces on this occasion vanity at the preference given them over the rest of mankind affection for their present wives fear of losing them hope if they must lose them to obtain the proposed comfort jealousy of each other in case both wives should die together—all working at the same time jumbled their features into inexplicable confusion they parted at length with professions and outward appearances of everenduring friendship but it was shrewdly suspected that each of them wished health and long life to the others wife and that however long either of these friends might like to live himself the other would be very well pleased to survive him  0  it is remarked that the skies have wept every day in craven street the absence of the queen the public may be assured that this morning a certain great person was asked very complacently by the mistress of the household if he would choose to have the bladebone of saturdays mutton that had been kept for his dinner today broiled or cold he answered gravely if there is any flesh on it it may be broiled if not it may as well be cold orders were accordingly given for broiling it but when it came to table there was indeed so very little flesh or rather none at all puss having dined on it yesterday after nanny that if our new administration had been as good economists as they would be thought the expense of broiling might well have been saved to the public and carried to the sinking fund it is assured the great person bears all with infinite patience but the nation is astonished at the insolent presumption that dares treat so much mildness in so cruel a manner a terrible accident had like to have happened this afternoon at tea the boiler was set too near the end of the little square table the first ministress was sitting at one end of the table to administer the tea the great person was about to sit down at the other end where the boiler stood by a sudden motion the lady gave the table a tilt had it gone over the great person must have been scalded perhaps to death various are the surmises and observations on this occasion the godly say it would have been a just judgment on him for preventing by his laziness the familys going to church last sunday the  0  opposition do not stick to insinuate that there was a design to scald him prevented only by his quick catching the table the friends of the ministry give out that he carelessly jogged the table himself and would have been inevitably scalded had not the ministress saved him it is hard for the public to come at the truth in these cases at six oclock this afternoon news came by the post that her majesty arrived safely at rochester on saturday night the bells immediately rang—for candles to illuminate the parlour the court went into cribbage and the evening concluded with every demonstration of joy it is reported that all the principal officers of state have received an invitation from the duchess dowager of rochester to go down thither on saturday next but it is not yet known whether the great affairs they have on their hands will permit them to make this excursion we hear that from the time of her majestys leaving cravenstreet house to this day no care is taken to file the newspapers but they lie about in every room in every window and on every chair just where the doctor lays them when he has read them it is impossible government can long go on in such hands to the publisher of the cravenstreet gazette sir— i make no doubt of the truth of what the papers tell us that a certain great person has been halfstarved on the bladebone of a sheep i cannot  0  call it of mutton because none was on it by a set of the most careless blundering foolish crafty and knavish ministers that ever got into a house and pretended to govern a family and provide a dinner alas for the poor old england of craven street if these nefarious wretches continue in power another week the nation will be ruined undone totally undone if the queen does not return or which is better turn them all out and appoint me and my friends to succeed them i am a great admirer of your useful and impartial paper and therefore request you will insert this without fail from your humble servant indignation to the publisher of the cravenstreet gazette sir— your correspondent indignation has made a fine story in your paper against our excellent cravenstreet ministry as if they meant to starve his highness giving him only a bare bladebone for his dinner while they riot upon roast venison the wickedness of writers in this age is truly amazing i believe we never had since the foundation of our state a more faithful upright worthy careful considerate incorrupt discreet wise prudent and beneficent ministry than the present but if even the angel gabriel would condescend to be our minister and provide our dinners he could scarcely escape newspaper defamation from a gang of hungry everrestless discontented and malicious scribblers   0 it is sir a piece of justice you owe our righteous administration to undeceive the public on this occasion by assuring them of the fact which is that there was provided and actually smoking on the table under his royal nose at the same instant as fine a piece of ribs of beef roasted as ever knife was put into with potatoes horseradish pickled walnuts c which beef his highness might have eaten of if he had pleased so to do and which he forbore to do merely from a whimsical opinion with respect be it spoken that beef doth not with him perspire well this is the truth and if your boasted impartiality is real you will not hesitate a moment to insert this letter in your very next paper i am though a little angry with you at present yours as you behave a hater of scandal junius and cinna came to hand too late for this days paper but shall have place in our next marriages none since our last but puss begins to go a courting deaths in the back closet and elsewhere many poor mice stocks biscuit—very low buckwheat and indian meal—both sour tea lowering daily—in the canister wednesday september   th postscript—those in the secret of affairs do not scruple to assert roundly that the present first ministress proves very notable     having this day been at market bought excellent muttonchops and apples four a penny made a very fine applepie with her own hands and mended two pair of breeches benjamin franklin   october    0 london m dubourg cccxci to m dubourg london   october    0 i see with pleasure that we think pretty much alike on the subject of english america we of the colonies have never insisted that we ought to be exempt from contributing to the common expenses necessary to support the prosperity of the empire we only assert that having parliaments of our own and not having representatives in that of great britain our parliaments are the only judges of what we can and what we ought to contribute in this case and that the english parliament has no right to take our money without our consent in fact the british empire is not a single state it comprehends many and though the parliament of great britain has arrogated to itself the power of taxing the colonies it has no more right to do so than it has to tax hanover we have the same king but not the same legislatures the dispute between the two countries has already lost england many millions sterling which it has lost in its commerce and america has in this respect been a proportionable gainer this commerce consisted     principally of superfluities objects of luxury and fashion which we can well do without and the resolution we have formed of importing no more till our grievances are redressed has enabled many of our infant manufactures to take root and it will not be easy to make our people abandon them in future even should a connexion more cordial than ever succeed the present troubles i have indeed no doubt that the parliament of england will finally abandon its present pretensions and leave us to the peaceable enjoyment of our rights and privileges b franklin benjamin franklin

respect and honor if he had given me the opportunity but he did not let me see him accept my sincere acknowledgments and thanks for the valuable present you made me of your excellent work on the

mention you have made in it of your friend is extremely obliging i was already too much in your debt for favours of that kind i purpose returning to america in the ensuing summer if our disputes should be adjusted as i hope they will be in the next session of parliament would to god i could take with me messrs dupont dubourg and some other french friends with their good ladies i might then by

in his since your whole long letter is made up of the history of his pretty actions it was very prudently done of you not to interfere when his mother thought fit to     correct him which pleased me the more as i feared from your fondness of him that he would be too much humored and perhaps spoiled there is a story of two little boys in the street one was crying bitterly the other came to him to ask what was the matter i have been says he for a pennyworth of vinegar and i have broke the glass and spilled the vinegar and my mother will whip me no she wont whip you says the other indeed she will says he what says the other have you then got neer a grandmother i am sorry i did not send one of my books to mr rhoads since he was desirous of seeing it my love to him and to all inquiring

return you my particular thanks your letter and replies to mr strahans questions gave me great pleasure though the closing and prophetic part coming from one so capable of discerning amidst the uncertainties of futurity which may probably take place could not but impress me with melancholy ideas  some of them have since been realized but may heaven forbid a further fulfilment in this wish i doubt not of your own hearty concurrence for i do not take you to be of the turn of swifts physicians of whom he somewhere says   they rather choose that i should die   than their predictions prove a lie and yet i am afraid i shall not soon see you thoroughly refuted by events     so many hope to find their own interest in misrepresentations so many seem willing to be deceived and so much art is employed to make whatever is thought convenient appear just and true that the happy day for establishing the prosperity of great britain by composing the troubles and insuring to her the united affections of america seems to be at too great a distance we ought not however to be discouraged from employing the most likely means to promote so desirable an end such a means i esteem the choice which our house of representatives have made of you to be their agent your letter came most seasonably for this i communicated it with great caution knowing the delicacy the times require i allowed however some of the leading members of the house in confidence to read your sentiments they expressed the highest satisfaction and though it was objected that you were agent for other provinces and we ought to enlarge the number of our friends and that you and your son the governor held places of importance under the crown and though the house from various causes had been much divided respecting an agent yet such was their opinion of your abilities and integrity that a majority readily confided the affairs of the province at this critical season to your care i am this moment told the vessel is just upon sailing i must break off you see the hurry of this script but it is to a friend i shall write more fully soon your very respectful c samuel cooper     benjamin franklin    december    0 london thomas cushing cccxcvi to thomas cushing  london    december    0 sir— your favor of october   st came to hand a few days since with the vote of the house of representatives appointing me their agent here which as it was unsolicited on my part i esteem the greater honor and shall be very happy if i can in that capacity render my country any acceptable service  i have also just received your letter of november  th containing an account of the state and circumstances of the province and the grievances it labors     under with sundry depositions and other papers another of november   th with a pamphlet entitled the proceedings of council c another of november   d containing an order on mr de berdt for papers i can at present only say that i shall immediately endeavour to make myself master of the business committed to my care that so when the parliament and public boards which are now adjourned for a month shall meet again i may be ready to proceed in such manner as on conferring with mr bollan shall appear advisable for obtaining redress of the grievances so justly complained of i have the pleasure to acquaint you from good authority that the project formed by the enemies of the province for bringing into parliament a bill to abridge our charter rights though at first it received some countenance and great pains were taken to recommend it is now laid aside i do not presume to suppose that the opposition i gave to it by showing the imprudence of the measure and declaring openly my opinion on all occasions that the charter being a compact between the king and the people of the colony who were out of the realm of great britain there existed nowhere on earth a power to alter it while its terms were complied with without the consent of both the contracting parties had any weight on the occasion i rather think that a disposition prevails of late to be on good terms with the colonies especially as we seem to be on the eve of a war with spain and that in consequence of that disposition which i hope we shall cultivate more attention has been paid to the     sober advice of our friends and less to the virulent instigations of our enemies i beg you will present my dutiful respects to the house of representatives and assure them of my most faithful endeavours in their service with great esteem and regard i have the honor to be c b franklin benjamin franklin  0 december    0 london jane mecom cccxcvii to mrs jane mecom london  0 december    0 dear sister— this ship staying longer than was expected gives me an opportunity of writing to you which i thought i must have missed when i desired cousin williams to excuse me to you i received your kind letter of september   th by the young gentlemen who by their discreet behaviour have recommended themselves very much to me and many of my acquaintance josiah has attained his hearts desire of being under the tuition of mr stanley who though he had long left off teaching kindly undertook at my request to instruct him and is much pleased with his quickness of apprehension and the progress he makes and jonathan appears a very valuable young man sober regular and inclined to industry and frugality which are promising signs of success in business i am very happy in their company as to the rumor you mention which was as josiah tells me that i had been deprived of my   0 place in the postoffice on account of a letter i wrote to philadelphia it might have this foundation that some of the ministry had been displeased on my writing such letters and there were really some thoughts among them of showing that displeasure in that manner but i had some friends too who unrequested by me advised the contrary and my enemies were forced to content themselves with abusing me plentifully in the newspapers and endeavoring to provoke me to resign in this they are not likely to succeed i being deficient in that christian virtue of resignation if they would have my office they must take it i have heard of some great man whose rule it was with regard to offices never to ask for them and never to refuse them to which i have always added in my own practice never to resign them as i told my friends i rose to that office through a long course of service in the inferior degrees of it before my time through bad management it never produced the salary annexed to it and when i received it no salary was to be allowed if the office did not produce it during the first four years it was so far from defraying itself that it became nine hundred and fifty pounds sterling in debt to me and my colleague i had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it to its present flourishing state and therefore thought i had some kind of right to it i had hitherto executed the duties of it faithfully and to the perfect satisfaction of my superiors which i thought was all that should be expected of me on that account as to the letters complained of it was true     i did write them and they were written in compliance with another duty that to my country a duty quite distinct from that of postmaster my conduct in this respect was exactly similar to that i held on a similar occasion but a few years ago when the then ministry was ready to hug me for the assistance i afforded them in repealing a former revenue act my sentiments were still the same that no such acts should be made here for america or if made should as soon as possible be repealed and i thought it should not be expected of me to change my political opinions every time his majesty thought fit to change his ministers this was my language on the occasion and i have lately heard that though i was thought much to blame it being understood that every man who holds an office should act with the ministry whether agreeable or not to his own judgment yet in consideration of the goodness of my private character as they were pleased to compliment me the office was not to be taken from me possibly they may still change their minds and remove me but no apprehension of that sort will i trust make the least alteration in my political conduct my rule in which i have always found satisfaction is never to turn aside in public affairs through views of private interest but to go straight forward in doing what appears to me right at the time leaving the consequences with providence what in my younger days enabled me more easily to walk upright was that i had a trade and that i knew i could live upon little and thence never     having had views of making a fortune i was free from avarice and contented with the plentiful supplies my business afforded me and now it is still more easy for me to preserve my freedom and integrity when i consider that i am almost at the end of my journey and therefore need less to complete the expense of it and that what i now possess through the blessing of god may with tolerable economy be sufficient for me great misfortunes excepted though i should add nothing more to it by any office or employment whatsoever i send you by this opportunity the two books you wrote for they cost three shillings apiece when i was first in london about fortyfive years since i knew a person who had an opinion something like your authors her name was ilive a printers widow she died soon after i left england and by her will obliged her son to deliver publicly in salters hall a solemn discourse the purport of which was to prove that this world is the true hell or place of punishment for the spirits who had transgressed in a better state and were sent here to suffer for their sins in animals of all sorts it is long since i saw the discourse which was printed i think a good deal of scripture was cited in it and that the supposition was that though we now remembered nothing of such a preëxistent state yet after death we might recollect it and remember the punishments we had suffered so as to be the better for them and others who had not yet offended might now behold and be warned by our sufferings     in fact we see here that every lower animal has its enemy with proper inclinations faculties and weapons to terrify wound and destroy it and that men who are uppermost are devils to one another so that on the established doctrine of the goodness and justice of the great creator this apparent state of general and systematical mischief seemed to demand some such supposition as mrs ilives to account for it consistently with the honor of the deity but our reasoning powers when employed about what may have been before our existence here or shall be after it cannot go far for want of history and facts revelation only can give us the necessary information and that in the first of these points especially has been very sparingly afforded us i hope you continue to correspond with your friends at philadelphia my love to your children and believe me ever your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin   february      london thomas cushing cccxcviii to thomas cushing london   february      sir— since mine of december   th i have been honored by the letter from the committee dated december   th which with yours of november  th now lies before me the doctrine of the right of parliament to lay taxes on america is now almost generally given up     here and one seldom meets in conversation with any who continue to assert it but there are still many who think that the dignity and honor of parliament and of the nation are so much engaged as that no formal renunciation of the claim is ever to be expected we ought to be contented they say with a forbearance of any attempt hereafter to exercise such right and this they would have us rely on as a certainty hints are also given that the duties now subsisting may be gradually withdrawn as soon as a regard to that dignity will permit it to be decently done without subjecting government to the contempt of all europe as being compelled into measures by the refractoriness of the colonies how far this may be depended on no one can say the presumption rather is that if by time we become so accustomed to these as to pay them without discontent no minister will afterwards think of taking them off but rather be encouraged to add others perhaps there was never an instance of a colony so much and so long persecuted with vehement and malicious abuse as ours has been for near two years past by its enemies here and those who reside in it the design apparently was by rendering us odious as well as contemptible to prevent all concern for us in the friends of liberty here when the projects of oppressing us further and depriving us of our rights by various violent measures should be carried into execution of late this abuse has abated the sentiments of a majority of the ministers are i think become more favorable towards us and i have reason to believe that all those projects     are now laid aside the projectors themselves too are i believe somewhat diminished in their credit and it appears not likely that any new schemes of the kind will be listened to if fresh occasion is not administered from our side the water it seems however too early yet to expect such an attention to our complaints as would be necessary to obtain an immediate redress of our grievances a little time is requisite but no opportunity will be lost by your agents of stating them where it may be of use and inculcating the necessity of removing them for the strength and safety of the empire and i hope the colony assemblies will show by frequently repeated resolves that they know their rights and do not lose sight of them our growing importance will ere long compel an acknowledgment of them and establish and secure them to our posterity in case of my leaving this country which i may possibly do in the ensuing summer i shall put into the hands of dr lee  all the papers relating to your affairs which i have received from you or from the son of your late agent mr de berdt the present american secretary lord hillsborough has indeed objected to the assemblys appointment and insists that no agent ought to be received or attended to by government here who is not appointed by an act of the general court to which the governor has given his assent this doctrine if he could establish it would in a manner give to his lordship the     power of appointing or at least negativing any choice of the house of representatives and council since it would be easy for him to instruct the governor not to assent to the appointment of such and such men who are obnoxious to him so that if the appointment is annual every agent that valued his post must consider himself as holding it by the favor of his lordship and of course too much obliged to him to oppose his measures however contrary to the interest of the province of what use such agents would be it is easy to judge and although i am assured that notwithstanding this fancy of his lordship any memorial petition or other address from or in behalf of the house of representatives to the king in council or to either house of parliament would be received from your agent as usual yet on this occasion i cannot but wish that the public character of a colony agent was better understood and settled as well as the political relation between the colonists and the mother country when they come to be considered in the light of distinct states as i conceive they really are possibly their agents may be treated with more respect and considered more as public ministers under the present american administration they are rather looked on with an evil eye as obstructors of ministerial measures and the secretary would i imagine be well pleased to get rid of them being as he has sometimes intimated of opinion that agents are unnecessary for that whatever is to be transacted between the assemblies of colonies and the government     here may be done through and by the governors letters and more properly than by any agent whatever in truth your nominations particularly of dr lee and myself have not been at all agreeable to his lordship i purpose however to draw up a memorial stating our rights and grievances and in the name and behalf of the province protesting particularly against the late innovations in respect to the military power obtruded on the civil as well as the other infringements of the charter and at a proper time if mr bollan on due consideration approves of it and will join me in it to present it to his majesty in council whether speedy redress is or is not the consequence i imagine it may be of good use to keep alive our claims and show that we have not given up the contested points though we take no violent measures to obtain them a notion has been much inculcated here by our enemies that any farther concession on the part of great britain would only serve to increase our demands i have constantly given it as my opinion that if the colonies were restored to the state they were in before the stamp act they would be satisfied and contend no farther as in this i have been supposed not to know or not to speak the sentiments of the americans i am glad to find the same so fully expressed in the committees letter it was certainly as i have often urged bad policy when they attempted to heal our differences by repealing part of the duties only as it is bad surgery to leave splinters in a wound which must     prevent its healing or in time occasion it to open afresh there is no doubt of the intention to make governors and some other officers independent of the people for their support and that this purpose will be persisted in if the american revenue is found sufficient to defray the salaries many think this so necessary a measure that even if there were no such revenue the money should issue out of the treasury here but this i apprehend would hardly be the case there being so many demands at home and the salaries of so many officers in so many colonies would amount to such an immense sum that probably the burden would be found too great and the providing for the expense of their governments be left to the colonies themselves i shall watch every thing that may be moved to the detriment of the province and use my best endeavours for its service no public notice has yet been taken of the inflammatory paper mentioned by the committee as stuck up in boston and i think the indiscretion of individuals is not now so likely as it has been of late to make general impressions to our disadvantage with the greatest respect c b franklin benjamin franklin   february      london samuel cooper cccxcix to samuel cooper london   february      dear sir— i have just received your kind favor of january  st by mr bowdoin to whom i should     be glad to render any service here i wrote to you some weeks since in answer to yours of july and november expressing my sentiments without the least reserve on points that require free discussion as i know i can confide in your prudence not to hurt my usefulness here by making me more obnoxious than i must necessarily be from that known attachment to the american interest which my duty as well as inclination demands of me in the same confidence i send you the enclosed extract from my journal containing a late conference between the secretary  and your friend in which you will see a little of his temper it is one of the many instances of his behaviour and conduct that have given me the very mean opinion i entertain of his abilities and fitness for his station his character is conceit wrongheadedness obstinacy and passion those who would speak most favorably of him allow all this they only add that he is an honest man and means well if that be true as perhaps it may i wish him a better place where only honesty and wellmeaning are required and where his other qualities can do no harm had the war taken place i have reason to believe he would have been removed he had i think some apprehensions of it himself at the time i was with him i hope however that our affairs will not much longer be perplexed and embarrassed by his perverse and senseless management i have since heard that his lordship took great offence at some of my last words which he calls extremely rude and   0 abusive he assured a friend of mine that they were equivalent to telling him to his face that the colonies could expect neither favor nor justice during his administration i find he did not mistake me it is true as you have heard that some of my letters to america have been echoed back thither but that has not been the case with any that were written to you great umbrage was taken but chiefly by lord hillsborough who was disposed before to be angry with me and therefore the inconvenience was the less and whatever the consequences are of his displeasure putting all my offences together i must bear them as well as i can not but that if there is to be war between us i shall do my best to defend myself and annoy my adversary little regarding the story of the earthen pot and brazen pitcher one encouragement i have the knowledge that he is not a whit better liked by his colleagues in the ministry than he is by me that he cannot probably continue where he is much longer and that he can scarce be succeeded by anybody who will not like me the better for his having been at variance with me pray continue writing to me as you find opportunity your candid clear and wellwritten letters be assured are of great use with the highest esteem i am my dear friend c b franklin     minutes of the conference mentioned in the preceding letter benjamin franklin    january      wednesday    january      i went this morning to wait on lord hillsborough the porter at first denied his lordship on which i left my name and drove off but before the coach got out of the square the coachman heard a call turned and went back to the door when the porter came and said his lordship will see you sir i was shown into the levee room where i found governor bernard who i understand attends there constantly several other gentlemen were there attending with whom i sat down a few minutes when secretary pownall  came out to us and said his lordship desired i would come in i was pleased with this ready admission and preference having sometimes waited three or four hours for my turn and being pleased i could more easily put on the open cheerful countenance that my friends advised me to wear his lordship came towards me and said i was dressing in order to go to court but hearing that you were at the door who are a man of business i determined to see you immediately i thanked his lordship and said that my business at present was not much it was only to pay my respects to his lordship and to acquaint him with my appointment by the house of representatives of massachusetts bay to be their agent here in which station if i could be of any service—i was going on to say—to the public i should be very happy but his lordship whose     countenance changed at my naming that province cut me short by saying with something between a smile and a sneer l h— i must set you right there mr franklin you are not agent b f— why my lord l h— you are not appointed b f— i do not understand your lordship i have the appointment in my pocket l h— you are mistaken i have later and better advices i have a letter from governor hutchinson he would not give his assent to the bill b f— there was no bill my lord it was a vote of the house l h— there was a bill presented to the governor for the purpose of appointing you and another one dr lee i think he is called to which the governor refused his assent b f— i cannot understand this my lord i think there must be some mistake in it is your lordship quite sure that you have such a letter l h— i will convince you of it directly rings the bell mr pownall will come in and satisfy you b f— it is not necessary that i should now detain your lordship from dressing you are going to court i will wait on your lordship another time l h— no stay he will come immediately to the servant tell mr pownall i want him mr pownall comes in l h— have not you at hand governor hutchinsons letter mentioning his refusing his assent to the bill for appointing dr franklin agent     sec p— my lord l h— is there not such a letter sec p— no my lord there is a letter relating to some bill for the payment of a salary to mr de berdt and i think to some other agent to which the governor had refused his assent l h— and is there nothing in the letter to the purpose i mention sec p— no my lord b f— i thought it could not well be my lord as my letters are by the last ships and they mention no such thing here is the authentic copy of the vote of the house appointing me in which there is no mention of any act intended will your lordship please to look at it with seeming unwillingness he takes it but does not look into it l h— an information of this kind is not properly brought to me as secretary of state the board of trade is the proper place b f— i will leave the paper then with mr pownall to be— l h hastily— to what end would you leave it with him b f— to be entered on the minutes of that board as usual l h angrily— it shall not be entered there no such paper shall be entered there while i have any thing to do with the business of that board the house of representatives has no right to appoint an agent we shall take no notice of any agents but such as are appointed by acts of     assembly to which the governor gives his assent we have had confusion enough already here is one agent appointed by the council another by the house of representatives which of these is agent for the province who are we to hear in provincial affairs an agent appointed by act of assembly we can understand no other will be attended to for the future i can assure you b f— i cannot conceive my lord why the consent of the governor should be thought necessary to the appointment of an agent for the people it seems to me that—— l h with a mixed look of anger and contempt— i shall not enter into a dispute with you sir upon this subject b f— i beg your lordships pardon i do not presume to dispute with your lordship i would only say that it seems to me that every body of men who cannot appear in person where business relating to them may be transacted should have a right to appear by an agent the concurrence of the governor does not seem to be necessary it is the business of the people that is to be done he is not one of them he is himself an agent l h hastily— whose agent is he b f— the kings my lord l h— no such matter he is one of the corporation by the province charter no agent can be appointed but by an act nor any act pass without his assent besides this proceeding is directly contrary to express instructions b f— i did not know there had been such instructions     i am not concerned in any offence against them and—— l h— yes your offering such a paper to be entered is an offence against them folding it up again without having read a word of it no such appointment shall be entered when i came into the administration of american affairs i found them in great disorder by my firmness they are now something mended and while i have the honor to hold the seals i shall continue the same conduct the same firmness i think my duty to the master i serve and to the government of this nation requires it of me if that conduct is not approved they may take my office from me when they please i shall make them a bow and thank them i shall resign with pleasure that gentleman knows it pointing to mr pownall but while i continue in it i shall resolutely persevere in the same firmness spoken with great warmth and turning pale in his discourse as if he was angry at something or somebody besides the agent and of more consequence to himself b f reaching out his hand for the paper which his lordship returned to him— i beg your lordships pardon for taking up so much of your time it is i believe of no great importance whether the appointment is acknowledged or not for i have not the least conception that an agent can at present be of any use to any of the colonies i shall therefore give your lordship no further trouble withdrew     benjamin franklin  0 february      london cadwallader evans cccc to cadwallader evans london  0 february      dear doctor— i have not now before me your letter which came with the sample of silk having put it into the hands of mr walpole with the sample who has promised me full and particular answers to all your queries after the silk has been thoroughly examined in the meantime he tells me the best sort appears to him to be worth in itself twentyseven or twentyeight shillings a pound and will fetch that price when some imperfections in the reeling it are remedied he tells me farther that the best eggs are to be had from valencia in spain whence he will procure some for you against the next year the worms from those eggs being the strongest healthiest and producing the finest silk of any others and he thinks you should get some reelers from italy which he would likewise undertake to do for you if desired he is one of the most opulent and noblespirited merchants of this kingdom i shall write to you fully by osborne with all the information i can procure in the meantime please to present my respects to the gentlemen concerned in the affair and assure them of my best services i am my dear friend yours affectionately b franklin     benjamin franklin   march      london jonathan williams cccci to jonathan williams london   march      loving cousin— i suppose jonathan has told you that the lottery is drawn and your two new tickets had the same success as the former namely one twentypound prize and one blank would you go on any further josiah is very happy in being under the tuition of mr stanley who very kindly undertook him at my request though he had left off teaching josiah goes constantly too to several concerts besides operas and oratorios so that his thirst for music is in a way of being thoroughly satiated this is the principal expense for in all other respects i never saw two young men from america more prudent and frugal than he and his brother are jonathan seems to have an excellent turn for business and to be a perfect master of accounts in the latter he has been of great use to me having put all mine in order for me there is a proposal from his uncle of his going to east india as a writer in the companys service which i wish may take place as i think if he lives he cannot fail bringing home a fortune he had ordered a cargo of goods to be sent you for cousin woods shop and had given expectations of paying ready money but one of your bills being protested there seemed a necessity of asking some credit of the merchant i advised him to take what was wanting of me rather than fail in punctuality to his word which is sacred     here among all that would maintain a character in trade he did so and thereby also saved the discount without putting me to the least inconvenience provided the money is replaced in six months and i was glad i had it in my power to accommodate him i hope you have before this time got another tenant for your house and at the former rent however i would have you go on advancing to my sister the amount of it as i am persuaded she cannot well do without it she has indeed been very unfortunate in her children  i am glad to hear that as soon as the weather permits the tomb will receive a thorough repair your kind care in this matter will greatly oblige your affectionate uncle b franklin benjamin franklin   march      london williams ccccii to mrs williams london   march      dear cousin— i received your kind letter by your sons they are i assure you exceeding welcome     to me and they behave with so much prudence that no two young men could possibly less need the advice you would have me give them josiah is very happily employed in his musical pursuits and as you hinted to me that it would be agreeable to you if i employed jonathan in writing i requested him to put my accounts in order which had been much neglected he undertook it with the utmost cheerfulness and readiness and executed it with the greatest diligence making me a complete set of new books fairly written out and settled in a mercantile manner which is a great satisfaction to me and a very considerable service i mention this that you may not be in the least uneasy from an apprehension of their visit being burdensome to me it being i assure you quite the contrary it has been wonderful to me to see a young man from america in a place so full of various amusements as london is as attentive to business as diligent in it and keeping as close at home till it was finished as if it had been for his own profit and as if he had been at the public diversions so often as to be tired of them i pray god to keep and preserve you and give you again in due time a happy sight of these valuable sons being your affectionate uncle b franklin   0 benjamin franklin  0 april      london william franklin cccciii to william franklin london  0 april      dear son— it is long since i have heard from you the last packet brought me no letter and there are two packets now due it is supposed that the long easterly winds have kept them back we have had a severe and tedious winter there is not yet the smallest appearance of spring not a bud has pushed out nor a blade of grass the turnips that used to feed the cattle have been destroyed by the frost the hay in most parts of the country is gone and the cattle perishing for want the lambs dying by thousands through cold and scanty nourishment on tuesday last i went to dine at our friend sir matthew featherstones through a heavy storm of snow his windows you know look into the park towards evening i observed the snow still lying over all the park for the ground was before too cold to thaw it being itself frozen and ice in the canal you cannot imagine a more winterlike prospect sir matthew and lady featherstone always inquire kindly of your welfare as do mr and mrs sargent sir john pringle has heard from mr bowman of your kindness to that gentleman and desires i would present his particular acknowledgments for the attention you have paid to his recommendation the ohio affair seems now near a conclusion and if the present ministry stand a little longer i think it will be completed to our satisfaction mr     wharton has been indefatigable and i think scarce any one i know besides would have been equal to the task so difficult it is to get business forward here in which some party purpose is not to be served but he is always among them and leaves no stone unturned  i have attended several times this winter upon your acts of assembly the board are not favorably disposed towards your insolvent acts pretending to doubt whether distant creditors particularly such as reside in england may not sometimes be injured by them i have had a good deal of conversation with mr jackson about them who remarks that whatever care the assembly may according to my representation of their practice take in examining into the cases to prevent injustice yet upon the face of the acts nothing of that care appears the preambles only say that such and such persons have petitioned and set forth the hardship of their imprisonment but not a word of the assemblys having inquired into the allegations contained in such petitions and found them true not a word of the general consent of the principal creditors or of any public notice given of the debtors intention to apply for such an act all which he thinks should appear in the preambles and then those acts would be subject to less objection and difficulty in getting them through the offices here i would have you communicate this to the speaker of the assembly with my best respects i doubt some of those acts will be repealed nothing has been done or is     now likely to be done by the parliament in american affairs the house of commons and the city of london are got into a violent controversy that seems at present to engross the public attention and the session cannot continue much longer by this ship i send the picture that you left with meyer he has never yet finished the miniatures the other pictures i send with it are for my own house but this you may take to yours b franklin samuel rhoads   may      philadelphia benjamin franklin cccciv from samuel rhoads to b franklin philadelphia   may      dear friend— i received thy kind favor of february  0th and am much obliged by the several useful papers pamphlets and samples contained therein thy friend wooller has taken much pains in explaining the method of making our houses secure from fire which i hope will be of great service we are much obliged to him i have given several little bits of the limestone to some of my acquaintance in the country in hopes it may be found here i am told they make lime in berks county that will harden under water i have sent for a sample of it and will try it we certainly have plenty of stone very like this in appearance and i hope of the same quality i am the more concerned for this discovery as we are told it was very useful in the works under water of the duke of bridgewaters canal and we expect shortly to be canalmad and may want it in such works also     the growing trade of baltimore town in maryland drawn principally from our province west of the susquehanna begins to alarm us with serious apprehensions of such a rival as may reduce us to the situation of burlington and newcastle on the delaware and we can devise no means of saving ourselves but by a canal from the susquehanna to the schuylkill and amending the navigation of all our rivers so far as they lead towards our capital city a great number of thy friends are very anxious for promoting this work particularly the canal if it is practicable through the heart of the country and as thou wast kind enough formerly to send me several papers relating to the navigation of calder river i request the favor of adding thereto the last accounts and instructions respecting canals the construction of their floodgates wastegates c the assembly have ordered the speaker to procure the remainder of the statutes to complete their set in the state house library by which i suppose we shall have those relating to canals but if they are to be had singly please to send one or two which are the most instructive in the rates terms conditions of carriage and passing the grounds and the cost shall be paid      i congratulate thee on the prospect we have of the sum of money lodged in the bank for the pennsylvania hospital being now paid and of thy pleasure in receiving it for that charity which thou hadst so great a share in establishing we last night executed a power of attorney to thee dr fothergill and david barclay to apply to the court of chancery in order to receive it and lest our hospital seal should not be sufficient evidence of our act and deed we called three witnesses who may be examined by your people on oath respecting the due executing the powers of attorney if any difficulty should occur you will not fail of acquainting us with it by the first opportunity my wife children and thy old friend ann paschal desire to be kindly remembered to thee thy sincere and affectionate friend samuel rhoads benjamin franklin    may      london ccccv to the committee of correspondence in massachusetts  london    may      gentlemen— i have received your favor of the   th of february with the journal of the house of     representatives and copies of the late oppressive prosecutions in the admiralty court which i shall as you direct communicate to mr bollan and consult with him on the most advantageous use to be made of them for the interest of the province i think one may clearly see in the system of customs to be exacted in america by act of parliament the seeds sown of a total disunion of the two countries though as yet that event may be at a considerable distance the course and natural progress seems to be first the appointment of needy men as officers for others do not care to leave england then their necessities make them rapacious their office makes them proud and insolent their insolence and rapacity make them odious and being conscious that they are hated they become malicious their malice urges them to a continual abuse of the inhabitants in their letters to administration representing them as disaffected and rebellious and to encourage the use of severity as weak divided timid and cowardly government believes all thinks it necessary to support and countenance its officers their quarrelling with the people is deemed a mark and consequence of their fidelity they are therefore more highly rewarded and this makes their conduct still more insolent and provoking the resentment of the people will at times and on particular incidents burst into outrages and violence upon such officers and this naturally draws down severity and acts of further oppression from hence the more the people are dissatisfied the more rigor will be thought necessary severe punishment     will be inflicted to terrify rights and privileges will be abolished greater force will then be required to secure execution and submission the expense will become enormous it will then be thought proper by fresh exactions to make the people defray it thence the british nation and government will become odious the subjection to it will be deemed no longer tolerable war ensues and the bloody struggle will end in absolute slavery to america or ruin to britain by the loss of her colonies the latter most probable from americas growing strength and magnitude but as the whole empire must in either case be greatly weakened i cannot but wish to see much patience and the utmost discretion in our general conduct that the fatal period may be postponed and that whenever this catastrophe shall happen it may appear to all mankind that the fault has not been ours and since the collection of these duties has already cost britain infinitely more in the loss of commerce than they amount to and that loss is likely to continue and increase by the encouragement given to our manufactures through resentment and since the best pretence for establishing and enforcing the duties is the regulation of trade for the general advantage it seems to me that it would be much better for britain to give them up on condition of the colonies undertaking to enforce and collect such as are thought fit to be continued by laws of their own and officers of their own appointment for the public uses of their respective governments this would alone destroy those seeds of disunion     and both countries might thence much longer continue to grow great together more secure by their united strength and more formidable to their common enemies but the power of appointing friends and dependents to profitable offices is too pleasing to most administrations to be easily parted with or lessened and therefore such a proposition if it were made is not very likely to meet with attention i do not pretend to the gift of prophecy history shows that by these steps great empires have crumbled heretofore and the late transactions we have so much cause to complain of show that we are in the same train and that without a greater share of prudence and wisdom than we have seen both sides to be possessed of we shall probably come to the same conclusion the parliament however is prorogued without having taken any of the steps we had been threatened with relating to our charter their attention has been engrossed by other affairs and we have therefore longer time to operate in making such impressions as may prevent a renewal of this particular attempt by our adversaries with great esteem and respect i have the honor to be c b franklin benjamin franklin   june      london deborah franklin ccccvi to mrs deborah franklin london   june      my dear child— i have lately made a journey of a fortnight to birmingham sheffield leeds and     manchester and returned only in time to be at court on the kings birthday which was yesterday the joy was in a fair way of being doubled on the same day for the queen was delivered early this morning of another prince the eighth child there being now six princes and two princesses all lovely children the prince of wales and the bishop of osnaburg appeared yesterday for the first time in the drawingroom and gave great pleasure by their sensible manly behaviour my journey has been of use to my health the air and exercise have given me fresh spirits and i feel now exceedingly well thanks to god i wrote to you lately i suppose you have written by falconer who is not yet heard of my love to our children and grandson i am as ever your affectionate husband b franklin benjamin franklin    june      london jonathan shipley ccccvii to jonathan shipley bishop of asaph london    june      my lord— i got home in good time and well but on perusing the letters that were sent to me from america during my absence and considering the business they require of me i find it not convenient to return so soon as i intended i regret my having been obliged to leave that most agreeable retirement which good mrs shipley put me so kindly in possession of  i now breathe with reluctance     the smoky air of london when i think of the sweet air of twyford and by the time your races are over or about the middle of next month if it should not then be unsuitable to your engagements or other purposes i promise myself the happiness of spending a week or two where i so pleasantly spent the last i have taken the liberty of sending by the southampton stage which goes tomorrow a parcel directed to your lordship to be left at the turnpike next beyond winchester containing one of my books for miss georgiana which i hope she will be good enough to accept as a small mark of my regard for her philosophic genius and also a specimen of the american dried apples for mrs shipley that she may judge whether it will be worth while to try the practice i doubt some dust may have got among them therefore it will not perhaps be amiss to rinse them a minute or two in warm water and dry them quick in a napkin but this is submitted to her better judgment with great esteem and respect and many thanks for your abundant civilities i am my lord c b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london noble wimberly jones ccccviii to noble wimberly jones london   july      sir— in mine of may  st i enclosed a copy of the petition intended to be presented to the king in council in behalf of the possessors of the lands   0 claimed by sir william bakers assigns i am now to acquaint you that it was presented accordingly and is referred down to the board of trade for their opinion but as the board is about to adjourn for some months we are advised not to press the consideration of it till they meet again as they have now too little time to attend to it properly immediately on their return to business we shall urge for their report i see by the newspapers that your new assembly is also dissolved  i am sorry for these differences which must be uncomfortable to you and all that wish the welfare of the province it is now thought that a peace between the turks and russians is likely soon to be concluded which gives a better prospect of the continuance of peace among the other powers of europe for it seldom happens that a war begun between any two of them does not extend itself sooner or later till it involves the whole spain showed a strong inclination to begin with us but france being not willing or ready to join her she has smothered that inclination for the present with great esteem i am sir c b franklin benjamin franklin   july      london cadwallader evans ccccix to cadwallader evans london   july      dear doctor— i acquainted you some time since that i expected soon to obtain satisfactory     answers to your queries relating to the specimens of silk you sent over but i was disappointed till lately when i had a meeting with mr patterson esteemed one of the best judges of that commodity who favored me with the enclosed paper and in conversation with the following particulars he thinks that the water though clear at first may grow foul with the impurities of the cocoons reeled in it and therefore should be changed as that appears to be the case he gave me a skein of what is called the best italian silk imported here and advised me to send it over as a pattern for our people to endeavour to imitate with regard to its evenness cleanness from nibs and lustre and that they might better see the difference and understand his remarks he wished the skeins sent over hither might be returned with it i send them all together accordingly he says the silk reeled from twelve cocoons fetches nearly as good a price as that from six because it winds well and there is less fine waste the dropping accidentally or through inattention three or four of the cocoons out of twelve not weakening the thread so much in proportion as when the same number are dropped out of six nor is the thread so apt to break in winding i observe that the italian silk has a sweet smell as if perfumed he thinks it is the natural smell of the silk when prepared in perfection he understands that the piedmontese reel is esteemed preferable to mr pulleins he says we may carry that produce to what length we please it is impossible to overstock the market     as the demand is continually increasing silk being more and more worn and daily entering into the composition of more and a greater variety of manufactures i communicated your thanks to mr walpole who was pleased to assure me he should always be ready to afford the design all the assistance in his power and will endeavour to procure some eggs for you from valencia against the next season i am much obliged to you for the snuffbox the wood is beautiful the manufacture should be encouraged i hope our people will not be disheartened by a few accidents and such disappointments as are incident to all new undertakings but persevere bravely in the silk business till they have conquered all difficulties by diligence and patience the mouse ate in twain the cable it is not two centuries since it was as much a novelty in france as it is now with us in north america and the people as much unacquainted with it my respects to my good old friend mr wharton i hope he is recovered of the indisposition you mention with sincere esteem i am dear sir your affectionate friend and humble servant b franklin samuel cooper  0 july      boston benjamin franklin ccccx from samuel cooper to b franklin boston  0 july      dear sir— my thanks are due to you for writing to me with so much freedom and i endeavour to     make the best use of what you communicate your interposition in favor of the charter was kind and must endear you to every true friend of the province but what shall we say of those who were capable of forming or promoting such a design can we suppose them possessed of such ideas and principles as entitle them to influence the councils of a great nation i could not but regard with pleasure the figure which the secretary made in his conversation with my friend he must have been uneasy not only from an apprehension of losing his place but from feeling also his own littleness and his selfsufficiency for a moment at least must have been suspended amidst all the pomp and parade of his office his measures respecting this province exactly answer the picture you have given of him and while we have in the american department a man of a size and temper to be a tool of sir francis bernard his majestys service will be perpetually embarrassed the project for making governors independent for their salaries upon the grants of the people they govern gives great uneasiness to the most considerate friends of the constitution the reasons you mention against it are unanswerable it was taken for granted when the charter was received here that the governor was to be supported by the free gift of the province and this was doubtless one reason for acquiescing in a compact that gave so great a power and influence to the crown and accordingly this has been the manner in which the     representatives of the crown have constantly been supported it is a strong connexion between the ruler and the people tending in every view to promote the great end of government and the want of which no expedient can supply the civil list is the free grant of a british parliament and is augmented from time to time at their pleasure but the american revenue is not the gift of the american assemblies it is extorted from them by mere power contrary to their just remonstrances and humble petitions and though the assembly may make a grant to a good governor at the close of his administration yet it is in the power of the crown to cut off from the people this very small resource of influence by obliging its representative not to accept such a grant while by its absolute appointment of him it is absolute master of his conduct nor can there be any pretence for this threatening innovation from the conduct of our provincial assembly upon this point for even in the highest political contest with sir francis bernard so sensible were the house of the importance of supporting the kings governor while he remained in office that they never once proposed to diminish or delay much less to deny his salary and surely it is to be hoped that the assembly will never meet with a stronger provocation to such a measure than they did in him i cannot forbear to add though writing to one who has a much more thorough comprehension of the subject than myself that this proposed and i am afraid determined independence is impolitic on     the part of the crown and tends to prejudice its interest even considered separately from that of the people as it will prove a strong temptation to governors to hold a conduct that will greatly lessen their esteem and influence in the province and consequently their power to promote the service of the king caution and watchfulness in governors and some regard to the interest and even the inclinations and humors of the people must i think be a security to the prerogative but independence will take off this guard and lead them to be inattentive to if not directly to encourage and promote such things as will still further weaken the political connexion between the parent country and the colonies so that i hope the ministry upon cool consideration may be induced to lay aside this measure as they wish the continuance of the constitutional powers of the crown and that it may long retain the peaceful and happy government of america i doubt not of your exerting your abilities and influence for so good a purpose and should you succeed you will do a most important and obliging service to the province but what are we to expect when the means of selfdefence upon such great points are to be taken from us and no public moneys are allowed for the support of an agent unless he be under the control of the governor you will no doubt be particularly informed of a new point that has alarmed us as much as any thing and is regarded almost universally as an undisguised violation of a fundamental principle of the charter i mean the governors refusing to sign the     supply bill because the commissioners  were not exempted by it from taxes the crown grants by charter that the general assembly shall have full power and authority to impose rates and taxes upon all and every the proprietors and inhabitants of the province no persons however related to the crown are excepted the king now says by his instructions no supply bill shall be passed unless the commissioners are exempted is not this to claim a right to rescind by instruction what was solemnly ceded by charter and compact the governor may indeed refuse his assent to a supply bill but can he do it upon a declared principle subversive of the capital privileges of the charter and only because they exercise the power and authority granted them in it if the crown can exempt five persons it may with equal right five hundred not only the commissioners but all judges justices clerks of courts constables and all friends to government as men of slavish principles affect to be called and leave the whole burden of taxes upon those who wish well to the rights of their country in this manner people reason here but out of the eater cometh forth meat good may arise from this it is bold and open and strikes every description of men it is not a point confined to trade it regards in itself and much more in its tendency the pocket of the farmer and the farmer will regard his pocket it shows the disposition of the commissioners who for such a trifle as the tax they pay and     which perhaps affects their pride much more than their purse have started a new and important subject of contention and how fit they are for that influence in governmental measures which they have so long and so mysteriously possessed i long to see your treatise showing that every lady of genoa is not queen of corsica i doubt not you will be able to prove your point but though i believe you capable of confuting a whole island of queens i fear whether you could persuade them silently to renounce their crowns and sceptres i am sir with the greatest esteem c samuel cooper benjamin franklin    july      london samuel franklin ccccxi to samuel franklin london    july      loving cousin— i received your kind letter of may   th and rejoice to hear that you and your good family are well my love to them with this i send you the print you desire for mr bowen he does me honor in accepting it sally franklin presents her duty to you and mrs franklin yesterday a very odd accident happened which i must mention to you as it relates to your grandfather a person that deals in old books of whom i sometimes buy acquainted me that he had a curious collection of pamphlets bound in eight volumes folio and twentyfour volumes quarto and octavo which he thought from the subjects i might     like to have and that he would sell them cheap i desired to see them and he brought them to me on examining i found that they contained all the principal pamphlets and papers on public affairs that had been printed here from the restoration down to      in one of the blank leaves at the beginning of each volume the collector had written the titles of the pieces contained in it and the price they cost him also notes in the margin of many of the pieces and the collector i find from the handwriting and various other circumstances was your grandfather my uncle benjamin wherefore i the more readily agreed to buy them i suppose he parted with them when he left england and came to boston soon after your father which was about the year      or      now more than fifty years since in whose hands they have been all this time i know not the oddity is that the bookseller who could suspect nothing of any relation between me and the collector should happen to make me the offer of them my love to your good wife and children your affectionate cousin b franklin benjamin franklin    july      london john bartram ccccxii to john bartram london    july      my good and dear old friend— i received your kind letter of april   th wherein you complain of your friends here not writing to you i had written a letter to you on the  0th of the same month which     i hope is long since come to hand but i confess i ought to have written sooner to acknowledge the receipt of the box of seeds whereby i was much obliged as to your pension there is not i believe the least reason for you to apprehend its being stopped i know not who receives it for you here or i should quicken them in writing to you but there is no instance in this kings reign of taking away a pension once granted unless for some great offence young is in no esteem here as far as i can learn i wish your daughter success with her silkworms i am persuaded nothing is wanting in our country for the produce of silk but skill which will be obtained by persevering till we are instructed by experience you take notice of the failing of your eyesight perhaps you have not spectacles that suit you and it is not easy there to provide ones self people too when they go to a shop for glasses seldom give themselves time to choose with care and if their eyes are not rightly suited they are injured therefore i send you a complete set from number one to thirteen that you may try them at your ease and having pitched on such as suit you best at present reserve those of higher numbers for future use as your eyes grow still older and with the lower numbers which are for younger people you may oblige some other friends my love to good mrs bartram and your children i am as ever your faithful friend and servant b franklin p s—on inquiry i find your pension continues and will be regularly paid as it becomes due to the person you empower to receive it for you   0 benjamin franklin    july      london cadwallader evans ccccxiii to cadwallader evans london    july      dear doctor— i wrote to you on the  th instant and sent you a paper of observations on your specimens of silk drawn up by mr patterson who is noted here in that trade with a specimen of italian silk as a copy for our people to imitate but they must not be discouraged if they should not come up to the lustre of it that being the very finest and from a particular district in italy none other being equal to it from any other district or any other country the european silk i understand is all yellow and most of the india silk what comes from china is white in ogilbys account of that country i find that in the province of chekiang they prune their mulberrytrees once a year as we do our vines in europe and suffer them not to grow up to high trees because through long experience they have learned that the leaves of the smallest and youngest trees make the best silk and know thereby how to distinguish the first spinning of the threads from the second viz the first is that which comes from the young leaves that are gathered in march with which they feed their silkworms and the second is of the old summer leaves and it is only the change of food as to the young and old leaves which makes the difference in the silk the prices of the first and second spinning differ among the chineses the best silk is that of march the coarsest of june yet both in one year i have copied this passage to     show that in chekiang they keep the mulberrytrees low but i suppose the reason to be the greater facility of gathering the leaves it appears too by this passage that they raise two crops a year in that province which may account for the great plenty of silk there but perhaps this would not answer with us since it is not practised in italy though it might be tried chekiang is from twentyseven to thirtyone degrees of north latitude duhalde has a good deal on the chinese management of the silk business dr pullein is an acquaintance of mine i will forward any letters you may send him he lives in ireland but often comes to london as you did not write to dr fothergill i communicated to him what you wrote in favor of mr parke who is to wait on him tomorrow i shall be glad to render the young man any service here we had a cold backward spring here and it is since the solstice that we have had what may be called a warm day but the country now looks well with the prospect of great plenty it is however the general opinion that britain will not for some years export much corn great part of the arable land being now enclosed and turned to grass to nourish the immense number of horses raised for exportation there being a rage in france and other parts of europe for english horses that seems increasing every year i hope our friend galloway will not decline the public service in the assembly with his private business both may be too much for his health but the first alone will be little more than an amusement     and i do not see that he can be spared from that station without great detriment to our affairs and to the general welfare of america i am with sincere esteem c b franklin p s—the enclosed notes were given me by mr small a leading member of the society of arts with a desire that i would send them over to some member of your philosophical society supposing the herbs may be of some use benjamin franklin    august      london deborah franklin ccccxiv to mrs deborah franklin london    august      my dear child— i am glad to hear of all your welfares and that the pictures were safe arrived you do not tell me who mounted the great one nor where you have it hung up let me know whether dr bond likes the new one better than the old one if so the old one is to be returned hither to mr wilson the painter you may keep the frame as it may be wanted for some other picture there i wrote to you a letter the beginning of last month which was to go by captain falconer and have since been in the country i am just returned to town and find him still here and the letters not gone he goes however next saturday i had written to many of my friends by him i spent three weeks in hampshire at my friend the bishop of st asaphs the bishops lady knows     what children and grandchildren i have and their ages so when i was to come away on monday the   th in the morning she insisted on my staying that one day longer that we might together keep my grandsons birthday at dinner among other nice things we had a floating island which they always particularly have on the birthdays of any of their own six children who were all but one at table where there was also a clergymans widow now above one hundred years old the chief toast of the day was master benjamin bache which the venerable old lady began in a bumper of mountain the bishops lady politely added and that he may be as good a man as his grandfather i said i hoped he would be much better the bishop still more complaisant than his lady said we will compound the matter and be contented if he should not prove quite so good this chitchat is to yourself only in return for some of yours about your grandson and must only be read to sally and not spoken of to anybody else for you know how people add and alter silly stories that they hear and make them appear ten times more silly just while i am writing the post brings me the inclosed from the good bishop with some letters of recommendation for ireland to see which country i am to set out next week with my old friend and fellow traveller counsellor jackson we expect to be absent a month or six weeks the bishops youngest daughter mentioned in his letter is about thirteen years of age and came up with me in the postchaise to go to school     captain osborn is not yet arrived here but is every day expected i hope he will come before i set out that i may hear from you by him i desire you will push the inquiry after the lancaster dutchman and not let it sleep and be forgotten i send you by captain falconer a box of lookingglasses for the closet door in the——the remainder is lost ccccxv plan for benefiting distant unprovided countries by dr franklin and mr dalrymple  august         the country called in the maps new zealand has been discovered by the endeavour to be two islands together as large as great britain these islands named acpynomawée and tovypoennammoo are inhabited by a brave and generous race who are destitute of corn fowls and all quadrupeds except dogs these circumstances being mentioned lately in a company of men of liberal sentiments it was observed that it seemed incumbent upon such a country as this to communicate to all others the conveniences of life which we enjoy     dr franklin whose life has ever been directed to promote the true interest of society said he would with all his heart subscribe to a voyage intended to communicate in general those benefits which we enjoy to countries destitute of them in the remote parts of the globe this proposition being warmly adopted by the rest of the company mr dalrymple then present was induced to offer to undertake the command in such an expedition on mature reflection this scheme appears the most honorable to the national character of any which can be conceived as it is grounded on the noblest principle of benevolence good intentions are often frustrated by letting them remain undigested on this consideration mr dalrymple was induced to put the outlines on paper which are now published that by an early communication there may be a better opportunity of collecting all the hints which can conduce to execute effectually the benevolent purpose of the expedition in case it should meet with general approbation on this scheme being shown to dr franklin he communicated his sentiments by way of introduction to the following effect britain is said to have produced originally nothing but sloes what vast advantages have been communicated to her by the fruits seeds roots herbage animals and arts of other countries we are by their means become a wealthy and a mighty nation abounding in all good things does not some duty hence arise from us towards other countries still remaining in our former state     britain is now the first maritime power in the world her ships are innumerable capable by their form size and strength of sailing on all seas our seamen are equally bold skilful and hardy dexterous in exploring the remotest regions and ready to engage in voyages to unknown countries though attended with the greatest dangers the inhabitants of those countries our fellowmen have canoes only not knowing iron they cannot build ships they have little astronomy and no knowledge of the compass to guide them they cannot therefore come to us or obtain any of our advantages from these circumstances does not some duty seem to arise from us to them does not providence by these distinguishing favors seem to call on us to do something ourselves for the common interests of humanity those who think it their duty to ask bread and other blessings daily from heaven would they not think it equally a duty to communicate of those blessings when they have received them and show their gratitude to their benefactor by the only means in their power promoting the happiness of his other children ceres is said to have made a journey through many countries to teach the use of corn and the art of raising it for this single benefit the grateful nations deified her how much more may englishmen deserve such honor by communicating the knowledge and use not of corn only but of all the other enjoyments the earth can produce and which they are now in possession of communiter bona profundere deûm est     many voyages have been undertaken with views of profit or of plunder or to gratify resentment to procure some advantage to ourselves or do some mischief to others but a voyage in now proposed to visit a distant people on the other side the globe not to cheat them not to rob them not to seize their lands or enslave their persons but merely to do them good and make them as far as in our power lies to live as comfortably as ourselves it seems a laudable wish that all the nations of the earth were connected by a knowledge of each other and a mutual exchange of benefits but a commercial nation particularly should wish for a general civilization of mankind since trade is always carried on to much greater extent with people who have the arts and conveniences of life than it can be with naked savages we may therefore hope in this undertaking to be of some service to our country as well as to those poor people who however distant from us are in truth related to us

provision for contingencies ccccxvi concerning the provision made in china against famine  i have somewhere read that in china an account is yearly taken of the number of people and the quantities of provision produced this account is transmitted to the emperor whose ministers can     thence foresee a scarcity likely to happen in any province and from what province it can best be supplied in good time to facilitate the collecting of this account and prevent the necessity of entering houses and spending time in asking and answering questions each house is furnished with a little board to be hung without the door during a certain time each year on which board are marked certain words against which the inhabitant is to mark the number and quantity somewhat in this manner  all under sixteen are accounted children and all above men and women any other particulars which the government desires information of are occasionally marked on the same boards thus the officers appointed to collect the accounts in each district have only to pass before the doors and enter into their book what they find marked on the board without giving the least trouble to the family there is a penalty on marking falsely and as neighbors must know nearly the truth of each others account they dare not expose themselves by a false one to each others accusation perhaps such a regulation is scarcely practicable with us   0 benjamin franklin    november      edinburgh william strahan ccccxvii to mr william strahan edinburgh    november      dear sir— i have been at blair drummond on a visit to my friend lord kames thence i went to glasgow thence to carron works viewing the canal by the way extreme bad weather detained me in several places some days longer than i intended but on tuesday i purpose setting out on my return and hope for the pleasure of seeing you by the tuesday following i thank you for your kind congratulations on the news you have heard i like immortal friendships but not immortal enmities and therefore kill the latter whenever i have a good opportunity thinking it no murder i am but just come back hither and write this line just to let you know i am well and again under the hospitable roof of the good samaritan as to news which you seem to expect from me i protest i know of none and i am too dull for invention my love to mrs strahan and your children and believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin thomas percival ccccxviii to thomas percival  on my return to london i found your favor of the   th of may      i wish i could as you desire     give you a better explanation of the phenomenon in question since you seem not quite satisfied with your own but i think we want more and greater variety of experiments in different circumstances to enable us to form a thoroughly satisfactory hypothesis not that i make the least doubt of the facts already related as i know both lord charles cavendish and dr heberden to be very accurate experimenters but i wish to know the event of the trials proposed in your six queries and also whether in the same place where the lower vessel receives nearly twice the quantity of water that is received by the upper a third vessel placed at half the height will receive a quantity proportionable i will however endeavour to explain to you what occurred to me when i first heard of the fact i suppose it will be generally allowed on a little consideration of the subject that scarce any drop of water was when it began to fall from the clouds of a magnitude equal to that it has acquired when it arrives at the earth the same of the several pieces of hail because they are often so large and so weighty that we cannot conceive a possibility of their being suspended in the air and remaining at rest there for any time how small soever nor do we conceive any means of forming them so large before they set out to fall it seems then that each beginning drop and particle of hail receives continual addition in its progress downwards this may be several ways by the union of numbers in their course so that what was at first only descending mist becomes a shower or by each particle in its descent through air that contains     a great quantity of dissolved water striking against attaching to itself and carrying down with it such particles of that dissolved water as happen to be in its way or attracting to itself such as do not lie directly in its course by its different state with regard either to common or electric fire or by all these causes united in the first case by the uniting of numbers larger drops might be made but the quantity falling in the same place would be the same at all heights unless as you mention the whole should be contracted in falling the lines described by all the drops converging so that what set out to fall from a cloud of many thousand acres should reach the earth in perhaps a third of that extent of which i somewhat doubt in the other cases we have two experiments   a dry glass bottle filled with very cold water in a warm day will presently collect from the seemingly dry air that surrounds it a quantity of water that shall cover its surface and run down its sides which perhaps is done by the power wherewith the cold water attracts the fluid common fire that had been united with the dissolved water in the air and drawing the fire through the glass into itself leaves the water on the outside   an electrified body left in a room for some time will be more covered with dust than other bodies in the same room not electrified which dust seems to be attracted from the circumambient air now we know that the rain even in our hottest days comes from a very cold region its falling sometimes in the form of ice shows this clearly and     perhaps even the rain is snow or ice when it first moves downward though thawed in falling and we know that the drops of rain are often electrified but those causes of addition to each drop of water or piece of hail one would think could not long continue to produce the same effect since the air through which the drops fall must soon be stripped of its previously dissolved water so as to be no longer capable of augmenting them indeed very heavy showers of either are never of long continuance but moderate rains often continue so long as to puzzle this hypothesis so that upon the whole i think as i intimated before that we are yet hardly ripe for making one b franklin benjamin franklin    november      preston mary hewson ccccxix to mrs mary hewson preston    november      dear friend— i came to this place on saturday night right well and untired with a seventy miles journey that day i met with your and my dollys joint letter which would have refreshed me with its kindness if i had been ever so weary the account you give of a certain ladys having entertained a new gallant in my absence did not surprise me for i have been used to rivals and scarce ever had a friend or a mistress in my whole life that other people did not like as well as myself and therefore i did not wonder when i read in the     newspapers some weeks since that the duke of c that general lover had made many visits of late to an old lady not many miles from craven street i only wondered considering the dislike she used to have for the family that she would receive his visits but as i saw soon after that prince charles had left rome and was gone a long journey nobody knew whither i made no doubt but the newswriters had mistaken the person and that it was he who had taken the opportunity of my absence to solace himself with his old friend i thank you for your intelligence about my godson i believe you are sincere when you say you think him as fine a child as you wish to see he had cut two teeth and three in another letter make five for i know you never write tautologies if i have overreckoned the number will be right by this time his being like me in so many particulars pleases me prodigiously and i am persuaded there is another which you have omitted though it must have occurred to you while you were putting them down pray let him have every thing he likes i think it of great consequence while the features of the countenance are forming it gives them a pleasant air and that being once become natural and fixed by habit the face is ever after the handsomer for it and on that much of a persons good fortune and success in life may depend had i been crossed as much in my infant likings and inclinations as you know i have been of late years i should have been i was going to say not near so handsome but as the vanity of that expression would offend other folks vanity i change     it out of regard to them and say a great deal more homely i rejoice that your good mothers new regimen succeeds so well with her we are to set out my son and i tomorrow for london where i hope to be by the end of the week and to find her and you and all yours well and happy my love to them all they tell me dinner is coming in and i have yet said nothing to dolly but must nevertheless conclude my dear friend yours ever most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london jane mecom ccccxx to mrs jane mecom london    january      my dear sister— i received your kind letters of september   th and november  th i have now been some weeks returned from my journey through wales ireland scotland and the north of england which besides being an agreeable tour with a pleasant companion has contributed to the establishment of my health and this is the first ship i have heard of by which i could write to you i thank you for the receipts they are as full and particular as one could wish but they can easily be practised only in america no bayberry wax nor any brasiletto being here to be had at least to my knowledge i am glad however that those useful arts which have so long been in our family are now put down in writing some future branch may be the better for it     it gives me pleasure that those little things sent by jonathan proved agreeable to you i write now to cousin williams to press the payment of the bond there has been forbearance enough on my part seven years or more without receiving any principal or interest it seems as if the debtor was like a whimsical man in pennsylvania of whom it was said that it being against his principle to pay intertes and against his interest to pay the principal he paid neither one nor the other i doubt you have taken too old a pair of glasses being tempted by their magnifying greatly but people in choosing should only aim at remedying the defect the glasses that enable them to see as well at the same distance they used to hold their book or work while their eyes were good are those they should choose not such as make them see better for such contribute to hasten the time when still older glasses will become necessary all who have seen my grandson agree with you in their accounts of his being an uncommonly fine boy which brings often afresh to my mind the idea of my son franky  though now dead thirtysix years whom i have seldom since seen equalled in every thing and whom to this day i cannot think of without a sigh mr bache is here i found him at preston in lancashire with his mother and sisters very agreeable people and i brought him to london with me i very much like his behaviour he returns in the next ship to philadelphia the gentleman who brought your last letter mr fox stayed but a few     minutes with me and has not since called as i desired him to do i shall endeavour to get the arms you desire for cousin coffin having many letters to write i can now only add my love to cousin jenny and that i am as ever your affectionate brother b franklin p s—sally franklin presents her duty mrs stevenson desires to be affectionately remembered no arms of the folgers are to be found in the heralds office i am persuaded it was originally a flemish family which came over with many others from that country in queen elizabeths time flying from the persecution then raging there benjamin franklin    january      london ccccxxi to the committee of correspondence in massachusetts london    january      gentlemen— on my return from a late tour through ireland and scotland for the establishment of my health i found your respected letter of june   th with the papers therein referred to relating to the townships settled eastward of penobscot river i immediately waited on mr bollan to consult with him agreeably to your instructions who informed me that in my absence he had by himself thoroughly considered the same having formerly had occasion to be acquainted with the whole affair and he suggested     to his constituents the council a plan of accommodation to be proposed to government here if they should approve of it and that he hoped by the meeting of parliament before which little public business is done here so many of the lords of the council being out of town he might have their answer and it would otherwise be to little purpose to attempt any thing sooner i make no doubt but the proposal has been communicated to the house of representatives if they have since had a meeting and that we may soon receive their further instructions thereon the town now begins to fill with members of parliament and great officers of state coming in daily to celebrate the queens birthday and be present at the opening of the session which is fixed for next tuesday it is given out that nothing relating to america is likely to be agitated this session that is there is no purpose either to abrogate the old duties or lay new ones for the first i am sorry believing as i do that no harmony can be restored between the two countries while these duties are continued this with the other aggrievances mentioned in your letters of june   th and july   th your agents will constantly attend to and take every step possible in their present situation unacknowledged as they are here to obtain the redress that is so justly your due and which it would be so prudent in government here to grant in yours of july  th it is mentioned that the house desire i would annually send an account of the expense i am at in carrying on the affairs of the province     having business to do for several colonies almost every time i go to the public offices and to the ministers i have found it troublesome to keep an account of small expenses such as coach and chair hire stationery c and difficult to divide them justly therefore i have some time since omitted keeping any account or making any charge of them but content myself with such salaries grants and allowances as have been made me where considerable sums have been disbursed as in fees to counsel payment of solicitors bills and the like those i charge but as yet i have made no such disbursements on the account of your province please to present my duty to the house of representatives and believe me to be with great esteem and respect gentlemen c b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london samuel cooper ccccxxii to samuel cooper london    january      dear sir— i have now before me your several favors a long journey i took in the summer and autumn for the establishment of my health prevented my answering sooner the two first i hope the state of your health also is mended by your retirement into the country as mine has sensibly been by that journey you have furnished me with a very good additional argument against the crown paying its governors   0 namely that the proposed independence is impolitic on the part of the crown and tends to prejudice it is interest even considered separately from that of the people as it will prove a strong temptation to governors to hold a conduct that will greatly lessen their esteem and influence in the province and consequently their power to promote the service of the king indeed the making it a rule among ourselves that the governor is to have his salary from our assemblies though his public conduct should be wilfully and maliciously prejudicial to the province has the same tendency of which the conduct of governor bernard while he was constantly and regularly paid by us is a considerable proof and therefore in my opinion if we would have our power of granting the support operate with any weight in maintaining an influence with the governor it should have been withheld from him and we should withhold it in part or in the whole according to the circumstances as often as such a conduct appears in any governor otherwise the power if in such cases it is not to be used would seem of very little importance and since the assembly have of late years and under such great provocations never attempted to abridge or withhold the salary no reason appears why the american minister should now think it necessary or advisable for the crown to take the payment of its governor upon itself unless it be with an intention to influence him by withholding it when he declines executing arbitrary instructions and then in such cases the people should be sure to compensate him as to procuring here any change of this measure i frankly own to     you that i despair of it while the administration of american affairs continues in the hands of lord hillsborough and while by our paying the duties there is a sufficient american fund out of which such salaries can be satisfied the failure of that fund would be the most likely means of demolishing the project the attempt to get the commissioners exempted from the payment of their taxes by an instruction to the governor is the most indiscreet thing surely to say nothing of its injustice that any prudent government was ever guilty of i cannot think it will be persisted in i hope it will never be complied with if the supply bill is duly offered without the clause i am persuaded it will not long be refused the public must however suffer in the meantime by the want of the supply but that will be a good foundation for an impeachment here your reasonings against the instruction are unanswerable and will be of use in the discussing that business i am glad that commodore gambier behaved in so satisfactory a manner his uncle mr mead first commissioner of the customs is a particular and intimate friend of mine a man of great moderation and prudence i knew that he gave his nephew before he went hence a great deal of good advice with regard to his conduct among the people of boston for whom he has a great esteem and regard having formerly commanded a frigate stationed there and he is happy to find by your letter which i communicated to him that his advice was so well followed he gave also equally good advice to your indiscreet     commissioners when they were sent out but they had not sense enough to follow it and therefore have been the authors of infinite mischief i wonder at the invention of so improbable a lie as that i should desire a place among them who am daily urging the expediency of their dissolution the other calumny you mention contained in an anonymous letter to the speaker is so weak that i believe you do not think that i ought to take any notice of it  as to the agency whether i am rechosen or not and whether the general assembly is ever permitted to pay me or not i shall nevertheless continue to exert myself in behalf of my country as long as i see a probability of my being able to do it any service i have nothing to ask or expect of ministers i have thanks to god a competency for the little time i may expect to live and am grown too old for ambition of any kind but that of leaving a good name behind me your story of the clergymen and proclamation is a pleasant one i can only match it with one i had from my father i know not if it was ever printed charles the first ordered his proclamation authorizing     sport on a sunday to be read in all churches many clergymen complied some refused and others hurried it through as indistinctly as possible but one whose congregation expected no such thing from him did nevertheless to their great surprise read it distinctly he followed it however with the fourth commandment remember to keep holy the sabbath day and then said brethern i have laid before you the commandment of your king and the commandment of your god i leave it to yourselves to judge which of the two ought rather to be observed with great and sincere esteem i remain dear sir c b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london james bowdoin ccccxxiii to james bowdoin london    january      dear sir— i should very readily have recommended your son to the care of my friend dr priestley if he had continued to superintend the academy at warrington but he has left that charge some time since and is now pastor of a congregation at leeds in yorkshire i am much obliged to you for introducing me to the acquaintance of mr erving who appears a very intelligent sensible man the governing of colonies by instruction has long been a favorite point with ministers here about thirty years since in a bill brought into parliament relating to america they inserted a clause to make     the kings instructions laws in the colonies which being opposed by the then agents was thrown out and i well remember a conversation with lord granville soon after my arrival here in which he expressed himself on that subject in the following terms your american assemblies slight the kings instructions pretending that they are not laws the instructions sent over to your governors are not like the pocket instructions given to ambassadors to be observed at their discretion as circumstances may require they are drawn up by grave men learned in the laws and constitutions of the realm they are brought into council thoroughly weighed well considered and amended if necessary by the wisdom of that body and when received by the governors they are the laws of the land for the king is the legislator of the colonies i remember this the better because being a new doctrine to me i put it down as soon as i returned to my lodgings to be sure if a governor thinks himself obliged to obey all instructions whether consistent or inconsistent with the constitution laws and rights of the country he governs and can proceed to govern in that train there is an end of the constitution and those rights are abolished but i wonder that any honest gentleman can think there is honor in being a governor on such terms and i think the practice cannot possibly continue especially if opposed with spirit by our assemblies at present no attention is paid by the american ministers to any agent here whose appointment is not ratified by the governors assent and if this is persisted in you can     have none to serve you in a public character that do not render themselves agreeable to these ministers and those otherwise appointed can only promote your interests by conversation as private gentlemen or by writing virginia had as you observe two agents one for the council the other for the assembly but i think the latter only was considered as agent for the province he was appointed by an act which expired in the time of lord botetourt and was not revived the other i apprehend continues but i am not well acquainted with the nature of his appointment i only understand that he does not concern himself much with the general affairs of the colony it gives me great pleasure that my book afforded any to my friends i esteem those letters of yours among its highest ornaments and have the satisfaction to find that they add greatly to the reputation of american philosophy there is in the governors collection of papers relative to the colony of massachusetts bay published in      a copy of an answer made by randolph to several heads of inquiry which i take to be the same with those i sent you  i shall be very glad to have     an account of the present number of ratables when you can obtain it for me in ireland among the patriots i dined with dr lucas they are all friends of america in which i said every thing i could think of to confirm them lucas gave mr bowdoin of boston for his toast my best respects to mrs bowdoin with sincere and great esteem i am dear sir c b franklin     benjamin franklin    january      london joshua babcock ccccxxiv to joshua babcock london    january      dear sir— it was with great pleasure i learnt by mr marchant that you and mrs babcock and all your good family continue well and happy i hope i shall find you all in the same state when i next come your way and take shelter as often heretofore under your hospitable roof the colonel i am told continues an active and able farmer the most honorable of all employments in my opinion as being the most useful in itself and rendering the man most independent my namesake his son will soon i hope be able to drive the plough for him i have lately made a tour through ireland and scotland in those countries a small part of the society are landlords great noblemen and gentlemen extremely opulent living in the highest affluence and magnificence the bulk of the people are tenants extremely poor living in the most sordid wretchedness in dirty hovels of mud and straw and clothed only in rags i thought often of the happiness of new england where every man is a freeholder has a vote in public affairs lives in a tidy warm house has plenty of good food and fuel with whole clothes from head to foot the manufacture perhaps of his own family long may they continue in this situation but if they should ever envy the trade of these countries i can put them in a way to obtain a share of it let them with three fourths of the people of ireland     live the year round on potatoes and buttermilk without shirts then may their merchants export beef butter and linen let them with the generality of the common people of scotland go barefoot then may they make large exports in shoes and stockings and if they will be content to wear rags like the spinners and weavers of england they may make cloths and stuffs for all parts of the world farther if my countrymen should ever wish for the honor of having among them a gentry enormously wealthy let them sell their farms and pay racked rents the scale of the landlords will rise as that of the tenants is depressed who will soon become poor tattered dirty and abject in spirit had i never been in the american colonies but were to form my judgment of civil society by what i have lately seen i should never advise a nation of savages to admit of civilization for i assure you that in the possession and enjoyment of the various comforts of life compared to these people every indian is a gentleman and the effect of this kind of civil society seems to be the depressing multitudes below the savage state that a few may be raised above it my best wishes attend you and yours being ever with great esteem c b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london thomas cushing ccccxxv to thomas cushing london    january      sir— i am now returned again to london from a journey of some months in ireland and scotland     though my constitution and too great confinement to business during the winter seem to require the air and exercise of a long journey once a year which i have now practised for more than twenty years past yet i should not have been out so long this time but that i was well assured the parliament would not meet till towards the end of january before which meeting few of the principal people would be in town and no business of importance likely to be agitated relating to america i have now before me your esteemed favors in the first you mention that the general assembly was still held out of its ancient and only convenient seat the townhouse in boston and by the latest papers from thence i see that it was prorogued again to meet in cambridge which i a little wonder at when i recollect a question asked me by lord hillsborough in ireland viz whether i had heard from new england lately since the general court was returned to boston from this i concluded that orders had been transmitted by his lordship for its removal perhaps such may have been sent to be used discretionally i think i have before mentioned to you one of the articles of impeachment brought against a bad minister of a former king that to work his ends he had caused the parliament to sit in villibus et remotis partibus regni where few people propter defectum hospitii et victualium could attend thereby to force illos paucos qui remanebunt de communitate regni concedere regi quamvis pessima lord clarendon too was impeached for endeavouring to introduce arbitrary government into the colonies   0 lord hillsborough seems by the late instructions to have been treading in the paths that lead to the same unhappy situation if the parliament here should ever again feel for the colonies being in dublin at the same time with his lordship i met with him accidentally at the lord lieutenants who had happened to invite us to dine with a large company on the same day as there was something curious in our interview i must give you an account of it he was surprisingly civil and urged my fellowtravellers and me to call at his house in our intended journey northward where we might be sure of better accommodations than the inns would afford us he pressed us so politely that it was not easy to refuse without apparent rudeness as we must pass through his town hillsborough and by his door and therefore as it might afford an opportunity of saying something on american affairs i concluded to comply with his invitation his lordship went home some time before we left dublin we called upon him and were detained at his house four days during which time he entertained us with great civility and a particular attention to me that appeared the more extraordinary as i knew that just before we left london he had expressed himself concerning me in very angry terms calling me a republican a factious mischievous fellow and the like in our conversations he first showed himself a good irishman blaming england for its narrowness towards that country in restraining its commerce and discouraging its woollen manufacture when i applied     his observations to america he said he had always been of opinion that america ought not to be restrained in manufacturing any thing she could manufacture to advantage that he supposed that at present she found more profit in agriculture but whenever she found that less profitable or any particular manufacture more so he had no objection to her pursuing it and that the subjects in every part of the kings dominion had a natural right to make the best use they could of the productions of their country he censured lord chatham for affecting in his speech that the parliament had a right or ought to restrain manufactures in the colonies adding that as he knew the english were apt to be jealous on that head he avoided every thing that might inflame that jealousy and therefore though the commons had requested the crown to order the governor to send over annually accounts of such manufactures as were undertaken in the colonies yet as they had not ordered such accounts to be annually laid before them he should never produce them till they were called for then he gave me to understand that the bounty on silk raised in america was a child of his and he hoped it would prove of great advantage to that country and that he wished to know in what manner a bounty on raising wine there might be contrived so as to operate effectually for that purpose desiring me to turn it in my thoughts as he should be glad of my opinion and advice then he informed me that newfoundland was grown too populous to be left any longer without a regular government but     there were great difficulties in the forming such a kind of government as would be suitable to the particular circumstances of that country which he wished me likewise to consider and that i would favor him with my sentiments he seemed attentive to every thing that might make my stay in his house agreeable to me and put his eldest son lord killwarling into his phaeton with me to drive me a round of forty miles that i might see the country the seats and manufactures covering me with his own greatcoat lest i should take cold in short he seemed extremely solicitous to impress me and the colonies through me with a good opinion of him all which i could not but wonder at knowing that he likes neither them nor me and i thought it inexplicable but on the supposition that he apprehended an approaching storm and was desirous of lessening beforehand the number of enemies he had so imprudently created but if he takes no steps towards withdrawing the troops repealing the duties restoring the castle or recalling the offensive instructions i shall think all the plausible behaviour i have described is meant only by patting and stroking the horse to make him more patient while the reins are drawn tighter and the spurs set deeper into his sides before leaving ireland i must mention that being desirous of seeing the principal patriots there i stayed till the opening of their parliament i found them disposed to be friends of america in which i endeavoured to confirm them with the expectation that our growing weight might in time be thrown into their     scale and by joining our interests with others a more equitable treatment from this nation might be obtained for them as well as for us there are many brave spirits among them the gentry are a very sensible polite and friendly people their parliament makes a most respectable figure with a number of very good speakers in both parties and able men of business and i must not omit acquainting you that it being a standing rule to admit members of the english parliament to sit though they do not vote in the house among the members while others are only admitted into the gallery my fellowtraveller being an english member was accordingly admitted as such but i supposed i must go to the gallery when the speaker stood up and acquainted the house that he understood there was in town an american gentleman of as he was pleased to say distinguished character and merit a member or delegate of some of the parliaments of that country who was desirous of being present at the debates of the house that there was a rule of the house for admitting members of english parliaments and that he supposed the house would consider the american assemblies as english parliaments but as this was the first instance he had chosen not to give any order in it without receiving their directions on the question the house gave a loud unanimous aye when two members came to me without the bar——the remainder is lost     benjamin franklin    january      london samuel franklin ccccxxvi to samuel franklin london    january      dear cousin— i received your kind letter of november  th and rejoice to hear of the continued welfare of you and your good wife and four daughters i hope they will all get good husbands i dare say they will be educated so as to deserve them i knew a wise old man who used to advise his young friends to choose wives out of a bunch for where there were many daughters he said they improved each other and from emulation acquired more accomplishments knew more could do more and were not spoiled by parental fondness as single children often are yours have my best wishes and blessing if that can be of any value i received a very polite letter from your friend mr bowen relating to the print please to present him my respectful compliments i am just returned from a long journey your affectionate cousin b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london ezra stiles ccccxxvii to ezra stiles london    january      dear sir— there is lately published in paris a work entitled zendavesta ouvrage de zoroastre contenant les idées théologiques physiques et morales de ce législateur les cérémonies du culte religieux     quil a établi et plusieurs traits importans relatifs à lancienne histoire des parses traduit en françois sur loriginal zend avec des remarques et accompagné de plusieurs traités propres à éclaircir les matières qui en sont lobjet par m anquetil du perron de lacadémie royale des inscriptions et belleslettres et interprète du roy pour les langues orientales it is in two volumes quarto near half the work is an account of the authors travels in india and his residence among the parses during several years to learn their languages i have cast my eye over the religious part it seems to contain a nice morality mixed with abundance of prayers ceremonies and observances if you desire to have it i will procure it for you there is no doubt of its being a genuine translation of the books at present deemed sacred as the writings of zoroaster by his followers but perhaps some of them are of later date though ascribed to him for to me there seems too great a quantity and variety of ceremonies and prayers to be directed at once by one man in the romish church they have increased gradually in the course of ages to their present bulk those who added new ones from time to time found it necessary to give them authority by pretences of their antiquity the books of moses indeed if all written by him which some doubt are an exception to this observation with great esteem i am ever dear sir c b franklin     benjamin franklin    january      london deborah franklin ccccxxviii to mrs deborah franklin london    january      my dear child— i have written several short letters to you lately promising to write more fully by captain falconer which i now sit down to do with a number of your favors before me i take notice of the considerable sums you have paid i would not have you send me any receipts i am satisfied with the accounts you give i am much pleased with your little histories of our grandson and happy in thinking how much amusement he must afford you i pray that god may continue him to us and to his parents mr bache is about retiring his behaviour here has been very agreeable to me i have advised him to settle down to business in philadelphia where i hope he will meet with success i mentioned to you before that i saw his mother and sisters at preston who are very genteel and agreeable people i received your young neighbour haddocks silk and carried it to her relations who live very well keeping a linendrapers shop in bishopsgate street they have a relation in spitalfields that is a manufacturer who i believe will do it well i shall honor much every young lady that i find on my return dressed in silk of her own raising i thank you for the sauceboats and am pleased to find so good a progress made in the china manufactory i wish it success most heartily mrs stevenson too loves to hear about your little     boy her own grandson and my godson is a fine child now nine months old he has an attentive observing sagacious look as if he had a great deal of sense but as yet he is not enough acquainted with our language to express it intelligently his mother nurses him herself for which i much esteem her as it is rather unfashionable here where numbers of little innocents suffer and perish his name is william the squirrels came safe and well you will see by the enclosed how welcome they were a hundred thanks are sent for them and i thank you for the readiness with which you executed the commission the buckwheat and indian meal are come safe and good they will be a great refreshment to me this winter for since i cannot be in america every thing that comes from thence comforts me a little as being something like home the dried peaches too are excellent those dried without their skins the parcel in their skins are not so good the apples are the best i ever had and came with the least damage the sturgeon you mention did not come but that is not so material i hope our cousin fisher will do well among us he seems a sober wellinclined man and when i saw him in birmingham he appeared to be well respected by his relations and friends an active lively industrious wife would be a good thing for him i sent you from ireland a fine piece of the holland of that country captain all whom i met with there found a captain whom he knew who promised to take care of it and deliver it safe you mention nothing of it in your letter of december  d when in the common     course you ought to have had it before that time which makes me fear it is lost i wrote to you from dublin and from glasgow in scotland i was in ireland about seven weeks in scotland about four weeks absent from london in all more than three months my tour was a very pleasant one i received abundance of civilities from the gentry of both kingdoms and my health is improved by the air and exercise i have advised mr bache to deal only in the readymoney way though he should sell less it is the safest and the most easy manner of carrying on business i have given him two hundred pounds sterling to add something to his cargo my love to our dear sally your affectionate husband b franklin benjamin franklin    january      london sarah bache ccccxxix to mrs sarah bache london    january      dear sally— i met with mr bache at preston where i stayed two or three days being very kindly entertained by his mother and sisters whom i liked much he came to town with me and is now going home to you i have advised him to settle down to business in philadelphia where he will always be with you i am of opinion that almost any profession a man has been educated in is preferable to an office held at pleasure as rendering him more independent more a free man and less subject to the caprices of superiors and i think that in keeping a     store if it be where you dwell you can be serviceable to him as your mother was to me for you are not deficient in capacity and i hope you are not too proud you might easily learn accounts and you can copy letters or write them very well upon occasion by industry and frugality you may get forward in the world being both of you yet young and then what we may leave you at our death will be a pretty addition though of itself far from sufficient to maintain and bring up a family it is of more importance for you to think seriously of this as you may have a number of children to educate till my return you need be at no expense for rent as you are all welcome to continue with your mother and indeed it seems to be your duty to attend her as she grows infirm and takes much delight in your company and the childs this saving will be a help in your progress and for your encouragement i can assure you that there is scarce a merchant of opulence in your town whom i do not remember a young beginner with as little to go on with and no better prospects than mr bache i hope you will attend to what is recommended to you in this letter it proceeding from sincere affection after due consideration with the knowledge i have of the world and my own circumstances i am much pleased with the account i receive from all hands of your dear little boy i hope he will be continued a blessing to us all it is a pleasure to me that the little things i sent you proved agreeable i am ever my dear sally your affectionate father b franklin  00 benjamin franklin  0 january      london william franklin ccccxxx to william franklin london  0 january      my dear son— in your last you mention some complaisance of lord hillsborough towards you that showed a disposition to be on better terms his behaviour to me in ireland corresponds exactly we met first at the lord lieutenants mr jackson and i were invited to dine there and when we came we were shown into a room where lord hillsborough was alone he was extremely civil wonderfully so to me whom he had not long before abused to mr strahan as a factious turbulent fellow always in mischief a republican enemy to the kings service and what not he entered very frankly into conversation with us both and invited us both to stop at his house in hillsborough as we should travel northward and urged it in so polite a manner that we could not avoid saying that we would wait on him if we went that way in my own mind i was determined not to go that way but mr jackson thought himself obliged to call on his lordship considering the connexion his office forms between them his lordship dined with us at the lord lieutenants there were at the table the lord chancellor the speaker and all the great officers of state he drank my health and was otherwise particularly civil he went from dublin some days before us   0  at dublin we saw and were entertained by both parties the courtiers and the patriots the latter treated me with particular respect we were admitted to sit among the members of the commons house mr jackson as member of the british parliament and i as member of some british parliament in america the speaker proposed it on my behalf with some very obliging expressions of respect for my character and was answered by the house with a unanimous aye of consent when two members came out to me led me in between them and placed me honorably and commodiously i hope our assemblies will not fall short of them in this politeness if any irish member should happen to be in our country in scotland i spent five days with lord kames at his seat blair drummond near stirling two or three days at glasgow two days at carron iron works and the rest of the month in and about edinburgh lodging at david humes who entertained me with the greatest kindness and hospitality as did lord kames and his lady all our old acquaintances there sir alexander dick and lady mr mcgowan drs robertson cullen black ferguson russel and others inquired affectionately of your welfare i was out three months and the journey was evidently of great service to my health mr bache had some views of obtaining an office in america but i dissuaded him from the application as i could not appear in it and rather wish to see all i am connected with in an independent situation supported by their own industry i therefore advised him to lay out the money he brought with him in  0  goods return and sit down to business in philadelphia selling for ready money only in which way i think he might by quick returns get forward in the world it would have been wrong for sally to leave her mother besides incurring the expense of such a voyage i cast my eye over goddards piece against our friend mr galloway and then lit my fire with it i think such feeble malicious attacks cannot hurt him the resolution of the board of trade to admit for the future no agents to appear before them but such as are appointed by concurrent act of the whole legislature will i think put an end to agencies as i apprehend the assemblies will think agents under the ministerial influence that must arise from such appointments cannot be of much use in their colony affairs in truth i think the agents as now appointed of as much use to the government here as to the colonies that send them having often prevented its going into mistaken measures through misinformation that must have been very inconvenient to itself and would have prevented more of the same kind if they had been attended to witness the stamp and duty acts i believe therefore we shall conclude to leave this omniscient infallible minister to his own devices and be no longer at the expense of sending any agent whom he can displace by a repeal of the appointing act i am sure i should not like to be an agent in such a suspicious situation and shall therefore decline serving under every such appointment your assembly may avoid the dispute you seem apprehensive of by leaving the appointment of an  0  agent out of the support bill or rather i should say the sum for his salary the money in my hands will pay him who ever he is for two or three years in which the measure and the minister may be changed in the meantime by working with a friend who has great influence at the board he can serve the province as effectually as by an open reception and appearance our friend sir john pringle put into my hands the other day a letter from mr bowman seeming i thought a good deal pleased with the notice you had taken of his recommendation i send you a copy of it that you may see the man has a grateful disposition temple has been at home with us during the christmas vacation from school he improves continually and more and more engages the regard of all that are acquainted with him by his pleasing sensible manly behaviour i have of late great debates with myself whether or not i shall continue here any longer i grow homesick and being now in my sixtyseventh year i begin to apprehend some infirmity of age may attack me and make my return impracticable i have also some important affairs to settle before my death a period i ought now to think cannot be far distant i see here no disposition in parliament to meddle farther in colony affairs for the present either to lay more duties or to repeal any and i think though i were to return again i may be absent from here a year without any prejudice to the business i am engaged in though it is not probable that being once at home i should ever again see england i have indeed so many  0  good kind friends here that i could spend the remainder of my life among them with great pleasure if it were not for my american connexions and the indelible affection i retain for that dear country from which i have so long been in a state of exile my love to betsey i am ever your affectionate father b franklin ccccxxxi mayz or indian corn it is remarked in north america that the english farmers when they first arrive there finding a soil and climate proper for the husbandry they have been accustomed to and particularly suitable for raising wheat they despise and neglect the culture of mayz or indian corn but observing the advantage it affords their neighbours the older inhabitants they by degrees get more and more into the practice of raising it and the face of the country shows from time to time that the culture of that grain goes on visibly augmenting the inducements are the many different ways in which it may be prepared so as to afford a wholesome and pleasing nourishment to men and other animals  st the family can begin to make use of it before the time of full harvest for the tender green ears stripped of their leaves and roasted by a quick fire till the grain is brown and eaten with a little salt or butter are a delicacy  dly when the grain is ripe and harder the ears boiled in their  0  leaves and eaten with butter are also good and agreeable food the tender green grains dried may be kept all the year and mixed with green haricots  also dried make at any time a pleasing dish being first soaked some hours in water and then boiled when the grain is ripe and hard there are also several ways of using it one is to soak it all night in a lessive or lye and then pound it in a large wooden mortar with a wooden pestle the skin of each grain is by that means skinned off and the farinaceous part left whole which being boiled swells into a white soft pulp and eaten with milk or with butter and sugar is delicious  the dry grain is also sometimes ground loosely so as to be broke into pieces of the size of rice and being winnowed to separate the bran it is then boiled and eaten with turkeys or other fowls as rice ground into a finer meal they make of it by boiling a hastypudding or bouilli to be eaten with milk or with butter and sugar this resembles what the italians call polenta they make of the same meal with water and salt a hasty cake which being stuck against a hoe or other flat iron is placed erect before the fire and so baked to be used as bread broth is also agreeable thickened with the same meal they also parch it in this manner an iron pot is filled with sand and set on the fire till the sand is very hot two or three pounds of the grain are then thrown in and well mixed with the sand by stirring each grain bursts and throws out  0  a white substance of twice its bigness the sand is separated by a wire sieve and returned into the pot to be again heated and repeat the operation with fresh grain that which is parched is pounded to a powder in mortars this being sifted will keep long for use an indian will travel far and subsist long on a small bag of it taking only six or eight ounces of it per day mixed with water the flour of mayz mixed with that of wheat makes excellent bread sweeter and more agreeable than that of wheat alone to feed horses it is good to soak the grain twelve hours they mash it easier with their teeth and it yields them more nourishment the leaves stripped off the stalks after the grain is ripe and tied up in bundles when dry are excellent forage for horses cows c the stalks pressed like sugarcane yield a sweet juice which being fermented and distilled yields an excellent spirit boiled without fermentation it affords a pleasant syrup in mexico fields are sown with it thick that multitudes of small stalks may arise which being cut from time to time like asparagus are served in desserts and their sweet juice extracted in the mouth by chewing them the meal wetted is excellent food for young chickens and the whole grain for grown fowls   0  ccccxxxii precautions to be used by those who are about to undertake a sea voyage when you intend to take a long voyage nothing is better than to keep it a secret till the moment of your departure without this you will be continually interrupted and tormented by visits from friends and acquaintances who not only make you lose your valuable time but make you forget a thousand things which you wish to remember so that when you are embarked and fairly at sea you recollect with much uneasiness affairs which you have not terminated accounts that you have not settled and a number of things which you proposed to carry with you and which you find the want of every moment would it not be attended with the best consequences to reform such a custom and to suffer a traveller without deranging him to make his preparations in quietness to set apart a few days when these are finished to take leave of his friends and to receive their good wishes for his happy return it is not always in ones power to choose a captain  0  though great part of the pleasure and happiness of the passage depends upon this choice and though one must for a time be confined to his company and be in some measure under his command if he is a social sensible man obliging and of a good disposition you will be so much the happier one sometimes meets with people of this description but they are not common however if yours be not of this number if he be a good seaman attentive careful and active in the management of his vessel you must dispense with the rest for these are essential qualities whatever right you may have by your agreement with him to the provisions he has taken on board for the use of the passengers it is always proper to have some private store which you may make use of occasionally you ought therefore to provide good water that of the ship being often bad but you must put it into bottles without which you cannot expect to preserve it sweet you ought also to carry with you good tea ground coffee chocolate wine of that sort which you like best cider dried raisins almonds sugar capillaire citrons rum eggs dipped in oil portable soup bread twice baked with regard to poultry it is almost useless to carry any with you unless you resolve to undertake the office of feeding and fattening them yourself with the little care which is taken of them on board ship they are almost all sickly and their flesh is as tough as leather all sailors entertain an opinion which has undoubtedly originated formerly from a want of water and when it has been found necessary to be sparing of it that poultry never know when they have drunk  0  enough and that when water is given them at discretion they generally kill themselves by drinking beyond measure in consequence of this opinion they give them water only once in two days and even then in small quantities but as they pour this water into troughs inclining on one side which occasions it to run to the lower part it thence happens that they are obliged to mount one upon the back of another in order to reach it and there are some which cannot even dip their beaks in it thus continually tantilized and tormented by thirst they are unable to digest their food which is very dry and they soon fall sick and die some of them are found thus every morning and are thrown into the sea whilst those which are killed for the table are scarcely fit to be eaten to remedy this inconvenience it will be necessary to divide their troughs into small compartments in such a manner that each of them may be capable of containing water but this is seldom or never done on this account sheep and hogs are to be considered as the best fresh provision that one can have at sea mutton there being in general very good and pork excellent it may happen that some of the provisions and stores which i have recommended may become almost useless by the care which the captain has taken to lay in a proper stock but in such a case you may dispose of it to relieve the poor passengers who paying less for their passage are stowed among the common sailors and have no right to the captains provisions except such part of them as is used for feeding the crew these passengers are sometimes   0 sick melancholy and dejected and there are often women and children among them neither of whom have any opportunity of procuring those things which i have mentioned and of which perhaps they have the greatest need by distributing amongst them a part of your superfluity you may be of the greatest assistance to them you may restore their health save their lives and in short render them happy which always affords the liveliest sensation to a feeling mind the most disagreeable thing at sea is the cookery for there is not properly speaking any professional cook on board the worse sailor is generally chosen for that purpose who for the most part is equally dirty hence comes the proverb used among the english sailors that god sends meat and the devil sends cooks those however who have a better opinion of providence will think otherwise knowing that sea air and the exercise or motion which they receive from the rolling of the ship have a wonderful effect in whetting the appetite they will say that providence has given sailors bad cooks to prevent them from eating too much or that knowing they would have bad cooks has given them a good appetite to prevent them from dying with hunger however if you have no confidence in those succours of providence you may yourself with a lamp and a boiler by the help of a little spirits of wine prepare some food such as soup hash c a small oven made of tinplate is not a bad piece of furniture your servant may roast in it a piece of mutton or pork if you are ever tempted to eat salt beef which is often     very good you will find that cider is the best liquor to quench the thirst generally caused by salt meat or salt fish sea biscuit which is too hard for the teeth of some people may be softened by steeping it but bread doublebaked is the best for being made of good loafbread cut into slices and baked a second time it readily imbibes water becomes soft and is easily digested it consequently forms excellent nourishment much superior to that of biscuit which has not been fermented i must here observe that this doublebaked bread was originally the real biscuit prepared to keep at sea for the word biscuit in french signifies twice baked pease often boil badly and do not become soft in such case by putting a twopound shot into the kettle the rolling of the vessel by means of this bullet will convert the pease into a kind of porridge like mustard having often seen soup when put upon the table at sea in broad flat dishes thrown out on every side by the rolling of the vessel i have wished that our tinmen would make our soupbasins with divisions or compartments forming small plates proper for containing soup for one person only by this disposition the soup in an extraordinary roll would not be thrown out of the plate and would not fall into the breast of those who are at table and scald them having entertained you with these things of little importance permit me now to conclude with some general reflections upon navigation when navigation is employed only for transporting necessary provisions from one country where     they abound to another where they are wanting when by this it prevents famines which were so frequent and so fatal before it was invented and became so common we cannot help considering it as one of those arts which contribute most to the happiness of mankind but when it is employed to transport things of no utility or articles merely of luxury it is then uncertain whether the advantages resulting from it are sufficient to counterbalance the misfortunes it occasions by exposing the lives of so many individuals upon the vast ocean and when it is used to plunder vessels and transport slaves it is evidently only the dreadful means of increasing those calamities which afflict human nature one is astonished to think on the number of vessels and men who are daily exposed in going to bring tea from china coffee from arabia and sugar and tobacco from america all commodities which our ancestors lived very well without the sugar trade employs nearly a thousand vessels and that of tobacco almost the same number with regard to the utility of tobacco little can be said and with regard to sugar how much more meritorious would it be to sacrifice the momentary pleasure which we receive from drinking it once or twice a day in our tea than to encourage the numberless cruelties that are continually exercised in order to procure it us a celebrated french moralist said that when he considered the wars which we foment in africa to get negroes the great number who of course perish in these wars the multitude of those wretches who die in their passage by disease bad air and bad provisions     and lastly how many perish by the cruel treatment they meet with in a state of slavery when he saw a bit of sugar he could not help imagining it to be covered with spots of human blood but had he added to these considerations the wars which we carry on against one another to take and retake the islands that produce this commodity he would not have seen the sugar simply spotted with blood he would have beheld it entirely tinged with it these wars make the maritime powers of europe and the inhabitants of paris and london pay much dearer for their sugar than those of vienna though they are almost three hundred leagues distant from the sea a pound of sugar indeed costs the former not only the price which they give for it but also what they pay in taxes necessary to support the fleets and armies which serve to defend and protect the countries that produce it ccccxxxiii toleration in old england and new england  sir— i understand from the public papers that in the debates on the bill for relieving the dissenters in the point of subscription to the church articles sundry reflections were thrown out against that people importing that they themselves are of a persecuting intolerant spirit for that when they had the superiority they persecuted the church and still persecute it in america where they compel its members     to pay taxes for maintaining the presbyterian or independent worship and at the same time refuse them a toleration in the full exercise of their religion by the administrations of a bishop if we look back into history for the character of the present sects in christianity we shall find few that have not in their turns been persecutors and complainers of persecution the primitive christians thought persecution extremely wrong in the pagans but practised it on one another the first protestants of the church of england blamed persecution in the romish church but practised it against the puritans these found it wrong in the bishops but fell into the same practice themselves both here and in new england to account for this we should remember that the doctrine of toleration was not then known or had not prevailed in the world persecution was therefore not so much the fault of the sect as of the times it was not in those days deemed wrong in itself the general opinion was only that those who are in error ought not to persecute the truth but the possessors of truth were in the right to persecute error in order to destroy it thus every sect believing itself possessed of all truth and that every tenet differing from theirs was error conceived that when the power was in their hands persecution was a duty required of them by that god whom they supposed to be offended with heresy by degrees more moderate and more modest sentiments have taken place in the christian world and among protestants particularly all disclaim persecution none vindicate it and but few practise it we should     then cease to reproach each other with what was done by our ancestors but judge of the present character of sects or churches by their present conduct only now to determine on the justice of this charge against the present dissenters particularly those in america let us consider the following facts they went from england to establish a new country for themselves at their own expense where they might enjoy the free exercise of religion in their own way when they had purchased the territory of the natives they granted the lands out in townships requiring for it neither purchasemoney nor quitrent but this condition only to be complied with that the freeholders should for ever support a gospel minister meaning probably one of the governing sects and a freeschool within the township thus what is commonly called presbyterianism became the established religion of that country all went on well in this way while the same religious opinions were general the support of minister and school being raised by a proportionate tax on the lands but in process of time some becoming quakers  some baptists     and of late years some returning to the church of england through the laudable endeavours and a proper application  of their funds by the society for propagating the gospel objections were made to the payment of a tax appropriated to the support of a church they disapproved and had forsaken the civil magistrates however continued for a time to collect and apply the tax according to the original laws which remained in force and they did it more freely as thinking it just and equitable that the holders of land should pay what was contracted to be paid when they were granted as the only consideration for the grant and what had been considered by all subsequent purchasers as a perpetual incumbrance on the estate bought therefore at a proportionably cheaper rate a payment which it was thought no honest man ought to avoid under the pretence of his having changed his religious persuasion and this i suppose is one of the best grounds of demanding tithes of dissenters now in england but the practice being clamored against by the episcopalians as persecution the legislature of the province of massachusetts bay near thirty years since passed an act for their relief requiring indeed the tax to be paid as usual but directing that the several sums levied from members of the church of england should be paid over to the minister of that church with whom such members usually attended divine worship which minister had power     given him to receive and on occasion to recover the same by law it seems that the legislature considered the end of the tax was to secure and improve the morals of the people and promote their happiness by supporting among them the public worship of god and the preaching of the gospel that where particular people fancied a particular mode that mode might probably therefore be of most use to those people and that if the good was done it was not so material in what mode or by whom it was done the consideration that their brethren the dissenters in england were still compelled to pay tithes to the clergy of the church had not weight enough with the legislature to prevent this moderate act which still continues in full force and i hope no uncharitable conduct of the church towards the dissenters will ever provoke them to repeal it with regard to a bishop i know not upon what grounds the dissenters either here or in america are charged with refusing the benefit of such an officer to the church in that country here they seem to have naturally no concern in the affair there they have no power to prevent it if government should think fit to send one they would probably dislike indeed to see an order of men established among them from whose persecutions their fathers fled into that wilderness and whose future domination they may possibly fear not knowing that their natures are changed but the nonappointment of bishops for america seems to arise from another quarter the same wisdom of government probably     that prevents the sitting of convocations and forbids by noliprosequis the persecution of dissenters for nonsubscription avoids establishing bishops where the minds of the people are not yet prepared to receive them cordially lest the public peace should be endangered  and now let us see how this persecution account stands between the parties in new england where the legislative bodies are almost to a man dissenters from the church of england—   there is no test to prevent churchmen from holding offices   the sons of churchmen have the full benefit of the universities   the taxes for support of public worship when paid by churchmen are given to the episcopal minister in old england—   dissenters are excluded from all offices of profit and honor   the benefits of education in the universities are appropriated to the sons of churchmen   the clergy of the dissenters receive none of the tithes paid by their people who must be at the additional charge of maintaining their own separate worship     but is it said the dissenters of america oppose the introduction of a bishop in fact it is not alone the dissenters there that give opposition if not encouraging must be termed opposing but the laity in general dislike the project and some even of the clergy the inhabitants of virginia are almost all episcopalians the church is fully established there and the council and general assembly are perhaps to a man its members yet when lately at a meeting of the clergy a resolution was taken to apply for a bishop against which several however protested the assembly of the province at their next meeting expressed their disapprobation of the thing in the strongest manner by unanimously ordering the thanks of the house to the protesters for many of the american laity of the church think it some advantage whether their own young men come to england for ordination and improve themselves at the same time with the learned here or the congregations are supplied by englishmen who have had the benefit of education in english universities and are ordained before they come abroad they do not therefore see the necessity of a bishop merely for ordination and confirmation is deemed among them a ceremony of no very great importance since few seek it in england where bishops are in plenty these sentiments prevail with many churchmen there not to promote a design which they think must sooner or later saddle them with great expenses to support it as to the dissenters their minds might probably be more conciliated to the measure if the bishops here should in their wisdom and goodness think fit to set   0 their sacred character in a more friendly light by dropping their opposition to the dissenters application for relief in subscription and declaring their willingness that dissenters should be capable of offices enjoy the benefit of education in the universities and the privilege of appropriating their tithes to the support of their own clergy in all these points of toleration they appear far behind the present dissenters of new england and it may seem to some a step below the dignity of bishops to follow the example of such inferiors i do not however despair of their doing it some time or other since nothing of the kind is too hard for true christian humility i am sir yours c a new england man benjamin franklin   february      london john foxcroft ccccxxxiv to john foxcroft london   february      dear friend— i have written two or three small letters to you since my return from ireland and scotland mr todd has not yet shown me that which you wrote to him about the new colony though he mentioned it and will let me see it i suppose when i call on him  i told you in one of mine that he has advanced for your share what has been paid by others though i was ready to do it and shall in the whole affair take the same care of your interest as of my own     you take notice that mr whartons friends will not allow me any merit in this transaction but insist the whole is owing to his superior abilities it is a common error in friends when they would extol their friend to make comparisons and to depreciate the merits of others it was not necessary for his friends to do so in this case mr wharton will in truth have a good deal of merit in the affair if it succeeds he having been exceedingly active and industrious in soliciting it and in drawing up memorials and papers to support the application and remove objections but though i have not been equally active it not being thought proper that i should appear much in the solicitation since i became a little obnoxious to the ministry on account of my letters to america yet i suppose my advice may have been thought of some use since it has been asked on every step and i believe that being longer and better known here than mr wharton i may have lent some weight to his negotiations by joining in the affair from the greater confidence men are apt to place in one they know than in a stranger however as i neither ask nor expect any particular consideration for any service i may have done and only think i ought to escape censure i shall not enlarge on this invidious topic let us all do our endeavours in our several capacities for the common service and if one has the ability or opportunity of doing more for his friends than another let him think that a happiness and be satisfied the business is not yet quite completed and as many things may happen between the cup     and the lip perhaps there may be nothing of this kind for friends to dispute about for if nobody should receive any benefit there would be no scrambling for the honor in yours from new york of july  d you mentioned your intention of purchasing a bill to send hither as soon as you returned home from your journey i have not since received any from you which i only take notice of that if you have sent any you may not blame me for not acknowledging the receipt of it in mine of april  0th i explained to you what i had before mentioned that in settling our private accounts i had paid you the sum of three hundred and eightynine pounds or thereabouts in my own wrong having before paid it for you to the general postoffice i hope that since you have received your books and looked over the accounts you are satisfied of this i am anxious for your answer upon it the sum being too large to be left long without an adjustment i am c b franklin benjamin franklin   february      london cadwallader evans ccccxxxv to cadwallader evans london   february      dear doctor— the trunks of silk were detained at the customhouse till very lately first because of the holidays and then waiting to get two persons skilful in silk to make a valuation of it in order to     ascertain the bounty as soon as that was done and the trunks brought to my house i waited on dr fothergill to request he would come and see it opened and consult about disposing of it which he could not do till last thursday on examining it we found that the valuers had opened all the parcels in order we suppose to see the quality of each had neglected to make them up again and the directions and marks were lost except that from mr parke and that of the second crop so that we could not find which was intended for the queen and which for the proprietary family then being no judges ourselves we concluded to get mr patterson or some other skilful person to come and pick out six pounds of the best for her majesty and four pounds for each of the other ladies this i have endeavoured but it is not yet done though i hourly expect it mr boydell broker for the ship attended the customhouse to obtain the valuation and had a great deal of trouble to get it managed i have not since seen him nor heard the sum they reported but hope to give you all the particulars by the next ship which i understand sails in about a fortnight when dr fothergill and myself are to write a joint letter to the committee to whom please to present my respects and assure them of my most faithful services i am charmed with the sight of such a quantity the second year and have great hopes the produce will now be established the second crop silk seems to me not inferior to the others and if it is practicable with us to have two crops and the second season does not interfere too much with other business in the farming     way i think it will be a great addition to the profits as well as to the quantity dr fothergill has a number of chinese drawings of which some represent the process of raising silk from the beginning to the end i am to call at his house and assist in looking them out he intending to send them as a present to the silk company i have now only time to add that i am ever yours very affectionately b franklin      david hume   february      edinburgh benjamin franklin ccccxxxvi from david hume to b franklin edinburgh   february      dear sir— i was very glad to hear of your safe arrival in london after being exposed to as many perils as st paul by land and by water though to no perils among false brethren for the good wishes of all your brother philosophers in this place attend you heartily and sincerely together with much regret that your business would not allow you to pass more time among them brother lin expects to see you soon before he takes his little trip round the world you have heard no doubt of that project the circumstances of the affair could not be more honorable for him nor could the honor be conferred on one who deserves it more i really believe with the french author of whom you have favored me with an extract that the circumstance of my being a scotchman has been a considerable objection to me so factious is this country i expected in entering on my literary course that all the christians all the whigs and all the     tories should be my enemies but it is hard that all the english irish and welsh should be also against me the scotch likewise cannot be much my friends as no man is a prophet in his own country however it is some consolation that i can bear up my head under all this prejudice i fancy that i must have recourse to america for justice you told me i think that your countrymen in that part of the world intended to do me the honor of giving an edition of my writings and you promised that you should recommend to them to follow the last edition which is in the press i now use the freedom of reminding you of it pray make my compliments to sir john pringle and tell him how much i wish for his company and be so good as to give him a description of the house i reserve for him in the square if you really go over to america we hope you will not grudge us sir john as a legacy i am dear sir with great truth and regard your most obedient humble servant david hume benjamin franklin    april      london thomas cushing ccccxxxvii to thomas cushing london    april      sir— i wrote to you in january last a long letter by meyrick and at the same time wrote to the committee since which i have received no line from any one in boston nor has mr bollan yet received the answer we wait for respecting the eastern settlements on the crown land     the parliament has been employed in the royal marriage bill and other business nothing of importance relating to america has been mentioned hitherto during the session and it is thought that india affairs will fill up the remainder of the time to the prorogation i have not met with lord hillsborough since my return from ireland seeing no use at present in attending his levees the papers mentioned his intention of moving something in the house of lords relating to america but i cannot learn there was any truth in it it is my present purpose to return home this summer in which case i suppose i am to leave your business and papers in the hands of mr lee which i shall do if i do not receive other directions upon the present plan here of admitting no agent but such as governors shall approve of from year to year and of course none but such as the ministry approves of i do not conceive that agents can be of much use to you and therefore i suppose you would rather decline appointing any in my opinion they have at all times been of full as much service to government here as to the colonies from whence they come and might still be so if properly attended to in preventing by their better information those disgraceful blunders of government that arise from its ignorance of our situation circumstances abilities temper c such as the stamp act which too would have been prevented if the agents had been regarded therefore i should think that if agents can be allowed here on no other footing than is now proposed we should omit     sending any and leave the crown when it wants our aids or would transact business with us to send its minister to the colonies be pleased to present my respects to the committee and duty to the assembly and believe me with sincere esteem c b franklin benjamin franklin  0 april      london m le roy ccccxxxviii to m le roy london  0 april      dear sir— i received your favor of march  th by m dazeux and shall be glad of any opportunity of doing him service it gave me great pleasure to learn by him that you are well and happily married on which i give you joy it is after all the most natural state of man mr west our president concering whom you make inquiry is esteemed a good antiquarian but has not distinguished himself in any other branch of science he is a member of parliament was formerly secretary to the treasury and is very rich  i am glad to hear that a voyage is intended from france to the north pole the world owes much to the noble spirit with which your nation pursues     the improvement of knowledge and to the liberality with which you communicate what you acquire to the rest of mankind i hope your philosophers on this voyage will be able to discover more clearly the cause of the aurora borealis and a passage round the north of america i suppose care has been taken to make their ships very strong that they may bear thumping among the ice my best wishes will attend them for their success and safe return messrs banks and solander are to sail with two ships in about a fortnight for the south they expect to be out near four years they present their compliments and are pleased with the notice you honor them with in your letter to me sir john pringle continues well and presents his respectful compliments to you i am with the most perfect esteem dear sir yours c b franklin benjamin franklin   may      london joseph priestley ccccxxxix to joseph priestley london   may      dear sir— i think with you that there cannot be the least occasion for my explaining your method of impregnating water with fixed air to messrs banks and solander as they were present and i suppose are as well acquainted with it as myself however i shall readily do it if they think it necessary i am glad you intend to improve and publish the process   0 you must go half an inch farther with your spark to exceed what i showed here with my philadelphia machine in      to lord charles cavendish and others who judged them to be nine inches my cushion was of buckskin with a long damp flap and had a wire from it through the window down to the iron rails in the yard the conductor of tin four feet long and about four inches diameter so powerful a machine had then never been seen in england before as they were pleased to tell me a machine was made from mine for mr timmer and was afterwards in the possession of lord morton a more convenient construction i have never since seen except that of yours i intend soon to repeat barettis experiments being provided with the requisites and shall let you know the result i should be glad to see the french translation of your book can you conveniently lend it to me when you have perused it i fancy it was translated at the request of abbé nollet by a friend and disciple of his as i know there was one whose name i have forgotten that used to translate for him extracts of english electrical books the abbés machine was a very bad one requiring three persons to make the smallest experiment one to turn the great wheel and one to hold hands on the globe and the effect after all was but weak de lor had a similar one and invited me to see him exhibit to the duchess of rochefoucauld but the weather being a little warm he could perform nothing scarce obtaining a spark this inconvenience must have occasioned his making     fewer experiments and of course his not being so easily convinced m le roy however got early possession of the truth and combated for it with nollet yet i think the academy rather favored the latter le roy will i suppose now confute this translator for i have just seen a letter of his to mr magalhaens thanking him for sending so excellent an electrical machine to france it is one of the plate ones which he has improved so as to produce the positive and negative electricities separately or together at the same time de façon says he quon peut faire toutes les expériences possibles sur lune ou lautre de ces deux électricités enfin on étoit si eloigné de connoître les phénomènes de ces deux électricités ici faute de machines commodes de les demontrer que beaucoup des gens ont été étonnés de voir avec quelle évidence ils établissent la distinction des ces deux électricités c this letter is of the  th instant my best wishes attend you and yours i am ever with great respect my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin

ireland is got safe into antigua i hope you will now     get the little token i sent you from thence i have not received the letter you mention to have given the young scotchman nor that from mr craige i am sorry for the disorder that has fallen on our friend kinnersley but hope he will get the better of it i thank you for your advice about putting back a fit of the gout i shall never attempt such a thing indeed i have not much occasion to complain of the gout having had but two slight fits since i came last to england i hope mr bache is with you and his family by this time as he sailed from the downs the latter end of february my love to him and sally and young master who i suppose is master of the house tell him that billy hewson is as much thought of here as he can be there was weaned last saturday loves music comes to see his grandmother and will be lifted up to knock at the door himself as he has done while i was writing this at the request of mrs stevenson who sends her love as sally does her duty thanks to god i continue well and am as ever your affectionate husband b franklin      benjamin franklin    may      major dawson ccccxli to major dawson engineer  craven street    may      sir— having visited yesterday as you desired the powder magazines at purfleet in order to see how they may be protected against danger from lightning i think—   that all the iron bars which pass down along the arches from the top to the place where the powder is deposited should be removed as they now constitute with the brass hoops with which the casks are bound an imperfect conductor imperfect in proportion to the greater or less height to which the casks are piled but in any case such that they can only serve to attract towards the powder the first stroke that falls upon the arch and that they are consequently very dangerous   that the building which has a leaden coping along the ridge from one end to the other may be secured by means of a pointed iron rod carried up near each end communicating with this coping and extending through the rock of chalk which serves as the foundation of the building till it meets with water this rod should be at least an inch in diameter that it may be more durable and afford the lightning a more free course through its substance and it should be painted to preserve it from rust its upper extremity should be carried ten feet above the     summit of the roof and taper off gradually till it ends in a sharp point and the better to preserve this point the last six inches should be of brass because it is less liable to become blunted by rust if the rod cannot well be made entirely of a single piece the different pieces composing it should be strongly screwed together or into one another very closely with a thin plate of lead between the joints in order to render the junction or continuation of the metal more perfect after all the electrical experiments that i have made in reference to this subject and all the examples that have come to my knowledge of the effects of lightning on these conductors it seems to me that provided they are good and perfect carried down till water or very moist ground is reached they are equally safe whether placed directly against the wall and secured by staples driven into it or whether supported by a pole or staff planted in the ground at some distance from the wall the former is the better rod as the rod can be bent to avoid the windows or doors which are situated directly below the summit of the roof yet as certain apprehensions may be more effectually set at rest by supporting the rods in the other manner i should make no objection to this provided that they can be suitably placed without interfering with any passage and that they are so firmly fixed that the wind cannot by causing them to vibrate interrupt the communication of iron or lead between the side of the rod and the lead that covers the ridge   as i am informed that the roofs of the other four buildings are to be reconstructed after the model     of that of which i have just been speaking the same method may be followed with regard to them when they are finished in this manner but if it be asked how they may be rendered secure in the meantime i would advise that as their roofs are now of a different form being hiproofs with four corners and the joining at their corners as well as their ridgepieces having a coping of lead which extends to the gutters the passages which it is proposed to carry down till water is reached be bored or dug immediately and that that part of each conductor which is to be carried up from the water as high as the gutters be fixed in them from the top of this conductor i would carry out two arms of iron to the corners of the gutters where the leaden coping of the corners of the roof should be united to the ends of these bars and at the junction of these corners with the ridgepiece i would carry up rods to the height of ten feet pointed as directed above which when a new roof is made could be used for the upper part of a straight conductor i am sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin p s—for that part of the conductor which is to be carried under ground leaden pipes should be used as less liable to rust      joseph priestley   june      leeds benjamin franklin ccccxlii from joseph priestley to b franklin leeds   june      dear sir— you make me very happy by the near prospect of seeing you and sir john pringle at leeds i shall be entirely at liberty to receive you and i hope you will contrive to stay as long as possible in this town and neighbourhood i thank you for the native of new england  i had casually seen the same paper and was particularly struck with it without having any suspicion of poor richard being the author of it i am obliged to you for your advice with respect to the dedication and shall comply with it but some other alterations besides what you noted must be made in it if it be addressed to lord sandwich only i am intent upon the prosecution of my experiments on air and since i wrote to you have observed several remarkable appearances that very extraordinary kind of air which dr hales got from walton pyrites and which i had despaired of procuring i get from all the metals i have yet tried by means of spirit of nitre it is quite transparent but a mixture of it and common air is red for a considerable time in which the whole quantity is greatly reduced in bulk a mixture of this and fixed air is not turbid this air alone is reduced above one half by a mixture of iron filings and brimstone standing in it whereas common     air is diminished only about one fifth in the same process when i have the pleasure of seeing you i shall acquaint you with some other remarkable properties of this new kind of air in the meantime you will do me a very important service by procuring for me and bringing along with you a little of highly concentrated marine acid there is none to be got here and using a weaker sort in the solution of gold i was obliged to apply a considerable degree of heat the consequence of which was that the acid menstruum suddenly boiling my hands face clothes and the walls of the room have been great sufferers by it as i am afraid i shall be able to show you a pennyweight of gold which i had bought for the purpose was also lost as a reward for this damage i preserved about three ounce measures of air extracted from gold which i believe was never seen before and have the prodigious satisfaction of finding that it has the very same properties with that which is produced from copper if i had studied poor richard in time i should not have indulged myself in these expenses but bad habits are not easily corrected if however the passion be not kept up by considerable success frugality and an attention to a growing family will at length get the better of experimenting and then i shall write nothing but politics or divinity to furnish the bishop of llandaff with more quotations for his future invectives against the dissenters the french translation of my history of electricity i borrowed of mr walsh but as it will be of some     use to me in a future edition of my work i think to purchase it in the meantime mr walsh will have no objection to your having it for what time you please and i can give it to you when you are here i am surprised that the french electricians should not have been able to provide themselves with better machines i am confident that plates will never answer so well as globes or cylinders i am with my respectful compliments to sir john pringle dear sir yours sincerely joseph priestley p s—i wish you could bring dr price with you benjamin franklin    june      maseres ccccxliii to mr maseres craven street    june      sir— i thank you for the pamphlets proposing to establish life annuities in parishes c i think it an excellent one in compliance with your wish pages       i send it back with a few marginal notes perhaps of no great importance made in reading it requesting it may be returned to me in page     of dr prices book on annuities  d edition you will find mention made of an institution in holland he had that information from me those houses are handsome neat buildings with very comfortable apartments some form the sides of a square with grassplots and gravel walks flowers c and some have little separate gardens behind     each apartment those for men are called oude mannen huyzen for women oude vrouwen huyzen i think the different kinds sometimes make different sides of the same square there is a chapel for prayers a common kitchen and a common hall in which they dine together two persons such as best like one another and choose so to associate are generally lodged in one apartment though in separate beds that they may be at hand to assist each other in case of sudden illness in the night and otherwise be mutually helpful the directors have also a room to meet in who form rules for the government of the house hear complaints and rectify what is amiss gentlemen are directors of the oude mannen huyzen ladies of the oude vrouwen huyzen a committee of two are chosen every year who visit often see the rules observed and take care of the management at the end of the year these are thanked off and as an honorable memorial of their services their names with the year they served are added to the goldletter list on the walls of the room all the furniture is neat and convenient the beds and rooms kept clean and sweet by the servants of the house and the people appear to live happily these institutions seem calculated to prevent poverty which is rather a better thing than relieving it for it keeps always in the public eye a state of comfort and repose in old age with freedom from care held forth as an encouragement to so much industry and frugality in youth as may at least serve to raise the required sum suppose £ 0 that is to   0 entitle a man or a woman at fifty to a retreat in those houses and in acquiring this sum habits may be acquired that produce such affluence before that age arrives as to make the retreat unnecessary and so never claimed hence if £ 0 would as by your table entitle a man at fifty years of age to an annuity of £      ½ i suppose that in such a house entertainment and accommodations to a much greater value might be afforded him because the right to live there is not transferable and therefore every unclaimed right is an advantage to the house while annuities would probably all be claimed then it seems to me that the prospect of a distant annuity will not be so influencing on the minds of young people as the constant view of the comfort enjoyed in those houses in comparison of which the payment and receipt of the annuities are private transactions i write this in hopes you will after consideration favor me with your opinion whether in addition to your plan which will still have all advantages for smaller sums one or more such houses in every county would not probably be of great use in still farther promoting industry and frugality among the lower people and of course lessening the enormous weight of the poortax i enclose a little piece i wrote in america to encourage and strengthen those important virtues of which i beg your acceptance and am with great esteem sir your most obedient and humble servant b franklin     joseph priestley   july      leeds benjamin franklin ccccxliv from joseph priestley to b franklin leeds   july      dear sir— i presume that by this time you are arrived in london and i am willing to take the first opportunity of informing you that i have never been so busy or so successful in making experiments as since i had the pleasure of seeing you at leeds i have fully satisfied myself that air rendered in the highest degree noxious by breathing is restored by sprigs of mint growing in it you will probably remember the flourishing state in which you saw one of my plants i put a mouse in the air in which it was growing on the saturday after you went away which was seven days after it was put in and it continued in it five minutes without showing any sign of uneasiness and was taken out quite strong and vigorous when a mouse died after being not two seconds in a part of the same original quantity of air which had stood in the same exposure without a plant in it the same mouse also that lived so well in the restored air was barely recoverable after being not more than one second in the other i have also had another instance of a mouse living fourteen minutes without being at all hurt in little more than two ounce measures of another quantity of noxious air in which a plant had grown i have completely ascertained the restoration of air in which tallow or wax candles spirit of wine or brimstonematches have burned out by the same means     the nitrous air which i showed you i found to be an admirable test of air that is fit for breathing it makes this air red and turbid but no other that i have tried i took air in which a mouse had putrified which was in the highest degree noxious and fetid and also a quantity of fixed air the nitrous air admitted to each of these kinds of air separately made no sensible alteration in them but when they were mixed which i discovered to make a wholesome air the nitrous air made the mixture turbid and diminished the bulk of it as in common air though not in the same degree a mouse put into this mixture lived five minutes without uneasiness when if it had been put into either of them separately a few minutes before it would have died in a few seconds air that has passed through hot charcoal has many perhaps all the properties of air that has been diminished by other processes it extinguishes flame kills animals and is not diminished or made turbid by a mixture of nitrous air but the observation that pleases me more than any i ever made is the diminution of air by the crystallization i believe of quicksilver and the nitrous acid this effect both precedes and follows the generation of nitrous air from the same mixture this i suspect to be the case with other crystallizations i have observed many other things which i have not room to mention at present i am with great respect dear sir yours sincerely joseph priestley     benjamin franklin    july      london deborah franklin ccccxlv to mrs deborah franklin london    july      my dear child— i am just returned from a journey of near a month which has given a new spring to my health and spirits i did not get home in time to write by osborne but shall write fully to my friends in general by captain all who sails about the end of the week i was charged with abundance of love to you and sally and ben from our sister bache and her amiable daughters i spent some days at preston visited several friends in cumberland westmoreland yorkshire and staffordshire rachel wilson sent her love to you and our children as did our remaining relations at birmingham where i likewise stayed several days in cumberland i ascended a very high mountain where i had a prospect of a most beautiful country of hills fields lakes villas c and at whitehaven went down the coal mines till they told me i was eighty fathoms under the surface of the sea which rolled over our heads so that i have been nearer both the upper and lower regions than ever in my life before my love to our children and all inquiring friends i am ever my dear debby your affectionate husband b franklin     benjamin franklin    august      london william franklin ccccxlvi to william franklin london    august      dear son— at length we have got rid of lord hillsborough and lord dartmouth takes his place to the great satisfaction of all the friends of america you will hear it said among you i suppose that the interest of the ohio planters has ousted him but the truth is what i wrote you long since that all his brother ministers disliked him extremely and wished for a fair occasion of tripping up his heels so seeing that he made a point of defeating our scheme they made another of supporting it on purpose to mortify him which they knew his pride could not bear i do not mean they would have done this if they had thought our proposal bad in itself or his opposition well founded but i believe if he had been on good terms with them they would not have differed with him for so small a matter the king too was tired of him and of his administration which had weakened the affection and respect of the colonies for the royal government of which i may say it to you i used proper means from time to time that his majesty should have due information and convincing proofs more of this when i see you the kings dislike made the others more firmly united in the resolution of disgracing hillsborough by setting at nought his famous report but now that business is done perhaps our affair may be less regarded in the cabinet and suffered to linger and possibly may yet miscarry therefore let us beware     of every word and action that may betray a confidence in its success lest we render ourselves ridiculous in case of disappointment we are now pushing for a completion of the business but the time is unfavorable everybody gone or going into the country which gives room for accidents i am writing by falconer and therefore in this only add that i am ever your affectionate father b franklin p s—the regard lord dartmouth has always done me the honor to express for me gives me room to hope being able to obtain more in favor of our colonies upon occasion than i could for some time past benjamin franklin    august      london governor franklin ccccxlvii to governor franklin new jersey london    august      dear son— in yours of may   th you acquaint me with your indisposition which gave me great concern the resolution you have taken to use more exercise is extremely proper and i hope you will steadily perform it it is of the greatest importance to prevent diseases since the cure of them by physic is so very precarious in considering the different kinds of exercise i have thought that the quantum of each is to be judged of not by time or by distance but by the degree of warmth it produces in the body thus when i observe if i am cold when i get into a carriage in a     morning i may ride all day without being warmed by it that if on horseback my feet are cold i may ride some hours before they become warm but if i am ever so cold on foot i cannot walk an hour briskly without glowing from head to foot by the quickened circulation i have been ready to say using round numbers without regard to exactness but merely to make a great difference that there is more exercise in one miles riding on horseback than in five in a coach and more in one miles walking on foot than in five on horseback to which i may add that there is more in walking one mile up and down stairs than in five on a level floor the two latter exercises may be had within doors when the weather discourages going abroad and the last may be had when one is pinched for time as containing a great quantity of exercise in a handful of minutes the dumbbell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind by the use of it i have in forty swings quickened my pulse from sixty to one hundred beats in a minute counted by a second watch and i suppose the warmth generally increases with quickness of pulse b franklin benjamin franklin    august      london william franklin ccccxlviii to william franklin london    august      dear son— i received yours of june  0th i am vexed that my letter to you written at glasgow miscarried not so much that you did not receive it as     that it is probably in other hands it contained some accounts of what passed in ireland which were for you only as lord hillsborough in fact got nothing out of me i should rather suppose he threw me away as an orange that would yield no juice and therefore not worth more squeezing when i had been a little while returned to london i waited on him to thank him for his civilities in ireland and to discourse with him on a georgia affair the porter told me he was not at home i left my card went another time and received the same answer though i knew he was at home a friend of mine being with him after intermissions of a week each i made two more visits and received the same answer the last time was on a levee day when a number of carriages were at his door my coachman driving up alighted and was opening the coach door when the porter seeing me came out and surlily chid the coachman for opening the door before he had inquired whether my lord was at home and then turning to me said my lord is not at home i have never since been nigh him and we have only abused one another at a distance the contrast as you observe is very striking between this conversation with the chief justice and his letter to you concerning your province i know him to be as double and deceitful as any man i ever met with but we have done with him i hope for ever his removal has i believe been meditated ever since the death of the princess dowager for i recollect that on my complaining of him about that time to a friend at court whom you may guess he told me we     americans were represented by hillsborough as an unquiet people not easily satisfied with any ministry that however it was thought too much occasion had been given us to dislike the present and asked me whether if he should be removed i could name another likely to be more acceptable to us i said yes there is lord dartmouth we liked him very well when he was at the head of the board formerly and probably should like him again this i heard no more of but i am pretty sure it was reported where i could wish it though i know not that it had any effect as to my situation here nothing can be more agreeable especially as i hope for less embarrassment from the new minister a general respect paid me by the learned a number of friends and acquaintance among them with whom i have a pleasing intercourse a character of so much weight that it has protected me when some power would have done me injury and continued me in an office they would have deprived me of my company so much desired that i seldom dine at home in winter and could spend the whole summer in the countryhouses of inviting friends if i chose it learned and ingenious foreigners that come to england almost all make a point of visiting me for my reputation is still higher abroad than here several of the foreign ambassadors have assiduously cultivated my acquaintance treating me as one of their corps partly i believe from the desire they have from time to time of hearing something of american affairs an object become of importance in foreign courts who begin     to hope britains alarming power will be diminished by the defection of her colonies and partly that they may have an opportunity of introducing me to the gentlemen of their country who desire it the king too has lately been heard to speak of me with great regard these are flattering circumstances but a violent longing for home sometimes seizes me which i can no otherwise subdue but by promising myself a return next spring or next fall and so forth as to returning hither if i once go back i have no thoughts of it i am too far advanced in life to propose three voyages more i have some important affairs to settle at home and considering my double expenses here and there i hardly think my salaries fully compensate the disadvantages the late change however being thrown into the balance determines me to stay another winter august   d—i find i omitted congratulating you on the honor of your election into the society for propagating the gospel there you match indeed my dutch honor but you are again behind for last night i received a letter from paris of which the enclosed is an extract acquainting me that i am chosen associé etranger foreign member of the royal academy there there are but eight of these associés etrangers in all europe and those of the most distinguished names for science the vacancy i have the honor of filling was made by the death of the late celebrated van swieten of vienna this mark of respect from the first academy in the world which abbé nollet one of its members took so much   0 pains to prejudice against my doctrines i consider as a kind of victory without ink shed since i never answered him i am told he has but one of his sect now remaining in the academy all the rest who have in any degree acquainted themselves with electricity are as he calls them franklinists  yours c b franklin ccccxlix report on lightningconductors for the powder magazines at purfleet drawn up by benjamin franklin august         h cavendish william watson benjamin franklin j robertson to the president and council of the royal society gentlemen— the society being consulted by the board of ordnance on the propriety of fixing conductors for securing the powder magazines at purfleet from lightning and having thereupon done us the honor of appointing us a committee to consider the same and report our opinion we have accordingly visited those buildings and examined with care and attention their situation construction and circumstances which we find as follows     they are five in number each about one hundred and fifty feet long about fiftytwo feet wide built of brick arched under the roof which in one of them is slated with a coping of lead twentytwo inches wide on the ridge from end to end and the others we were informed are soon to be covered in the same manner they stand parallel to each other at about fiftyseven feet distance and are founded on a chalkrock about one hundred feet from the river which rises at high tides within a few inches of the level of the ground its brackish water also soaking through to the wells that are dug near the buildings the barrels of powder when the magazines are full lie piled on each other up to the spring of the arches and there are four copper hoops on each barrel which with a number of perpendicular iron bars that come down through the arches to support a long grooved piece of timber wherein the crane was usually moved and guided to any part where it was wanted formed broken conductors within the building the more dangerous from their being incomplete as the explosion from hoop to hoop in the passage of lightning drawn down through the bars among the barrels might easily happen to fire the powder contained in them but the workmen were removing all those iron bars by the advice of some members of the society who had been previously consulted a measure we very much approve of on an elevated ground nearly equal in height with the tops of the magazines and one hundred and fifty yards from them is the house wherein the board usually meet it is a lofty building with a     pointed hiproof the copings of lead down to the gutters whence leaden pipes descend at each end of the building into the water of two wells forty feet deep for the purpose of conveying water forced up by engines to a cistern in the roof there is also a proofhouse adjoining to the end of one of the magazines and a clockhouse at the distance of —— feet from them which has a weathercock on an iron spindle and probably some incomplete conductors within such as the wire usually extending up from a clock to its hammer the clock pendulumrod c the blowing up of a magazine of gunpowder by lightning within a few years past at brescia in italy which demolished a considerable part of the town with the loss of many lives does in our opinion strongly urge the propriety of guarding such magazines from that kind of danger and since it is now well known from many observations that metals have the property of conducting and a method has been discovered of using that property for the security of buildings by so disposing and fixing iron rods as to receive and convey safely away such lightning as might otherwise have damaged them which method has been practised near twenty years in many places and attended with success in all the instances that have come to our knowledge we cannot therefore but think it advisable to provide conductors of that kind for the magazines in question in common cases it has been judged sufficient if the lower part of the conductor were sunk three or four feet into the ground till it came to moist earth     but this being a case of the greatest importance we are of opinion that greater precaution should be taken therefore we would advise that at each end of each magazine a well should be dug in or through the chalk so deep as to have in it at least four feet of standing water from the bottom of this water should rise a piece of leaden pipe to or near the surface of the ground where it should be strongly joined to the end of an upright bar an inch and a half in diameter fastened to the wall by leaden straps and extending ten feet above the ridge of the building tapering from the ridge upwards to a sharp point the upper twelve inches to be copper the iron to be painted we mention lead for the underground part of the conductor as less liable to rust in water and moist places in the form of a pipe as giving greater stiffness for the substance and iron for the part above ground as stronger and less likely to be cut away the pieces of which the bar may be composed should be screwed strongly into each other by a close joint with a thin plate of lead between the shoulders to make the joining or continuation of metal more perfect each rod in passing above the ridge should be strongly and closely connected by iron or lead or both with the leaden coping of the roof whereby a communication of metal will be made between the two bars of each building for a more free and easy conducting of the lightning into the earth we also advise in consideration of the great length of the buildings that two wells of the same depth with the others should be dug within twelve feet of     the doors of the two outside magazines that is to say one of them on the north side of the north building the other on the south side of the south building from the bottoms of which wells similar conductors should be carried up to the eaves there joining well with a plate of lead extending on the roof up to the leaden coping of the ridge the said plate of lead being of equal substance with that of the coping we are further of opinion that it will be right to form a communication of lead from the top of the chimney of the proofhouse to the lead on its ridge and thence to the lead on the ridge of the corridor and thence to the iron conductor of the adjacent end of the magazine and also to fix a conductor from the bottom of the weathercockspindle of the clockhouse down on the outside of that building into the moist earth as to the boardhouse we think it already well furnished with conductors by the several leaden communications above mentioned from the point of the roof down into the water and that by its height and proximity it may be some security to the buildings below it we therefore propose no other conductor for that building and only advise erecting a pointed rod on the summit similar to those before described and communicating with those conductors to these directions we would add a caution that in all future alterations or repairs of the buildings special care be taken that the metallic communications are not cut off or removed it remains that we express our acknowledgments to sir charles frederick surveyorgeneral of the     ordnance for the obliging attention with which he entertained and accommodated us on the day of our inquiry with very great respect we are gentlemen your most obedient humble servants h cavendish william watson b franklin j robertson      benjamin franklin    august      london anthony benezet ccccl to mr anthony benezet  philadelphia london    august      dear friend— i made a little extract from yours of april   th of the number of slaves imported and perishing with some close remarks on the hypocrisy of this country which encourages such a detestable commerce by laws for promoting the guinea trade while it piqued itself on its virtue love of liberty and the equity of its courts in setting free a single negro this was inserted in the london chronicle of the  0th of june last i thank you for the virginia address which i shall also publish with some remarks i am glad to hear that the disposition against keeping negroes grows more general in north america several pieces have been lately printed here against the practice and i hope in time it will be taken into consideration and suppressed by the legislature your labors have already been attended with great effects i hope therefore you and your friends will be encouraged to proceed my hearty wishes of success attend you being ever my dear friend yours affectionately b f  e     ccccli experiments observations and facts tending to support the opinion of the utility of long pointed rods for securing buildings from damage by strokes of lightning read at the committee appointed to consider the erection of conductors to secure the magazines at purfleet august         experiment i the prime conductor of an electric machine a b see plate i being supported about ten inches and a half above the table by a wax stand and under it erected a pointed wire seven inches and a half high and one fifth of an inch thick and tapering to a sharp point communicating with the table when the point being uppermost is covered by the end of a finger the conductor may be full charged and the electrometer  will rise to the height indicating a full charge but the moment the point is uncovered the ball of the electrometer drops showing the prime conductor to be instantly discharged and nearly emptied of its electricity turn the wire its blunt end upward which represents an unpointed bar and no such effect follows the electrometer remaining at its usual height when the prime conductor is charged observation what quantity of lightning a high pointed rod well communicating with the earth may be expected     to discharge from the clouds silently in a short time is yet unknown but i reason from a particular fact to think it may at some times be very great in philadelphia i had such a rod fixed to the top of my chimney and extending about nine feet above it from the foot of this rod a wire the thickness of a goosequill came through a covered glass tube in the roof and down through the well of the staircase the lower end connected with the iron spear of a pump on the staircase opposite to my chamber door the wire was divided the ends separated about six inches a little bell on each end and between the bells a little brass ball suspended by a silk thread to play between and strike the bells when clouds passed with electricity in them after having frequently drawn sparks and charged bottles from the bell of the upper wire i was one night awakened by loud cracks on the staircase starting up and opening the door i perceived that the brass ball instead of vibrating as usual between the bells was repelled and kept at a distance from both while the fire passed sometimes in very large quick cracks from bell to bell and sometimes in a continued dense white stream seemingly as large as my finger whereby the whole staircase was enlightened as with sunshine so that one might see to pick up a pin  and     from the apparent quantity thus discharged i cannot but conceive that a number  of such conductors must considerably lessen that of any approaching cloud before it comes so near as to deliver its contents in a general stroke an effect not to be expected from bars unpointed if the above experiment with the blunt end of the wire is deemed pertinent to the case experiment ii the pointed wire under the prime conductor continuing of the same height pinch it between the thumb and finger near the top so as just to conceal the point then turning the globe the electrometer will rise and mark the full charge slip the fingers down so as to discover about half an inch of the wire then another half inch and then another at every one of these motions discovering more and more of the pointed wire you will see the electrometer fall quick and proportionably stopping when you stop if you slip down the whole distance at once the ball falls instantly down to the stem observation from this experiment it seems that a greater effect in drawing off the lightning from the clouds may be expected from long pointed rods than from short ones i mean from such as show the greatest length above the building they are fixed on   0 experiment iii instead of pinching the point between the thumb and finger as in the last experiment keep the thumb and finger each at near an inch distance from it but at the same height the point between them in this situation though the point is fairly exposed to the prime conductor it has little or no effect the electrometer rises to the height of a full charge but the moment the fingers are taken away the ball falls quick to the stem observation to explain this it is supposed that one reason of the sudden effect produced by a long naked pointed wire is that by the repulsive power of the positive charge in the prime conductor the natural quantity of electricity contained in the pointed wire is driven down into the earth and the point of the wire made strongly negative whence it attracts the electricity of the prime conductor more strongly than bodies in their natural state would do the small quantity of common matter in the point not being able by its attractive force to retain its natural quantity of the electric fluid against the force of that repulsion but the finger and thumb being substantial and blunt bodies though as near the prime conductor hold up better their own natural quantity against the force of that repulsion and so continuing nearly in the natural state they jointly operate on the electric fluid in the point opposing its descent and aiding the point to retain it contrary to the repelling power of     the prime conductor which would drive it down and this may also serve to explain the different powers of the point in the preceding experiment on the slipping down the finger and thumb to different distances hence is collected that a pointed rod erected between two tall chimneys and very little higher an instance of which i have seen cannot have so good an effect as if it had been erected on one of the chimneys its whole length above it experiment iv if instead of a long pointed wire a large solid body to represent a building without a point be brought under and as near the prime conductor when charged the ball of the electrometer will fall a little and on taking away the large body will rise again observation its rising again shows that the prime conductor lost little or none of its electric charge as it had done through the point the falling of the ball while the large body was under the conductor therefore shows that a quantity of its atmosphere was drawn from the end where the electrometer is placed to the part inmediately over the large body and there accumulated ready to strike into it with its whole undiminished force as soon as within the striking distance and were the prime conductor movable like a cloud it would approach the body by attraction till within that distance the swift motion of clouds as driven by the winds probably prevents this happening so     often as otherwise it might do for though parts of the cloud may stoop towards a building as they pass in consequence of such attraction yet they are carried forward beyond the striking distance before they could by their descending come within it experiment v attach a small light lock of cotton to the under side of the prime conductor so that it may hang down towards the pointed wire mentioned in the first experiment cover the point with your finger and the globe being turned the cotton will extend itself stretching down towards the finger as at a but on uncovering the point it instantly flies up to the prime conductor as at b and continues there as long as the point is uncovered the moment you cover it again the cotton flies down again extending itself towards the finger and the same happens in the degree if instead of the finger you use uncovered the blunt end of the wire uppermost observation to explain this it is supposed that the cotton by its connexion with the prime conductor receives from it a quantity of its electricity which occasions its being attracted by the finger that remains still in nearly its natural state but when a point is opposed to the cotton its electricity is thereby taken from it faster than it can at a distance be supplied with a fresh quantity from the conductor therefore being reduced nearer to the natural state it is attracted up     to the electrified prime conductor rather than down as before to the finger supposing farther that the prime conductor represents a cloud charged with the electric fluid the cotton a ragged fragment of cloud of which the underside of great thunderclouds are seen to have many the finger a chimney or highest part of a building we then may conceive that when such a cloud passes over a building some one of its ragged underhanging fragments may be drawn down by the chimney or other high part of the edifice creating thereby a more easy communication between it and the great cloud but a long pointed rod being presented to this fragment may occasion its receding like the cotton up to the great cloud and thereby increase instead of lessening the distance so as often to make it greater than the striking distance turning the blunt end of a wire uppermost which represents the unpointed bar it appears that the same good effect is not from that to be expected a long pointed rod it is therefore imagined may prevent some strokes as well as conduct others that fall upon it when a great body of cloud comes on so heavily that the above repelling operation on fragments cannot take place experiment vi opposite the side of the prime conductor place separately isolated by wax stems mr cantons two boxes with pith balls suspended by fine linen threads on each box lay a wire six inches long and one fifth of an inch thick tapering to a sharp point but so laid as     that four inches of the pointed end of one wire and an equal length of the blunt end of the other may project beyond the ends of the boxes and both at eighteen inches distance from the prime conductor then charging the prime conductor by a turn or two of the globe the balls of each pair will separate those of the box whence the point projects most considerably the others less touch the prime conductor and those of the box with the blunt point will collapse and join those connected with the point will at the same time approach each other till within about an inch and there remain observation this seems a proof that though the small sharpened part of the wire must have had a less natural quantity in it before the operation than the thick blunt part yet a greater quantity was driven down from it to the balls thence it is again inferred that the pointed rod is rendered more negative and farther that if a stroke must fall from the cloud over a building furnished with such a rod it is more likely to be drawn to that pointed rod than to a blunt one as being more strongly negative and of course its attraction stronger and it seems more eligible that the lightning should fall on the point of the conductor provided to convey it into the earth than on any other part of the building thence to proceed to such conductor which end is also more likely to be obtained by the length and loftiness of the rod as protecting more extensively the building under it it has been objected that erecting pointed rods upon     edifices is to invite and draw the lightning into them and therefore dangerous were such rods to be erected on buildings without continuing the communication quite down into the moist earth this objection might then have weight but when such complete conductors are made the lightning is invited not into the building but into the earth the situation it aims at and which it always seizes every help to obtain even from broken partial metalline conductors it has also been suggested that from such electric experiments nothing certain can be concluded as to the great operations of nature since it is often seen that experiments which have succeeded in small in large have failed it is true that in mechanics this has sometimes happened but when it is considered that we owe our first knowledge of the nature and operations of lightning to observations on such small experiments and that on carefully comparing the most accurate accounts of former facts and the exactest relations of those that have occurred since the effects have surprisingly agreed with the theory it is humbly conceived that in natural philosophy in this branch of it at least the suggestion has not so much weight and that the farther new experiments now adduced in recommendation of long sharppointed rods may have some claim to credit and consideration it has been urged too that though points may have considerable effects on a small prime conductor at small distances yet on great clouds and at great distances nothing is to be expected from them to this it is answered that in those small experiments it is     evident the points act a greater than the striking distance and in the large way their service is only expected where there it such nearness of the cloud as to endanger a stroke and there it cannot be doubted the points must have some effect and if the quantity discharged by a single pointed rod may be so considerable as i have shown it the quantity discharged by a number will be proportionally greater but this part of the theory does not depend alone on small experiments since the practice of erecting pointed rods in america now near twenty years five of them have been struck by lightning namely mr ravens and mr maines in south carolina mr tuckers in virginia mr wests and mr moulders in philadelphia possibly there may have been more that have not come to my knowledge but in every one of these the lightning did not fall upon the body of the house but precisely on the several points of the rods and though the conductors were sometimes not sufficiently large and complete was conveyed into the earth without any material damage to the buildings facts then in great as far as we have them authenticated justify the opinion that is drawn from the experiments in small as above related it has also been objected that unless we knew the quantity that might possibly be discharged at one stroke from the clouds we cannot be sure we have provided sufficient conductors and therefore cannot depend on their conveying away all that may fall on their points indeed we have nothing to form a judgment by in this but past facts and we know of no instance where a complete conductor to the moist     earth has been insufficient if half an inch in diameter it is probable that many strokes of lightning have been conveyed through the common leaden pipes affixed to houses to carry down the water from the roof to the ground and there is no account of such pipes being melted and destroyed as must sometimes have happened if they had been insufficient we can then only judge of the dimensions proper for a conductor of lightning as we do of those proper for a conductor of rain by past observation and as we think a pipe of three inches bore sufficient to carry off the rain that falls on a square of twenty feet because we never saw such a pipe glutted by any shower so we may judge a conductor of an inch diameter more than sufficient for any stroke of lightning that will fall on its point it is true that if another deluge should happen wherein the windows of heaven are to be opened such pipes may be unequal to the falling quantity and if god for our sins should think it fit to rain fire upon us as upon some cities of old it is not expected that our conductors of whatever size should secure our houses against a miracle probably as water drawn up into the air and there forming clouds is disposed to fall again in rain by its natural gravity as soon as a number of particles sufficient to make a drop can get together so when the clouds are by whatever means over or undercharged with the electric fluid to a degree sufficient to attract them towards the earth the equilibrium is restored before the difference becomes great beyond that degree mr lanes electrometer for limiting precisely the quantity of a shock that is to be administered in a     medical view may serve to make this more easily intelligible the discharging knob does by a screw approach the conductor to the distance intended but there remains fixed whatever power there may be in the glass globe to collect the fulminating fluid and whatever capacity of receiving and accumulating it there may be in the bottle or glass jar yet neither the accumulation nor the discharge ever exceeds the destined quantity thus were the clouds always at a certain fixed distance from the earth all discharges would be made when the quantity accumulated was equal to the distance but there is a circumstance which by occasional lessening the distance lessens the discharge to wit the movableness of the clouds and their being drawn nearer to the earth by attraction when electrified so that discharges are thereby rendered more frequent and of course less violent hence whatever the quantity may be in nature and whatever the power in the clouds of collecting it yet an accumulation and force beyond what mankind has hitherto been acquainted with is scarce to be expected  b f august             benjamin franklin    august      london joseph galloway cccclii to joseph galloway london    august      dear friend— i acknowledged before the receipt of your favor of may   th since which i have no line from you it will be a pleasure to render any service to mr tilghman whom you recommended the acts passed in your winter and spring sessions i have not yet received nor have i heard from mr wilmot that they have been presented lord hillsborough mortified by the committee of councils approbation of our grant in opposition to his report has resigned i believe when he offered to do so he had such an opinion of his importance that he did not think it would be accepted and that it would be thought prudent rather to set our grant aside than part with him his colleagues in the ministry were all glad to get rid of him and perhaps for this reason joined more readily in giving him that mortification lord dartmouth succeeds him who has much more favorable dispositions towards the colonies he has heretofore expressed some personal regard for me and i hope now to find our business with the board more easy to transact your observations on the state of the islands did not come to hand till after lord rochford had withdrawn   0 his petition  his lordship and the promoters of it were so roasted on the occasion that i believe another kind will not very soon be thought of the proprietor was at the expense of the opposition and as i knew it would not be necessary and thought it might be inconvenient to our affairs i did not openly engage in it but i gave some private assistance that i believed was not without effect i think too that mr jacksons opinion was of great service i would lodge a copy of your paper in the plantation office against any similar future applications if you approve of it i only think the island holders make too great a concession to the crown when they suppose it may have a right to quitrent it can have none in my opinion on the old grants from indians swedes and dutch where none was reserved and i think those grants so clearly good as to need no confirmation to obtain which i suppose is the only motive for offering such quitrent i imagine too that it may not be amiss to affix a caveat in the plantation office in the behalf of holders of property in those islands against any grant of them that may be applied for till they have had timely notice and an opportunity of being fully heard mr jackson is out of town but i shall confer with him on the subject as soon as he returns i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin     benjamin franklin   september      london thomas cushing ccccliii to thomas cushing london   september      sir— i write this line just to acknowledge the receipt of your several favors of july   th and   th containing the resolves of the house relating to the governors salary and the petition to the king lord dartmouth now our american minister is at present in the country and will probably not be in town till the season of business comes on i shall then immediately put the petition into his hands to be presented to his majesty i may be mistaken but i imagine we shall not meet the same difficulty in transacting business with him as with his predecessor on whose removal i congratulate you and the assembly most heartily i shall write fully by some of the next boston ships at present can only add that with the sincerest esteem and respect i have the honor to be c b franklin benjamin franklin    september      london joseph priestley ccccliv to dr priestley london    september      dear sir— in the affair of so much importance to you wherein you ask my advice i cannot for want of sufficient premises advise you what to determine but if you please i will tell you how when these difficult cases occur they are difficult chiefly     because while we have them under consideration all the reasons pro and con are not present to the mind at the same time but sometimes one set present themselves and at other times another the first being out of sight hence the various purposes or inclinations that alternately prevail and the uncertainty that perplexes us to get over this my way is to divide half a sheet of paper by a line into two columns writing over the one pro and over the other con then during three or four days consideration i put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives that at different times occur to me for or against the measure when i have thus got them all together in one view i endeavour to estimate their respective weights and where i find two one on each side that seem equal i strike them both out if i find a reason pro equal to some two reasons con i strike out the three if i judge some two reasons con equal to some three reasons pro i strike out the five and thus proceeding i find at length where the balance lies and if after a day or two of farther consideration nothing new that is of importance occurs on either side i come to a determination accordingly and though the weight of reasons cannot be taken with the precision of algebraic quantities yet when each is thus considered separately and comparatively and the whole lies before me i think i can judge better and am less likely to make a rash step and in fact i have found great advantage from this kind of equation in what may be called moral or prudential algebra     wishing sincerely that you may determine for the best i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    september      london georgiana shipley cccclv to miss georgiana shipley  on the loss of her american squirrel who escaping from his cage was killed by a shepherds dog london    september      dear miss— i lament with you most sincerely the unfortunate end of poor mungo few squirrels were better accomplished for he had had a good education had travelled far and seen much of the world as he had the honor of being for his virtues your favorite he should not go like common skuggs without an elegy or an epitaph let us give him one in the monumental style and measure which being neither prose nor verse is perhaps the properest for grief since to use common language would look as if we were not affected and to make rhymes would seem trifling in sorrow   epitaph    alas poor mungo   happy wert thou hadst thou known   thy own felicity   remote from the fierce bald eagle   tyrant of thy native woods   thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons   nor from the murdering gun   of the thoughtless sportsman         safe in thy wired castle   grimalkin never could annoy thee   daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands   by the fair hand of an indulgent mistress   but discontented   thou wouldst have more freedom   too soon alas didst thou obtain it   and wandering   thou art fallen by the fangs of wanton cruel ranger   learn hence   ye who blindly seek more liberty   whether subjects sons squirrels or daughters   that apparent restraint may be real protection   yielding peace and plenty   with security you see my dear miss how much more decent and proper this broken style is than if we were to say by way of epitaph   here skugg   lies snug   as a bug   in a rug and yet perhaps there are people in the world of so little feeling as to think this would be a good enough epitaph for poor mungo if you wish it i shall procure another to succeed him but perhaps you will now choose some other amusement      remember me affectionately to all the good family and believe me ever your affectionate friend b franklin cccclvi the art of procuring pleasant dreams inscribed to miss —— being written at her request as a great part of our life is spent in sleep during which we have sometimes pleasant and sometimes painful dreams it becomes of some consequence to obtain the one kind and avoid the other for whether real or imaginary pain is pain and pleasure is pleasure if we can sleep without dreaming it is well that painful dreams are avoided if while we sleep we can have any pleasing dream it is as the french say autante de gagné so much added to the pleasure of life to this end it is in the first place necessary to be careful in preserving health by due exercise and great temperance for in sickness the imagination is disturbed and disagreeable sometimes terrible ideas are apt to present themselves exercise should precede meals not immediately follow them the first promotes the latter unless moderate obstructs digestion if after exercise we feed sparingly the digestion will be easy and good the body lightsome the temper cheerful and all the animal functions performed agreeably sleep when it follows will be natural and undisturbed while indolence with full     feeding occasions nightmares and horrors inexpressible we fall from precipices are assaulted by wild beasts murderers and demons and experience every variety of distress observe however that the quantities of food and exercise are relative things those who move much may and indeed ought to eat much more those who use little exercise should eat little in general mankind since the improvement of cookery eat about twice as much as nature requires suppers are not bad if we have not dined but restless nights naturally follow hearty suppers after full dinners indeed as there is a difference in constitutions some rest well after these meals it costs them only a frightful dream and an apoplexy after which they sleep till doomsday nothing is more common in the newspapers than instances of people who after eating a hearty supper are found dead abed in the morning another means of preserving health to be attended to is the having a constant supply of fresh air in your bedchamber it has been a great mistake the sleeping in rooms exactly closed and in beds surrounded by curtains no outward air that may come in to you is so unwholesome as the unchanged air often breathed of a close chamber as boiling water does not grow hotter by longer boiling if the particles that receive greater heat can escape so living bodies do not putrefy if the particles so fast as they become putrid can be thrown off nature expels them by the pores of the skin and the lungs and in a free open air they are carried off but in a close room we receive them again and again though they become     more and more corrupt a number of persons crowded into a small room thus spoil the air in a few minutes and even render it mortal as in the black hole at calcutta a single person is said to spoil only a gallon of air per minute and therefore requires a longer time to spoil a chamberfull but it is done however in proportion and many putrid disorders hence have their origin it is recorded of methusalem who being the longest liver may be supposed to have best preserved his health that he slept always in the open air for when he had lived five hundred years an angel said to him arise methusalem and build thee an house for thou shalt live yet five hundred years longer but methusalem answered and said if i am to live but five hundred years longer it is not worth while to build me a house i will sleep in the air as i have been used to do physicians after having for ages contended that the sick should not be indulged with fresh air have at length discovered that it may do them good it is therefore to be hoped that they may in time discover likewise that it is not hurtful to those who are in health and that we may be then cured of the aerophobia that at present distresses weak minds and makes them choose to be stifled and poisoned rather than leave open the window of a bedchamber or put down the glass of a coach confined air when saturated with perspirable matter  will not receive more and that matter must     remain in the bodies and occasion diseases but it gives some previous notice of its being about to be hurtful by producing certain uneasinesses slight indeed at first such as with regard to the lungs is a trifling sensation and to the pores of the skin a kind of restlessness which is difficult to describe and few that feel it know the cause of it but we may recollect that sometimes on waking in the night we have if warmly covered found it difficult to get asleep again we turn often without finding repose in any position this fidgetiness to use a vulgar expression for want of a better is occasioned wholly by an uneasiness in the skin owing to the retention of the perspirable matter the bedclothes having received their quantity and being saturated refusing to take any more to become sensible of this by an experiment let a person keep his position in the bed but throw off the bedclothes and suffer fresh air to approach the part uncovered of his body he will then feel that part suddenly refreshed for the air will immediately relieve the skin by receiving licking up and carrying off the load of perspirable matter that incommoded it for every portion of cool air that approaches the warm skin in receiving its part of that vapor receives therewith a degree of heat that rarefies and renders it lighter when it will be pushed away with its burthen by cooler and therefore heavier fresh air which for a moment supplies its place and then being likewise changed and warmed gives way to a succeeding quantity this is the order of nature to prevent animals being infected by their own perspiration he will now be sensible of     the difference between the part exposed to the air and that which remaining sunk in the bed denies the air access for this part now manifests its uneasiness more distinctly by the comparison and the seat of the uneasiness is more plainly perceived than when the whole surface of the body was affected by it here then is one great and general cause of unpleasing dreams for when the body is uneasy the mind will be disturbed by it and disagreeable ideas of various kinds will in sleep be the natural consequences the remedies preventive and curative follow   by eating moderately as before advised for healths sake less perspirable matter is produced in a given time hence the bedclothes receive it longer before they are saturated and we may therefore sleep longer before we are made uneasy by their refusing to receive any more   by using thinner and more porous bedclothes which will suffer the perspirable matter more easily to pass through them we are less incommoded such being longer tolerable   when you are awakened by this uneasiness and find you cannot easily sleep again get out of bed beat up and turn your pillow shake the bedclothes well with at least twenty shakes then throw the bed open and leave it to cool in the meanwhile continuing undressed walk about your chamber till your skin has had time to discharge its load which it will do sooner as the air may be drier and colder when you begin to feel the cold air unpleasant then return to your bed and you will soon fall asleep and your   0 sleep will be sweet and pleasant all the scenes presented to your fancy will be too of the pleasing kind i am often as agreeably entertained with them as by the scenery of an opera if you happen to be too indolent to get out of bed you may instead of it lift up your bedclothes with one arm and leg so as to draw in a good deal of fresh air and by letting them fall force it out again this repeated twenty times will so clear them of the perspirable matter they have imbibed as to permit your sleeping well for some time afterwards but this latter method is not equal to the former those who do not love trouble and can afford to have two beds will find great luxury in rising when they wake in a hot bed and going into the cool one such shifting of beds would also be of great service to persons ill of a fever as it refreshes and frequently procures sleep a very large bed that will admit a removal so distant from the first situation as to be cool and sweet may in a degree answer the same end one or two observations more will conclude this little piece care must be taken when you lie down to dispose your pillow so as to suit your manner of placing your head and to be perfectly easy then place your limbs so as not to bear inconveniently hard upon one another as for instance the joints of your ankles for though a bad position may at first give but little pain and be hardly noticed yet a continuance will render it less tolerable and the uneasiness may come on while you are asleep and disturb your imagination these are the rules of the art     but though they will generally prove effectual in producing the end intended there is a case in which the most punctual observance of them will be totally fruitless i need not mention the case to you my dear friend but my account of the art would be imperfect without it the case is when the person who desires to have pleasant dreams has not taken care to preserve what is necessary above all things a good conscience benjamin franklin   october      london bache cccclvii to mr bache london   october      loving son— i received yours of september  st and am rejoiced to hear you are all well your good mother and sisters were so about a fortnight ago when i heard from them the bill you sent me for £ 0 whinney on smith wright  grey being good i return your note enclosed and canceld there remains five guineas unpaid which you had of me just on going away so i suppose you forgot it send it in a venture for ben to jamaica by the way it has been reported here that some years since a very long building in that island which had a rod or conductor at each end was nevertheless struck by lightning in the middle and much damaged did you hear of such a thing while you was there if so pray enquire and learn the particulars from thence what kind of rods how placed how high above the roof how deep in the ground and other material circumstances with regard to the building and the damage     if you heard of no such event while you was there i suppose the story is not true but a mr smith who was there in some business and now here a merchant i think relates it as what he heard spoken of when there i am surprised to hear that the dutchman i assisted with    guineas turned out a rogue and that sheets has paid nothing of what i furnished him when here i am afraid i do not grow wiser as i grow older pray let me know whether the dutch printer armbruster has paid any thing or is solvable or not and also how the affair stands of the mortgage i had on my friend maugridges plantation no intelligible information has yet been given me of it we are moving to another house in the same mutilated leaving this to mr hewson as soon as i am settled in my new apartments i shall examine parkers accounts and write to you on them you hope i was not a sufferer in the late general wreck of credit here my two bankinghouses browns  collinson and smith wright  grey stood firm and they were the only people here in debt to me so i lost nothing by the failure of others and being out of debt myself my credit could not be shaken by any run upon me out of debt as the proverb says was being out of danger but i have since hazarded a little in using my credit with the bank to support that of a friend as far as £ 000 for which i am secured by bills of the bank of douglas heron  co accepted by a good house here and therefore i call it only hazarding a little though the sum is large enough to ruin me if i were to lose it our     friends the alexanders went on again immediately being supported by great houses here and through them by the bank their bottom being manifestly very great and good though they had embarrassed themselves by assisting the adamses and others the affair of the grant is in good train and we expect it to be completed soon after the boards meet if no new difficulties start up unexpected my love to sally and the boy i am your affectionate father b franklin benjamin franklin    october      london john bartram cccclviii to john bartram london    october      my dear old friend— i received some time since the enclosed letter from dr hope and lately the gold medal it mentions was delivered to me for you by the first ship directly to philadelphia i shall send it in the care of some safe hand thinking it not so well to hazard it with this letter round through new york i hope the rhubarb you have sown and distributed will be taken care of there seems to me no doubt of its doing as well with us as in scotland remember that for use the root does not come to its perfection of power and virtue in less than seven years the physicians here who have tried the scotch approve it much and say it is fully equal to the best imported i send you enclosed a small box of upland rice brought from cochin china it grows there     on dry grounds and not in water like the common sort also a few seeds of the chinese tallowtree they have been carefully preserved in bringing hither by mr ellis method i had them from him and he tells me they may grow under your skilful care my love to mrs bartram and all yours from your affectionate friend b franklin benjamin franklin   november      london jonathan williams cccclix to jonathan williams london   november      dear cousin— my sister to whom i have not now time to write acquainted me in her last letter that there was some expectation her daughter would soon be married with her consent if that should take place my request is that you would lay out the sum of fifty pounds lawful money in bedding or such other furniture as my sister shall think proper to be given the newmarried couple towards housekeeping with my best wishes and charge that sum to my account i can now only add that i am ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   november      london lord stirling cccclx to lord stirling london   november      my lord— on my return to town i found your favor with the schemes of your lottery to which i     wish success and besides ordering some tickets for myself i have spoken well of it on every occasion but i find little inclination among my acquaintances to engage in lotteries at such a distance and one cannot be very open in promoting them it being contrary to express acts of parliament as well as offensive to administration here which would avail itself of all that is to be gained that way with great and sincere esteem i am my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant b f benjamin franklin   november      london william franklin cccclxi to governor william franklin london   november      dear son— i wrote to you per the october packet and have not since had any line from you i spent sixteen days at lord le despencers most agreeably and returned in good health and spirits lord dartmouth came to town last week and had his first levee on wednesday at which i attended he received me very politely in his room only secretary pownall present expressing some regret that he happened to be from home when i was near him in the country where he had hoped for the pleasure of seeing me c i said i was happy to see his lordship in his present situation in which for the good of both countries i hoped he would long continue and i begged leave to recommend my son to his protection who says i is one of your governors in     america the secretary then put in—and a very good governor he is yes says my lord he has been a good governor and has kept his province in good order during times of difficulty i then said that i came at present only to pay my respects and should wait on his lordship another day on business to which he said he should always be ready to hear me and glad to see me i shall attend his levee again today on some n england affairs and hope we may now go on more smoothly but time will show as the boards are met again the ohio affair will again be put forward as soon as mr walpole comes to town mutilated in record who went lately into norfolk i am almost settled in my new apartment but removing and sorting my papers and placing my books and things has been a troublesome job i am amazed to see how books have grown upon me since my return to england i brought none with me and have now a roomful many collected in germany holland and france and consisting chiefly of such as contain knowledge that may hereafter be useful to america my love to betsey concludes at present from your affectionate father b franklin november  th p s—i was this day again at lord dartmouths levee who showed me particular respect in sending for me out of the crowd long before my turn and apologizing for having kept me so long by means of mr maseres detaining him on canada affairs he received my business too very properly not making     any objection to my acting as agent for the massachusetts without the governors approbation of my appointment as his predecessor had done whether this will continue or not is now the question for as he has the same secretaries pownall and knox probably they will remind him of the late measures and prompt him to continue them benjamin franklin   november      london timothy cccclxii to mr timothy london   november      dear sir— i received yours of aug   th by capt vanderhorst to whom i should willingly have shown any civilities in my power but i being gouty of late seldom go into the city and he has not called on me since he delivered your letter i am sorry you talk of leaving off your business with a view of getting some post it is so difficult a matter to obtain any thing of the kind that i think to leave a good trade in hopes of an office is quitting a certainty for an uncertainty and losing substance for shadow i have known so many here dangling and soliciting years for places till they were reduced to the lowest poverty and distress that i cannot but pity a man who begins to turn his thoughts that way the proverb says he who has a trade has an office of profit and honor because he does not hold it during any other mans pleasure and it affords him honest subsistence with independence i hope therefore you will alter your     mind and go on with your business i assure you it is not in my power to procure you that post you mention or any other whatever my wishes may be for your prosperity i am not sic thought here too much an american to have any interest of the kind you have done me honor in giving a son my name i wish he may live to be an honor and comfort to you benjamin franklin   november      london thomas cushing cccclxiii to thomas cushing london   november      sir— lord dartmouth our american minister came to town last week and held his first levee on wednesday when i paid my respects to him acquainting him at the same time that i should in a few days wait upon him on business from boston which i have accordingly since done and have put your petition to the king into his lordships hands that being the regular course he received me very obligingly made no objection to my acting as agent without an appointment assented to by the governor as his predecessor had done so that i hope business is getting into a better train i shall use my best endeavours in supporting the petition and write you more fully by the next ship to boston in the meantime i remain with great respect your most obedient and humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin   december      london thomas cushing london   december      sir— the above is a copy of my last a few days after my leaving your petition with lord dartmouth his lordship sent for me to discourse with me upon it after a long audience he was pleased to say that notwithstanding all i had said or could say in support and justification of the petition he was sure the presenting it at this time could not possibly produce any good that the king would be exceedingly offended but what steps his majesty would take upon it was uncertain perhaps he would require the opinion of the judges or government lawyers which would surely be against us perhaps he might lay it before parliament and so the censure of both houses would be drawn down upon us the most favorable thing to be expected was a severe reprimand to the assembly by order of his majesty the natural consequence of which must be more discontent and uneasiness in the province that possessed as he was with great goodwill for new england he was extremely unwilling that one of the first acts of his administration with regard to the massachusetts should be of so unpleasant a nature that minds had been heated and irritated on both sides of the water but he hoped those heats were now cooling and he was averse to the addition of fresh fuel that as i had delivered the petition to him officially he must present it if i insisted upon it but he wished i would first consult my constituents who might possibly on reconsideration think fit to order its being deferred i answered that the great majority with which the petition and the resolves on which it was founded   0 were carried through the house made it scarce expectable that their order would be countermanded that the slighting evading or refusing to receive petitions from the colonies on some late occasions by the parliament had occasioned a total loss of the respect for and confidence in that body formerly subsisting so strongly in america and brought on a questioning of their authority that his lordship might observe that petitions came no more from thence to parliament but to the king only that the king appeared now to be the only connexion between the two countries and that as a continued union was essentially necessary to the wellbeing of the whole empire i should be sorry to see that link weakened as the other had been that i thought it a dangerous thing for any government to refuse receiving petitions and thereby prevent the subjects from giving vent to their griefs his lordship interrupted me by replying that he did not refuse to deliver the petition that it should never justly be said of him that he interrupted the complaints of his majestys subjects and that he must and would present it as he had said before whenever i should absolutely require it but for motives of pure goodwill to the province he wished me not to insist on it till i should receive fresh orders finally considering that since the petition was ordered there had been a change in the american administration that the present minister was our friend in the repeal of the stamp act and seems still to have good dispositions towards us that you had     mentioned the probability that the house would have remonstrated on all the other grievances had not their time been taken up with the difficult business of a general valuation and since the complaint of this petition was likely alone to give offence it might perhaps be judged advisable to give the substance of all our complaints at once rather than in part and after a reprimand received i say upon the whole i thought it best not to disoblige him in the beginning of his administration by refusing him what he seemed so desirous of—a delay at least in presenting the petition till further directions should be received from my constituents if after deliberation they should send me fresh orders i shall immediately obey them and the application to the crown itself may possibly derive greater weight from the reconsideration given it while the temper of the house may be somewhat calmed by the removal of a minister who had rendered himself so obnoxious to them accordingly i consented to the delay desired wherein i hope my conduct will not be disapproved  with the greatest esteem and respect i have the honor to be sir your and the committees most obedient and most humble servant b franklin     cccclxiv preface by the british editor to the votes and proceedings of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town of boston  all accounts of the discontent so general in our colonies have of late years been industriously smothered and concealed here it seeming to suit     the views of the american minister  to have it understood that by his great abilities all faction was subdued all opposition suppressed and the whole country quieted that the true state of affairs there may be known and the true causes of that discontent well understood the following piece not the production of a private writer but the unanimous act of a large american city lately printed in new england is republished here this nation and the other nations of europe may thereby learn with more certainty the grounds of a dissension that possibly may sooner or later have consequences interesting to them all the colonies had from their first settlement been governed with more ease than perhaps can be equalled by any instance in history of dominions so distant their affection and respect for this country while they were treated with kindness produced an almost implicit obedience to the instructions of the prince and even to acts of the british parliament though the right of binding them by a legislature in which they were unrepresented was never clearly understood that respect and affection produced a     partiality in favor of every thing that was english whence their preference of english modes and manufactures their submission to restraints on the importation of foreign goods which they had but little desire to use and the monopoly we so long enjoyed of their commerce to the great enriching of our merchants and artificers the mistaken policy of the stamp act first disturbed this happy situation but the flame thereby raised was soon extinguished by its repeal and the old harmony restored with all its concomitant advantage to our commerce the subsequent act of another administration which not content with an established exclusion of foreign manufactures began to make our own merchandise dearer to the consumers there by heavy duties revived it again and combinations were entered into throughout the continent to stop trading with britain till those duties should be repealed all were accordingly repealed but one the duty on tea this was reserved professedly so as a standing claim and exercise of the right assumed by parliament of laying such duties  the colonies on this repeal retracted their agreement so far as related to all other goods except that on which the duty was retained this was trumpeted here by the minister for the colonies as a triumph     there it was considered only as a decent and equitable measure showing a willingness to meet the mother country in every advance towards a reconciliation and a disposition to a good understanding so prevalent that possibly they might soon have relaxed in the article of tea also but the system of commissioners of customs officers without end with fleets and armies for collecting and enforcing those duties being continued and these acting with much indiscretion and rashness giving great and unnecessary trouble and obstruction to business commencing unjust and vexatious suits and harassing commerce in all its branches while that the minister kept the people in a constant state of irritation by instructions which appeared to have no other end than the gratifying his private resentments  occasioned a persevering adherence to their resolutions in that particular and the event should be a lesson to ministers not to risk through pique the obstructing any one branch of trade since the course and connexion of general business may be thereby disturbed to a degree impossible to be foreseen or imagined for it appears that the colonies finding their humble petitions to have this duty repealed were rejected and treated with contempt and that the produce of the duty was applied to the rewarding with undeserved salaries and pensions every one of their enemies the duty itself became more odious and their resolution to share it more vigorous and obstinate the dutch the danes and french took this opportunity     thus offered them by our imprudence and began to smuggle their teas into the plantations at first this was something difficult but at length as all business is improved by practice it became easy a coast fifteen hundred miles in length could not in all parts be guarded even by the whole navy of england especially where their restraining authority was by all the inhabitants deemed unconstitutional the smuggling of course considered as patriotism the needy wretches too who with small salaries were trusted to watch the ports day and night in all weathers found it easier and more profitable not only to wink but to sleep in their beds the merchants pay being more generous than the kings other india goods also which by themselves would not have made a smuggling voyage sufficiently profitable accompanied tea to advantage and it is feared the cheap french silks formerly rejected as not to the tastes of the colonies may have found their way with the wares of india and now established themselves in the popular use and opinion it is supposed that at least a million of americans drink tea twice a day which at the first cost here can scarce be reckoned at less than half a guinea a head per annum this market that in the five years which have run on since the act passed would have paid two million five hundred thousand guineas for tea alone into the coffers of the company we have wantonly lost to foreigners meanwhile it is said the duties have so diminished that the whole remittance of the last year amounted to no more than the pitiful sum of eightyfive     pounds  for the expense of some hundred thousands in armed ships and soldiers to support the officers hence the tea and other india goods which might have been sold in america remain rotting in the companys warehouses  while those of foreign ports are known to be cleared by the american demand hence in some degree the companys inability to pay their bills the sinking of their stock by which millions of property have been annihilated the lowering of their dividend whereby so many must be distressed the loss to government of the stipulated four hundred thousand pounds a year  which must make a proportionable reduction in our savings towards the discharge of our enormous debt and hence in part the severe blow suffered by credit in general  to the ruin of many families the stagnation of business in spitalfields and manchester through want of vent for their goods with other future evils which as they cannot from the numerous and secret connexions in general commerce easily be foreseen can hardly be avoided     benjamin franklin   december      london deborah franklin cccclxv to mrs deborah franklin london   december      my dear child— i received yours of october   th and one without date which i suppose to be written since capts all osborne and sparkes are arrived and a barrel of apples with another of cranberries are come i know not yet by which of them i am glad to hear you continue so well and that the pain in your side and head have left you eat light foods such as fowls mutton etc and but little beef or bacon avoid strong tea and use what exercise you can by these means you will preserve your health better and be less subject to lowness of spirits it seems polly pitts is really dead i suppose you know that we have a mortgage on her lots mr galloway took it for me you do not tell me whether any thing has been done about it or whether any interest was ever paid nor have you ever told me whether mr maugridges executors have paid off his mortgage to me and that to the insurance office i wish you would give my love to mrs montgomery and all inquiring friends mrs stevenson and polly hewson and sally franklin present their love the latter adds her duty she is about to be married to a farmers son i shall miss her as she is nimblefooted and willing to run of errands and wait upon me and has been very serviceable to me for some years so that i have not kept a man     i am ever my dear debby your affectionate husband b f p s—have just opened the apples and cranberries which i find in good order all sound thanks for your kind care in sending them benjamin franklin   december      london joseph galloway cccclxvi to joseph galloway london   december      dear friend— i am glad you are returned again to a seat in the assembly where your abilities are so useful and necessary in the service of your country we must not in the course of public life expect immediate approbation and immediate grateful acknowledgement of our services but let us persevere through abuse and even injury the internal satisfaction of a good conscience is always present and time will do us justice in the minds of the people even those at present the most prejudiced against us i have given dr denormandie a recommendation to a friend in geneva for which place he set out this morning and i shall be glad of any opportunity of serving him when he returns to london i see by the pennsylvania gazette of october   st that you are continued speaker and myself agent but i have no line from you or the committee relative to instructions perhaps i shall hear from you by falconer i find myself upon very good terms with our new  00 minister lord dartmouth who we have reason to think means well to the colonies i believe all are now sensible that nothing is to be got by contesting with or oppressing us two circumstances have diverted me lately one was that being at the court of exchequer on some business of my own i there met with one of the commissioners of the stamp office who told me he attended with a memorial from that board to be allowed in their accounts the difference between their expense in endeavouring to establish those offices in america and the amount of what they received which from canada and the west india islands was but about fifteen hundred pounds while the expense if i remember right was above twelve thousand pounds being for stamps and stamping with paper and parchment returned upon their hands freight c the other is the present difficulties of the india company and of government on their account the company have accepted bills which they find themselves unable to pay though they have the value of two millions in tea and other india goods in their stores perishing under a want of demand their credit thus suffering and their stock falling one hundred and twenty per cent whereby the government will lose the four hundred thousand pounds per annum it having been stipulated that it should no longer be paid if the dividend fell to that mark and although it is known that the american market is lost by continuing the duty on tea and that we are supplied by the dutch who doubtless take the opportunity of smuggling other india goods among us with the tea  0  so that for the five years past we might probably have otherwise taken off the greatest part of what the company have on hand and so have prevented their present embarrassment yet the honor of government is supposed to forbid the repeal of the american tea duty while the amount of all the duties goes on decreasing so that the balance of this year does not as i have it from good authority exceed eighty pounds after paying the collection not reckoning the immense expense of guardacostas c can an american help smiling at these blunders though in a national light they are truly deplorable with the sincerest esteem and inviolable attachment i am my dear friend ever most affectionately yours b franklin benjamin franklin   december      london abel james cccclxvii to mr abel james london   december      dear friend— i duly received your favors of september   d and october  th and am glad the purchase proves acceptable our friend dr evans has remitted me the bill you mention drawn for the produce of the silk it exceeds what i paid and i wait orders for the disposition of the overplus particularly what i am to pay wheeler for his services in the business i do not at this distance understand the politics of your last election why so many of the members declined the service and why yourself and mr fox  0  were omitted which i much regret while goddard was voted for by so great a number another year i hope will set all right the people seldom continue long in the wrong when it is nobodys interest to mislead them it must be very discouraging to our friend galloway to see his long and faithful services repaid with abuse and ingratitude but let him persevere in welldoing and all will end well and to his final satisfaction and though it may be inconvenient to your private affairs to attend public business i hope neither you nor mr fox will through resentment of the present slight decline the service when again called upon by your country with great and sincere esteem i am ever dear sir your affectionate friend and most obedient servant b f benjamin franklin   december      london william franklin cccclxviii to william franklin london   december      dear son— i have received yours of oct  th  th and   th i cannot imagine what became of my letter of august  d from may place it was however of no great importance mr denormandie is gone this day to geneva i gave him a letter of recommendation to a friend there i am persuaded that your packets were not opened at the office for though a secretary of state has the power of ordering letters to be opened i think it is seldom used but in times of war rebellion or on  0  some great public occasion and i have heard they have means of copying the seal so exactly as that it cannot be discovered that the letters have been looked into it is plain therefore that whoever rubbed your packets open had not the use of such means and yet as you are satisfied it was not done on your side the water i suspect the lettercarrier might be corrupted and the business done between the office in lombard street and my house when a packet arrives a special messenger goes directly from the office with the public letters before the sorting is finished mine have been sometimes sent by the same messenger who called on me on his way to lord hs sometimes on his return and as he told mr strahan that his letters to you were often returned to me from america and yours to him sent through my hands to be seen he supposed by me before delivery and since his resignation your packets do not appear to have suffered the least violation i fancy the rubbing them open may possibly have been the ingenuity of mr secretary knox by the list you have sent me i find none of the papers missing another circumstance in favor of this opinion is that no letters to me were thus abused but yours and those from the assembly of boston this i think clears the person you suspected and rather fixes the above conjecture i have not seen your speech at the opening of your last session but i hear it has been commended by the ministry i return mr foxcrofts letters as you desire i make no remarks on the reports he mentions i know  0  not who is meant by the hero of your speech nor will i say more at present of the ohio affair than that it is not yet quite secure and therefore i still advise discretion in speaking of it dr price has been so good as to give me his opinion of your scheme which i send hoping it may be of use i suppose you have his book referred to in the paper some acknowledgment or thanks should be sent him for the trouble he has taken i continue very well thanks to god on monday last i was chosen into the council of the royal society for the fourth time our friend sir john pringle was elected president which is very agreeable to him i shall send you a teaurn by the first ship i just now hear that the november packet is arrived so i stop here till i receive the letters that come by her these words are crossed out in the record apparently in the same ink just now comes to hand yours of november  d whereby i find mine of august  d is received i am glad to learn that you and your neighbouring governors are so sociable i shall communicate what you write about the virginia grants at present i can only add that i am with love to betsey your ever affectionate father b franklin  0  benjamin franklin   december      london m dubourg cccclxix answer to m dubourgs queries respecting the armonica london   december      when the glasses are ranged on the horizontal spindle or to make use of your expression enfilés and each one is definitely fixed in its place the whole of the largest glass appears at the extremity to the left the following one nearly enclosed in the preceding one shows only about an inch of its border which advances so much further than the edge of the larger glass and so in succession each glass exceeds the one containing it leaving by this placement an uncovered border on which the fingers may be applied the glasses do not touch one another but they are so near as not to admit a finger to pass between them so that the interior border is not susceptible of being rubbed the finger is to be applied flat on the borders of the largest glasses and on the borders of the smaller but in part on the borders and in part on the edges of the glasses of an intermediate size nothing but experience can instruct with respect to this manutation fingering because the differentsized glasses require to be touched differently some nearer the edge and others farther from it a few hours exercise will teach this b f  0  some directions for drawing out the tones from the glasses of the armonica before you sit down to play the fingers should be well washed with soap and water and the soap well rinsed off the glasses must be always kept perfectly clean from the least greasiness therefore suffer nobody to touch them with unwashed hands for even the common slight natural greasiness of the skin rubbed on them will prevent their sounding for a long time you must be provided with a bottle of rainwater spring water is generally too hard and produces a harsh tone and a middling sponge in a little slopbowl in which you must keep so much of the water that the sponge may be always very wet in a teacup keep also ready some fine scraped chalk free from grit to be used on occasion the fingers when you begin to play should not only be wet on the surface but the skin a little soaked which is readily done by pressing them hard a few times in the sponge the first thing after setting the glasses in motion is to pass the sponge slowly along from the biggest glass to the smallest suffering it to rest on each glass during at least one revolution of the glasses whereby they will all be made moderately wet if too much water is left on them they will not sound so readily if the instrument is near a window let the window be shut or the curtain drawn as wind or sunshine on the glasses dries them too fast when these particulars are all attended to and  0  the directions observed the tone comes forth finely with the slightest pressure of the fingers imaginable and you swell it at pleasure by adding a little more pressure no instrument affording more shades if one may so speak of the forte piano one wetting with the sponge will serve for a piece of music twice as long as handels waterpiece unless the air be uncommonly drying but a number of thin slices of sponge placed side by side and their ends held fast between two stripes of wood like rulers of a length equal to the glasses and placed so that the loose ends of the sponges may touch the glasses behind and by that means keep them constantly wet is very convenient where one proposes to play a long time the sponges being properly wetted will supply the glasses sufficiently a whole evening and touching the glasses lightly do not in the least hurt the sound the powder of chalk is useful two ways fingers after much playing sometimes begin to draw out a tone less smooth and soft and you feel as well as hear a small degree of sharpness in this case if you dip the ends of your wet fingers in the chalk so as to take up a little and rub the same well on the skin it will immediately recover the smoothness of tone desired and if the glasses have been sullied by handling or the fingers not being just washed have some little greasiness on them so that the sounds cannot easily be produced chalk so used will clean both glasses and fingers and the sounds will come out to your wish a little practice will make all this familiar and  0  you will also find by trials what part of the fingers most readily produces the sound from particular glasses and whether they require to be touched on the edge chiefly or a little more on the side as different glasses require a different touch some pretty full on the flat side of the brim to bring out the best tone others more on the edge and some of the largest may need the touch of two fingers at once cccclxx settlement on the ohio river  report of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations on the petition of the honorable thomas walpole and his associates for a grant of lands on the river ohio in north america my lords— pursuant to your lordships order of the   th may    0 we have taken into our consideration  0  the humble memorial of the honorable thomas walpole benjamin franklin john sargent and samuel wharton esquires in behalf of themselves and their associates setting forth among other things that they presented a petition to his majesty in council for a grant of lands in america parcel of the lands purchased by government of the indians in consideration of a price to be paid   0 in purchase of the same that in pursuance of a suggestion which arose when the said petition was under consideration of the lords commissioners for trade and plantations the memorialists presented a petition to the lords commissioners of the treasury proposing to purchase a larger tract of land on the river ohio in america sufficient for a separate government whereupon their lordships were pleased to acquaint the memorialists they had no objection to accepting the proposals made by them with respect to the purchasemoney and quitrent to be paid for the said tract of land if it should be thought advisable by those departments of government to whom it belonged to judge of the propriety of the grant both in point of policy and justice that the grant should be made in consequence whereof the memorialists humbly renew their application that a grant of said lands may be made to them reserving therein to all persons their just and legal rights to any parts or parcels of lands which may be comprehended within the tract prayed for by the memorialists whereupon we beg leave to report to your lordships— i that according to the description of the tract of land prayed for by the memorialists which description is annexed to their memorial it appears to us to contain part of the dominion of virginia to the south of the river ohio and to extend several degrees of longitude westward from the western ridge of the appalachian mountains as will more fully appear to your lordships from the annexed sketch of the said tract which we have since caused     to be delineated with as much exactness as possible and herewith submit to your lordships to the end that your lordships may judge with the greater precision of the situation of the lands prayed for in the memorial ii from this sketch your lordships will observe that a very considerable part of the lands prayed for lies beyond the line which has in consequence of his majestys orders for that purpose been settled by treaty as well with the tribes of the six nations and their confederates as with the cherokee indians as the boundaryline between his majestys territories and their huntinggrounds and as the faith of the crown is pledged in the most solemn manner both to the six nations and to the cherokees that notwithstanding the former of these nations had ceded the property in the lands to his majesty yet no settlement shall be made beyond that line it is our duty to report to your lordships our opinion that it would on that account be highly improper to comply with the request of the memorial so far as it includes any lands beyond the said line it remains therefore that we report to your lordships our opinion how far it may consist with good policy and with justice that his majesty should comply with that part of the memorial which relates to those lands which are situated to the east of that line and are part of the dominion of virginia iii and first with regard to the policy we take leave to remind your lordships of that principle which was adopted by this board and approved and confirmed by his majesty immediately after the     treaty of paris viz the confining the western extent of settlements to such a distance from the seacoast as that those settlements should lie within the reach of the trade and commerce of this kingdom upon which the strength and riches of it depend and also of the exercise of that authority and jurisdiction which was conceived to be necessary for the preservation of the colonies in a due subordination to and dependence upon the mother country and these we apprehend to have been two capital objects of his majestys proclamation of the  th of october      by which his majesty declares it to be his royal will and pleasure to reserve under his sovereignty protection and dominion for the use of the indians all the lands not included within the three new governments the limits of which are described therein as also all the lands and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the west and northwest and by which all persons are forbid to make any purchases or settlements whatever or to take possession of any of the lands above reserved without special license for that purpose iv it is true indeed that partly from want of precision in describing the line intended to be marked out by the proclamation of      and partly from a consideration of justice in regard to legal titles to lands which had been settled beyond that line it has been since thought fit to enter into engagements with the indians for fixing a more precise and determinate boundary between his majestys territories and their huntinggrounds     v by this boundary so far as regards the case now in question your lordships will observe that the huntinggrounds of the indians are reduced within narrower limits than were specified by the proclamation of      we beg leave however to submit to your lordships that the same principles of policy in reference to settlements at so great a distance from the seacoast as to be out of the reach of all advantageous intercourse with this kingdom continue to exist in their full force and spirit and though various propositions for erecting new colonies in the interior parts of america have been in consequence of this extension of the boundary line submitted to the consideration of government particularly in that part of the country wherein are situated the lands now prayed for with a view to that object yet the dangers and disadvantages of complying with such proposals have been so obvious as to defeat every attempt made for carrying them into execution vi many objections besides those which we have already stated occur to us to propositions of this kind but as every argument on this subject is collected together with great force and precision in a representation made to his majesty by the commissioners for trade and plantations in march      we beg leave to state them to your lordships in their words in that representation they deliver their opinion upon a proposition for settling new colonies in the interior country as follows viz the proposition of forming inland colonies in america is we humbly conceive entirely new it     adopts principles in respect to american settlements different from what has hitherto been the policy of this kingdom and leads to a system which if pursued through all its consequences is in the present state of that country of the greatest importance the great object of colonizing upon the continent of north america has been to improve and extend the commerce navigation and manufactures of this kingdom upon which its strength and security depend   by promoting the advantageous fishery carried on upon the northern coast   by encouraging the growth and culture of naval stores and of raw materials to be transported hither in exchange for perfect manufactures and other merchandise   by securing a supply of lumber provisions and other necessaries for the support of our establishments in the american islands in order to answer these salutary purposes it has been the policy of this kingdom to confine her settlements as much as possible to the seacoast and not to extend them to places inaccessible to shipping and consequently more out of the reach of commerce a plan which at the same time that it secured the attainment of these commercial objects had the further political advantage of guarding against all interfering of foreign powers and of enabling this kingdom to keep up a superior naval force in those seas by the actual possession of such rivers and harbors as were proper stations for fleets in time of war     such may it please your majesty have been the considerations inducing that plan of policy hitherto pursued in the settlement of your majestys american colonies with which the private interest and sagacity of the settlers coöperated from the first establishments formed upon that continent it was upon these principles and with these views that government undertook the settlement of nova scotia in      and it was from a view of the advantages represented to arise from it in these different articles that it was so liberally supported by the aid of parliament the same motives though operating in a less degree and applying to fewer subjects did as we humbly conceive induce the forming the colonies of georgia east florida and west florida to the south and the making those provincial arrangements in the proclamation of      by which the interior country was left to the possession of the indians having thus briefly stated what has been the policy of this kingdom in respect to colonizing in america it may be necessary to take a cursory view of what has been the effect of it in those colonies where there has been sufficient time for that effect to discover itself because if it shall appear from the present state of these settlements and the progress they have made that they are likely to produce the advantages above stated it will we humbly apprehend be a very strong argument against forming settlements in the interior country more especially when every advantage derived from an established     country would naturally tend to draw the stream of population fertility of soil and temperature of climate offering superior incitements to settlers who exposed to few hardships and struggling with few difficulties could with little labor earn an abundance for their own wants but without a possibility of supplying ours with any considerable quantities nor would these inducements be confined in their operation to foreign emigrants determining their choice where to settle but would act most powerfully upon the inhabitants of the northern and southern latitudes of your majestys american dominions who ever suffering under the opposite extremes of heat and cold would be equally tempted by a moderate climate to abandon latitudes peculiarly adapted to the production of those things which are by nature denied to us and for the whole of which we should without their assistance stand indebted to and dependent upon other countries it is well known that antecedent to the year      all that part of the seacoast of the british empire in america which extends northeast from the province of maine to canceau in nova scotia and from thence north to the mouth of the st lawrence river lay waste and neglected though naturally affording or capable by art of producing every species of naval stores the seas abounding with whale cod and other valuable fish and having many great rivers bays and harbors fit for the reception of ships of war thus circumstanced a consideration of the great commercial advantages which would follow from securing the possession of     this country combined with the evidence of the value set upon it by our enemies who during the war which terminated at that period had at an immense expense attempted to wrest it from us induced that plan for the settlement of nova scotia to which we have before referred and which being prosecuted with vigor though at a very large expense to this kingdom secured the possession of that province and formed those establishments which contributed so greatly to facilitate and promote the success of your majestys arms in the late war the establishment of government in this part of america having opened to the view and information of your majestys subjects in other colonies the great commercial advantages to be derived from it induced a zeal for migration and associations were formed for taking up lands and making settlements in this province by principal persons residing in these colonies in consequence of these associations upwards of ten thousand souls have passed from those colonies into nova scotia who have either engaged in the fisheries or become exporters of lumber and provisions to the west indies and further settlements to the extent of twentyone townships of one hundred thousand acres each have been engaged to be made there by many of the principal persons in pennsylvania whose names and association for that purpose now lie before your majesty in council the government of massachusetts bay as well as the proprietors of large tracts to the eastward of the province of maine excited by the success of     these settlements are giving every encouragement to the like settlements in that valuable country lying between them and nova scotia and the proprietors of the twelve townships lately laid out there by the massachusetts government now solicit your majesty for a confirmation of their title such may it please your majesty is the present state of the progress making in the settlement of the northern parts of the seacoasts of north america in consequence of what appears to have been the policy adopted by this kingdom and many persons of rank and substance here are proceeding to carry into execution the plan which your majesty pursuing the same principles of commercial policy has approved for the settlement of the islands of st john and cape breton and of the newestablished colonies to the south and therefore as we are fully convinced that the encouraging settlements upon the seacoast of north america is founded in the true principles of commercial policy and as we find upon examination that the happy effects of that policy are now beginning to open themselves in the establishment of those branches of commerce culture and navigation upon which the strength wealth and security of this kingdom depend we cannot be of opinion that it would in any view be advisable to divert your majestys subjects in america from the pursuit of those important objects by adopting measures of a new policy at an expense to this kingdom which in its present state it is unable to bear this may it please your majesty being the     light in which we view the proposition of colonizing in the interior country considered as a general principle of policy we shall in the next place proceed to examine the several arguments urged in support of the particular establishments now recommended these arguments appear to us reducible to the following general propositions viz first that such colonies will promote population and increase the demands for and consumption of british manufactures secondly that they will secure the fur trade and prevent an illicit trade or interfering of french or spaniards with the indians thirdly that they will be a defence and protection to the old colonies against the indians fourthly that they will contribute to lessen the present heavy expense of supplying provisions to the distant forts and garrisons lastly that they are necessary in respect to the inhabitants already residing in those places where they are proposed to be established who require some form of civil government after what we have already stated with respect to the policy of encouraging colonies in the interior country as a general principle we trust it will not be necessary to enter into an ample discussion of the arguments brought to support the foregoing propositions we admit as an undeniable principle of true policy that with a view to prevent manufactures it is necessary and proper to open an extent of territory for colonization proportioned to the increase of   0 people as a large number of inhabitants cooped up in narrow limits without a sufficiency of land for produce would be compelled to convert their attention and industry to manufactures but we submit whether the encouragement given to the settlement of the colonies upon the seacoast and the effect which such encouragement has had have not already effectually provided for this object as well as for increasing the demand for and consumption of british manufactures an advantage which in our humble opinion would not be promoted by these new colonies which being proposed to be established at the distance of above fifteen hundred miles from the sea and in places which upon the fullest evidence are found to be utterly inaccessible to shipping will from their inability to find returns wherewith to pay for the manufactures of great britain be probably led to manufacture for themselves a consequence which experience shows has constantly attended in a greater or lesser degree every inland settlement and therefore ought in our humble opinion to be carefully guarded against by encouraging the settlement of that extensive tract of seacoast hitherto unoccupied which together with the liberty that the inhabitants of the middle colonies will have in consequence of the proposed boundary line with the indians of gradually extending themselves backwards will more effectually and beneficially answer the object of encouraging population and consumption than the erection of new governments such gradual extension might through the medium of a continued population upon even the same extent     of territory preserve a communication of mutual commercial benefits between its extremest parts and great britain impossible to exist in colonies separated by immense tracts of unpeopled desert as to the effect which it is supposed the colonies may have to increase and promote the fur trade and to prevent all contraband trade or intercourse between the indians under your majestys protection and the french or spaniards it does appear to us that the extension of the fur trade depends entirely upon the indians being undisturbed in the possession of their huntinggrounds that all colonizing does in its nature and must in its consequences operate to the prejudice of that branch of commerce and that the french and spaniards would be left in possession of a great part of what remained as new orleans would still continue the best and surest market as to the protection which it is supposed these new colonies may be capable of affording to the old ones it will in our opinion appear upon the slightest view of their situation that so far from affording protection to the old colonies they will stand most in need of it themselves it cannot be denied that new colonies would be of advantage in raising provisions for the supply of such forts and garrisons as may be kept up in the neighborhood of them but as the degree of utility will be proportioned to the number and situation of these forts and garrisons which upon the result of the present inquiry it may be thought advisable to continue so the force of argument will depend upon that event     the present french inhabitants in the neighborhood of the lakes will in our humble opinion be sufficient to furnish with provisions whatever posts may be necessary to be continued there and as there are also french inhabitants settled in some parts of the country lying upon the mississippi between the rivers illinois and the ohio it is to be hoped that a sufficient number of these may be induced to fix their abode where the same convenience and advantage may be derived from them but if no such circumstance were to exist and no such assistance to be expected from it the objections stated to the plan now under our consideration are superior to this or any other advantage it can produce and although civil establishments have frequently rendered the expense of an armed force necessary for their protection one of the many objections to these now proposed yet we humbly presume there never has been an instance of a government instituted merely with a view to supply a body of troops with suitable provisions nor is it necessary in these instances for the settlements already existing as above described which being formed under military establishments and ever subjected to military authority do not in our humble opinion require any other superintendence than that of the military officers commanding at these posts in addition to this opinion of the board of trade expressed in the foregoing recital we further beg leave to refer your lordships to the opinion of the commanderinchief of his majestys forces in north america who in a letter laid before us by the earl     of hillsborough delivers his sentiments with regard to settlements in the interior parts of america in the following words viz vii as to increasing the settlements to respectable provinces and to colonization in general terms in the remote countries i conceive it altogether inconsistent with sound policy for there is little appearance that the advantages will arise from it which nations expect when they send out colonies into foreign countries they can give no encouragement to the fishery and though the country might afford some kind of naval stores the distance would be too far to transport them and for the same reason they could not supply the sugar islands with lumber and provisions as for the raising wine silk and other commodities the same may be said of the present colonies without planting others for the purpose at so vast a distance but on the supposition that they would be raised their very long transportation must probably make them too dear for any market i do not apprehend the inhabitants could have any commodities to barter for manufactures except skins and furs which will naturally decrease as the country increases in people and the deserts are cultivated so that in the course of a few years necessity would force them to provide manufactures of some kind for themselves and when all connection upheld by commerce with the mother country shall cease it may be expected that an independency on her government will soon follow the pretence of forming barriers will have no end wherever we     settle however remote there must be a frontier and there is room enough for the colonists to spread within our present limits for a century to come if we reflect how the people of themselves have gradually retired from the coast we shall be convinced they want no encouragement to desert the seacoast and go into the back countries where the lands are better and got upon easier terms they are already almost out of the reach of law and government neither the endeavors of government nor fear of indians has kept them properly within bounds and it is apparently most for the interest of great britain to confine the colonies on the side of the back country and to direct their settlements along the seacoast where millions of acres are yet uncultivated the lower provinces are still thinly inhabited and brought to the point of perfection that has been aimed at for the mutual benefit of great britain and themselves although america may supply the mother country with many articles few of them are yet supplied in quantities equal to her consumption the quantity of iron transported is not great of hemp very small and there are many other commodities not necessary to enumerate which america has not yet been able to raise notwithstanding the encouragement given her by bounties and premiums the laying open new tracts of fertile territory in moderate climates might lessen her present produce for it is the passion of every man to be a landholder and the people have a natural disposition to rove in search of good lands however distant it may     be a question likewise whether colonization of the kind could be effected without an indian war and fighting for every inch of ground the indians have long been jealous of our power and have no patience in seeing us approach their towns and settle upon their huntinggrounds atonements may be made for a fraud discovered in a trader and even the murder of some of their tribes but encroachments upon their lands have often produced serious consequences the springs of the last general war are to be discovered near the alleghany mountains and upon the banks of the ohio it is so obvious that settlers might raise provision to feed the troops cheaper than it can be transported from the country below that it is not necessary to explain it but i must own i know no other use in settlements nor can give any other reason for supporting forts than to protect the settlements and keep the settlers in subjection to government i conceive that to procure all the commerce it will afford and at as little expense to ourselves as we can is the only object we should have in view in the interior country for a century to come and i imagine it might be effected by proper management without either forts or settlements our manufactures are as much desired by the indians as their peltry is sought for by us what was originally deemed a superfluity or a luxury by the natives is now become a necessary they are disused to the bow and can neither hunt nor make war without firearms powder and lead the british provinces can only supply them with their necessaries which     they know and for their own sakes would protect the trader which they actually do at present it would remain with us to prevent the traders being guilty of frauds and impositions and to pursue the same methods to that end as are taken in the southern district and i must confess though the plan pursued in that district might be improved by proper laws to support it that i do not know a better or more economical plan for the management of trade there are neither forts nor settlements in the southern department and there are both in the northern department and your lordships will be the best judge which of them has given you the least trouble in which we have had the fewest quarrels with or complaints from the indians i know of nothing so liable to bring on a serious quarrel with indians as an invasion of their property let the savages enjoy their deserts in quiet little bickerings that may unavoidably sometimes happen may soon be accommodated and i am of opinion independent of the motives of common justice and humanity that the principles of interest and policy should induce us rather to protect than molest them were they driven from their forests the peltry trade would decrease and it is not impossible that worse savages would take refuge in them for they might then become the asylum of fugitive negroes and idle vagabonds escaped from justice who in time might become formidable and subsist by rapine and plundering the lower countries viii the opinions delivered in the foregoing recitals are so accurate and precise as to make it     almost unnecessary to add any thing more but we beg leave to lay before your lordships the sentiments of his majestys governor of georgia upon the subject of large grants in the interior parts of america whose knowledge and experience in the affairs of the colonies give great weight to his opinion in a letter to us on the subject of the mischiefs attending such grants he expresses himself in the following manner viz and now my lords i beg your patience a moment while i consider this matter in a more extensive point of view and go a little further in declaring my sentiments and opinion with respect to the granting of large bodies of land in the back parts of the province of georgia or in any other of his majestys northern colonies at a distance from the seacoast or from such parts of any province as is already settled and inhabited and this matter my lords appears to me in a very serious and alarming light and i humbly conceive may be attended with the greatest and worst of consequences for my lords if a vast territory be granted to any set of gentlemen who really mean to people it and actually do so it must draw and carry out a great number of people from great britain and i apprehend they will soon become a kind of separate and independent people and who will set up for themselves that they will soon have manufactures of their own that they will neither take supplies from the mother country nor from the provinces at the back of which they are settled that being at a distance from the seat of government     courts magistrates etc etc they will be out of the reach and control of law and government that it will become a receptacle and kind of asylum for offenders who will fly from justice to such new country or colony and therefore crimes and offences will be committed not only by the inhabitants of such new settlements but elsewhere and pass with impunity and that in process of time and perhaps at no great distance they will become formidable enough to oppose his majestys authority disturb government and even give law to the other or firstsettled part of the country and throw every thing into confusion my lords i hope i shall not be thought impertinent when i give my opinion freely in a matter of so great consequence as i conceive this to be and my lords i apprehend that in all the american colonies great care should be taken that the lands on the seacoast should be thick settled with inhabitants and well cultivated and improved and that the settlements should be gradually extended back into the province and as much connected as possible to keep the people together in as narrow a compass as the nature of the lands and state of things will admit of and by which means there would probably become only one general view and interest amongst them and the power of government and law would of course naturally and easily go with them and matters thereby properly regulated and kept in due order and obedience and they would have no idea of resisting or transgressing either without being amenable to justice and subject to punishment for offences they may commit     but my lords to suffer a kind of province within a province and one that may indeed must in process of time become superior and too big for the head or original settlement or seat of government to me conveys with it many ideas of consequences of such a nature as i apprehend are extremely dangerous and improper and it would be the policy of government to avoid and prevent whilst in their power to do so my ideas my lords are not chimerical i know something of the situation and state of things in america and from some little occurrences or instances that have already really happened i can very easily figure to myself what may and in short what will certainly happen if not prevented in time ix at the same time that we submit the foregoing reasons against colonization in the interior country to your lordships consideration it is proper we should take notice of one argument which has been invariably held forth in support of every proposition of this nature and upon which the present proponents appear to lay great stress it is urged that such is the state of the country now proposed to be granted and erected into a separate government that no endeavors on the part of the crown can avail to prevent its being settled by those who by the increase of population in the middle colonies are continually emigrating to the westward and forming themselves into colonies in that country without the intervention or control of government and who if suffered to continue in that lawless state   0 of anarchy and confusion will commit such abuses as cannot fail of involving us in quarrel and dispute with the indians and thereby endangering the security of his majestys colonies we admit that this is an argument that deserves attention and we rather take notice of it in this place because some of the objections stated by governor wright lose their force upon the supposition that the grants against which he argues are to be erected into separate governments but we are clearly of opinion that his arguments do in the general view of them as applied to the question of granting lands in the interior parts of america stand unanswerable and admitting that the setlers in the country in question are as numerous as report states them to be yet we submit to your lordships that this is a fact which does in the nature of it operate strongly in point of argument against what is proposed for if the foregoing reasoning has any weight it certainly ought to induce your lordships to advise his majesty to take every method to check the progress of these settlements and not to make such grants of the land as will have an immediate tendency to encourage them a measure which we conceive is altogether as unnecessary as it is impolitic as we see nothing to hinder the government of virginia from extending the laws and constitution of that colony to such persons as may have already settled there under legal titles x and there is one objection suggested by governor wright to the extension of settlements in the interior country which we submit deserves your     lordships particular attention viz the encouragement that is thereby held out to the emigration of his majestys european subjects an argument which in the present peculiar situation of this kingdom demands very serious consideration and has for some time past had so great weight with this board that it has induced us to deny our concurrence to many proposals for grants of land even in those parts of the continent of america where in all other respects we are of opinion that it consists with the true policy of this kingdom to encourage settlements and this consideration of the certain bad consequences which must result from a continuance of such imigrations as have lately taken place from various parts of his majestys european dominions added to the constant drains to africa to the east indies and to the newceded islands will we trust with what has been before stated be a sufficient answer to every argument that can be urged in support of the present memorial so far as regards the consideration of it in point of policy xi with regard to the propriety in point of justice of making the grant desired we presume this consideration can have reference only to the case of such persons who have already possession of lands in that part of the country under legal titles derived from grants made by the governor and council of virginia upon which case we have only to observe that it does appear to us that there are some such possessions held by persons who are not parties to the present memorial and therefore if your lordships shall be of opinion that the making the grant     desired would notwithstanding the reservation proposed in respect to such titles have the effect to disturb those possessions or to expose the proprietors to suit and litigation we do conceive that in that case the grant would be objectionable in point of justice xii upon the whole therefore we cannot recommend to your lordships to advise his majesty to comply with the prayer of this memorial either as to the erection of any parts of the lands into a separate government or the making a grant of them to the memoralists but on the contrary we are of opinion that settlements in that distant part of the country should be as much discouraged as possible and that in order thereto it will be expedient not only that the orders which have been given to the governor of virginia not to make any further grants beyond the line prescribed by the proclamation of      should be continued and enforced but that another proclamation should be issued declaratory of his majestys resolution not to allow for the present any new settlements beyond that line and to forbid all persons from taking up or settling any lands in that part of the country we are my lords your lordships most obedient and most humble servants whitehall april             dr franklins answer to the foregoing report i the first paragraph of the report we apprehend was intended to establish two propositions as facts viz first that the tract of land agreed for with the lords commissioners of the treasury contains part of the dominion of virginia secondly that it extends several degrees of longitude westward from the western ridge of the alleghany mountains on the first proposition we shall only remark that no part of the above tract is to the eastward of the alleghany mountains and that those mountains must be considered as the true western boundary of virginia for the king was not seized and possessed of a right to the country westward of the mountains until his majesty purchased it in the year      from the six nations and since that time there has not been any annexation of such purchase or of any part thereof to the colony of virginia on the second proposition we shall just observe that the lords commissioners for trade and plantations appear to us to be as erroneous in this as in the former proposition for their lordships say that the tract of land under consideration extends several degrees of longitude westward the truth is that it is not more on a medium than one degree and a half of longitude from the western ridge of the alleghany mountains to the river ohio ii it appears by the second paragraph as if the lords commissioners for trade and plantations     apprehended that the lands southwesterly of the boundary line marked on a map annexed to their lordships report were either claimed by the cherokees or were their huntinggrounds or were the huntinggrounds of the six nations and their confederates as to any claim of the cherokees to the above country it is altogether new and indefensible and never was heard of until the appointment of mr stuart to the superintendency of the southern colonies about the year      and this we flatter ourselves will not only be obvious from the following state of facts but that the right to all the country on the southerly side of the river ohio quite to the cherokee river is now undoubtedly vested in the king by the grant which the six nations made to his majesty at fort stanwix in november      in short the lands from the great kenhawa to the cherokee river were never either the dwelling or huntinggrounds of the cherokees but formerly belonged to and were inhabited by the shawanese until such time as they were conquered by the six nations mr colden the present lieutenantgovernor of new york in his history of the five nations observes that about the year      the five nations being amply supplied by the english with firearms and ammunition gave a full swing to their warlike genius they carried their arms as far south as carolina to the northward of new england and as far west as the river mississippi over a vast country which extended twelve hundred miles     in length from north to south and about six hundred miles in breadth where they entirely destroyed whole nations of whom there are no accounts remaining among the english in   0  the five nations put all their huntinglands under the protection of the english as appears by the records and by the recital and confirmation thereof in their deed to the king of the  th september      and governor pownall who many years ago diligently searched into the rights of the natives and in particular into those of the northern confederacy says in his book entitled the administration of the colonies the right of the fivenation confederacy to the huntinglands of ohio ticûcksouchrondite and scaniaderiada by the conquest they made in subduing the shaôanoes delawares as we call them twigtwees and oilinois may be fairly proved as they stood possessed thereof at the peace of ryswick      and confirmatory hereof mr lewis evans a gentleman of great american knowledge in his map of the middle colonies published in america in the year      has laid down the country on the southeasterly side of the river ohio as the huntinglands of the six nations and in his analysis to this map he expressly says the shawanese who were formerly one of the most considerable nations of those parts of america whose seat extended from kentucky southwestward to the mississippi have been subdued by the confederates or six nations and the country since became their property    no nation held out     with greater resolution and bravery and although they have been scattered in all parts for a while they are again collected on ohio under the dominion of the confederates at a congress held in the year      by the provinces of pennsylvania maryland and virginia with the six nations the commissioners of virginia in a speech to the sachems and warriors of that confederacy say tell us what nations of indians you conquered any lands from in virginia how long it is since and what possession you have had and if it does appear that there is any land on the borders of virginia that the six nations have a right to we are willing to make you satisfaction to this speech the six nations gave the following animated and decisive answer all the world knows we conquered the several nations living on susquehanna cohongoranto that is potomac and on the back of the great mountains in virginia the conoyucksuckroona cocknowwasroonan tohoairoughroonan and connutskinoughroonaw feel the effects of our conquests being now a part of our nations and their land at our disposal we know very well it hath often been said by the virginians that the king of england and the people of that colony conquered the people who lived there but it is not true we will allow they conquered the sachdagughronaw and drove back the tuskaroras the first resided near the branches of james river in virginia and the latter on these branches and that they have on that account a     right to some parts of virginia but as to what lies beyond the mountains we conquered the nations residing there and that land if the virginians ever get a good right to it it must be by us in the year    0 the french seized four english traders who were trading with the six nations shawanese and delawares on the waters of the ohio and sent them prisoners to quebec and from thence to france in      the french took a formal possession of the river ohio and built forts at venango at the confluence of the ohio and monongahela and at the mouth of the cherokee river in      general braddock was sent to america with an army to remove the french from their possessions over the alleghany mountains and on the river ohio and on his arrival at alexandria he held a council of war with the governors of virginia maryland pennsylvania new york and the massachusetts bay and as these gentlemen well knew that the country claimed by the french over the alleghany mountains and southwesterly to the river mississippi was the unquestionable property of the six nations and not of the cherokees or any other tribe of indians the general gave instructions to sir william johnson to call together the indians of the six nations and lay before them their beforementioned grant to the king in      wherein they had put all their huntinglands under his majestys protection to be guaranteed to them and to their use and as general braddocks instructions are clearly declaratory of the right of the six nations to the     lands under consideration we shall here transcribe the conclusive words of them and it appearing that the french have from time to time by fraud and violence built strong forts within the limits of the said lands contrary to the covenant chain of the said deed and treaties you are in my name to assure the said nations that i am come by his majestys order to destroy all the said forts and to build such others as shall protect and secure the said lands to them their heirs and successors for ever according to the intent and spirit of the said treaty and i do therefore call upon them to take up the hatchet and come and take possession of their own lands that general braddock and the american governors were not singular in their opinion as to the right of the six nations to the land over the alleghany mountains and on both sides of the river ohio quite to the mississippi is evident from the memorials which passed between the british and french courts in      in a memorial delivered by the kings ministers on the  th june      to the duc de mirepoix relative to the pretensions of france to the abovementioned lands they very justly observed as to the exposition which is made in the french memorial of the fifteenth article of the treaty of utrecht the court of great britain does not think it can have any foundation either by the words or the intention of this treaty the court of great britain cannot allow of this article relating only to the persons of the savages     and not their country the words of this treaty are clear and precise that is to say the five nations or cantons are subject to the dominion of great britain which by the received exposition of all treaties must relate to the country at well as to the persons of the inhabitants it is what france has acknowledged in the most solemn manner she had well weighed the importance of this acknowledgment at the time of signing this treaty and great britain can never give it up the countries possessed by these indians are very well known and are not at all so undetermined as it is pretended in the memorial they possess and make them over as other proprietors do in all other places whatever pretext might be alleged by france in considering these countries as the appurtenances of canada it is a certain truth that they have belonged and as they have not been given up or made over to the english belong still to the same indian nations which by the fifteenth article of the treaty of utrecht france agreed not to molest nullo in posterum impedimento aut molestiâ afficiant notwithstanding all that has been advanced in this article the court of great britain cannot agree to france having the least title to the river ohio and the territory in question n b—this was all the country from the alleghany mountains to the ohio and down the same and on both sides thereof to the river mississippi even that of possession is not nor can it be alleged on this occasion since france cannot pretend to have had any such before the treaty of   0 aixlachapelle nor since unless it be that of certain forts unjustly erected lately on the lands which evidently belong to the five nations or which these have made over to the crown of great britain or its subjects as may be proved by treaties and acts of the greatest authority what the court of great britain maintained and what it insists upon is that the five nations of the iroquois acknowledged by france to be the subjects of great britain are by origin or by right of conquest the lawful proprietors of the river ohio and the territory in question and as to the territory which has been yielded and made over by these people to great britain which cannot but be owned must be the most just and lawful manner of making an acquisition of this sort she reclaims it as belonging to her having continued cultivating it for above twenty years past and having made settlements in several parts of it from the sources even of the ohio to pichawillanes in the centre of the territory between the ohio and the wabash in      the lords commissioners for trade and plantations were so solicitous to ascertain the territory of the six nations that dr mitchell by their desire published a large map of north america and mr pownall the present secretary of the board of trade then certified as appears on the map that the doctor was furnished with documents for the purpose from that board in this map dr mitchell observes that the six nations have extended their territories ever since the year      when they subdued and were incorporated with the ancient shawanese the native proprietors of these countries and     the river ohio besides which they likewise claim a right of conquest over the illinois and all the mississippi as far as they extend this he adds is confirmed by their own claims and possessions in      which include all the bounds here laid down and none have ever thought fit to dispute them and in confirmation of this right of the six nations to the country on the ohio as mentioned by the kings ministers in their memorial to the duc de mirepoix in      we would just remark that the six nations shawanese and delawares were in the actual occupation of the lands southward of the great kenhawa for some time after the french had encroached upon the river ohio and that in the year      these tribes had a large town on kentucky river two hundred and thirtyeight miles below the scioto that in the year      they resided and hunted on the southerly side of the river ohio in the lower country at about three hundred and twenty miles below the great kenhawa and in the year      they had also a large town opposite to the mouth of the scioto at the very place which is the southern boundary line of the tract of land applied for by mr walpole and his associates but it is a certain fact that the cherokees never had any towns or settlements in the country southward of the great kenhawa that they do not hunt there and that neither the six nations shawanese nor delawares do now reside or hunt on the southerly side of the river ohio nor did for several years before they sold the country to the king these are facts which can be easily and fully proved     in october      at a congress held with the six nations at fort stanwix they observed to sir william johnson now brother you who know all our affairs must be sensible that our rights go much farther to the southward than the kenhawa and that we have a very good and clear title as far south as the cherokee river which we cannot allow to be the right of any other indians without doing wrong to our posterity and acting unworthy those warriors who fought and conquered it we therefore expect our right will be considered in november      the six nations sold to the king all the country on the southerly side of the river ohio as far as the cherokee river but notwithstanding that sale as soon as it was understood in virginia that government favored the pretensions of the cherokees and that dr walker and colonel lewis the commissioners sent from that colony to the congress at fort stanwix had returned from thence the late lord botetourt sent these gentlemen to charleston south carolina to endeavor to convince mr stuart the southern superintendent of indian affairs of the necessity of enlarging the boundary line which he had settled with the cherokees and to run it from the great kenhawa to holston river these gentlemen were appointed commissioners by his lordship as they had been long conversant in indian affairs and were well acquainted with the actual extent of the cherokee country whilst these commissioners were in south carolina they wrote a letter to mr stuart as     he had been but a very few years in the indian service and could not from the nature of his former employment be supposed to be properly informed about the cherokee territory respecting the claims of the cherokees to the lands southward of the great kenhawa and therein they expressed themselves as follows charleston south carolina february       —the country southward of the big kenhawa was never claimed by the cherokees and now is the property of the crown as sir william johnson purchased it of the six nations at a very considerable expense and took a deed of cession from them at fort stainwix in      the house of burgesses of the colony of virginia represented to lord botetourt that they have the greatest reason to fear the said line meaning the boundary line which the lords commissioners for trade and plantations have referred to in the map annexed to their lordships report if confirmed would constantly open to the indians and other enemies to his majesty a free and easy ingress to the heart of the country on the ohio holston river and the great kenhawa whereby the settlements which may be attempted in those quarters will in all probability be utterly destroyed and that great extent of country at least eight hundred miles in length from the mouth of the kenhawa to the mouth of the cherokee river extending eastward as far as laurel hill so lately ceded to his majesty to which no tribe of indians at present set up any pretensions will be entirely     abandoned to the cherokees in consequence of which claims totally destructive of the true interest of his majesty may at some future time arise and acquisitions justly ranked among the most valuable of the late war be altogether lost end of volume v   translated from dubourgs edition of franklins works vol ii p       alluding to the following passage in a letter

which grew out of franklins visit to paris in       was that with dupont de nemours one of the chief apostles of the school of french economistes of whom doctor quesnay and the marquis de mirabeau

the reader may understand the whole in an hour or two it is necessary to add that the new letters used in the course of printing this paper are exactly copied from the manuscript in my possession there being no provision for a distinction in the character as written or printed i have no other way therefore of marking the scored parts of the manuscript answering to italics than by placing such passages between inverted commas as to capitals i should have provided for them by means of larger types but the form of some of them would have made them too large for the page however were the authors general system ever adopted nothing would be easier than to remedy this particular—b v   dr franklin used to lay some little stress on this circumstance when he occasionally spoke on the subject a dictionary formed on this model would have been serviceable to him he said even as an american because from the want of public examples of pronunciation in his own country it was often difficult to learn the proper sound of certain words which occurred very frequently in our english writings and which of course every american very well understood as to their meaning i think i have seen a french grammar which endeavored to represent the french pronunciation by a resolution of it into english letters but for want of proper characters it seemed an embarrassed business is not the

january           this dear friend was peter collinson who had recently died and who had long corresponded with john bartram   mr bartrams merit as a naturalist attracted the attention of the king and

expediency of having an american bishop of the episcopal church   the reasons for paying a price are not founded merely upon a computation of the expense of production a general knowledge of the expenses of producing a bushel of corn does not prevent the producer from demanding and the consumer from paying a higher price when the article is scarce nor the consumer from offering and the producer from accepting a lower price when it is plenty a proposition bearing a near affinity to that stated in the text seems to be true namely that those things which are of general production and habitual consumption like the common agricultural products are more likely to bear a market price near to the cost of production than things of less common production and less regular use as the article of lace mentioned in the next section it may also be generally the case that the greater the distance of the place of consumption from that of production the longer an article is likely to be sold at a great profit since the operation of competition in bringing down the price is likely to be slower—w phillips   franklin does not probably intend to be literally understood as recommending a system of defrauding foreigners the benefit he proposes from manufactures does not by any means amount to this nobody considers it cheating to obtain from a domestic purchaser more for a thing than it costs the vender to make it the most scrupulous mercantile morality does not proscribe profits the author has elsewhere stated that gain is the great motive of commerce he can only mean what he has elsewhere stated that the nation exporting manufactures has the means of carrying on a more profitable foreign trade which it may do as long as there are few competitors in effecting sales but the other reason mentioned immediately before in favor of exporting manufactures namely that it gives an opportunity of exporting the products of more labor is of much greater importance than the chance of making extraordinary profits a chance which has been very much diminished by the diffusion of the manufacturing arts since this article was written—w phillips   captain jonathan carver celebrated

eastern and middle colonies particularly new york and pennsylvania but an increase at the south this is in part explained by the fact that the necessities of the southern colonies for foreign goods were much greater than at the east where domestic manufactures had to some extent become established the statement is transcribed from a letter written by mr w s johnson in london march      0   the office to which franklin alludes in this letter was probably that of governor of pennsylvania it has been said that at one time he was tempted by the offer of the position of undersecretary of state he was thought of also as a successor to governor bernard in massachusetts the ministry would no doubt have given him any thing he would have asked to have him with them but they never found him in a frame of mind which made it safe to approach him with any proposition which was irreconcilable with his devotion and loyalty to the interests of the colonies referring to similar reports set afloat some three or four years previous he wrote to his sister as to the reports you mention that are spread to my disadvantage i give myself as little concern about them as possible i have often met with

other which did not imply a certain equality between the two associations on the   d of september      the american society was again organized new rules were adopted and its title was changed to the

finally agreed that the two societies should unite on equal terms each electing all the members of the other this union was effected on the  d of january      a new name was formed by uniting those of the two societies which thus became the american philosophical society held at philadelphia for promoting useful knowledge it is of this union that franklin here speaks   some of the authors friends

has jurisdiction does no way affect this position nor doth the   th section of the said statute directing that the commissioners of whom such court subsists may issue their warrant for apprehending such pirates c in order to their being tried in the colonies or sent into england any way militate with the doctrine here laid down nor can it be applied as the case of a jurisdiction actually existing which supersedes the jurisdictions of the courts in the colonies and plantations and as what authorizes the taking the accused of such piracies c from those jurisdictions and the sending such so taken to england for trial it cannot be applied as a case similar and in point to the application of an act of parliament passed in the   th of henry viii concerning the trial of treasons lately recommended in order to the sending persons accused of committing crimes in the plantations to england for trial because this act of the   th and   th of william iii c   respects crimes committed in places where the admiral has jurisdiction and cases to which the jurisdiction of those provincial courts do not extend in the case of treasons committed within the jurisdiction of the colonies and plantations there are courts competent to try such crimes and to give judgment thereupon where the trials of such are regulated by laws to which the king hath given his consent from which there lies no appeal and wherein the king hath given power and instruction to his governor as to execution or respite of judgment the said act of henry viii which provides remedy for a case which supposes the want of due legal jurisdiction cannot be any way or by any rule applied to a case where there is due legal and competent jurisdiction   in referring to an old act made for the trial of treasons committed out of the realm by such persons as had no legal resiancy but within the realm and who were of the realm applying the purview of that statute which was made to bring subjects of the realm who had committed treason out of the realm where there was no criminal jurisdiction to which they could be amenable to trial within the realm under that criminal jurisdiction to which alone by their legal resiancy and allegiance they were amenable applying this to the case of subjects whose legal resiancy is without the realm and who are by that resiancy and their allegiance amenable to a jurisdiction authorized and empowered to try and give judgment upon all capital offences whatsoever without repeal thus applying this statute so as to take up a proceeding for which there is no legal process either by common or statute law as now established but in defiance of which there is a legal process established by the habeas corpus act would be to disfranchise the subject in america of

application to existing bases were intended to remedy the prejudice indigestion indecision and errors then prevailing either in opinions or conduct he adds the very attention to the investigation may

and thence a prospect of lessening considerably the national debt i continue well sir john pringle has proposed to me a journey for this summer to switzerland but i have not resolved upon it and i believe i shall not i am balancing upon a wish of visiting at least if not returning for good and all as the phrase is to america if i do not do that i shall spend the summer with some or other of those friends who have invited me to their countryhouses   this letter is here printed in a translation from the french as contained in m dubourgs edition of the authors writings tom i p   0—ed   in consequence of this letter the ordnance department directed that the advice of the writer should be followed in some respects but that they might be still better authorized to proceed with regard to other points these gentlemen were desirous to obtain the sanction of the royal society and therefore requested their opinion the royal society appointed messrs cavendish watson franklin wilson and robertson a committee to examine the subject and report thereon—dubourg   probably alluding to a piece entitled toleration in old england and new england and signed a new england man this piece was first printed in the london packet june        see supra page       the following is the reply which dr franklin wrote to the duke de vrillière who had informed him of his having been chosen a member of the royal academy at paris benjamin franklin september        london duke de vrillière dear sir— it was with the greatest pleasure i received the information your grace has condescended to give me of my nomination by the king to fill a vacancy in the academy of sciences as associé etranger i have a high sense of the great honor thereby conferred on me and beg that my grateful acknowledgments may be represented to his majesty with the greatest respect c —london september          mr benjamin wilson one of the committee appointed by the royal society dissented from the part of the above report which relates to pointed conductors—ed i dissent from the report said he in that part only which recommends that each conductor should terminate in a point my reason for dissenting is that such conductors are in my opinion less safe than those which are not pointed every point as such i consider as soliciting the lightning and by that means not only contributing to increase the quantity of every actual discharge but also frequently occasioning a discharge where it might not otherwise have happened if therefore we invite the lightning while we are ignorant what the quantity or the effects of it may be we may be promoting the very mischief we mean to prevent whereas if instead of pointed we make use of blunted conductors those will as effectually answer the purpose of conveying away the lightning safely without that tendency to increase or invite it my further reasons for disapproving of points in all cases where conductors are judged necessary are contained in a letter addressed to the marquis of rockingham and published in the philosophical transactions vol liv p     there are other reasons also which i have to offer for rejecting points on this particular occasion and which were mentioned at the committee those i shall lay before the royal society at another opportunity for the benefit of the public   an american philanthropist in      he wrote a caution to great britain and her colonies in a short representation of the calamitous state of the enslaved negroes in the british dominions in      he published historical accounts of guinea with an inquiry

was to take from his desk six dollars for a poor widow   mr henleys   m de romas saw still greater quantities of lightning brought down by the wire of his kite he had explosions from it the noise of which greatly resembled that of thunder and were heard from without into the heart of the city notwithstanding the various noises there the fire seen at the instant of the explosion had the shape of a spindle eight inches long and five lines in diameter yet from the time of the explosion to the end of the experiment no lightning was seen above nor any thunder heard at another time the streams of fire issuing from it were observed to be an inch thick and ten feet long see dr priestleys history of electricity pp        first edition   twelve were proposed on and near the magazines at purfleet   it may be fit to mention here that the immediate occasion of the dispute concerning the preference between pointed and blunt conductors of lightning arose as follows a powdermill having blown up at brescia in consequence of its being struck with lightning the english board of ordnance applied to their painter mr wilson then of some note as an electrician for a method to prevent the like accident to their magazines at purfleet mr wilson having advised a blunt conductor and it being understood that dr franklins opinion formed upon the spot was for a pointed one the matter was referred in      to the royal society and by them as usual to a committee who after consultation prescribed a method conformable to dr franklins theory but a harmless stroke of lightning having under particular circumstances fallen upon one of the buildings and its apparatus in may      the subject came again into violent agitation and was again referred to the society and by the society again referred to a new committee which committee confirmed the decision of the first committee—b v   islands in the delaware river to which lord rochford had made a claim   a daughter of the bishop of st asaph   the

massachusetts   on the  0th of november      there was a meeting of the inhabitants of boston at which was read a report of a committee who had been appointed at a previous meeting this report contained a view of the state of public affairs touching largely on the rights of the colonists and the infringement and violations of those rights by the british government it was the boldest exposition of the american grievances which had hitherto been made public and was drawn up with as much ability as freedom hutchinson says of this report of the committee that although at its first appearance it was considered as their own work yet they had little more to do than to make the necessary alterations in the arrangement of materials prepared for them by their great director in england whose counsels they obeyed and in whose wisdom and dexterity they had an implicit faith such principles in government were avowed as would be sufficient to justify the colonies in revolting and forming an independent state and such instances were given of the infringement of their rights by the exercise of parliamentary authority as upon like reasons would justify an exception to the authority in all cases whatever nevertheless there was color for alleging that it was not expressly denied in every case the whole frame of it however was calculated to strike the colonists with a sense of their just claim to independence and to stimulate them to assert it—history of massachusetts vol iii p     the person alluded to by governor hutchinson as the great director in england was dr franklin and it is insinuated that he was in effect the author of the report but this is in no sense true nor did he wholly approve the measures adopted at that meeting he thought the affair was carried a little farther than the occasion required at the time and was afraid that ill consequences would result it was only the time and manner of bringing the subject forward however upon which he had any doubts to the sentiments expressed in the report of the committee and adopted by the inhabitants of the town he fully assented this is proved by his sending a copy of the proceedings to the press as soon as he received it in london with a prefatory notice written by himself the pamphlet was entitled the votes and proceedings of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town of boston in town meeting assembled according to law published by order of the town the following is dr franklins preface to the london edition—sparks   lord hillsborough this nobleman already first lord of trade was introduced in      into the newtitled office of secretary of state for the colonies—b v   mr burke says in his speech in      that this preambulary tax had lost us at once the benefit of the west and of the east had thrown open the foldingdoors to contraband and would be the means of giving the profits of the colony trade to every nation but ourselves he adds in the same place it is indeed a tax of sophistry a tax of pedantry a tax of disputation a tax of war and rebellion a tax for any thing but benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject—b v   some of his circularletters had been criticized and exposed by one or two of the american assemblies—b v   eightyfive pounds i am assured my lords is the whole equivalent we have received for all the hatred and mischief and all the infinite losses this kingdom has suffered during that year in her disputes with north america see the bishop of st asaphs speech intended to have been spoken—b v   at this time they contained many millions of pounds of tea including the usual stock on hand mr burke in his speech in      supposes that america might have given a vent for ten millions of pounds this seems to have been the greater part of the whole quantity—b v   on account of a temporary compromise of certain disputes with government—b v   seen in certain memorable mercantile failures in the year        the report which follows was drawn up by lord hillsborough president of the board of trade in opposition to the petition of a company of gentlemen with thomas walpole at their head for a grant of land on the ohio river already referred to in the preceding correspondence as walpoles grant it is followed by an answer prepared by dr franklin which proved so cogent and conclusive that when the subject came again before the council on the first of july      and his answer was read the petition was granted hillsborough was greatly chagrined by his defeat and shortly after resigned his seat as president of the board of trade lord dartmouth succeeded him in both changes hillsboroughs late colleagues as well as the colonies found great satisfaction in a letter to his son dated july         franklin wrote of this matter mr todd who has some attachment to lord hillsborough told me as a secret that lord hillsborough was much chagrined at being out of place and could never forgive me for writing that pamphlet against his report about the ohio of all the men i ever met with he is surely the most unequal in his treatment of people the most insincere and the most wrongheaded witness besides his various behavior to me his duplicity in encouraging us to ask for more land ask for enough to make a province when we at first asked only for two millions five hundred thousand acres were his words pretending to befriend our application then doing every thing to defeat it and reconciling the first to the last by saying to a friend that he meant to defeat it from the beginning and that his putting us upon asking so much was with that very view supposing it too much to be granted thus by the way his mortification becomes double he has served us by the very means he meant to destroy us and tripped up his own heels into the bargain lord hillsboroughs report and dr franklins answer were published in the year      in the second volume of a work entitled biographical literary and political anecdotes of several of the most eminent persons of the present age the author of that work remarks on the subject as follows lord hillsborough was so much offended by the decision of the privy council that he resigned upon it he resigned for that reason only he had conceived the idea and was forming the plan of a boundary line to be drawn from the hudson river to the mississippi and thereby confining the british colonies between that line and the ocean similar to the scheme of the french after the peace of aixlachapelle which brought on the war of      his favorite project being thus defeated he quitted the ministry dr franklins answer to the report of the board of trade was intended to have been published but lord hillsborough resigning dr franklin stopped the sale on the morning of the publication when not above five copies had been disposed of whatever may have been hillsboroughs other accomplishments this report shows conclusively that he was but poorly equipped for a seat in the executive councils of a great empire—ed
