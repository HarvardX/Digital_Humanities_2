remarks on dr leakes paper on the use of his forceps  remarks on dr leakes paper on the use of his forceps to prevent confusion i shall examine the doctrine laid down in each paragraph according to the order in which they arise  i the description of the forceps is not correct the forceps ought to be considered as an instrument consisting of two levers acting alternately from two centres which are those parts of the childs head undergoing the greatest friction it is true that with respect to themselves the center of motion will be at that part where the blades unite but when in the hands of the operator and containing a body within their curve the alternate motion necessary for the extraction of that body through a small space changes the whole circumstance then all that part of the blades not bearing upon the childs head becomes an additional length of lever  ii professors have generally misled us in the pursuit of practical knowledge being too often of that order of men who are the bane of real improvement inquirunt says dr harvey non quomodo res sunt sed quid alii dicunt i believe there are reasons for suspecting that m crantz is but little qualified for laying down rules for the use of instruments in midwifery and m levrette is not unexceptionable authority the latter however set an example highly worthy of imitation when he condemned the use of his tire tete after having universally recommended it in the unexperienced part of his life  dr leake says when the childs head is wedged within the bones of the pelvis it cannot be extracted by smellies forceps because of their shortness and when the hindhead is forced over the symphysis of the pubes it cannot be got hold of within the curve of the blades because they are only curved in one direction and being applied along the ears they are apt to slip over the face more especially as they are taper toward the point  when the head is incuneatum enclavee or wedged in the pelvis it is a case in which forceps of any kind cannot be used with prudence if we did try them we should happily miscarry in the attempt for if we succeeded dreadful would be the consequence to the soft parts of the mother crushed between the childs head and forceps on one hand and the bones of the pelvis on the other  it is supposed that the hindhead is forced over the symphysis of the pubes whenever this is the case it is not possible to apply forceps of any kind with advantage or without the utmost danger and i call upon every gentleman conversant in practice to confirm the truth of the assertion this situation can only be occasioned by the projection of the sacrum and last vertebrae of the loins the doctrine of applying forceps before the bulk of the head has passed the superior aperture of the pelvis carries great danger and unsurmountable difficulties on the face of it those who have endeavored to reduce it to practice for it is an old and obsolete doctrine have in their accounts given us histories of their attempting it of the difficulties they met with of the mischief they did and a retraction of their errors  the censure on dr smellies forceps is unprofitable he was a man of great candor industry and ingenuity and we are all indebted to him perhaps he pursued his favorite opinion too far but let us attribute his errors to the common infirmity of human nature dr smellies forceps are not taper at the point  the only possible advantage to be reaped from the third blade of the forceps is the prevention of their slipping over the face which does not happen once in a hundred times if the forceps are properly applied and the head of the child be low enough for their application  iii independent of the dimensions of the pelvis it is well known that there are many cases which require the use of the forceps  iv objections are made to the use of the forceps till the bulk of the head of a child has passed the superior aperture of the pelvis not only for the reason specified by dr leake but also because force cannot be exerted in a proper direction it is true that terrible accidents have followed from the causes here mentioned seldom of necessity however but generally from mismanagement or innatention after delivery they do not happen near so frequently when a labor is wholly resigned to the efforts of nature as when the forceps are injudiciously applied  v the largeness of the head and the narrowness of the pelvis are relative terms however desirable it might be to deliver a woman under these circumstances facts prove that if the bulk of the head is not descended through the superior aperture of the pelvis the attempt with forceps would be fruitless with respect to the living child and exceedingly pernicious with respect to the mother  no practitioner who has a competent knowledge of  ever thinks of turning a child when the head has entered the pelvis and the uterus is contracted if the head is wedged in the pelvis this operation is absolutely impracticable  vi the case supposed in this paragraph i believe never can happen at the upper part of the pelvis if it is meant at the lower part the case requires no instruments for before it is perfectly turned the hindhead begins to emerge from under the arch of the pubes all presentations of the head with regard to instrumental delivery may be divided into two kinds  with the face to the sacrum  or to the pubes yet neither of these are exact at the time when it is judged necessary or proper to apply instruments at the superior aperture of the pelvis the head descends with one ear to the pubes with the other to the sacrum or diagonally as it progredes it necessarily turns to one of the general presentations and it is compelled to this turn by the converging form of the internal surface of the pelvis and by the spinal processes of the ischia now the head is not placed with the ears to each side but diagonally in all cases invariably when it is necessary to apply the forceps when they are applied if the action be gentle with them as it ought the head will be turned without our assistance into the most favorable position as in a natural delivery my reason for preferring the straight forceps is a conviction that this opinion is true and that under these circumstances the curvilinear forceps become inconvenient except with regard to the preservation of the perinaeum i do  not think any one case sufficient for the establishment of any practice  vii i know enough of the history of vectes in as able hands as roonhuysens to convince a reasonable man that much mischief may be and has been done by them it is not sufficient to know that women have been delivered we should be acquainted with the general events or we cannot form any comparative judgment of the propriety of this or that practice roonhuysens vectis changes it is center of action and though it may be first fixed against the symphysis of the pubes the ramus of the ischium near the obtuse process must become the fulcrum or you will not be able to extract the head i allow his instrument to be very dangerous but not to such a degree as the forceps applied and acting before the bulk of the head has passed through the superior aperture of the pelvis  viii the application of a third blade is as free from danger as of either of the other blades  ix the resisting point is not particularly where the hindhead presses against the pubes  the head is wedged and presses on many points  x the line of action will certainly be from the extremity of the curve without great caution when the curved forceps are introduced we shall fix them on a part we do not mean and when we act with them we shall do it in a wrong direction  the uniformity of the compressive force does not prevent the laceration of the perinaeum but slowness in acting and a recollection that the vagina has an axis different from that of the pelvis compressive force is not intended in the use of the forceps but it always sis produced  xi there is a possibility of exerting insinitely more power with every kind of forceps that has been contrived than can be used if we attend either to the safety of the mother or child the designs of nature are effected very slowly the only method by which we can avoid every inconvenience which attends the use of the forceps is by imitating the progress of a natural delivery  xii great advantages are said to be obtained by the use of forceps curved though of the common size i object to the use of all curvilinear forceps because the head of the child is always in a diagonal situation when it is proper or necessary to apply them the curve of m levrettes forceps seems the most convenient and mr osborn has contrived a very elegant pair by diminishing the size of levrettes and very little alteration besides  xiii allowing dr leake the full force of his own reasoning i cannot conceive the advantage arising from this complicated instrument but the case is really thus  if we act with the forceps from handle to handle the third blade can do no service but must do much mischief by bruising the soft parts  if we act with the lever the forceps are useless or prejudicial  i pay great regard to dr leakes abilities but being convinced that the instrument which he has recommended will do great mischief if the attempt to introduce it into practice should succeed i have taken the trouble of writing these remarks  tho denman
