cooper at the globe in paternoster row      price sixpence  verses to his grace the duke of newcastle if yet your throbbing bosom finds relief if reason yet one moment steals from grief forgive my lord the muse that late appears to join with britains sighs  newcastles tears the muse that joins her well intended strain with georges sacred sighs but joins in vain not regal sorrows can that life restore in vain the kingly fountains rich run over it is hers to join with all who truly mourn who pour the plaintive note on pelhams urn mistaken mortals in this vale below sons of adversity and heirs of woe the sad inheritance tenacious keep too soon they triumph or too late they weep the good possessed with listless hearts they rate nor prize the bliss enjoyed till snatched by fate reflection then and gratitude conspire then every virtue kindles every fire the breast humane with sudden fervor burns then all the soul alarmed regrets and mourns this tribute virtue from the heart demands and nature pays it with obedient hands to vice high raised no hallowed mark remains her springs of pleasures and her source of pains ambitions frenzy lust and lucre fly to black obscurity far off they lie sunk in the mass confused oblivions lot by time rejected and by fame forgot the allrevered pile erect to fame with virtues trophies charged with trajans name over vanquished time shall stand with storyd pride with each immortal witness at its side the worlds applause by classic power expressed which thunder spared to strike and goths molest o sacred avarice o thirst divine the immortal springs of paradise are thine the treasures thine in times diminished store for thou shall claim when he can give no more illustrious pelham to thy country dear for whom thy prince still sheds the social tear thy honored worth with lasting wreaths shall shine and every british trophy shall be thine not latian marble nobler praise can give in every patriot heart thy name shall live nor yet britannia let thy bosom cease thy beating bosom stranger yet to peace the fatal storm that tore thy bulwark wide with dread irruption cannot yet subside thy agitated heart yet feels the blow and justice must approve the grateful woe it is due to merit in the humblest sphere where private virtue claims the private tear a secret transport mingles with such grief such generous sorrow brings the soul relief reason approves what passion then bestows and nature pays the debt that friendship owes ah say what sad memorial can express a peoples anguish and a kings distress alas what monumental mark make known the sighs of millions grieved  a monarchs moan what equal witness shall invention find worthy the friend of truth  of humankind let gratitude her sacred source explore let genius turn her treasured talents over let greece let rome bestow their reverend aid and rear the awful pile to pelhams shade let envy come by factious malice nursed with all her black seditious brood accursed come forth at once and witness if she can that ever thy shadow fraud eclipsed the man she growls conviction with reluctant tone and grinds the sacred truth she is forced to own the vanquished pest retreats that bane of men drove back by truth she seeks her horrid den a statesman die and not one arrow move has faction lost her nerve  can malice love science sincerity or truth she can the blameless minister the upright man even in britannia blessed a length of years in whose clear conduct not one stain appears and will the jarring hydra this proclaim from all her hostile mouths to pelhams fame thrice happy pelham blessed beyond compare blessed in thy life and what few else could share in public station and exalted trust blessed in thy death and honored in the dust with walsingham with burleigh blend thy rays equal to each in merit as in praise o if exalted to the realms of joy the immortal mind one moment may employ on things terrestrial on the affairs of men bow down inrapturd thy celestial ken behold each rank each faction all agree the patriots rich reward reserved for thee alike the princes and the peasants tear in mingled current flowing over thy bier extatic vision to the virtuous given felt with increasing transport though in heaven how wretched now from thy seraphic sphere does fraud does flattery to thy sight appear ambitions crest how abject does it show with craft with avarice thy scorn below how pomp how pride how courts to atoms shrink from thy averted view how sudden sink with gold with grandeur these misrated things these trappings of command these toys of kings whilst in some lowly cottage truths retreat neglected virtue to thy eye looks great the unbodyd mind affections force retains and friendship with the blessed new fervor gains exalted fervor free from earths cold dross and each alloy that sensual hearts engross still helpful to the good the virtuous mind still fond they cast the friendly wish behind fast by the stream of life that joyful roves through labyrinths of bliss immortal groves thy ardent spirit feels a social care and friendship still imprints its image there with each endearing tie through life enjoyed with each fond object that the heart employed to science wedded in the abstracted bower to business sacred in the important hour when deep experience poised europas weal when britains genius watched the varying scale and o where heartfelt raptures often inspired the throb reciprocal by friendship fired by sense by truth by love by honor taught by ripening time to rich perfection brought angels themselves might view a scene like this with longing eyes and envy human bliss such soulfelt ecstasy so deep impressed retains thy cathrines form among the blessed takes off thy raptured thought with tender care divides perhaps thy wishes even there what mortal anguish tore each filial breast when dreadful struck in fixed amaze  expressed by gushing tears when nature felt the blow and every voice was lost in whelming woe by silent agonizing looks alone with heartexpressive force to words unknown sent from the agitated soul to tell that britain lost a friend when pelham fell the parent dear  but sorrow stopped the rest and nature sunk beneath the load oppressed o thou to whom my numbers would ascend the tenderest brother and the noblest friend newcastle pelham patriot loyal true from thy fraternal eye still falls the dew of genuine sorrow flowing from the heart that melting feels  but britain claims her part in thee thy country now demands thy care thy prince to thee inclines the attentive ear by anxious thoughts and toils of state oppressed he leans for counsel on thy faithful breast to thee his bosoms inmost weight makes known thou firm support thou pillar to his throne o long support him long his cause defend thy princes favorite and thy countrys friend another pelham to the grave descend finis
