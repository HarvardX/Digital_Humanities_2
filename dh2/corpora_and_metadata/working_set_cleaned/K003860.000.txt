an essay at removing national prejudices against a union with scotland  to be continued during the treaty here  part ii  london printed in the year   0   an essay at removing national prejudices etc in the first part of this work i attempted to prove the unreasonableness of the common national prejudices which seem to have taken too fast hold of the people of these nations and that stand in the way of the common opinion about a union  there is nothing more fatal to a general union than to have peoples minds prepossessed with the difficulties or disadvantages of the thing it self and i cannot therefore think it improper to go on with this work a little farther to remove if possible the very root and causes of these prejudices which i say obstruct the happy conjunction now in view  and these i take to be comprised in the two words just mentioned above viz difficulties and disadvantages  when men either think on one hand it is so difficult a task that they shall never get through it or on the other hand that if they do get through it it will not be their advantage no wonder if they go coldly about it or seem unconcerned at the event  i take the commissioners who are to treat of this union perhaps in a different manner or capacity from what some people take them in i do not take them as gentlemen come together from two nations at variance entering into a confederation of amity and so are struggling and wrangling with one onother to get the best terms they can to each others advantage  but i look upon the two nations as intentionally united into one body already fixed and resolved to be from hence forward one people and the gentlemen come together to settle such articles of mutual friendship and coallition as may be most effectually conducive to the ease safety prosperity and general satisfaction of both being now to be considered as one  i look upon any thing grievous any thing particularly burthensom or disadvantageous to either side which may render the union afterward uneasy or disadvantageous to one more than the other ought to be the especial care of both parties to prevent that all complaining and dissatisfaction may be anticipated  every thing that is especially disadvantageous to either side is to be given up to the other every thing particularly burdensome to either side is to be removed for them by the other that these two twin nations may become one united english empire resolved into one form of government one interest one body politic under one head one administration one representative and strengthened by one united body of power a power thereby so increased and in it self not only impregnable but formidable to the whole world  in forming this union either side cheerfully brings her part without examining which contributes most to the work or repining at the seeming inequalities nor are those inequalities so great as some who are enemies to this union would suggest of which i shall hereafter enlarge  here is wealth to enrich there is strength to defend here money to pay there hands to fight here a country improved there a country to improve here a nation grown opulent by trade there a nation which let into trade will be in time as rich and opulent and in proportion as much improved as they  nor shall their increase be our decrease but just the contrary and i doubt not to make it appear that not only england shall gain by this union as a nation united but at a nation separate that the center of trade and the center of government being all here all the wealth that scotland shall accrue by improvement shall circulate through the capital and london shall still remain the center of the wealth of the whole island  i shall go on to prove that the improvement of scotland shall every way be the improvement of england the increase of their manufactures shall no way interfere with ours but almost infinite variety of trade in its funds and branches shall increase to the general wealth and mutual enriching of each other  in this union here are lands and people added to the english empire these are the two essential parts of strength these for improvement for trade for war for every public national advantage are our own the scots being encouraged to industry and enriched by trade and manufactures shall dwell at home and increase the vast numbers that now fill the armies and straggle about the countries of our neighbourprinces shall then stay at home and living easy shall increase in number and form the wealth and strength of britain to a magnitude too great to be modestly calculated  the numbers that go abroad shall people our colonies and extend our borders on the continent of america a part of that world which this nation has room in to grow equally populous and terrible to what they are at home and whose growing wealth is all our own and can never be thought too great  it is impossible britain should have too many people were   millions of strangers to come over hither and settle nay though they brought nothing with them but their hands they would add to our national wealth as from the labor of those people and their expense for necessaries the general stock would be increased the growth of our land expended and our manufactures made use of  under these heads of increase the union of this nation or island in time will be such an increase of wealth and strength as can admit of no description and as the seeming interfering difficulties now talked of bear no manner of proportion to  it is therefore certain the gentlemen now treating of this happy conjunction if their eyes shall be so far opened to the public good shall strive with one another to remove every difficulty to lessen every burden and to study to make this union at first as agreeable as it shall at last be profitable to the whole body  in order to this the design of this second tract is to level some of the mountains that stand in the middle between this union and which seem upon a remote view to be so unpassable in their situation that they should interrupt our happy meeting represent it as impracticable or seem by their stupendous height to hide from our eyes the real advantages of the proposed conjunction  difficulties like dangers often look greater at a remote than at a near view distant objects are seen by the help of art and often represent themselves in figures different from what they really are as an island in the sea at first appears a rough heap of craggy rocks or mountains which threaten the pilot with shipwreck if he approaches but when he comes nearer he discovers open harbors navigable rivers a fruitful pleasant country and a hospitable trading people and then he is invited in to exchange his merchandises and make a happy voyage  let us therefore descend to a nearer view of union we have hitherto talked at a distance and strange mountains of difficulties have presented themselves let us come close up to the matter let us view things as they are and not as they seem only and let us see if perhaps these things may not upon a nearer view appear to be quite different from what we thought them to be  if i understand what we are meaning when we talk of union i understand it in the utmost construction of that extensive word  i understand an entire coallition or incorporation of two different bodies into one as completely every way and to all intents and purposes as has been formerly settled between the kingdom of england and the principalities of wales that we shall for the future be one indivisible community conjoined in every possible article and circumstance so as to have for the future but one politic general interest be brethren in blood and nation brethren in possession prospect and power  what reserves are made are no more obstructions to this healing union than the men of wales reserving their language was an obstruction to their coallition with england the religion and civil administration of justice in scotland are no more concerned in this matter than the popish religion and methods of justice reserved in lancashire and durham have been obstructions to their being annexed to the english government and made provinces thereof  the island will be one the government one the treasure one the military power one their general commerce undivided and in common their laws and customs reserved to every part by the regulations of their own privileges but under the direction of one legislature and representative  as to religious matters the balance is exact the alternative harmonious each establishment preserved general charity maintained the church of england free and uninvaded in england the presbtyerian church of scotland free and unenvyed in scotland episcopacy here presbytery there and toleration universal church of englandmen ruling here and submitting without oppression there presbyterians ruling there and submitting here without reproach or persecution  they that are afraid indeed of such a harmony and who dare not unite not their principle only but their cause suffers some scandal since to me it must pass for a maxim that peace is such a heavenly gift that where it is inconsistent with any party people cause or circumstance that foundation is founded upon something else than heaven and savours of a spirit wholly infernal  this is the present union we are upon nor can england agree to receive the scot upon any other foot for any union that should leave a possibility of a return to its first condition would be incongruous to the present design and disadvantageous to england  england expects by this union safety peace and mutual assistance from scotland in point of defending the wealth she enjoys scotland expects helps in trade assistance to improve her lands employ her people increase her fishery shipping and the like one seeks to gain the other to keep what she has gained  if scotland by a partial union shall answer her end grow rich opulent and formidable and when she is so be empowered to break with us and go off they are then gainers by us and we no gainers by them because we are reduced by the breach to the same circumstance we were in before the union they have bettered themselves and cannot be said to be reduced because they will be then better able to support their independency than they are now  this to me seems so just an objection against what some call a federal union and the scheme whereof they are very fond of that i cannot but wonder to hear such a proposal should come from any englishman  till therefore they can remove the inequality which upon a determination of such a union shall lie hard on the side of the english and prove the scots can never break it to their advantage and our prejudice i cannot think their schemes worth examining since to me they seem calculated not to make a union but to break it off and disappoint both nations of the present good issue which they expect from this treaty  i shall therefore suppose it out of doubt that there can no union be treated of between the nations but what shall be an entire incorporation of principles i mean a becoming one body in all the public capacities of both kingdoms  in treating of the methods to bring this to pass i know no better way than if possible to state the circumstances of both nations and bring them to a balance for certainly while the inequalities of things remain there can be no fair coalition one side or other would be aggrieved that would be to jumble circumstances huddle all things together and by the clashing of interests inequality of particulars and uncouth jarring of causes and consequences would instead of uniting two nations put them into all manner of national confusions  to bring a union of clashing interests therefore to pass i humbly conceive a balance of circumstances must be the basis to build upon in which if i do not exactly pursue every man or perhaps any man that has gone before me i pray their pardon since it is effecting the union not imitating of any man however superior in judgment or experience to me that is the mark to be aimed at and this i shall pursue with the same sincerity that i wish it accomplished  to bring the balance of circumstances upon the stage it must be necessary to enter into the several inequalities in which the two kingdoms now stand with respect to one another and see if we can even things as we go  the principal heads of inequality i take to be wealth trade religion and civil power i hope no body will cavil at my order of ranking them and putting religion behind the wealth and trade i speak to it last as that which i believe there will be least occasion for dispute about not but that if i had said perhaps those that cavil most at this union are not the most concerned for the religious part of it i might have said true enough  in stating the wealth of the two nations we are to examine if possible the proportions of either side and without running into the several true reasons of the poverty of one nation and the riches of the other which though it is a study would furnish large subjects of speculation yet as not exactly suited to the present enquiry i wave with only this short hint viz  scotland has felt more the weight of the arbitrary despotick tyranny of their princes which we all had such reason to fear the neglect or oppression of their subjects joined to some unreasonable disadvantages of another sort and all added to an unhappy constitution between the gentry and the commonalty have formed a complication of circumstances which have kept her declining in wealth for above a  00 years past  england at the same time has visibly increased in trade wealth people colonies and every thing that adds to the opulence and abundance of a nation in a rising posture before  so that without vanity on one hand or insulting on the other there is a vast disparity of circumstances between the kingdoms and though in former estimations scotland may have been valued with respect to england as one to seventeen and some have drawn schemes from that foot i think there are so many reasons to be given for englands rising in value and scotlands sinking more than its proportion that it must be owned no judgment can be made from these former calculations  in order therefore to form regular calculations of the wealth of scotland and at the same time go hand in hand with the articles of a union i shall begin with the head of taxes which must be most concerned in these calcuculations and which i must say i believe to be the most difficult point of the treaty at least it has most room for debates on both hands  some gentlemen in england have made calculations from the taxes in the old parliament union when oliver cromwell having reduced scotland by arms incorporated them into one body with this nation and by this incorporation they are rated at  000 l per month in their land tax when england was rated at  0000 l per month  though it also appears by the same calculator that scotland paid this  000 l per month when england paid but   000 l per month  now i would gladly apply this calculation to our present case before i enter upon stating of our present proportions that our grand enquiry about an equality of taxes may be the plainer to enter upon  our land tax in time of war at   s per l is supposed to  millions sterling  the scots paying  000 to our   000 per month which is something less than a sixth part not to trouble the reader with fractions by the same rule in two millions per annum which our land tax raises they must be chargeable with            per annnm land tax  if you return from this arbitrary difference which oliver cromwell and his parliament made which as is observed was in consideration that england had for diverse years past been at almost all the expense of war still at the former calculation scotland would in a four shilling aid pay half that sum viz             per annum  now to examine the rents of each kingdom what must this amount to the annual rents of lands in scotland must by the first calculation amount to one million six hundred sixty six thousand six hundred sixty six pound thirteen and four pence sterling per annum and by the last calculation just half the money  both which sums are far wide of the fact and far beyond what scotland is able to raise  but this is by the way  i am now come to the grand question whether in case of a union and an equality between the kingdoms there ought not to be an equality of burdens and without any hesitations i agree readily it must certainly be so  but then it remains to make some needful enquiry into what we mean by equality  all equalities must be subjected to proportion or else confusion would spread over every step we take i need not enter i presume into the particulars or form a philosophical system of equality if an army marches charged with their own baggage if every man carries a burden proportioned to his strength though the strong man has a heavy load and the weak man a light  the distribution is equal  wherefore it is plain and all our calculators allow a numerical or arithmetical equality cannot be meant here  it must then be a geometrical or proportioned equality  how then say some shall we come to a true state of proportion i answer this is the hare we are hunting and though i may be at a fault now and then i persuade my self i shall make it out at last and fairly run her down in view  i begin with the land tax  and here i meet with an objection which i do not find any body has started yet  you talk of proportious and equalities pray why should not the scots pay equal to us in their land tax since all is paid upon a net rent the poverty of the country is not concerned in it  0 s in scotland is as good as  0 s in england and better too because money is dearer there and living is much cheaper he that has  00 l sterling in scotland can much better pay   s in the pound out of it than he that has  00 l a year in england   s is no more in one place than another since no body pays it but he that has the fund in rent to pay it from  this objection is weighty and has more in it than any i have yet met with and therefore i think requires some answer  there are some reasons and i think very good ones why the scots should not be taxed at   s per l upon their rents when we are so taxed and i shall first offer them in general before i come to enquire what proportions are reasonable in this case  i am not at all pleading here for the scots abstracted or for an abatement of taxes to them i allow  0 s is  0 s there or here and ought to bear an equal burden in the whole but i am arguing for justice and equality if we will not prepare our selves to bear with the proportions that these things allow we shall not do justice and if we will not do justice we can never come to a union  i a numerical equality can not be just in the land tax to the scots because really speaking our land tax it self is not equally assessd it bears no conformity to its title and would if literally executed be the greatest piece of injustice and inequality in the world to scotland and perfectly ruin that nation  it is known to all that understand these things that the scots way of collecting their taxes is rigorous and exact and if   s per l was laid by parliament upon the whole island their assessments would bona fide be   s per l upon the rack rent of all their lands  it is as well known that   s per l in england is a lions face upon an asses head and the ears are so plain to be seen that it serves now for a mere priapus a scarecrow without any effect for it never puts the assessors out of their old road but they assess according to the old rates and every county being rated in the very body of the act the title is ipso facto repealed since if the lands etc of that country will raise the money by an assessment of   s   d per pound and it is known some do for less the law is satisfied and the end answered  now to tax scotland at   s per l upon her net rent and tax our own northern and western counties but at so much money which they can raise by a proportion of    d to  0 d at most per l would be such a piece of injustice as i should be ashamed for my native country to see them insist upon  it is plain that you must tax scotland not by your pound rate but at a proportioned sum as your own countries are taxed and leave them to the division of it to raise it as they see fit and this i call a geometrical equality and this i shall say more to when that proportioned sum comes to be spoken of  ii the sum charged upon lands in england after it is levied and raised from the tenant stands charged with large deductions and charges upon the levying collecting and receiving and those charges if my calculations are right amount to little less than   d per l upon the money received besides public losses by the insolvency of receivers and their securities which oftentimes runs deep into the money and which though they cannot be brought into an exact account yet i think put all together    d per pound may at least very well be charged upon the whole as an off reckoning or discount upon the money between the collection and the exchequer  this    d per pound upon the money collected is   d  0 per pound upon all the rents in england and amounts in two millions of money to a hundred thousand pound sterling  now as on the other hand the scots collect all their tax at their own charges clear of all losses deficiencies or defalcations and pay it in nett to the exchequer or public treasure to charge them by the same numerical equallity which you charge england by would be to make them pay their taxes clear of charge and bear part of the expense and loss in collecting ours  iii differing customs and manners of paying rent and letting out lands in the two kingdoms make a numerical equallity impracticable  in england the rents are paid in money in scotland they are generally speaking paid in kind or vittle as they call it now though it is true this may and is in some respect brought to a head by a general valuation yet with this difference against a scots landlord to an english viz that the scots landlord stays two terms and runs two risques in his receiving the rent of his land  first he stays the term agreed to receive of his tenant and secondly he trusts the merchant a second term to whom he sells the produce he receives of his tenant in the same sense he runs two hazards one in the solvency of the tenant and the other of the merchant which makes a considerable difference in the essential value of the rent and consequently of the purchase of such an estate and though the purchase or real value of lands in scotland may not come into this dispute yet i must tell my reader that were an estate let in england to pay the rent in kind it would sell for much less than an estate of the same value paid in specie nor would it be taxed at near so much in our common assessment which i refer to any indifferent judge to determine  the matter of purchase will not argue between scotland and england because were there the same security of title to land in england as there now is in scotland i am of opinion it would advance the price of land in england above ten years purchase why we are not wise enough to do it i shall not pretend to determine    the last reason i shall give not but that there are yet more is the difference in letting our lands in england which are in many places fined down and the stated rents reduced whereas in scotland lands are let without leases or but on short terms and at a rackrent any man that knows what belongs to letting or taking lands in england cannot be ignorant    st that the landlord letting a long lease to the tenant confining him to such and such improvement makes frequent considerations in the rent and the reason is plain that the estate advances upon it at the expiration of the term   any tenant that takes a farm without a certainty of years will give the more because he really seeks the utmost produce of the land without any regard to the time beyond him and though the needy landlord for none but such will let their land so puts something the more money in his pocket for the present yet his estate sinks sinks the land is beggared grows poor and out of heart and he loses in the end  this is a large field and perhaps would discover to the scots much of the reason why their country is so poor and consequently how to recover it and make it rich since the vast difference between the value of their lands and ours cannot be wholly in the land it self but in the management of the tenantry and defect of their leases and contracts but this is not the present business i shall handle that by it self  on the other hand should this article of   s per l be insisted on in the literal sense and the scots come to consider how to avoid it by fining down rents and other advantageous methods which they may easily find out they might soon evade the act and pay little or nothing and this would be an evil hard to discover and if found out almost impossible to cure  for example if a tenant takes a farm in england at  00 l per ann which in reality is worth   0 if he is bound to build or fence if he is under contract to improve drein or cure if he contracts to give his landlord so many quarters of malt or wheat or oats or the like he swears to the annual rent produces his lease and shall be taxed no more than he pays in money this would leave room for strange advantages in scotland and in your   s aid the scots shall soon come off for   d in the pound  i think these reasons are sufficient to prove that a numerical or arithmetical proportion of taxes cannot be insisted on with the scots as being unreasonable on their side and unable to answer the end on our side  from this i come to examine if possible what may be counted a due equality and here it will be necessary to enter a little into the short history of taxes in scotland since the restoration which bringing it down to the present time may serve as a rule to this matter  anciently the levying money upon land in scotland was called in general the taxation and the manner of levying it was by rules altogether obsolete and now grown out of use as the custom of tenths fifteenths subsidies etc are in england  the now method of taxing land has its beginning as to practice in the assessment of  000 l per month settled in scotland in cromwells time when a union was actually formed and settled of which however deficient in it self without doubt this may be said that it had in it the essential parts and might be modeled into a complete coalition  this is the tax they now go by and is called in scotland the cess by which i understand a months assessment it is raised upon land by a method peculiarly exact and i have never heard any one complain of the inequality  it is raised as is before noted without any charge deduction or defalcation and is paid nett into the treasury  according as the occasions of the government require this tax is increased but then not the sum per month is increased but the number of months are increased which by the help of time increases the sum  the original of the demand was as before and of the method but the continuance of it was thus introduced  anciently the kings of scotland contented themselves with the ancient demesnes crown lands customs etc and on extraordinary cases the taxation as above excises or any sort were altogether unknown till the days of king charles the second  king charles the second in the year      obtained of the scots to give him a settled sum of  0000 l sterling during his life in consideration whereof he promised never to demand any cess or taxation except in time of war as by the words of the act as follows     act of the   st parliament cha   the estates of parliament taking to their consideration the great happiness this kingdom has enjoyed etc and that the kings majesty has been graciously pleased notwithstanding all the provocations given to himself and his royal father to evidence his affection and favor to this his ancient kingdom etc do with all humble duty acknowledge his majestys unparalled grace and goodness etc  and seeing for the due establishment of his majestys authority and settling and securing the peace of the kingdom his majesty may have occasion to raise and keep some forces within this kingdom and his majesty has signified his resolution not raise any more cess therefore and from the due sense of their duty and obligations the estates of parliament do in the name of the kingdom make an humble and cheerful offer to his majesty of a yearly annuity of  0000 l sterling during all the days of his majestys life time    this  0000 l was raised by  000 l laid as impost on foreign importations and   000 l per ann on malt brewed into liquor for sale but as this was a novelty and uncertain in its produce a cess was granted to make good the deficiency which deficiency generally amounts to   months cess more or less and other cess than this stotland knew none till the convention in      which being a time of war a cess was imposed but not exceeding   months  here i ought to observe that the excises and customs of scotland could not raise  0000 l per ann put together which i note for the other uses which i shall make of it hereafter but to go on with my history  from this time to the year      scotland had no more cess or convention nor was at any charge more than to make good the deficiency of the  0000 l mentioned before except   months cess during the dutch war expiring at candlemas       about this time the nation being very unhappily divided into parties had the missortune not only to have a religious division but a court division also and people strove at any price to oblige the sovereign in giving up their privileges and liberties to be trampled on by arbitrary designs and the first fruits of this courting the prince appeared in that they brought a tax   months upon the country to be continued for   years which though in time of peace was backed with a specious pretense of the disaffection of the phanaticks or to express it in a more modern phrase the danger of the church as follows act of convention  0 july      the convention of estates of the kingdom of scotland by his majestys authority and command at this time assembled considering the great happiness etc and as all kings and estates do at present carefully secure themselves and their people by providing against all such foreign invasions and intestine commotions as may make them a prey to their enemies so it is not fit that this kingdom should only of all others remain without defense in a time when these dangerous field conventicles declared by law rendezvouzes of rebellion do still grow in their numbers and insolences against all which the present forces cannot be in reason thought a suitable security in recognizance thereof etc the convention of estates etc do humbly beseech his majesty to accept their cheerful and humble tender of a new supply    this was the first infraction upon the scots and upon the kings royal promise to cover which duke lauderdale then commissioner seignd a new word and put upon it the gloss of a voluntary offer or free gift  when this had been imposed for about   years and   years before it expired king james then duke of york and high commissioner in scotland when he was forced away from hence an      obtained the continuation of this   months cess for   years which was to the year      after he came to the crown he advanced it by his mere absolute command to   months cess and had it confirmed to him for his life vide the act as follows   th act of parliament jan   the estates of parliament calling to mind the many great blessings they have and do enjoy under the protection of the royal government and especially by the many deliverances from the rebellious insurrections and designs of fanatical traitors from whom they could expect no less than confusion in religion oppression etc and that the terror of his majestys forces has been very instrumental for procuriug our present securtiy but considering that not only these enemies continue their inveterate hatred against king and people but that their frequent disappointments have heightnd their malice to despair and that the present forces may be too few to undergo all the fatigue which his majestys service etc may require and to demonstrate to all seditious men that this nation is resolved to bestow all they have in the kings service rather than to bear the least of their insults do therefore for themselves and the nation represented by them make a hearty and dutiful offer etc over and above the   months cess already imposed etc whereby there will be   months cess payable at each term hereafter and as a farther evidence of their entire affection etc they humbly and heartily offer a continuation of the said   months cess termly during all the terms of his majestys life time which god almighty long preserve    t would be remote to this matter to enter into the secret history of these arbitrary proceedings in scotland in which i could give such a display of tyranny that whoever were to read some stories of it which i could furnish the world with would no more wonder why the scots are so moved against a race of men that pretend to be hardly treated there  the several court parties struggled who should give their country away fastest the bishops got into every part of the civil jurisdiction the severities against the people first drove them into desperations and rebellions and then such advantages were taken and such use made of the said insurrections to ruin others that the poor people were brought to the brink of general ruin the nation brought to that pass that a man might be fined or forfaulted that is his estate taken from him for his wives giving a halfpenny at his door to a common beggar on pretense it was relieving a rebel  thus poor scotland was bought and sold and the example is useful for our observation a great many ways for thus shall every nation be used that is divided into contending parties and exposed to an encroaching government  but that i may not have said all this foreign to the present purpose it is very observable that this will make one period for taxation viz the highest that an arbitrary prince backed with a mercenary nobility and a governing clergy even in the greatest extreme of absolute tyranny ever imposed upon this nation which they desired to sqeeze and cared not if they ruined  come we now to the revolution which these exorbitances had no little influence upon the first thing transacted upon the meeting of the estates or convention of scotland was to break these chains reassume the power of raising taxes by parliament and make themselves judges both of the occasion and of the sum  however as in england since the revolution greater occasions have called for immense sums to carry on the war and such taxes have been raised as were never heard of before so in scotland the parliament have agreed to such taxes as the aforesaid time of tyranny excepted were never known in scotland before  yet in the carrying on this war six or seven months cess has one time with another been thought scotlands full proportion and the late king excepting one or two years on extraordinary occasions always contented himself with it and this at the same time that england raised   s per l upon their land and her present majesty has never demanded more of her subjects there though the weight of the war is now as great as ever and this i call another period of taxation  now what i mean by a geometrical scale or equality in taxes is drawn from these proportions  that since exact valuation of rents cannot be made on both sides and least of all in england it seems as good a way to come at this equality as any i have yet seen  that the highest period of taxes that ever scotland bore since the restoration may be taken on one hand and set against the highest period of taxes that ever england bore i mean of a land tax on both sides and let this stand together as the scale of equality  thus suppose the scots   months cess though that was the height of tyrannick imposition and though it is allowed the scots are manifestly impoverished and less able to bear it than they were yet say it be full   months cess and set this against the english   s per l and i cannot believe any more just calculation can be made  thus when ever a tax upon land for   s per pound is granted the scots pay   months cess if of   s per pound in england   months cess and so in proportion  nor is this so wide of more nice calculators the ingenious author of the enquiry into the reasonableness and consequences of a union etc calculates scotland to pay  0000 l per annum on land when england pays   millions in which he differs but  000 l per ann  what better and more regular equation can be drawn than this i confess i know not and though the scots seem in this to save no money by the revolution but to return to the valuation put on them by their worst enemies yet i hope they will think the union not bought too dear whatever they pay in reason and within their ability for it especially considering the continuance of the extraordinary taxes are only for the present state of war which we hope cannot last long  i come next to the taxes on trade and these consist in customs upon goods imported from abroad and excise on the consumption at home and here are yet greater inequalitses than before and they are to be considered by proportion also  the inequalities here will lie on both sides and first on the english should not the scale come up even to a literal numerical equality in point of goods imported an open free uninterrupted commerce by land being the consequence of a union they would ruin the english trade by supplying our markets with all sorts of imported goods cheaper than our merchants could do and this would be a most destructive article in trade especially in fine goods for example in linens from hamborough or holland or in tobacco coffee tea chacolate such other things as are now under large duty and small carriage these would all be spread over england by the scots to our damage and a confusion in trade  there is no doubt therefore but the customs prohibitions and charges of all foreign importations must be numerically and literally the same in both nations unless a small abatement which it may be necessary to allow to the scots for encouragement of shipping and for the carriage of their overplus to london which still will be the commanding port in trade  but i come from these heads to the general state of taxes in both nations and here the scale of inequality is very uneven and the scots have vastly the disadvantage in case of a union  the english are a rich nation but greatly in debt the scots are poor but free and clear from all manner of encumbrance arrear or any claim of debt whatsoever  now take the two nations as coming to unite they seem like two tradsemen entering into partnership one has a great stock but being before in the trade has large debts both to pay and receive the other brings in a small stock but being clear and having no debts though he comes in but for a smaller share of trade yet they begin upon a clear stock and a new foundation  the credits of the old trade are set apart and the debts of the old trade are set against them and they are paid off and received in by themselves for the separate accounts of the old trader and all future dealings go on upon a new foot  i know some gentlemen differ from my opinion in this matter but i desire to explain my self and then submit my judgment to any mans censure  we have a debt upon us contracted by the length and weight of the war which will not be paid in many years the scots have no debt upon them they bring a small but clear revenue the overplus of which will revert into our exchequer  speaking upon the square there is no reason we should ask the scots to help pay our debts or to come into our appropriated taxes and here as i conceive lies the greatest difficulty of the treaty  an equality of taxation understood as before is certainly most absolutely necessary to trade to complete the union and to remove disadvantages in commerce but england to answer her vast debts has loaded her self with some taxes which are in their circumstances impracticable in scotland and which would if offered tend to discompose the people there and render the union odious and uneasy to them as a thing that would load them with taxes which they never heard of and which their present condition will not suffer them to bear  to reconcile this difficulty the author before quoted has i think a little too easily come into the thing for an equivalent to be paid out of the said duties in several sums which he places against their share of the debt as follows  the english debts amount to a heavy sum no less says he than one and twenty millions and the gentleman states by a reasonable proportion enough the scots share of those debts shall be  00000 l in return for this he offers a rentcharge of  0000 l per ann to be appropriated to certain uses for the public good till this sum of  00000 l shall be paid  this is the equivalent for bringing the scots in to pay their quota of    millions of our debts  but to examine this let us first enquire what occasion have the scots to make us this loan or what necessity are we in to ask it for in short this is nothing but borrowing  00000 l of the scots to pay our debts and repaying them again by a rentcharge of  0000 l per ann out of their own money and this without any partiality to the scots i must own a most unreasonable request  it is allowed by the gentleman aforesaid that after the union the overplus of the revenue in the kingdom of scotland the civil government being entirely defrayed amounts to    000 l per annum  now who shall this overplus revert to the answer is short and plain it shall revert to the united treasury of britain and the english of that is that we shall gain all that sum in ready money yearly from the scots an article i humbly recommend to those gentlemen who say we shall get nothing by the union  now if this be true i can see no reason nor the least occasion why we should oblige the scots to come into every tax we have laid whether it be properly suited for their country or no and this leads me to examine  ii what condition are the scots in to come up to you in an equality of taxes there may be some taxes which are peculiarly proper or improper for one country which are not so in another the taxes in england chiefly lie on foreign trade in holland they lie on the homeconsumption should england pay for every diminutive of their eatables and drinkables as the dutch do our yeomandry and common people would be undone should holland load their trade and lay heavy duties on their imports they had hardly been a people much less a rich opulent nation and many reasons might on both sides be given to prove this observation but i bring it nearer home  there are a great many reasons to be given why the scots are no way able to bear the present duties upon malt and salt which are raised in england of which i shall speak presently  but giving me leave to beg the question for the present do but suppose those duties improper for scotland let us inquire next why should they be imposed  first of all they are both calculated but at  0000 l per ann which deducted from the sum of    000 l you still receive    000 per ann out of scotland clear of all expense as a capital clearly gained by the union  if it be true that the scots shall grow rich by you their riches shall still be your gain as their trade increases so will their customs and all shall tend to raise that sum of    000 l per ann higher and more to the public gain of england  so that gentlemen do but pay your own debts and you have no need to lay any unreasonable burden upon your neighbors  but now to show how this is still more equal let us examine the great question here how must we carry on the war if i were a scot i would answer it by asking another how do you carry it on now  we are to pay none of your debts for you now why should we buy our union with you at  00000 l debt and    000 l per ann taxes  on the other hand take away your appropriated taxes and your war would be carried on without the taxes on malt and salt were your debts all paid it is certain the land tax customs excise and settled branches of revenue as coals stamptpaper post office etc would carry on the whole expense of the war  so that it is very evident take the reason of the case into consideration there can be nothing said why the scots should come into a literal equality of taxes the taxes themselves being inconsistent with their circumstances and only necessary to you here for payment of debts not for carrying on the war  it remains to examine why these two taxes are unsuitable to or impracticable in scotland and thus    because they are exorbitant in their rate being charged not upon the value but upon the bulk of the commodity and the goods bearing so different a value in scotland and in england to put the duty equal would be tax to the scots in three times the sum they are taxed at in england  for example suppose the duty upon salt which is charged by weight in general amounts in scotland to    s   d sterling upon   s value and in england to    s   d sterling upon  0 s   d value or thereabout let any man state the proportion here they will easily allow the tax to be intolerable to the scots since by the same proportion the english ought to pay   l    s   d for the same quantity of salt or the scots ought to pay but   s   d for that which by this tax is rated at    s   d and the like though not in so great a difference for the malt    the weight of the salt tax lies especially on the poor who in scotland live very much on salt meats and whose differing condition from the english does not permit nor cannot bear being taxed at all much less equal to the english and not to insist on the further impracticableness of these taxes i shall answer one objection here  if we are taxed on our salt and malt and scotland is not then all the salt and malt that can be conveyed from scotland into england will make an unreasonable advantage to one and be injurious to the other  to this i answer  the same argument is good against reduction of the rate to an equality and yet the contrary would be an intolerable oppression and an inequality too extravagant to mention the remedy for this is thus  they are both bulky commodities and not to be hid the excisemen in the towns on the borders and the officers on the coast may be empowered to charge all malt and salt imported from scotland with the english duty as they would do now and this may be without any addition of officers either on the borders or in the ports the salt being so bulky and heavy that it cannot be concealed put in a pocket or carried under a coat so i think that difficulty falls to the ground and to reconcile the rest the following general which is the consequence of the whole seems to me highly reasonable on both sides  that what debts are contracted on both sides be paid by both nations out of the respective duties of either nation as now established that the overplus of the scots revenue be improved for the settling trade and encouragement and employment of the poor and other public uses that the scots be exempted from the taxes of salt and malt only for so long as the english debts are paid or for a certain term of years to be calculated from the proportion between those taxes and the english debts  and afterward to stand upon a proportioned equality with england in all taxes that shall be raised for the public good  this must be called an equality because scotland is at present unconcerned in our debts and cannot reasonably be brought into an encumbrance for that money they had no hand in borrowing nor any part of the advantage of  to say they shall have an equivalent for this payment is not an answer because i think it may be said the tax cannot be laid the poor cannot pay it the equivalent is to the state and cannot be given the poor that are aggrieved if it can it is the same thing and not taxing is a nearer way to keep them easy  as to the excises of beer ale etc i see no occasion to debate them it is a charge on none but the liquor sold and affects no body but they that please to spend their money only it requires the scots ale which they call twopeny ale and which is about the price of our small beer should be expressed to signify small beer and to pay as such the value being the same otherwise the scots would pay for the name and calling that ale which really is but small beer be wronged in the proportion and be pinched in their trade  nor is all this to be called advocating for the scots the question is not here whether it be pleading on this side or that but whether the facts on either side be true and whether the calculated proportions are stated right and the reasons good if not i should be pleased to see any gentleman fairly detect them and would be very forward to alter my judgment  to argue then for truth and justice impartially to state the inequalities on either side and bring them to a balance is neither arguing for the english nor the scots but for the union in general and in that respect is for the general good of britain since the union is for the advantage of the whole but more especially for england which in the pursuit of this work i question not to make good  it remains now to enquire  that since the scots revenue shall amount to above   0000 l per annum more than their expense whether it shall not be thought reasonable to employ that money or such part of it as shall be thought sufficient for the public improvement of the country from whence it is raised and how  the methods for employing it the just occasion there is to do so for restoring the trade of that kingdom employing the poor reviving manufactures and making good losses will be the subject of the next part of this discourse  some expedients and their proper explications for settling the trade to india to the mutual advantage and i hope satisfaction of both kingdoms shall also be part of our care  and lastly to examine the inequalities between the two kingdoms with relation to trade reduce them to a balance and make some enquiry into those hard articles to us viz   the letting the scots into our plantationtrade   opening to them the fountain of our manufactures i mean our wool by which we say they fall into our trade and by underworking and by consequence under selling ruin our trade at home and rob us of the most capital article of our prosperity the employment of our poor   i cannot enter upon these things here but i cannot conclude this part of the work without saying i doubt not to prove that even in all these things we shall have the advantage of scotland and be gainers by the union  i shall prove that the scots trading to our colonies shall enrich those very colonies and that in the single and only wealth which at present is the dead weight upon their prosperity viz the want of people  what prevents our norway trade being converted into a new england trade hemp pitch tar rosin plank masts etc being brought from the continent of america as it already begins to be from carolina why does not new england supply us with copper pensilvania with iron and all these metals which now we purchase with our ready money why are they not bought with our own manufactures wrought by our own people and the wealth of them revert to our general stock why are not the bowels of the earth searched in the vast tracts of land we possess there for a treasure which has lain hid for so many ages and which we send to other nations for buy at our disadvantage and let our own lie still as a prize put in the hand of a fool or a talent hid in a napkin it is evident and i shall put it past doubt when i come to the particulars that we have a yet undiscovered wealth in the mountains of america and when we come to ask our merchants there why it has not been searched into they will unanimously answer want of people  this threfore is the wealth the union shall bring us this the treasure to be raised out of the barren mountains of scotland poor scotland shall thus make rich england and we shall gain of them that only wealth that single advantage which of all things we want most and which in time may make britain the most powerful nation in the world  as to our woollen manufactures i i shall prove the scots need them not ii have no genius to ours iii if they had they can never fall into them with advantage or be able to outwork or undersell ours but on the contrary our people are able to outwork them undersell them keep them out of our manufactures and at any time sell them cheaper than they shall be able to make them   there are some necessary speculations which as the consequences of these heads i shall descend to perhaps useful to both nations in which i shall open a scene of advantages to both kingdoms for trade and with which i shall close this design in which without the charge of an extravagant projection i doubt not to show the field of trade is vastly extended and more than sufficient to both kingdoms that a coalition of trade shall be mutually advantageous and not one article of trade be lessened discouraged oppressed or suppressed no not on either hand  that neither the stock of both kingdoms nor the hands of both kingdoms can be too great or too many the one to be improved and the other to be employed in the many and most extensive branches of vet undiscovered trade those uncultivated parts of trade which providence seems to have reserved for a general union of both nations and which we seem almost incapable of carrying on without one another  and that i may not have advanced a notion i cannot make good in saying the union shall be our advantage i shall at last enquire whose shall the wealth be to whom the increase  and in this search it will appear beyond contradiction that as london is the emporium of britain it will be the center of wealth and all the circles will meet there all the lines of trade will be drawn from and to it the parts like members to the body will thrive and grow proportionably fat and rich but this will be the fountain from whence and the conduit through which all that wealth will be conveyed and the ocean into which it all flows will be the people  i shall undertake to prove also that it cannot be otherwise that all returns will be made thither fraights of ships from all foreign nations made thither exchanges will all center there bills be payable there and the general correspondence must come by way of london  of these things i shall treat more largely in our next and the mean time should be glad to see any substantial reason offered against a union and those reasons drawn from any principles o foundations except such as are destructive to the present politic settlement and general good of both  but as i see no room for it i cannot but conclude that nothing can complete the wealth strength and prosperity of both kingdoms like a firm entire complete and indissolvible union  finis
