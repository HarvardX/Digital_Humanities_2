essays on the following subjects i on the reality and evidence of miracles especially those on which the jewish and christian religion are built and on those which were wrought by moses in egypt and why styled by god his judgments on the egyptian deities exodus xii    ii on the extraordinary adventure of balaam the famed eastern prophet and diviner number xxii and seq iii on the surprising march and signal victory gained by joshua over jabin king of hazor and his numberless confederates josh x iv on the religious war of the israelitish tribes against that of benjamin and the almost total destruction of that impious tribe jud xviii and seq v on the amazing speedy relief which saul the newly chosen king of israel brought to the besieged inhabitants of jabeshgilead and the signal overthrow which he gave to the ammonites and their confederates   samuel xi wherein the most considerable objections raised against each respective subject are fully answered the difficulties removed and each of these remarkable transactions accounted for in a rational way  written some years since at the desire and for the use of a young clergyman in the country by an obscure layman in town and now published on occasion of some late attempts made to disprove the probability and even possibility of all miracles particularly by a pretended moral philosopher and more lately by an essaywriter on some philosophical subjects  london printed for a millar in the strand mdccliii  the preface the following essays among many more of the same nature were written as is hinted in the title page at the desire and for the use of a young clergyman and transmitted to him in so many letters on the following laudable occasion his friends had procured him a confiderable benefice in the country where he no sooner came to reside than he was attacked by several of his neighbors most of them men of wit and figure and professed skeptics about the abovementioned and other scriptural subjects of the like important nature in which he had the misfortune to be so little versed that he must in all likelihood have become the frequent subject of their raillery and led a very uneasy life among them had not his good sense and singular modesty directed him to an expedient that would at least entitle him to if not procure him better quarter from them and this was by ingenuously owning himself as yet too young and unacquainted with the topics they urged against him to enter the lists with such seasoned opponents and begging of them for truths sake that he might be allowed the liberty of turning these points in dispute over to a person whom he knew to have been of a long time conversant with that kind of learning and who had lately published some occasional remarks upon sundry subjects of the like controverted nature which had been well received by the public so just and modest a proposal could hardly fail of being complied with and they came into it the more readily it seems when he apprised them that the person he designed to apply to was an obscure layman who had spent a great part of his latter years in privacy and retirement and who he had reason to believe was in no way addicted or bigoted to either party or opinion they only expressed a desire to know his name and such other particulars as he should think fit to acquaint them with both which he declined to do without my leave lest that should induce me to refuse the task as he was fully apprised of the care i had taken to conceal my being the author of those productions from all but a few select friends i failed not in my next letter to thank him for his kind caution and to assure him of my unwillingness to comply with his request upon any other terms to which he informed me soon after they all readily acquiesced immediately after which our epistolary correspondence began and each of the subjects in debate were regularly conveyed to me by him with full liberty of methodizing both the objections and answers in such manner as i thought would prove most convincing and satisfactory to them or to the public in case i should be inclined to make them so  this license proved the more acceptable to me because though i had then no view of printing them yet i found the most serious of those subjects treated by his antagonists in so trivial and ludicrous a manner as if they had been fitter for ridicule than an impartial examination so that i made no difficulty to take them at their word and to retrench as much of the sarcastical pleasantry out of their objections as i found void of reasoning as well as to soften the profaneness and scurrility of their language wherever it could be done without lessening the weight and strength of their objections and thus much may suffice for the occasion of my writing these essays  i must however acquaint the reader that the five abovementioned subjects were not the only controverted ones that were sent to me from the same quarter several others they successively communicated to me no less curious and important some of which i found had been so fully and learnedly treated by a set of gentlemen in a late extensive work that i made no scruple to refer our antagonists to it for a satisfactory answer to all their objections un hist   vo vol iii p   0 and seq     and seq  of this nature were those two miraculous transactions mentioned in the old testament viz the passage of the israelites through the red sea exodus xiv and the supernatural solstice obtained by joshua their new chief in the land of canaan josh x to which i may add a third which gave me no less pleasure to find so justly and evidently cleared by those curious gentlemen and in a manner entirely new viz the different genealogies given of christ in the gospels of st matthew and st luke ibid vol x p     and seq r  a point that has lately exercised some of our best heads and this i the more readily did in hopes that if i could by that means bring my polemic correspondents to be better acquainted with that extensive work they would find so many difficulties of the like nature so satisfactorily cleared as would of course much lessen the matter of this our epistolary controversy as well as induce them to treat these serious and important subjects in a less ludicrous and offensive manner  as for the occasion of my now publishing the five following ones i shall not insist here on the kind invitations i had to it from some of my worthy country friends who had both perused them and been witnesses of the good effect they had on some of my young clergymans antagonists for if that had had a sufficient weight with me they had appeared in print some years ago neither could the various attempts that have been made from time to time by so many eminent hands against the authority of the sacred books have induced me to it since then because i could see neither objection nor argument in any of them if we except perhaps the newness and variety of their dress but had been fully exploded over and over by persons of equal sense and learning and much superior to them in the learned worlds eye in point of judgment and fair solid reasoning and what could not but lessen ones value of them without paying any regard to or taking the least notice of what had been so often and so powerfully urged on the other side of the question this treatment appears still the more unfair as they have not hitherto made any fresh attack on their side but has been soon after fairly examined and confuted on ours and i may add in a more civil serious candid and impartial way than we have as yet met from them though they so frequently charge us with the contrary behavior but how justly let every reader judge from all that has been written on either side i was therefore so well satisfied upon the whole that the foundation of the jewish and christian revelation as well as the evidence of the miracles upon which both are built were out of all danger of being shaken by any attempt that had hitherto been made or as i imagined could be made against it from that quarter that i could not suppose this occasional performance of mine could add any weight to that variety of solid arguments and cloud of unquestionable testimonies that had been urged in its defense i was rather in hopes that after the divine authority both of the law and gospel had been so clearly and learnedly demonstrated all the other difficulties and cavils which have been raised against them would easily have yielded to that superior evidence and have subsided of their own accord instead of furnishing our skeptic opponents with fresh occasion of discrediting and ridiculing the sacred records by magnifying and misrepresenting those difficulties at the unfair rate they have lately done and as if they were of themselves sufficient to invalidate their divine authority and the credibility of the great and manifold miracles upon which it is founded see the author of the characteristics collins tindal chub etc  but as those further exceptions could never be deemed by the serious part of mankind sufficient to outweigh so great an evidence a new expedient must be thought on that might at once overturn both the foundation and superstructure and that was by trying to destroy not only the probability but even the possibility of all miracles to this end among other champions one of them a prosessed infidel boldly enters the lists under the disguise of a moral philosopher and not only attacks the greatest and best attested miracle of the gospel against the learned author of the trial of the witnesses resurrection considered p    and seq  but on the strength of an imaginary victory concludes that indigested performance with what he styles a full and unanswerable confutation of the reality and possibility of any of the rest his swelling style induces one to believe that he comes fraught with some newset arguments that will give a decisive blow to the controversy between us whilst in fact he produces none but such trite and exploded ones as give reason to expect that something more effectual is still behind and kept in reserve for the concluding blow without which one would hardly have the patience to follow him through so much scurrility arrogance and impiety and you are not apprised of your mistake till you are insensibly brought to the end of the book  this piece however which had so little novelty to recommend it except the boldness and inveteracy of its style gave our country antagonists such new matter for triumph that my young clergyman was forced to call upon me for fresh assistance every argument in it appearing to them both new and decisive so little were they versed in that trite controversy and i should have had the irksome task of confuting them had not i been timely relieved by a much abler hand which appeared soon after in the defense of the trial of the witnesses and in a few pages at the end of it exploded all his pretended reasoning against the possibility of miracles in so clear nervous and convincing a manner evidence of the resurrection cleared p     and seq  as i doubted not would upon the bare reading effectually satisfy them and excuse my proceeding farther upon that head as well as from publishing any of the other subjects of our epistolary controversy unless some future and more proper occasion should induce me to it but this i imagined would not be in haste considering the signal defeat which that daring champion had met with after having spent so long a time in raking up all the objections and sophistical reasoning of his whole unbelieving tribe against the possibility of all miracles and in dressing them up in the most assuming and invidious terms for this bold piece did not appear in print till the incomparable one he pretended to answer had gone through a tenth edition and it was in all likelihood the success and universal approbation this last so justly met with that caused such an extraordinary profusion of gall in our pretended moral philosopher beyond what is usually met with in the writings of his brethren so that it was now high time for them to look out for some skilful hand to wipe off as much as possible the discredit which that frantic performance had done to them and their cause by resuming its defense if not by a new recruit of more solid arguments their logic and philosophy having been long exhausted by dressing the old exploded ones in such a polite and artful trim as might carry at least the appearance of novelty and thereby the more easily insinuate them into the minds of the thoughtless and unwary without giving such great offense to those of the opposite side  and here i cannot pretend to say how many hands engaged in this new attempt i rather wonder that any should where so little thanks and credit were to be gained and where the only plausible pretext for so doing viz the promoting of natural religion or moral virtue and the happiness of society had been so fairly exploded and their writeings proved by so many able pens to tend to undermine and ruin them both insomuch that one of the politest of them and a strenuous opposer of revealed religion makes no difficulty to own its superior influence on the lives and conduct of mankind to all the other topics which he had put into the mouth of his epicurean philosopher and to conclude his argument with this notable remark which whether meant in earnest or no must needs carry its own evidence with it in the judgment of every strict observer of mankind his words are these humes essay on particular providence and future state p      whether this reasoning of theirs about the rewards and punishments of a future state be just or not is no matter its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same and those who attempt to disabuse them may for ought i know be good reasoners but i cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians since they free men from one restraint upon their passions and make the infringement of the laws of equity and society in one respect more easy and secure  now if the notion of future rewards and punishments founded on a mere abstruse reasoning be allowed to be of any efficacy toward the preservation of the peace and interest of society how much greater influence must it be supposed to have on the minds and actions of men when once sirmly believed to be founded on the authority of a divine revelation and such a revelation as is so exactly calculated to promote the most social and exalted virtues and to enforce them by the noblest and most powerful motives insomuch that were it not built on so strong a foundation it would be hardly possible for a sincere wellwisher to human society not to wish it were so and may we not here safely pronounce that author to be a much worse politician and commonwealthsman who has taken such extraordinary pains to overturn burlesque and ridicule it if not with such scurrilous and inveterate malice as his predecessor had done yet with such subtle and sophistical reasoning and dogmatic arrogance as if the peace and welfare of mankind depended wholly on its ruin see his essay on miracles pass  if the former therefore has been so justly censured for his splenetic and blasphemous language even by those who are no enemies in other respects to his way of thinking some decent regard being certainly due to that authority from which we derive the liberty we enjoy of free speaking and writeing what must a sober reader think of the latter who without producing one new argument against the reality and evidence of those miracles upon which it is founded or taking the least notice how clearly and fully all his old ones against it had been exploded by so many persons of learning and merit makes no scruple to pronounce them mere delusions forgery and impositions upon mankind merely on account of their being miracles so that according to him every man of sense may and ought to reject them without farther trial or regard either to the authority they claim or any evidence or testimony how great soever that is urged in defense of them see humes essay on miracles p     and seq  how much behind his brother he comes in his bitter as well as unjust reflections against the christian revelation may be judged among many other instances by this one scantling with which he concludes his essay where having told his reader but a page or two before that our most holy religion so he is pleased to style it in an ironical sneer is founded on faith and not on reason and that it is the surest way to expose it to put it to such a trial as it is by no means fit to endure ibid p  0   he closes up the whole with these remarkable words see humes essay on miracles p  0   so that upon the whole we may conclude that the christian religion was at first not only attended with miracles but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity and whoever is moved by faith to assent to it is conscious of a miracle in his own person which subverts all the principles of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience i am willing to hope however that the sincere professors of that holy religion will be able to draw a much juster conclusion from his premises and that the sight of so much learning philosophy and subtle reasoning displayed in defense of so bad a cause will direct them to discover the real miracle where this author least expects it whilst it reminds them of the many signal instances in which the divine providence has according to an express promise visibly interposed in confounding the wisdom of the learned and defeating the counsels of the prudent and crafty of this world conf isa xxxix    and   cor i and seq   what i would farther observe with respect to this notable conclusion is his shrewd manner of introducing it two or three pages before in these terms i am the better pleased with this method of reasoning as i think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguised enemies to the christian religion who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason humes essay on mirales p  0  and seq  the design of this ungenerous not to say invidious reflection on all those learned men who have appeared in defense of the jewish or christian revelation is too barefaced to want explanation and too plainly shows the singular disregard he has and would at any rate inspire his readers with both for them and their writings and if his vain conceit of his performance made him imagine that it would deter others from entering the lists against him in support of the same interesting cause it cannot but be extremely pleasing to all sincere wellwishers to it to see how quickly he was undeceived and how many able pens were ready to defend it by dint of fair and sound reasoning without the least apprehension of being reckoned either dangerous friends or disguised enemies to it see among others adamss essay on mr humes essay where the latter is fully and clearly answered paragraph by paragraph  two characters which are nowhere so justly applicable as where so much merit and force of argument is boasted and so little urged to support it or where so manifest a distance some would venture to call it contrariety appears between the skeptical structure of the premises and the dogmatic boldness of the conclusion  it is hardly possible to read the greater part of that polite authors essays without imagining yourself to be perusing some long and elaborate commentary or exposition on one of the most instructive lessons of the book of wisdom the words of that excellent ancient author whose work is by the greeks justly styled panaretos are as follow wisdom of solomon ix    ad fin   verse    for what man is he who can know the counsel of god or know what the lords will is     for the thoughts of mortal man are fearful and our devices are but uncertain     for the corruptible body presses down the soul and the earthly tahernacle weighs down the mind that museth on many things     and hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon earth and with great difficulty do we find out the things that are at hand but the things that are in heaven who has searched out     and thy counsel who has known except thou give him wisdom and send thy holy spirit from above     for so were the ways of them that lived on earth reformed and men were taught by thee the things that are pleasing unto thee and were saved through wisdom    in which the weakness of human understanding the narrow boundaries of our knowledge the darkness of our conception the fallibility of our reasonings the wildness of our conclusions and other human defects from which the greatest philosophers of all sects and ages were not exempt are exemplified in a most philosophical and pathetic manner the only difference between the text and comment is in the choice of the most proper remedy the former directing us to seek it in that wisdom which comes from above and flows from the sacred fountain of divine revelation the only sure and safe criterion of truth the other unwilling to go so far on what he thinks a bootless errand being entirely satisfied in his own mind that every thing of that kind that is pretended to be derived from thence is no other than mere delusion or forgery imagines there may be a much nearer way to be found to it and though he has sought for it in vain in all the schools of philosophy both ancient and modern yet having after much difficulty and study happily stumbled upon one which will better suit his purpose is no less industrious in recommending the use of it to mankind as a most efficacious nay an everlasting check to all kinds of bigotry and superstitious delusions and so safe a criterion for every wise man to regulate his belief by that the benefit of it will in all likelihood be felt as long as the world endures essay on miracles p      this new criterion this new touchstone is what he styles experience or common observation which though in most respects as old as our first parents yet may be nevertheless allowed a new discovery with respect to the unlimited application he would have us make of it to all times places persons and cases so that according to him whatever facts doctrines or other pretended truths fall in our way and will not abide this test may and ought by every wise man to be struck out of his creed but more especially all such as carry the face or pretense of a miracle on whatever testimony founded as being the most opposite to common experience and observation  by what powerful arguments he has deavoured to establish the certainty and safety of this new criterion so as to venture upon the strength of it not only to explode the authority of the sacred books but to burlesque and ridicule all the miracles recorded both in the law and gospel how he makes it appear that the want of experience or observation of a fact is equivalent to its being contrary to it and consequently sufficient to outweigh all that multitude and variety of testimonies both from friends and foes which are urged in defense of their reality and evidence lastly what irrefragable proofs he or any of his predecessors have hitherto produced not only against the probability but even the possibility of all miracles so as to dare to pronounce all those upon which the jewish and christian revelations are built to be mere delusions and imposture shall be fairly examined in the first and some of the following essays and i was the more readily prevailed upon to make them public at this juncture not only as the subjects they were written in defense of were some of those which had been most carped at and ridiculed by our modern skeptics and ranked in the lump by the author last quoted among the most absurd and fabulous productions of those remote and barbarous ages and people essay on miracles p  0  and seq  but because i am satisfied they have not hitherto that i know of been sufficiently examined or so rationally accounted for as i hope they will be found there and if the reader find something new and peculiar in the light i have given to those miracles which moses wrought in egypt in the first essay or by joshua in the land of canaan in those that follow it i doubt not but it will upon due examination be found to be exactly conformable to the strict tenor of the text as well as to the main end and scope of the divine providence considered not as terminating solely in the benefit and prosperity of the israelitish nation as our opposers misrepresent it but as a real prelude of that universal system in favor of mankind which had been in part revealed to adam immediately after his fall genes iii     and was to be conducted by gradual steps to its full completion by our divine redeemer under the light of his glorious gospel for if it can be once fairly proved against all our opposers to be every way consistent with the wisdom and goodness of the supreme being to interpose his divine power in order to rectify the enormous disorders that had been introduced into the moral world particularly in religion then it will be no less evident that no period could be more seasonable to lay the foundation of such a reformation than this when the civil power and the avarice of the heathen priests had rendered the distemper incurable by any other means than by such a series of wonders no scene more proper to display them in than egypt where the most abominable idolatry and worship had its birth and had spread itself into all other countries far and near neither will any of the miracles which moses wrought there under the divine power and direction appear less wisely levelled against some one or other of their pretended deities or against some other branch of their idolatrous theology and consequently every way conducive to the main design of convincing that infatuated people by the most rational means of gods absolute superintendency and government over the whole creation  the extraordinary adventure of balaam and the singular circumstances that accompanied it have been likewise the subject of much cavil and ridicule among our unbelievers and of doubt and dissatisfaction among the far greater part of believers both jews and christians either for want of leisure or capacity to give it a due and serious examination many of them even among the latter looking upon the whole transaction as scarce worth or fit to bear a scrutiny yet i am willing to hope that what i have said upon it will easily reconcile any impartial reader to the most exceptionable part of it and make the whole to appear altogether uniform agreeable and conducing to the same gracious system of the divine providence but of all the transactions recorded in the old testament none have been objected so much against or with so great appearance of reason as those surprising swift marches and signal victories ascribed to joshua saul and other hebrew chiefs and which considering the plain and succinct style in which they are related by the sacred penmen are clogged with so many geographical and other difficulties as have appeared to some of the ablest commentators altogether insurmountable i have in the following essays singled out two of the most remarkable instances of that kind viz that of joshua over jabin king of hazor and his numberless confederates and the swift conquest of northern canaan that immediately followed it josh xi pass  and that of saul over nahash king of the ammonites at the siege of jabeshgilead   samuel xi pass  this last above all others is related with so many circumstances which give it the appearance of impossibility that most critics and commentators have been contented to let the credibility of it rest on the sole authority of the inspired writer and yet i dare flatter myself to have made it plainly appear in the last of these essays that there wanted nothing but a competent acquaintance with the excellent laws and martial discipline of the hebrews together with some attention to the geography of their country and the situation of their respective tribes both with regard to each other and to the heathen nations round about them to dispel all those seemingly unsurmountable difficulties and to demonstrate that whole transaction to be every way as feasible and probable though in most respects as great and noble if not much more so as any that is to be met with in sacred or profane history  this last piece it is hoped the reader will not be displeased to see published in a different form from the rest  viz in that of a sermon in which it was originally written by the same lay hand when he comes to be acquainted at the conclusion with the occasion and success of it and thus much shall suffice for a preface to these essays which if they meet with a favorable acceptance from the public may be hereafter followed by the remainder of our epistolary intercourse on the like obscure and controverted places of the sacred writ  essay i letter   on the real evidence of miracles in general and more particularly of those which were wrought in confirmation of the jewish and christian revelation  reverend sir i am not a little concerned to hear that your lot is so unluckily fallen into a parish where you are so frequently attacked by your skeptic neighbors who take an ungenerous delight in pressing you upon those difficult points of scripture in which they know you to be least versed such as particularly the hebrew and other eastern tongues the jewish economy antiquities laws and customs and it is greatly to be wished either that there were not so great a number of our clergy who have like you been misled into a neglect of so necessary a branch of learning or that they would as often as they fall under the like difficulties make use of the same method you have condescended to take of supplying that defect by appealing to some more proper judge of every point in dispute rather than to suffer the authority of the sacred historians to be impaired through your want of ability as you modestly word it of defending them and i no less applaud your prudence in the choice of a layman who will in all probability be thought less exceptionable than a clergyman in a controversy of this nature but why you should single me out for the task when you might so easily have pitched upon one of much superior ability to answer the end i can only ascribe to that partial satisfaction you lately expressed in reading some of my former observations on several obscure and controverted points of the old testament i shall therefore the more readily accept of your offer as it will afford me an opportunity of communicating to you and your neighbors some more of the same kind which i have had occasion to make during my long recess from the world and which in all likelihood must otherwise have lain neglected and useless by me and i own myself highly obliged to you for having engaged yourself to conceal my name unless permitted by me to do otherwise which i cannot by any means consent to upon several considerations i need not trouble you and them with one of which will however easily occur to you that it is too obscure and too little known to add any weight to what i shall transmit to you on its own merit let it stand or fall one thing you may indeed acquaint them with because it may in all probability make a favorable impression on them viz that the writer is a layman who though neither designed for nor ever intending to enter into holy orders has yet chosen to dedicate the greater part of his latter life to this kind of study but has still for some not unworthy reasons carefully concealed his name although some of his productions have met with a good reception from the public and as you are sufficiently apprised that this is my case so it can hardly fail of meeting with a ready belief from a person of your singular integrity thus much in answer to the former part of your letter  as to the objections and difficulties raised by them against several miraculous and other historical facts recorded in the old testament these are particularly mentioned in the titlepage and preface  as i have long ago had occasion to examine them at my leisure hours so i doubt not to convince them in the subsequent essays that they chiefly arise either from their not being sufficiently acquainted with or their not having given sufficient attention to the peculiar genius of the hebrew idiom the laws discipline and customs of the jews and the uniform and general design of providence toward them and more particularly to a misapprehension of their being calculated solely in favor of that nation whereas in fact they were no less designed and fitted for the benefit of the rest of the heathen world so that if your skeptic neighbors are the persons of sense and candor you represent them i flatter myself i shall find no great difficulty in removing all that heap of doubts and difficulties which they have thrown in your way with respect to the facts in question and at the same time make it appear to their satisfaction that this admirable and long series of miracles which were wrought both in egypt and in the land of canaan were so far from being calculated in favor of the jewish nation only that they are no less than a gradual and uniform sequel of that divine scheme which had been laid ever since the creation for the benefit of all mankind and was to be fully completed in the person of the messiah when the fullness of the time was come  in the mean while as you inform me that some of your antagonisis are great admirers of the noble author of the characteristics of collins tindal the late writer of the moral philosopher and other professed opposers of divine revelation and of the miracles on which the jewish and christian religion are built it will be highly requisite before i proceed farther to take a short examen of the arguments by which those authors pretend to prove not only the incredibility but likewise the impossibility of all miracles in general as well as of those which are urged in confirmation of the law and gospel were a mere stranger to guess at the merit of the christian revelation by the indefatigable pains which these pretended wellwishers to mankind and public society have taken to overthrow it he must of course conclude it to be one of the worst and the most dangerous instead of the most beneficial and comfortable systems of religion in the world and if we were to measure the success of their labor either by the number of their admirers or by the victorious applauses they assume to themselves or have received from them we could not hardly suppose any thing but that they had long since gained their point and silenced all opposers by the most irresragable arguments and clearest demonstration de his vid int al spinos leibnit dissert de fid and ration collins tindal moral philosopher considerations on the resurrection against the trial of the witnesses and al  and yet we plainly see that as on the one hand they have never dared yet openly to impugn the excellent morality of its precepts so neither have they been able on the other to undermine its foundation by all the variety of engines they have set on work for that purpose they have all indeed made strong efforts to cry down the validity truth probability and some of them even possibility of those numberless miracles on which its evidence is chiefly founded they have left no art untried to expose them as contrary to reason and the experience of mankind and what they know of the stated laws and course of nature they have represented them as inconsistent with the immutability of the supreme being and as insufficient evidences of the doctrines they are urged in proof of some of them have endeavored to expose the law and the gospel as unnecessary and impertinent revelations mens natural faculties being able to teach them the most excellent morals to furnish them with the most effectual incentives to the observation of them and to inspire them with the truest notions of the divine nature and a well grounded belief of a supreme being and his providence which if true overturns at once the necessity of a revelation and of the miracles urged in proof of it others again as positively affirm that such revelations were not only needless but that the admitting of any such implies some extraordinary defect in the morai world which requires a divine interposition to amend it whereas all gods works being the result of infinite wisdom power and goodness can never be supposed to stand in need of any amendment much less of a divine interposition to rectify them lastly they affirm with the same assurance that if such an interposition of the divine power was ever requisite upon that or any other occasion it must have been always and ever continue to be so if miracles therefore were thought necessary or expedient at any time they must be so at all times because say they whoever supposes god to have wrought them in one generation and not in another must of course look upon him as a partial being consider ubi sup p    edit   p     this is the sum and substance of all their arguments against the reality evidence and possibility of miracles in consequence of which they have made no scruple to condemn them all in the lump as delusions and vile impositions upon mankind and the recorders of them be their character what it will in other respects as dealers in forgeries and monstrosities and unworthy any credit or regard humes essay on miracles p     and seq   from this short scantling i have given of the premises and conclusion you and your skeptic neighbors may clearly see what pains those authors have taken to eradicate as far as possible the very notion of a divine revelation founded on miracles out of the world and it was natural for them to prefer that expeditious way to any other and since they could not stand against the shafts that galled them from that battery to endeavor by any means to blow it up and if their sanguine hopes have hitherto failed of success the world will at least say thus much in justice to them that their disappointment is owing to some other cause than to the want of zeal or hard struggling for it on their part whilst those who reflect more justly upon it will probably be reminded of christs infallible promise to his church matthew xvi     that he would protect it to the end of time and against much more powerful and dangerous attempts than any of these gentlemen can make against it but this more properly belonging to your province i shall leave to you to take notice of and urge against your opponents as occasion offers and as i doubt not but you are by this time thoroughly acquainted with those excellent authors who have written in defense of the jewish and christian revelation i shall here insert some of the principal of them for the sake of the younger sort of readers see grotius and labadie de verit limborchs theolog and amica collat cum erudito judaeo lesleys short method with the deists bentleys boyles lectures and philoluther lipsiens dean bs alciphron dr sam clark saurin calmet and al on the most difficult places in the old testament  it will not be improper to observe to them how short those of the opposite side are from having completed their task were even their arguments against revelation more solidly founded and their inferences more fairly drawn than they will be found upon closer examination to be for even in such case the merit of the controversy at the best will be still left in suspense until they have fully consulted all that has been urged in defense of it and all that a reader of a moderate capacity could conclude after a careful perusal of both sides would be only this that it was a point about which much might and had been urged pro and con but on which side to fix he was still at a loss it is true one thing must greatly help to determine him in favor of our side who are the defendants in possession viz our readiness at all times to enter the list with them on the fairest terms and to give their arguments a candid hearing as well as the most solid and pertinent answers whilst they without paying the least regard to them take all opportunities they can to appear in the field with the same air of triumph though so often repulsed and with the same old weatherbeaten invalids kept up it seems in reserve upon every fresh occasion to make a shortlived parade in some new modish dress and be laid up again till farther orders it would be no difficult matter to discover the grounds of these so frequent and indecent insults on a revelation that has the seal of heaven for its credentials the most excellent and exalted morality for its voucher the testimony of all antiquity foes as well as friends for its evidence the most considerable men of all ages for learning judgment and integrity for its defenders and the legislative power for its support but i shall leave that to you and others to infer from the plain tendency and spirit of their writings and the nature of the religion which they would substitute in its stead there you will likewise see with ease the true motive of their singular contempt for the clergy especially of those who have written most clearly and powerfully in defense of christianity or most effectually detected and exploded the sophistry and fallacy of their arguments against its evidence from miracles this last is indeed an affront or injury perhaps in their sense they will not easily forgive them as it has cast no small reflection on their integrity as well as judgment and by that means prevented their favorite scheme from going so swimmingly on or meeting with so general an approbation as they seemed to expect see rights of the christian church defended christianity as old as the creation independent whig moral philosopher and al pass  it is not unlikely neither that your skeptic neighbors and others of their admirers and disciples may flatter themselves with the hopes of better days and an happier world should these demagogues prove so successful as to become the only instructors and reformers of it and by procuring their so much boasted system of natural religion to be adopted instead of the christian which is now established set human reason at once free from the oppression of mysterious creeds and their fellowsubjects from the dominion of priestcraft and other religious impositions so that every one might live peaceably under his own vine and under his own fig tree and i may add in his own way without fear or danger of coercion or other disturbance from those hot zealots for revelation but were that more likely to be ever the case than it is i can see but little reason to expect that we of the laity should meet with berter quarter by becoming the disciples and catechumens of these new guides than we enjoy under our present ones or that men that betray so much subtilty and sophistry in their reasonings and show themselves in the highest degree either skeptical or dogmatical as best suits with their purpose could much better agree in any one system of morality or religion than ours do or indulge their disciples in a greater freedom of thinking and acting than these do their flocks hitherto they have been only endeavoring to undermine and pull down an old structure they do not like but if we may guess from thence how they will act when they come to build their new one it is much to be feared that let them split themselves into ever so many systems about it they will agree in this one canon to turn skepticism over to their hearers and to allow of none to act the dogmatists but those that sit in the chair but not to create to ourselves needless fears from their illgrounded hopes let us now take a short survey of those pretended irrefragable arguments they have hitherto urged against the credibility and possibility of miracles and on the strength of which one of their latest writers has made no difficulty to affirm they may and ought to be rejected as delusions and forgeries merely on account of their being miracles let the authority of the recorder or evidence of the fact be what they will because according to him the evidence of the testimony must naturally rise or fall according as the fact related is more or less agreeable to our common experience and observation the consequence of which must be that where the fact attested has seldom fallen under observation there is a contest of two opposite experiences of which the one destroys the other as far as its force goes humes essay on miracles p      this strange way of reasoning which seems to imply that want of observation and contrary to observation are the same thing has been already so clearly confuted by a learned author adamss essay on miracles p  0 and seq  that it were superfluous to add anything to it only i cannot but observe that it is much the same with that which a witty french writer font world in the moon supposes roses would be apt to make concerning their gardener and conclude him to be some eternal and unchangeable being because they had never observed any alteration in him either with respect to age dress etc now if i may be permitted to carry the allusion a little farther let us suppose that they had some authentic records that this same gardener had many generations before made a much finer appearance for some time that is in his sundays dress or that in some corner of the rosebush there had been kept a constant tradition and very authentic monuments and records that the same gardener in some ages still more remote had been so kind to the whole shrub as to cut down a tree which greatly incommoded it by its shade and frequent dropping of rain or that he had planted a very convenient and comfortable fence to shelter them against the cutting northwinds in this case if that author reasons justly it is plain that all these facts must be rejected as fabulous or mere forgeries because they could not find either by observation or experience that they had been ever incommoded by any such tree on the one side or had ever wanted such a shelter on the other or that ever the gardener had been seen in any but one and the same dress  but is there no disparity between the facts recorded of the gardener and those which the sacred writers ascribe to the supreme being yes doubtless a vast one but as the want of observation could be no sufficient argument against the authenticity of the facts in one case so neither can it be against that of the other unless either of them can be demonstrated to be above the power of their respective agents or to have implied a palpable contradiction an hard point this one would think to prove with respect to the deity let us therefore see now how they have succeeded in their attempt to do it but here you will i doubt not easily excuse me if for brevity and clearness sake as well as to avoid troubling you with a multitude of quotations i choose to link the sum and substance of all their objections and reasonings together with my answer to them in one chain and to contract both in one short view rather than as they lie scattered in the works of the writers on both sides of the controversy and you will do me the justice to think that as i would not charge them with any thing but what is expressly found in their writings much less would i omit any thing they have said on this important head that carries any weight with it for though your antagonists at p  may not perhaps carry their opposition so far as the authors i am going to examine in which case they can easily disculpate themselves from it to you yet would it by no means excuse my omitting any material thing that has been urged by others on so momentous a point  first then as to that old and trite objection against miracles that they are no proper proofs of any doctrine i have already shown some instances in which they really are and that the raising of the dead is as full and proper evidence of the doctrine of the resurrection as any that could be possibly given or reasonably required see the preface  again the miraculous cures wrought on the blind lame lepers lunatics paralytics and other discases were no less proper as well as pregnant proofs both of the universal depravity of mankind and of the guilt incurred by it when the same miraculous power that delivered them from the dire effects of the former pronounced them absolved from the latter matthew ix   and seq  what greater proof could any one require to convince him that his guilt or sin was really remitted to him with respect to the penalty or punishment of it in the next life than such a miraculous deliverance from that only part of it which was the consequence of it in this with respect to the monstrous idolatry and abominable superstitions which had overrun the greatest part of the heathen world at the time when moses made his second appearance in egypt could any thing be more proper or pertinent to convince that nation of the absurdity and impiety of their worshipping and putting any confidence in the false deities of their own creating or of the god of israel being the supreme governor and disposer of all sublunary things than that long and wonderful contest which he condescended to enter into with them wherein every miracle wrought under his direction and auspices by his servant was so exactly levelled against some one or other of their pretended deities and every other branch of their superstitious worship as will be more fully shown in the next essay and if egypt was at that time the chief seat of learning from which every branch of it together with that vast variety of extravagancies which related to their worship flowed into most other countries about it far and near if their priests and doctors were allowed to excel all others not only in the knowledge of their profound and mystic theology but in their skill in astronomy astrology natural philosophy magic divination and other pretended occult arts and sciences where could there be a more proper scene for this display of his supreme and irresistible power than that what means more likely to convince not only pharaoh and his subjects but all other nations which had received their false theology from thence of the vanity and impotency of their imaginary deities than the constant defeat which was given to them at every new trial what time more proper than this for it when the infection was grown so universal and become incurable by any other means by its reigning under the pretense of a divine sanction whilst those who alone had the power of suppressing made it their interest and glory to support and propagate it lastly what occasion more worthy of the divine interposition than the reducing such a number of nations from the most destructive and abominable errors in faith and practice to such a sense of his unerring providence such an obedience to his will and such pure and undefiled worship of him as could alone entitle them to his favor and blessings in this and the next life  hence then we may safely conclude that miracles were so far from being such improper evidences of gods gracious design of reclaiming a degenerate world from that multitude of errors and enormities into which it was irretrievably immerged that they appear to have been the most effectual if not the only means that could bring about so desirable a change as they were most apt to awaken the attention of mankind appealed to their rational faculties without offering any violence to their freedom and gave them the strongest assurances of his overruling providence over the whole creation and what still more nearly concerned them to know over all those imaginary deities whether the luminaries planets stars elements or any other mistaken object of their worship and confidence hence also we may judge how worthy of the divine goodness and justice such a miraculous interposition ought to appear to every serious thinker that is not as merely calculated in favor of the poor and despicable nation of the jews as our opposers falsely suggest but for the benefit both present and future of the heathen world and ultimately as a part of prelude to the grand system of the redemption of mankind see grot de verit lib   comm in exodus labadie verit de la religion judaique bates harmony of the divine attributes brays covenant hammond and other commentators on excd sam clarks lectures and al   against all this how reasonable soever they have as i observed to you a little higher levelled a new set of arguments which in their judgment amount to no less than so many demonstrations not only against the credibility but the possibility of all miracles how firmly soever attested and on what occasion soever pretended to have been wrought how justly we shall now examine  first then with regard to the universal disaster which we lately observed had overrun the moral world and stood in need of nothing less than the divine interposition to rectify they peremptorily object that both the material and moral world being alike the production of infinite wisdom power and goodness cannot be otherwise than perfect each in their kind and consequently out of all possibility of ever standing in need of any such interposition to amend it this is one of their fundamental axioms which whosoever can admit without any farther proof for none they have or can give of it must of course give up the cause of miracles as absurd and utterly exploded what they affirm of the material world being less pertinent to our present controversy i shall content myself with reminding them that a much greater natural philosopher than they can produce out of their class made no scruple to declare himself of a contrary opinion viz that the frame of it would in course of time require the same divine hand to retouch and refit it that had at first created it sir isaac newtons optics p     last edit  with respect to the moral world it is no less certain that two as great moral philosophers as ever antiquity or the world could boast were so far from dreaming any thing like its having been created in such pretended perfection as to be above all possibility of ever wanting the divine interposition to reform it that one of them socrates vid plut in alcibiad ad fin  thought it highly reasonable to hope that god in time would send some proper messenger from heaven to instruct mankind in the great duties of religion and morality the other the celebrated confucius who flourished in china above a century earlier than that of athens that is about   0 years before the christian era used to comfort himself and his disciples under the then reigning degeneracy with a prevailing tradition they had among them that the saint or holyone so he styled the extraordinary person who was expected to work a signal reformation in the world would in time appear in the west martini hist sinens p     du halde in vit confuc and alib  meaning doubtless christ the promised messiah and divine lawgiver this notion of an holy lawgiver or reformer together with his character of a peaceable prince and the very year of his coming into the world if we may believe the chinese missionaries was so well known and strongly believed not only in confuciuss time but for several ages after him that on the very year in which it was foretold he should be born which was exactly that of christs birth the then reigning monarch a prince otherwise of no great character is recorded to have changed his name of ngay which signified a conquror into that of ping or peaceable in memory of that remarkable event martin du halde and al ub sup  how they came by this tradition or could be so exact as to the year we are not told but it is not unlikely that the chinese received it from noah or some of his immediate descendents as they were settled in those remote parts some few ages after the flood and as to their being exact with respect to the very year it is probable that they kept their records more carefully as living separate from other nations who were continually at war with each other whilst they enjoyed a constant peace among themselves and freedom from invaders without so that the tradition being in all probability the same which was likewise preserved in the family of shem and descended from thence to the israelites importing that the messiah or promised seed should appear at the close of the fourth or beginning of the fifth millenary confucius might more easily determine the precise time from their records with which he was perfectly acquainted but as to the precise coincidence of the year with that of christs birth it wholly depends on the credit of the jusuits abovementioned   we may indeed safely leave it to them to make out this pretended impossibility of the worlds ever wanting to be amended against the known sentiment of the rest of the world and the constant experience of all ages and nations and to show in what sense such a divine revelation as that we are defending can be said to amend gods original work except that in which a good education or instruction is known to do for what does a divine revelation else than offord mankind a clearer and more certain knowledge of his divine nature and attributes than bare unassisted reason could do in order to render us more conformable to his will and to the ends for which he made us we may therefore pronounce the moral world perfect when every part of it is endowed with faculties answerable to those ends and it is in this very sense that the wise man ecclef vii    tells us god made man perfect or upright yet adds that they sought out many inventions or as the original imports vain imaginations he was endowed with sufficient faculties to know what is right or wrong and a free power over his own actions that is of making a good or bad use of those faculties without which he would have been only a mere piece of machinery instead of rational free agent and consequently incapable of virtue or vice of reward or punishment but as this does not exclude but rather enforces the necessity of tutors to instruct and direct and monitors to encourage or deter to reprove or reclaim individuals so much more will it do so with respect to the whole moral world and since the experience of every age and nation shows it to be in a continual fluctuation one while making vast advances and improvements in virtue and knowledge and byandby sunk into the grossest ignorance and immorality superstition and idolatry if such has been the state of the moral world that the far greater part of it has preferred falsehood to truth vice to virtue superstition to a pure worship with what face can these pretenders to reasoning and philosophy affirm it out of all possibility of wanting any amendment they may indeed ptonounce those disorders to be incurable and so they do in fact by excluding the only means that can possibly rectify them but what reason can they give us the disease being thus far above all human remedy to believe the divine goodness too unconcerned to interpose in our behalf and furnish us with a more suitable powerful and effectual one viz a more perfect revelation of himself and a system of morality more suitable to his divine will but here they tell us again that we assume too much when we pronounce the disastrous state of mankind to be beyond all human power to rectify seeing the faculties with which he has endowed mankind are abundantly sufficient to recover mankind from any miscarriage and to furnish them with such a system of religion and morality and such a competent nation of god and his providence as will answer all the ends of such a supposed revelation this they positively affirm and though none of them has hitherto dared as they have in other cases to appeal to common experience and observation for the truth of so bold an assumption they being point blank against it a small retrospection on the brightest ages of the most polite ancient nations the egyptians chaldeans babylonians greeks romans etc will soon convince us how few there were amongst their wise and learned men that had any true notion either of the deity or of religion and morality how fewer still those who had either credit or courage to stem the current of superstition and degeneracy in comparison of those who suffered themselves to be hurried away with it to say nothing of the small if not rather ill success of such an opposition against such powerful supporters as the civil power the priesthood and an headstrong populace our antagonists therefore being conscioushow little able that vain assertion was to stand against two such powerful witnesses have thought it more expedient to endeavor to prop it up by some farfetched arguments which how inconclusive soever might at least bear the specious face of reasoning and first they tell us that such a miraculous revelation is inconsistent with gods immutability one of his most essential attributes that is according to their logic if god is immutable in his nature he must be likewise so in his actions wild conclusion this and of no force unless they can also prove all his creatures to be as unchangeable as himself than which nothing is more contrary to all observation and experience nor more absurd and unreasonable to suppose and much more so with respect to the moral world for if the experience of all ages shows it to have been in a constant fluctuation if whole nations appear to have sunk from a good pitch of learning to the lowest dregs of ignorance from the truest and sublimest notions of the supreme being and of the pure worship that is due to him to the basest degrees of idolatry and superstition and from the noblest sentiments of virtue and morality to the most shameful degeneracy and corruption both in theory and practice what reason can there be to suppose much less to affirm so peremptorily as our opposers do that a divine interposition must necessarily be contrary to his immutability is it not rather more just to infer that the very immutability of his nature and counsels must incline i might say oblige him to alter his measures with his creatures as often as he sees them deviate from or go contrary to them or abase those faculties and that freedom of choice with which he had endowed them to purposes quite opposite to the ends for which he had created them can a clockmaker be said to change his mind or design when he goes about mending what is amiss in a clock or a physician when the irregularity of his patient obliges him to alter his prescriptions and method of treating him in order to his recovery much more absurd if not impious will it be to infer a mutability in the supreme and allwise being who foreknowing from all eternity all the possible exigencies of his moral world and the ill use men would make of those faculties and the liberty with which he had endowed them must necessarily be thought to have decreed likewise in his eternal counsel a proper supply for every want and remedy for every disorder so that every such extraordinary interposition as we are contending for that is where the subject is worthy of it is so far from implying any thing like a mutability in the godhead as our opposers would infer that it is in reality no other than an effect of his eternal and unalterable decrees i dare venture to appeal to every considering man whether immutability in this sense is not more truly and every way worthy of the divine nature than that which our opposers attribute to him and which represents the whole creation as a mere large piece of compound mechanism which having been once set in motion by its maker is left to go on its own way without any farther care or regard from him notwithstanding that great variety of disorders and irregularities which is seen and felt in our moral part of it  but here again we are strangely stopped on the sudden and are boldly arraigned as entertaining too high notions of the divine nature and attributes and all our reasonings from the effects to the cause and ascribing those perfections to the latter in an infinite degree which we observe in the former is it seems all false logic and whatever degrees of wisdom justice goodness power etc we ascribe to the creator beyond what has immediately fallen under our observation on the works of nature being all together unsupported by any reason or argument can never be admitted but as mere conjecture and hypothesis hume essay xi p      so that according to this authors reasoning which is for forms sake put into the mouth of an epicurean philosopher supposed to defend his doctrine before an athenian senate as many as have ascribed any higher or any other kind of attributes or perfections to the deity than actually appear to have been exerted to the full in his works have been guilty of flattery and panegyric rather than masters of just reasoning and philosophy which can never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience or give us different measures of conduct and behavior from those which are furnished by reflection on common life ibid p   0  whence we are taught these two special lessons viz first to take care for the future how we launch out in the praises of the supreme creator at that extraordinary rate the greatest divines and moral philosophers have hitherto done seeing the notion of his infinite wisdom power justice etc is no better than absurd nonsense an absolute contradiction to experience and reason the one plainly showing that he never did and the other that it is impossible for him ever to exert any of his perfections or attributes were they ever so truly infinite in any such degree as we may safely pronounce to be such from any effectual appearance or impression they can make upon a finite mind the other lesson we may learn from it is not to suffer ourselves to be any more imposed upon by any pretense how specious soever that he ever did or ever will interpose his power or furnish us with any new means to amend his moral world since if our authors logic is good we have no reason or argument to convince us that bad or corrupt as it may appear to us it is not in as good and perfect condition as he could or knew how to make it and the contrary supposition that he might if he would is at best but mere conjecture and hypothesis  i shall readily leave it to him to make the most of all this bold assuming stuff against the clearest and most convincing reasonings of those great divines and learned philosophers who have hitherto argued in defense of gods infinite perfection if such dogmatical assertions as his may pass for demonstrations with any set of men not only the notion of the divine attributes but that of the divine nature may be in some danger of dwindling into a mere imaginary shadow in their estimation and we may plainly see by the topics they have hitherto made use of to explode the bare possibility of its interposing in human affairs upon any account or exigence whatsoever how much they have already ventured to sink it below the mark to which most other schools except their own had so universally raised it  but since this author not only makes experience and observation the sole touchstone by which we may judge of the truth of any historical facts but seems to engross the sole property and evidence to his own side whilst he absolutely excludes ours from challenging any benefit from it merely because those we challenge in defense of the divine revelation are of a miraculous kind it will not be improper here to examine which of the two has the better claim to it even according to his way of reasoning for if that experience may be most safely depended upon which is founded upon the best testimony it is plain that ours has produced the amplest the most positive unquestionable and universal from friends and foes and been confirmed by other authentic monuments in proof of the miracles recorded in our sacred books vid grotius and labadie de verit lesleys short method and al sup citat vid and un hist octavo vol   p   0 and seq sub not p and alib pass  whereas all the pretended experience he objects against them being of the negative kind and implying no more than a want of experience and observation and not a contrariety to it can never be allowed to outweigh the evidence of a single wellattested testimony much less of such a number and variety of them as we allege against him this he could not but be sensible of and that as he could not object any thing against the sufficiency of them either on account of their paucity or of the character of the witnesses but what had been fully answered long ago and by many able pens he must likewise think that his consining his negative experience to such periods of time in which no such divine interpositions were become unnecessary and consequently could not fall under our observation is but a weak argument against the credibility of their having been displayed in former ones when the exigencies of the moral world did more immediately require them and the occasion of them was altogether worthy of them and when could there be a more worthy one than when mankind were not only sunk into the most dishonorable notions of the deity and the most abominable rites in his worship but had even degenerated so far as to shelter them under the sanction of his authority and institution barring up by that means all possible avenues against conviction and rendering the distemper incurable by any other means but that of a new revelation of himself and his divine will if in such a case we have sufficient testimony that the divine providence interposed and by a long series of miracles the most apposite strove to convince the egyptians who were the first broachers and propagators of that detestable theology and worship of the vanity of their false deities the impiety of their religious rites and of his alone and absolute superintendency over all his creatures and our author is not above supposing that the testimony for those miracles considered apart and in itself may amount to a full proof i would gladly know of what evidence his negative experience of latter ages when no such exigence called for them can be against that of the former ones when there was such a visible necessity for them or how the want of observation in the former can invalidate the testimony which we have of their having been so frequent and so signal in the latter at this rate of reasoning an inhabitant of lower egypt must never believe that palestine and other countries enjoy the benefit of the former and latter rain let ever so many credible eyewitnesses assure him of it because such a blessing is seldom or never observed in his own and for the same wise reason those that live within the tropics ought not on any account to believe that there is either snow or ice without because there is no such thing to be seen within them and onehalf of the moons globe must not believe that our earth is a planet to it because it can never be observed by those of that side by reason of its being constantly turned from us  but here it may be asked how does all this affect our authors argument drawn from nonexperience and nonobservation against testimony which is not here levelled against a few rare phenomenon of nature but against miracles which are a plain deviation from or as he pleases to style them a violation of the laws of nature is not this single consideration sufficient to discredit it and explode the bare possibility of them against any testimony whatever though considered apart and in itself amounting to a full proof i grant that the charge of violation of natures laws were miracles really such as is here so boldly affirmed carries an absurdity sufficient to discourage any thinking person from admitting the bare possibility of it let who will be violator of them whether the supreme author of those laws or any other subordinate power but here the absurdity lies in the supposition of either being possibly chargeable with it for in what sense can the former be possibly taxed with violating his own laws whenever he sees fit for motives worthy of himself to suspend or dispense with them or how can the latter who only act as instruments under him and by his sole direction and power that nature would act constantly and uniformly to the laws that were first impressed upon it by the supreme being is out of all question but what less than being of his own eternal council or having it revealed to him can embolden any creature to affirm or even imagine that he divested himself of all power of ever suspending or dispensing with them upon any occasion whatsoever much less that such a suspension of or dispensing with was a violation of them especially as we still see the same laws constantly observed in every instance but where the exigencies of the moral world rendered such a casual interposition necessary or expedient in which case in cannot be deemed any other than an effect of his divine wisdom and prescience and a part of his eternal decrees in consequence to it as i observed a little higher to you  here again therefore the author lastquoted has greatly overshot himself in making what he calls experience or observation the common standard of the laws of nature hume ibid p   0  which were it ever so truly such as in many cases it is plain it is not yet has nothing to do with miracles the very notion of which supposes a deviation from those laws the impossibility of which can never be with any justice pleaded against testimony until it has been fully demonstrated but that is what our opposers could never yet do nor i may add ever will for where is the absurdity or impossibility of the supreme lawgivers suspending his own laws or even of his decreeing in his eternal counsel the dispensing with or suspension of them for some wise ends toward his rational creatures that is either to convince them of his omnipresence prescience providence mercy justice and absolute government over the whole creation or to inspire them with the deeper regard to him or to revive it in them when obliterated or extinct through the depravity of human nature or to answer any other designs of his unerring will if a true sense of those divine attributes is so beneficial or necessary as having a most powerful influence upon mankind surely such a constant uniform and universal observation of what they style the laws of nature was the most unfit means to revive it in their minds after it had been once obliterated and the experience of all ages plainly assures us that the very hypothesis of it has only served to extinguish instead of rekindling it for what are the wild systems of the stoics and epicureans to name no others but the genuine offspring of that unphilosophical supposition which has been ever observed to be the constant shelter of the most licentious and abandoned of men and the most effectual means to harden them against all remorse and reproofs in a word have not all the enormous disorders that have ever infected the moral world both with respect to theory and practice been chiefly owing to that destructive notion of the worlds for ever continuing in the same unalterable course and without all possibility of its ever wanting or receiving any amendment from its supreme architect but enough has already been said before against the monstrous absurdity of excluding the divine providence from interposing in the extraordinary and miraculous way we are told from sufficient testimony he did in favor of his moral world especially as that was the only one consistent with the liberty of rational creatures that could possibly reclaim it and the doing of it by such means every way worthy of the divine goodness and wisdom  it is plain then notwithstanding all the dogmatical parade of the opposers of miracles that they have not hitherto produced one fair argument against their probability and possibility that can outweigh or even affect the contrary evidence we have of them from reason and testimony i shall therefore hasten to the last argument they urge against us and which though no less illogical and unphilosophical than any of the former must by no means be passed by especially as it has been ushered in by some of them with such a seeming confidence and triumph as if it carried the most irresistible demonstration see the considerer of the trial of the witnesses p    hume essay on miracles tindal collins and al  i shall content myself with giving you the substance of it which is to this amount that if god be supposed to have thus miraculously interposed his divine power in any age or to have made use of that extraordinary method to reveal his will to any people he must of course be concluded to do so in all ages and toward all nations so that according to their way of reasoning if miracles were ever necessary or expedient to answer any of the designs of the divine providence they must be ever so because whether the nature of things or the laws of nature be allowed to be changeable or not yet god being unchangeable in his nature must still pursue the same methods whether we allow the state of the moral world to require it or no that is in other words if god ever wrought any miracles when the state of mankind made them expedient or necessary he cannot but continue so working of them when they cease to be so this inference wild as it is they draw not only from his immutability which has been already proved to be out of the present case but back it by another argument no less assuming and inconclusive viz that he cannot cease to do so without being chargeable with partiality toward one age or nation above another i shall forbear reflecting on the boldness of such a charge as well as on the presumption of these writers who dare thus freely to cavil at the counsels of infinite wisdom which extending to all ages cannot but be above all possible comprehension let it suffice to observe here that as god will ever act with the same unalterable wisdom goodness and justice toward his creatures so he will always display the same miraculous interposition whenever the state and circumstances of the moral world make it expedient or requisite but at no other time does it follow that he must or can do so because according to their own confession he can do nothing in vain that he condescended to act in this miraculous manner upon some particular occasions at some particular times when nothing less than such an extraordinary interposition could reduce mankind from those enormities into which it was plunged both with regard to their religion and morals as both were then established and upheld by the civil and priestly power and under the pretense of the divine sanction we have such sufficient evidence as they have not been able hitherto to overthrow but after he had by a long series of wonders made so ample a manifestation of his will nature attributes given them the most sensible proofs both of his overruling power and of his high displeasure at their abominable superstitious idolatries inhuman rites by the severest punishment of those whom the milder displays of his arm could not soften into an acknowlegement of his almighty power and sovereignty as in the instance of the egyptians and canaanites of which see the next essay lastly after he had caused those wonders to be recorded in such indelible characters both under the mosaic and much more so under the christian dispensation where could there be any occasion for renewing and repeating them in every age and nation when the memory of them if duly preserved was of itself sufficient to answer all the ends for which they had been wrought now that they have been so preserved in the sacred records of the old and new testament the frequent and vain efforts and illusory shifts the opposers have hitherto used to discredit those sacred books in which they are recorded would of themselves afford us a sufficient proof had we no other evidence of their divine authority or were those facts which they relate destitute of that cloud of testimonies which we have of them from all antiquity and from foes as well as friends of the jewish and christian revelation but i have already said enough on this head and may have occasion to resume and back it with some fresh proofs in some of the following essays but before i take my leave of them and the subject of miracles i cannot pass by a new illusory argument or rather an old one in a new dress they have started to invalidate this pressing testimony we urge against them especially because it may though a poor one chance to impose on such of their readers as are either biased in their favor or too indolent to look beyond the surface of it one of the last writers gives it to us in words to this purpose most religions whether ancient or modern and how different soever from one another were at first established on the like pretended evidence of miracles which if of any weight would argue them to be all alike true and to stand alike on a solid foundation which yet must appear to be absolutely impossible to every one who considers their vast contrariety to make this assertion appear more plausible we are reminded of an apollonius tyaneus at rome a simon magus at samaria an alexander in paphlagonia a titus at alexandria and many others who are recorded to have wrought much the same miracles which are urged in confirmation of the christian revelation next to these are brought in sundry legends both new and old of popish miracles to which the essaywriter lately quoted has added a catalogue of others published some time since at paris and affirmed to have been wrought at the tomb of a jansenist saint all which if we will take his word sor it are as fully attested and as universally believed as those recorded in the gospel hume essay on miracles p     and seq  in consequence of which he makes no scruple to put them all on the same level and to pronounce them mere delusions and impositions upon mankind a modest inference this and of a piece with the premises but of which i shall take no farther notice than to observe from the whole what impartial regard these great pretenders to reasoning pay to that vast number and variety of irrefragable arguments which have been urged by much abler pens in confutation of so odious and unjust a parallel and to show beyond all contradiction the vast and almost infinite disparity there is between the miracles recorded in our sacred books and those which are opposed to them either with respect to their nature or evidence instead therefore of treading the same irksome road of proveing afresh what has been so fully and clearly demonstrated by so many learned and judicious men vid grot de verit labadie limborch bentley clark bullock middleton lesleys short method with the deists and al sup citat  i think we may fairly challenge them to prove that pretended parity by some stronger arguments than those that have been hitherto used to confute it before they venture to urge it again on their own bare word and against such evidence to the contrary as for those of more modern date which the same author has mustered up in his essay on this subject they have been so fully and judiciously exploded by one of your reverend brethren adamss essay against hume p    and seq  that you will easily excuse my taking no farther notice of them here upon the whole i shall readily submit to the judgment of every can did reader who has the juster claim to impartial reasoning they who from this general though false pretense to miracles conclude that some real ones must have been wrought to give rise to it or those who from the uncertainty and absurdity of some pronounce all the rest how reasonable or well soever attested to be equally false  by this time i hope i have sufficiently answered all the objections which have been hitherto raised against the reality and evidence of miracles and by that means cleared in some measure the way to the subsequent essays in which i am to remove the difficulties which your neighboring antagonists urge against those which were wrought in egypt and in the land of canaan and if the subject i have been upon has been so far exhausted by much better hands that it was scarcely possible for me to add any new thing to it i hope you will find the subsequent ones treated in a more untrite though no less clear and satisfactory way than they have hitherto been and if i have taken the liberty to suspend the taking notice of those which they have raised against those two celebrated transactions the miraculous passage of the israelites through the red sea and the supernatural solstice obtained by joshuas prayer in favor of the gibeonites his new allies and proselytes it is for no other reason but because they are so fully and in my opinion so satisfactorily cleared up in that book which i had once the pleasure to recommend to your perusal universal history folio edit vol i chap   sect     octavo edit vol iii page   0 and seq  0      and which has since met with such approbation that i am highly pleased to hear by the public proposals and advertisements given about it is now ready for a third edition for if what i have hitherto said on the subject of miracles be thought sufficient by your skeptic neighbors to answer all the objections that have been urged against their reality and evidence as well as against the character and authority of the inspired historians as i can hardly question but it will if they are the judicious and candid opponents you represent them to be you may safely refer them to that book for a full satisfaction to all that they or any other objectors have said or written against them though if there should still be any doubt or difficulty left which they think not sufficiently cleared up or if they should chance to start up any new ones against either of those two extraordinary events i shall not be wanting in my readiness and endeavors according to my small ability to remove them as soon as you shall be pleased to apprise me of them  if the following essays have the good fortune to answer the end proposed with your skeptic friends i shall readily embrace any opportunity you shall afford me of pursuing hereafter the same laudable tract especially as they pretend to you that these you have sent me in this first packet are but a small sketch in comparison of what they can muster up against the authority of our sacred books but on the other hand if you should find our endeavors as far as they have gone to come short of our expectation i beg you will apprise me of it by a line seeing you and i can spend our time to a much better purpose than in vainly trying to wash a blackmoor white i rest dear sir  your ever affectionate and obliged etc  letter ii on the lords judgments threatened and executed upon the gods of egypt exodus xii    ad fin  reverend sir the text you may remember runs thus for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt will i execute judgments i am the lord but what is meant by the gods of egypt and in what manner this judgment was executed upon them by god is what has hitherto been variously and i may add unsatisfactorily accounted for by all the expositors i have hitherto met with some of them interpreting the words elohe mizraim the gods of egypt of the princes or rulers of that nation which are sometimes in the scriptures styled gods psalm lxxxii   and who following their king in his pursuit of the israelites perished with him and his host in the red sea others understanding the word elohim to mean no more than the idols which they carried about with them in their armies on all such emergencies and which were all swallowed up by the waves on that remarkable night in this sense the ancient jews and particularly the author of the book of wisdom understood it and the latter subjoins the following remark upon the extraordinary completion of that threatened judgment that the idol which is made with hands is cursed as well as he that made it being both alike hateful to god and both deserving to be punished by him therefore adds he upon the idols of the gentiles shall there be a visitation because the creature of god is made thereby to become an abomination and a stumblingblock to the souls of men a snare to the feet of the unwise the occasion of spiritual fornication and of the corruption of mens lives wisd xiv      but whoever seriously weighs the importance dignity and design of this whole miraculous transaction will hardly allow either of those interpretations to be answerable to or worthy of such a solemn and dreadful denunciation first not answerable to it because this judgment was to be executed not at the fatal destruction of the egyptians at the red sea but on the same night in which all the firstborn of the nation were to be miraculously cut off secondly not worthy of it because from the very tenor of it it plainly appears to be levelled against something greater than princes or magistrates who were to be alike sufferers with the rest of the people in the loss of their firstborn from pharaoh their haughty monarch down to the lowest slave in his dominions and much less can it be supposed to have been levelled against their dumb and senseless idols the words therefore which we translate i will execute judgment or rather judgments as the text has it must mean something of an higher nature than the bare drowning of their rulers or idols in the red sea and the words any jehovah which conclude the verse and which we translate i am the lord but may be more properly rendered i even i jehovah or the supreme being will perform it plainly show that nothing less here is threatened than the whole colluvies of false egyptian deities as they stand justly opposed to the true and only god whom pharaoh had hitherto refused to acknowledge notwithstanding the variety of miracles which moses had already wrought in his name and such as the very magicians had been forced to own were wrought by the only finger of the supreme being  but to make this and what i am farther to say in order to display the genuine sense of the text in question still plainer it will be necessary to take the matter a little higher and make some previous remarks on the nature and design of this divine and miraculous dispensation from the account which the inspired hebrew lawgiver has given us of it and from which it will plainly appear that tho the deliverance of the israelites from their present dreadful thraldom seems to be the main point in view yet god had still a much higher and nobler design in it namely to convince not only the egyptians now more immediately concerned in it but by that means all other nations far and near of these three important truths viz i that the lord jehovah whom the hebrews worshipped was the supreme being the creator and sole governor and disposer of all things   that all the other pretended deities which either the egyptians or any other heathen nations worshipped as mediators and benefactors whether the celestial bodies angels demons etc were either fictions of their own brain or at best beings created by him and entirely subordinate to his supreme power and disposal and   that the hebrews now groaning under their severe servitude were the peculiar people of that one only supreme and almighty being in consequence of which he sent pharaoh this special message and absolute command to let them go and serve him under the dreadful penalty in case of refusal of being made to feel the most severe effects of his anger and resentment this last is plainly implied in those words of god to moses exodus iv       vid and cap vii    ix    and seq x   and seq x pass  thus shall thnu say unto pharaoh thus says the lord or jebovah the supreme and only god israel is my son firstborn and i say unto thee let israel go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn  with respect to the first of these three grand points viz that jehovah the god of the hebrews was the supreme creator and governor of all things it is a thing which considering the then reigning theology of the egyptians and the miserable figure which the hebrews then made in the world could hardly come into the head of pharaoh or of any of his people some of them had indeed a right notion of a supreme being whom they called cneph or eneph and believed him to be the creator or as they styled him the architect of the world and the only immortal god plutarch in isid and osirid vid and cumberland in cosmog sanchionat p    and seq  but beside that it was peculiar to the priests of thebais or upper egypt this cneph or eneph they represented in an human shape holding a scepter and a girdle with a royal plume on his head and an egg coming out of his mouth the latter of which some interpret to have signified the world others the god phtha or vulcan eusebius praep evang lib iii c    and the worshipers of that supreme deity are affirmed to have been particularly distinguished from the rest by an exemption from the tax that was levied toward the maintenance of those animals which were worshipped by the idolatrous part plutarch de isid and osirid vide lumbert in cosmog sanchoniat p    and seq   whilst those of the lower egypt were sunk into the grossest idolatry vid ibid eusebius praepar lib i c   jamblic ap cudworth intel syst p     and seq  had that doctrine been ever so universally held it is scarcely to be supposed that pharaoh or any of his sages should be so easily persuaded that such a set of poor and enslaved strangers could be the peculiar and favorite people of that supreme deity the thing will still appear more unlikely if we suppose with some learned men that the egyptian monarch to whom moses was sent and whom he styles a new king or a king of a new family who knew not joseph exodus i    was of the race of those hycsos or shepherds which overran and enslaved the whole land of egypt and that these were the horims or horites whom the edomites or children of esau had driven out of the country deuteronomy ii        and forced to seek new settlements else where much about this time which those authors think the most probable conjecture concerning those shepherds for they were a people that lived by pasturage and being seated eastward of egypt had but a short and strait passage thither who those hycsos or as these two words imply kingshepherds were is indeed hard to guess manetho brought them from arabia ap joseph cont apion  and africanus from phoenice sync p    canon chron  and from the eastern parts  by which might as well be meant the land of canaan those two countries being often confounded and his assertion is not a little confirmed by their fortifying all the eastern borders after their settling in egypt to prevent their being followed thither by those who had driven them out of their ancient territories as to the time of this invasion s marsham places it     years before the exodus and sir isaac newton soon after the time of joshua entering into canaan newtons chronology  but it is more likely that they had already been driven out of egypt by amosis king of thebais or upper egypt some time before josephs being sold thither and that thence proceeded the aversion which the egyptians bore to all shepherds genesis xliii    xlvi     it is true there is another reason given for that aversion but such as carries but little weight viz because the shepherds slew and lived upon the flesh of those sheep oxen etc which the egyptians worshipped but this could easily have been prevented by making some severe law against it and then in all other respects the shepherds life would have been an honorable one they being the guardians and protectors of those sacred animals and accordingly we are told that the goatherds of the province of mendez were highly respected where that creature was held in particular veneration herod lib ii c     it is more likely therefore that their aversion to shepherds was owing to that slavery which they underwent under them during the space of almost   0 years and that they were canaanites who fled from those wars which every petty kingdom waged from the earliest of time against each other of which see genesis xiv pass    for these being still more degenerated in their religion had in all likelihood lost all notion of one supreme being so that when moses addressed their monarch with this strange message thus says jehovah or the one supreme deity he might be well surprised at it and answer that he knew of no such supreme deity and therefore in a kind of defiance to it not only refused to let the israelites go but made them feel a more severe servitude than they had done till then but we need not have recourse to the horites as some learned men have done vid shuckfords connect vol ii lib    for a king or people capable of returning so arrogant an answer to the divine message seeing any of the monarchs of lower egypt and we may add of any other heathen nation would upon the like occasion have behaved in the very same manner especially as it was backed with no better authority than that of the messengers bare word however whether that pharaoh was of egyptian or any other race and whether the meaning of his answer was that he did not know or acknowledge such a supreme deity or that he did not believe this pretended god of the hebrews to be him it plainly appears by the whole tenor of mosess commission and miracles that gods design was to convince him and his people of both those important truths by such infallible signs as should at once extort from him a free confession of them and an infallible compliance with the divine command  the second point which the egyptians were to be made sensible of by this divine message and which is but a natural consequence of the first was that all the other pretended deities both of the egyptians and other heathen nations whether angels demons and the like or the stars and planets etc were either mere illusions and fictions of mens brains or at best but beings created by jehovah the supreme creator and governor of the universe and wholly subordinate to his overruling power and unerring providence but this doctrine reasonable and just as it was in itself could not but meet with the most strenuous opposition not only from the heathen priests but from the laity too considering that polytheism had then overrun the greatest part of the world and that lower egypt was at that time so overstocked with those imaginary deities and so stupidly fond of that superstitious sort of worship that they had altogether forgot that of the supreme being if not the very notion of him insomuch that we are told herodot lib ii eusebius demonstr evang joseph etc no country abounded with idols of all kinds like it in all the world and i may add that it was chiefly from thence that assyria babylon phoenice greece and other nations received their chief deities belus whatever was his original name was an egyptian and is recorded to have led a colony to babylon and built the chief temple there for which they honored him with the name of belus which was that of their founder

more instances might be brought of their great personages who abandoned egypt either to avoid the tyranny of their new invaders the kingshepherds abovementioned or upon some other motive and dispersing themselves into various countries brought thither with them the egyptian theology and introduced the worship of the egyptian deities wherever they settled but these few will suffice to show at once where this notion of polytheism had its origin and what ready and universal reception it met with everywhere and this raised the reputation of the egyptian priests and sages to such an height that those of other nations not content with what had been brought to them from hence by others were eager to travel thither in order to be still more deeply instructed in their mysteries rites and other branches of learning for which they were no less famous i may add that their being so justly extolled for their superior skill in all other sciences proved a most effectual means of recommending their religion to them also for who could imagine otherwise but that the theology and worship of so learned and polite a people must be answerable to their other learning and this notion was accordingly so universally received that whatever the learned of other nations met with in it that seemed to shock their reason they readily chose to suppose some deep mystery to be wrapped up in it rather than to think that any thing either absurd or unreasonable could possibly be contained in the religion of so wise a people not considering as st paul rightly observes romans i    and seq  that it was this boasted wisdom that made them become vain in their imaginations so that pretending themselves to be wiser than all the rest of mankind they became foolish and monstrous in their notions of the deity above all other nations introducing instead of one only supreme almighty and allwise being an infinite number and variety of inferior deities and sinking into such a degree of folly and depravity as to worship not only all the celestial bodies angels demons heroes etc but even beasts fowls reptiles and plants whilst on the other hand they suffered their pride to swell to such a monstrous height as to challenge an extravagant antiquity above all other nations and to pretend to have been governed by a long series of gods and demigods above   000 years before menes their first monarch of human race these were the boasted sages whom moses was now not only to enter the lists with for their monarchs seldom if ever did or resolved any thing of moment without previously consulting them but was to convince by irrefragable proofs that all the boasted variety of deities which they worshipped were mere delusions of their own brain an imposition upon mankind or at the most that they were only beings created by and wholly subordinate to the great and only god jehovah in whose name and by whose express orders he was sent to demand the immediate release of the oppressed israelites no wonder then that moses should express such an extraordinary reluctance against and devise so many idle pretenses to excuse himself from undertaking so arduous and dangerous a commission even after all the singular encouragement which god was pleased to give him at that first miraculous conference exodus iii iv  and the infallible promise of his supernatural assistance  but thirdly moses was to convince pharaoh and his sages that this supreme being this sole and almighty lord of the universe was in a more peculiar manner the god of the poor oppressed hebrews and that though now groaning under so severe a thraldom they had been a long time his chosen people his firstborn above all other nations under heaven and in whose behalf he was now ready to display his irresistible power and inflict on that haughty monarch and his people the most dreadful judgments in case they were not immediately dismissed out of the land ibid vii and seq pass  strange message this to the egyptian king and court take it all together that there should be but one supreme jehovah in the whole universe that he should make choice of the most despicable people upon earth to be his favorite nation above all others and that he should so far interest himself in their deliverance as to smite the whole land with such terrible punishments as none of that infinite variety of deities which were worshipped there should be able to avert well might pharaoh tell the messenger that he knew of no such an overruling power as he spoke to him of which was a thing he never heard of and point blank opposite to the then egyptian theology for if any of the wiser sort of his priests or magicians had any notion left of a supreme being as many of the philosophers of other nations had yet the belief of his having transferred the care of all sublunary things to the stars planets and other inferior deities prevailed so far everywhere that it had quite obliterated that of his overruling providence how could they therefore be persuaded to think that he should concern himself so far in the release of a despicable set of strangers that seemed born to perpetual slavery the most therefore that they could gather from mosess dreadful threats was that he designed to surprise them with some strange feats but such as the magicians told pharaoh he needed not be frightened at seeing they themselves professed the same art and would quickly convince him that they were as dextrous at it as he exodus vii    vid philo in vit mos  and if we may believe josephus antiq l ii c     and the thalmud tract sanhedr  egypt abounded with such at that time to that degree that some of them flouted moses with this saying with regard to the two or three first miracles thou bring straw to afra or as we may english it thou bring coals to newcastle in pretending to play thy conjuring tricks here but by what art or power these wrought theirs whether by mere legerdemain or some strange delusion caused on the sight of the beholders or by the help of demons or by some occult natural operation as some ancient fathers and a much greater number of learned moderns have imagined just mart quaest orthod    tertul de anima greg nyssen hieron cont jovin etc vid and joseph lib ii c    grot le clerc and al  or by some deeper insight into natural magic or lastly by witchcraft and the help of the devil as st austin and many other ancient and modern contend for will be more clearly seen in the sequel all that need be said here is that moses in the relation he has given us of this extraordinary contest makes no difference between his own miracles and those of the magicians which he would certainly have done had theirs been no more than a deceptio visus accordingly he tells us in one place that they flung down their rods as he had done and that they became serpents exodus vii     and not that they only appeared such and in the two following trials of the waters turned into blood and of the frogs he expressly says that the magicians even they did the same likewise by their enchantments so that there can be no room left to doubt of the reality of the one more than of the other  but to return to the true and real intent of the divine providence in this wonderful contest between its commissioned messenger and the egyptian king and his magicians we have already seen how egypt was at this time not only immerged in the strangest and most monstrous polytheism but had likewise infected most other nations far and near with it and i might have added that a great number of inhuman and unnatural rites had also been gradually introduced into the worship of those false deities which were destructive of common society and a scandal to human nature itself it has indeed been questioned whether the worship of the egyptians canaanites etc had any such abominable rites at least so early as mosess time if at all and i must own it is not easy to fix the time when they were first introduced among them as for human sacrifices it cannot be proved that any were offered by them before abrahams time whatever any ancient or moderns may say to the contrary vide phil de vit abraham sir j marshams can chron shaftesburys charact vol iii p    but that they became common soon after is not to be doubted and it is not improbable that the intended sacrifice of that patriarch who was in very high esteem among all those nations might give rise to them and that that of chronus mentioned by sanchoniatho ap eusebius praep evang  was an imitation of it if not the same under different names and with additional circumstances vide shuckfords connect vol ii lib    and that the egyptians used them in their worship of osiris juno and lucina we have no reason to doubt diod sicul lib i manetho ap porphyr plut in osir  for amosis was the first of their monarchs who abolished them and ordered waxen images to be offered in their stead iid ibid vide eusebius ubi sup lib iv c    wisdom xii   and seq  it is likewise disputed whether the frequent expression used in the old testament of making their children to pass through the fire to moloch and other deities implies a real burning of them alive or only the bare carrying them through the flames by way of purification the jews do indeed insist on the latter by way of excusing their imitation of that rite vide int al maimon more nevoch l iii c     but if we had no other authority for the other sense that which the sacred historian relates of its practice at tophet   kings xxiii  0   chronicles xxviii    as well as the psalmist ps cvi        would be sufficient to explode that jewish evasion besides if there had been no more in it than they pretend god would hardly have forbid it in such strong terms and under such severe penalties vide levit xx         all which now loudly called for his interposing hand and the accomplishment of that solemn promise which he had made to abraham some centuries before genesis xv    and seq  and what country could be a more proper scene for this wonderful display of his almighty power than that which had been both the mother and nurse of such a strange variety of false deities the inventress of such a superstitious and abominable worship but neither were these fearful judgments to be confined to egypt only for those nations that had been infected with it and more especially all the nations of canaan were afterward to feel the effect of them in order to make both the one and the other sensible of the wretched folly and stupidity of putting their confidence in such false and imaginary deities as neither could hurt nor benefit them instead of acknowleging and relying on the unerring providence of the allwise and almighty creator and governor of the universe  but in order to work so unexpected and universal a conviction in so many different nations so long enured and hardened in their idolatrous superstition what method could be more effectual and worthy of an allwise gracious god than that which he was pleased to make use of condescending to enter into a kind of competition with the vast multitude of their pretended deities and by this surprising display of his uncontrollable power over the seven planets as well as four elements over which they were supposed to preside in such a great and dreadful variety of instances to convince their stupid votaries of the nonentity of the greatest part of them such as their pretended gods of the air sea water and earth their demons mediators demigods etc and that those whom they placed in the highest rank such as the luminaries and other celestial bodies were no other than necessary agents wholly subordinate to his supreme power and direction or according to his own energic words so frequently repeated through this whole transaction that they might know that he alone was jehovah or the only sovereign governor and moderator of the universe this was indeed a most effectual method of bringing that momentous contest to a fair and easy trial and so suited to the meanest capacity exodus vii   and alib pass  as well as to the most refined genius that neither of them could be at a loss how to make a true judgment upon it it was using men as rational creatures and directing them without the least infringement or invasion on their native freedom to judge where to assign the palm of victory it was in a word appealing to their senses experience and rational faculties by such infallible tokens as the lowest mechanic could as easily judge for himself as the most sublime reasoner or profound philosopher either of them might be held in suspense for a while not only whilst pharaohs magicians imitated some of mosess miracles but even after they had been nonplused by him and forced to acknowledge the supreme power of god as their confession might be as well suspected to have been a mere cloak to cover their ignorance or incapacity and though moses had all the way even from the beginning the much greater advantage over them especially when they appeared with their swarms of lice ibid viii    and seq about them or hid themselves to conceal their boils and blotches ibid ix     yet still the people might only infer from it that moses was only a greater conjurer than they or at most that the god of the hebrews had hitherto showed himself more powerful than those of the egyptians but this they might still ascribe to any other cause unknown to them rather than to suppose the former the only supreme god and the latter no gods at all for thus stupidly do we find the syrians reasoning after having received a total overthrow from the israelites that their gods were gods of the mountains and that there could no head be made against them unless they could be brought down into the valleys   kings xx     and be obliged to fight on plain ground any pretense would easily account for this disparity of power among people who believed a plurality of gods and did not acknowledge a supreme one over all the rest the philistines could see their dagon fallen in pieces before the ark and themselves plagued with emrods etc without abating one tittle of their regard for their dismembered idol   samuel v   and seq  that could neither defend itself nor heal them where then is the wonder that pharaoh and his court should continue obstinate and rebellious in spite of all the grievous plagues he and his people had felt from the turning the waters into blood to the three days total and most dreadful darkness which overspread the whole land i do not hereby pretend to excuse much less to justify this their obstinacy and hardness of conviction against such dire and awakening judgments all i would observe here is what a stubborn and almost invincible obstacle their notion of polytheism and other prejudices which they had imbibed with their religion especially when backed with selfinterest and unwillingness of dismissing so many hundred thousands of useful slaves was to their passing a more equitable and impartial judgment on mosess miracles  it is indeed said in many places that god would and that he had hardened that monarchs heart against conviction exodus iv    and alib pass  and in one place that he had raised him up for that very end that he might show his power and declare his name over all the earth ibid ix    romans ix     but it will here scarcely be needful to remind your opponent that the former of those expressions according to the genius of the hebrew tongue implies at most but a bare permission and the latter that god had suffered him to reign so far though he might long before have cut him off for his obstinacy and disobedience that he might convince him and all the world of his being the only supreme governor of it and in this sense both those expressions are understood and interpreted by the best expositors to which i shall refer see among the rest pelling whitby limborch le clerc shuckford and un hist   vo edit vol iii p     d those who are not sufficiently versed in the text that moses meant no more by them than to express pharaohs invincible obstinacy is plain not only from many such parallel phrases where the mountains cedars etc of god mean no more than their vast height strength and the like vid int al ps xxxvi   lxviii    civ     but likewise by the singular pains he took to make that monarch comply with gods commands which he could hardly have done had he thought that his refusal had been the effect of gods irrevocable doom to destroy him and his people it is very remarkable that as to the words for this very cause have i raised thee up etc the exposition i have given above of it is confirmed by the septuagint version and the chaldee paraphrase the former of whom renders it for this end thou have been hitherto preserved and the latter for this cause i have hitherto borne with thee or held thee up either of which much more naturally expresses the meaning of the hebrew  heghemadtika i have suffered or caused to stand vid munster tremel lyran and al in loc and un hist octavo vol iii p     sub not   but i cannot forbear taking notice here that the hebrew verb  chazak which we translate harden does in its primitive and genuine sense signify to strengthen encourage confirm and the like which is either done by exhortations promises assistances etc or else as in pharaohs case by forbearance sparing or suspending of due punishment as fond parents often do by their stubborn children which last sense seems clearly implied in that expostulation of god as yet or hitherto exaltest thou thyself or art as yet too elated to let my people go exodus ix     and that of moses to him glory thyself over me when i entreat the lord tomorrow ibid viii    and in another place i will spread my hands to the lord that the thunder and hail may cease and that thou may be convinced that the earth is the lords but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not fear the lord god exodus ix     0  or as the words  more emphatically express i know that before ye fear the lord god implying thereby that they must yet feel some heavier judgment before they could be brought to a true sense and fear of that overruling power and indeed pharaohs frequent prevarication with him and owning himself no longer in a state of obedience than whilst the rod was stretched over him and returning to his old obstinacy as soon as it was removed had given but too much room for that threatening reproof which was accordingly followed by a still more grievous plague than any they had hitherto felt namely the total darkness that overspread his whole realm during three whole days the dread and grievousness of which moses could not more emphatically express than by calling it a darkness that might be felt and which did not suffer the egyptians to stir from their places all the time it lasted exodus x    and seq  for if any of the foregoing ones especially as they fell only on the egyptians whilst the israelites were wholly free from them had already so far shaken their confidence in their vain deities and extorted a confession from that proud monarch that the lord jehovah alone was righteous and he and his people sinners a much more powerful effect must this surprising darkness make upon them who till now had looked upon the sun as the chief deity of egypt and saw the whole land deprived of his benign light whilst the israelites in the land of goshen were the only ones that enjoyed their usual sunshine ibid v     how can they now any longer doubt that this great luminary whom they worshipped as the greatest of all their deities is really as moses assured them subordinate to the god of the hebrews when they see its most zealous votaries deprived so long of its cherishing beams whilst it is obliged to shine with its usual luster on those who absolutely disowned its pretended divine power and such a consternation did this last judgment throw the whole nation into and more especially its haughty monarch and whole court that moses was sent for with all speed and told that they were now at full liberty to depart with their wives and their children provided they consented to leave their numerous herds behind this he doubtless thought a great concession and such as would have contented him but when he was positively answered that not an hoof of these should be left in egypt his consternation quickly changed into a furious rage in the first part of which he so far forgets himself and whom he is speaking to that he orders him immediately to go from his presence and never to come to him upon such an errand under pain of death exodus x     as if he could still at his pleasure take the life of a man who had by so many ways made him sensible to his cost of his own impotence either to hurt him or to ward off the effects of any of his threatenings the result of this last interview was that moses took him at his word so that they parted in great anger at each other a learned author finds fault here with our english and most other versions for making moses to depart from pharaoh in anger and thinks that the text rather implies that it was that monarch that was angry with him exodus xi    and that the place should be rendered he moses went out from pharaoh who was in a furious anger shuckford connect tom ii l    but besides that the hebrew construction will not admit of that sense and that in fact they were most likely in a great passion against each other i see nothing inconsistent with mosess character had he been the only angry person for as his singular meekness must restrain him from showing it in an indecent manner to the king so neither could his zeal for the honor of god nor that monarchs tyrannic behavior permit him to receive his obstinate and threatening refusal without some considerable emotion especially as that prince acted more like an hardened tyrant on this occasion than a father of his people and appeared resolved to sacrifice the lives of so vast a number of his subjects rather than suffer the israelites to take their herds with them  though not without moses previously apprising him of the concluding and most dreadful judgment of all the destruction of all the egyptian firstborn which his obstinate refusal was now hastening upon him and his whole kingdom that moses acquainted the king with the universal slaughter of the firstborn in this last interview is agreed on by most interpreters though he has related them somewhat out of their natural order in this eleventh chapter after having mentioned his last parting from pharaoh at the conclusion of the preceding so that the direction given to the people at the beginning of it about asking jewels and other valuable things of the egyptians is but a short recapitulation of what he had injoined them in some of the foregoing ones  the same must be likewise understood of the contents of the twelfth chapter in which the passover is instituted and the manner of celebrating it set forth for this is but a recapitulation of what god had injoined them to do four days before that is on the tenth day whereas this last message and the sad catastrophe that ensued it happened on the fourteenth day of the month exodus xii   compared with verses    and seq  as for those who pretend to censure the orders given the israelites about getting jewels and other valuable things from the egyptians exodus xi   xii     it will be sufficient to tell them that the verb  shaal which moses makes use of signifies to ask or beg and not to borrow as our version renders it josephus therefore rightly styles them gifts or presents antiq l ii c    ad fin  and it can hardly be supposed that they obtained more of them than they had dearly earned by their long and laborious servitude    and which he assured him would be executed in such an astonishing manner not only upon every rank and condition from the highest to the lowest of his subjects but even upon all their cattle that the survivors would come crouching to the hebrews and in the most submissive and endearing manner entreat them to be gone exodus xi     this was indeed the dreadfullest message that he had hitherto brought to that infatuated king yet was it such as his obstinacy against so many others that had gone before and been so punctually executed might justly deserve and the most likely to force him into a compliance and as such was reserved by god as the finishing stroke to all the rest for this was plainly hinted to moses from the beginning go and tell pharaoh israel is my son my firstborn and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn ibid iv    and seq  which was as much as to say as appears by the sequel if none of the previous wonders i design to work in thy sight nor the fearful punishments i shall inflict upon thee and thy kingdom can prevail upon thee to discharge this my favorite people the destruction of all the firstborn in thy dominions from man to beast with which i intend to conclude all my plagues upon you shall effectually compel thee to comply and it is very remarkable here that the threatened judgments on the gods of egypt which never were once mentioned before are now joined together with the death of the firstborn as if the last was to be no other than the effectual completion of the former for says god exodus xii    i will pass this night through the land of egypt and destroy all the firstborn in it both of man and beast and against the gods of egypt will i execute judgments i am the lord so that the import of this last and most dreadful message is plainly this since all the wonders i have hitherto wrought before your eyes have not been able to make you acknowledge me the true and only god nor all the severe punishments i have already inflicted upon you which none of the imaginary gods you fondly confide in were able to avert have been powerful enough to extort an obedience to my commands this last which i have kept in reserve as the finishing stroke viz the destruction of all the firstborn shall in spite of your obstinacy oblige you to confess and acknowledge my supreme power and authority over the universe as well as your own folly and blindness in trusting on any other god but me  it must be owned that the expression here used  eghesse shephatim which we translate i will execute judgments is somewhat vague and obscure but there is none that is ever so little versed in the hebrew language that does not know that it generally imports to do or execute justice to try and judge a cause to pass sentence of absolution or condemnation to right the injured and punish the injurer etc according to the nature of the subject in question vid int al number xxvii    in this sense we find much the same expression used in the last chapter of the second book of kings verse   where it is said that nebuchadnezzar and his officers dabru ito mishpat or as jeremiah has it cap ult ver   mishphatim which our version rightly renders gave judgment upon zedekiah at ribla that is as the sequel shows pronounced sentence of death upon him the true meaning therefore of doing justice or executing judgment on the false deities of egypt can be no other than the bringing the point in dispute whether the egyptian deities had all or any of that power which their votaries ascribed to them or whether the lord jehovah was the only supreme governor of the world to so fair and impartial a trial that not only pharaoh and his subjects but all other nations that came to hear of it might be enabled to judge of the issue of it or pass an equitable sentence on the merit of either side from the result of the whole and how could this be done in a more rational and satisfactory manner than by condescending to enter into this competition with them for this was such a plain and irrefragable appeal to their reason experience and senses as i lately hinted that had any of our modern skeptics who either deny miracles to be a sufficient proof of any doctrine or even deny the possibility of them been eyewitnesses of it it could hardly have failed of extorting at least a taoit recantation from them and a conscious acknowlegement that such a series of supernatural events could be effected by nothing less than by the interposition of the supreme and almighty lord and that he was indeed the only god of whom it could be said that he did whatsoever he pleased both in heaven earth the sea and all the deep abysses psalm cxxxv   and    but to make this appear still plainer to every unbiassed reader let us now take a short review of the design and management of this whole transaction  and first let it be remembered that the deliverance of the israelites from their long and hard bondage was only designed by providence to be subservient to a much nobler one that of the egyptians and other heathen nations from their strange ignorance or at best base and unworthy notions of the supreme being from their vain and unaccountable confidence in their false deities and the more detestable rites they used in their worship of them in order to reduce and allure them by degrees to the true primitive religion from which they were so scandalously degenerated it was to this end that abraham of whom god made choice to be the reviver of it was called out of his idolatrous country and kindred and that both he and his two immediate descendants isaac and jacob were made to wander through several parts of canaan and thence at last into egypt in order to sow the seeds of it wherever they came it was to confirm their faith and encourage their obedience that god was pleased so frequently to appear to them to bless and protect them in so extraordinary a manner and to allure them by still greater promises lastly it was with the same gracious view that god showed such signal favors to and heaped such extraordinary blessings upon them to the end that the people among whom they lived seeing a set of strangers who professed a religion point blank opposite to theirs and which consisted chiefly in acknowleging one only supreme being relying upon one only mediator between god and man and professing an utter abhorrence for all their false gods and their still more detestable worship of them to be such favorites of heaven above all the rest of human race might the more effectually be weaned from their vain confidence in and execrable worship of their imaginary deities and be allured by degrees to look up to that almighty and allbeneficent creator as the sole dispenser of all blessings for other than temporal ones they scarcely dreamed of and such they were of which these worshipers of the true god appeared to them to have the far larger share vid int al genesis xxiii   and seq xxvi    and seq xxxii   and seq   and seq and alib pass  this was visibly the case of the israelites not only during their frequent peregrinations through the several kingdoms of canaan but much more so in the land of egypt the scene made choice of some ages before by the divine providence for this extraordinary contest see genesis xv    and seq  and where they accordingly increased in wealth number and strength to such an astonishing degree as could not fail alarming the whole kingdom exodus i   and seq  so that to prevent their joining at any time with a foreign enemy against them they found themselves obliged to doom them to the most inhuman thraldom which brought on the till then unheard of series of wonders and fearful punishments which ended in and hastened their glorious deliverance  i have already observed that egypt was probably made choice of by god for the scene of this wonderful display of his divine power as it was the parent and nurse of all the false deities and superstitious idolatry that had been transplanted thence into a great number of other nations far and near and it might be much more so on account of the great name it then bore both for being the inventress and for exceeding all others in the art of magic divination enchanting and other such conjuring knowledge which was at that time and long after esteemed as the highest pitch of learning and human wisdom pliny lib xxx cap   the egyptians boasted that they received this so samed art from ham the third son of noah and that his second son mizraim the founder of their nation brought it thither vid un hist octavo vol i p         iii     and seq  others ascribe the invention of it to their hermes philastr brix haeres    and the improvement of it to one of their kings called nechepsos auson epist     as for the notion that the angels who became enamoured with the daughters of men taught it the antediluvian world genesis vi    it is hardly worth confuting the first author who mentions it being the fabulous author of the recognitions falsely attributed to st clement vid bochart phaleg lib iv c    what this art consisted in and how far it extended is hard to say however that it went farther than a bare knowledge of the various powers of nature as some contend for vid corn agrip clav magic sir william temples essay on the wisdom of the ancients grotius le clerc and al in exodus vii and seq  seems fully confirmed by what the magicians of pharaoh are affirmed to have performed upon this occasion exodus vii       chapter viii    as well as by the divine prohibition against the practice of the several branches of it deuteron xviii  0 and seq  that are said to have been then in use amongst the heathen nations  much less can this art have consisted in a greater skill in the nature influence and motion of the heavenly bodies for thothey believed them all as well as the elements themselves to be endued with peculiar intelligences by which these magicians pretended to perform great feats to foretell events and the like as being appointed by the supreme being to govern the world vid plutarch de defect orac cicer de divinat lib i c     yet there is hardly any person so besotted to that art now as to imagine that any such extraordinary effects could ever be produced by it and it is most likely that those magicians only made use of that pretense the better to conceal the means by which they did them viz by the intercouse and assistance of superior agents such as angels and demons in the knowledge of whose natural abilities and manner of setting them on work consisted the foundation of their art or what we style in the worst sense magic and is that which was so severely forbid by god under the old leviticus xix    xx   deuteron xviii  0 and seq  as well as under the new testament see burnet archaeol lib i p  0  and the generality of commentators both jewish and christian  for unless we will admit the possibility of such a commerce with those evil spirits at least before the times of the gospel i cannot see how we can account either for this or for several other the like instances mentioned by the inspired writers vid calmets dissert prefixed to his comm on exodus     and where pharaoh would not fail of trying the utmost that could be done by it to invalidate the miracles of moses so that if his magicians who were commonly the priests and sacred scribes could not stand this competition but were so visibly defeated in every instance of it there could be no room for supposing that those of any other nation could have been more successful in it st paul mentions only two magicians who withstood moses viz jannes and jambres   timothy iii    these two were perhaps the two chiefs of that sect and are celebrated as such by the talmud under the names of juchani and mamri and by pliny as the founders of the magic sect in conjunction with moses lib xxx c    the chaldee paraphrast adds that they were the sons of the famous balaam and that they were sent for by pharaoh to oppose their miracles to those of moses and that they perished with the rest of the egyptians in the red sea targum jonath in loc  but without laying too much stress upon those authors we may well assure ourselves that the egyptian monarch would spare neither pains nor cost to procure the most celebrated masters of the art upon so singular an emergency nor neglect any other precaution to prevent being imposed upon by the two hebrew chiefs neither can it be supposed that the divine providence which directed the whole to so wise and gracious an end would suffer any thing to be wanting that could leave any room to doubt of his being that only true and almighty god whom pharaoh refused to acknowledge and that he was too righteous to punish him for his disobedience before he had given full conviction of his supreme authority over the whole creation  accordingly the contest proceeds gradually on between moses and the magicians and in such a manner that the former has visibly the advantage over the latter both turn their rods into serpents at the first trial and that of aaron swallows up all the rest and this perhaps is not without its particular meaning that as the serpent was ever looked upon as the emblem of wisdom and cunning genesis iii   isai xxvii   matthew x     so that of the magicians would be forced to yield to that of moses exodus vii     in the next trial the waters of the nile from which the land of egypt received its fecundity are turned into blood that river supplied the defect of rain to them and was on that account worshipped by them with great ceremony but being now smitten by a superior hand is made to disgorge that blood with which it had been stained if not by the human sacrifices offered up yearly to it the egyptians are recorded from the most ancient times to have celebrated a yearly festival with the utmost solemnity and pomp in honor of the nile especially on these years in which it swelled above its usual mark and as an acknowlegement of the great benefits they received from that river to have sacrificed a girl or according to others a boy and a girl herod l ii diod sicul i lucas voyage tom ii p     and seq thevenot voy part i cap        and that this inhuman custom may have been as early if nor earlier than the time of moses we have little reason to doubt considering what has been lately said of their religion and rites being about the same time propagated into all the other countries about it far and near and what scrupulous observers they have been of it since we may gather from this that it never was totally abolished though perhaps suspended when they were under the government of foreign princes till the conquest of their country by the turks when the first governor put an effectual end to it by ordering flowers and branches to be offered upon the altar instead of those human victims lucas thevenot ub sup  we are indeed told that amosis king of that part of egypt called diospolis who is supposed by africanus to have lived about the time of the exodus but in all likelihood somewhat earlier had caused the human sacrifices offered to juno lucina at heliopolis to be abolished diodor sicul l i maneth ap porphyr de abstinent eusebius praep evang l iv c    plutarch de isid and osir p   0  if so it is strange that he should not have forbid this also and much more so that none of the christian emperors or the saracens should abolish it while they were masters of it but it must be observed that the egyptians were very tenacious of their superstitions about the nile because on them they imagined the rising of it to its usual height chiefly depended insomuch that they would doubtless have risen in arms rather than forego them so that if it was at any time interrupted by the authority of those emperors it continued no longer so than till they found an opportunity of reviving it  this was likely to have proved the case when their turkish governor abovementioned first attempted to suppress it for that river not rising on the next year to its usual mark and the following one proving still worse the people were all ready to revolt and tear him in pieces upon which he persuaded them jews turks and christians to accompany him to a neighboring mountain and there exhorted them to strive by fervent prayers to god to obtain the blessing they wanted and on the next morning they were congratulated with the joyful news that the river had risen in that night twelve full pikes it continued doing so during the rest of the time and that year was blessed with such extraordinary plenty that whenever its waters are like to fail they have had ever since recourse to that mountain and to their prayers instead of their inhuman sacrifices lucas thevenot ub sup     at least by that of so many innocent infants who had been doomed to perish in it exodus i     could the magicians have exerted their art to any purpose it would have been shown in the turning the blood into water again but this was out of their power they could only add to the plague instead of removing it exodus vii    and seq  the same happened to them in the third trial where their skill could only help them to increase the number and stench of those vast swarms of frogs which moses had already brought over all the land and with the stink of whose carcases the air was but too much infected to want any addition  here then was one of their chief deities fairly tried and condemned in two such instances as might have convinced the senseless egyptians how easily that river in which they placed so great a confidence and which they looked upon as one of their greatest blessings could be turned into the greatest curse by the bare stroke of the miraculous rod and that nothing but the divine power could restore it to its native usefulness and fecundity exodus viii   and seq  whilst the art of the magicians here proved vain and ineffectual  the fourth trial was that of the lice a trial to all appearance as easy if not more so to be imitated than any of the former but in which however they are so unexpectedly foiled that they make no difficulty to own their impotence and disappointment to be the effect of a divine power ibid verse     hence some divines have been induced to believe that this small vermin was a new kind of creature and out of the power of any but god to produce whereas the miracle here chiefly consisted in restraining the power of those magicians from working a miracle every whit as easy as those they had done before and thereby forcing them to acknowledge that superior power or as they expressed it to the king the finger of god which was the cause of it by which both he and they might see that what they had hitherto performed was chiefly owing to his divine permission beyond which they found it impossible to go and this the magicians so readily acknowleged that we do not find that the king made any farther trial of their art or that they intermeddled any farther in the contest  however as pharaohs magicians appeared so little affected by the advantage which moses had hitherto gained over them in it that there is reason to think he did not believe them if he did not indeed suspect them to have been privately drawn in to act in concert with the two hebrew chiefs it was requisite that the succeeding plagues should be of a more pungent and awakening nature and by falling on the magicians as well as the rest of the people remove all possible suspicion of any latent juggle or confederacy accordingly the next was that of the swarm of flies which by their poisonous sting so terribly annoyed both man and beast that the air was now as much infected with them as the earth and water had been by the frogs and the river turned into blood exodus viii  0 and seq  but what was still more singular and wonderful in this new one was that those little poisonous insects were directed to make a difference between the land of egypt and the canton of goshen so that they had no more power to annoy an israelite than to spare an egyptian and this so plainly showed them to be sent by an angry god and not by chance or art that pharaoh unable to resist such an evidence consents to let israel go and sacrifice to their god if he will but vouchsafe to rid him of this plague ibid verse     though he continues still hardened as soon as it is removed and here i cannot but observe once for all that god not only made the same remarkable difference between the israelites and egyptians in the murrain of beasts in the boils and blains which affected the very magicians themselves as well as the king and people but likewise set the space of a day between the message and the plague as well as between the promise and the removing in the first it is said always tomorrow the lord will bring it to pass and in the other it is said tomorrow i will entreat the lord and he shall remove it the intent of which seems plainly to give them time to apply to those false deities in whom they put so much confidence and try whether any of them were able either to avert the threatened judgment or to remove it when inflicted for if none of them could do either of these what could be a greater demonstration that all the power that was falsely attributed to them was mere delusion and that consequently there was no other god in heaven or on earth except the lord jehovah this pharaob could not but be deeply sensible of but the thoughts of dismissing so many myriads of useful slaves made still a much stronger impression upon him and though extremely desirous to have each plague removed from him yet he would willingly purchase the blessing at the cheapest rate at first he tells them plainly they shall not go he next gives them leave to go and sacrifice so it be done within his dominions exodus viii     in the next they may go into the wilderness but not too far off exodus viii     byandby the men may go so they leave their young ones and cattle behind ibid x   and seq  at last they may all go young and old provided their numerous herds stay behind ibid verse     neither can he be prevailed upon to condescend so far to their desire till earnestly solicited to it by his servants and reminded of the deplorable condition egypt was now reduced to ibid verse   through his obstinacy and great reason they had to do so considering that all the fish was destroyed by the first plague ibid vii     the cattle and fruits by the murrain and hail ibid ix   and seq    and seq  the corn by the locusts ibid x   and seq  and the fruits and leaves by the same vermin which now covered the whole face of the desolate earth in such prodigious swarms that they darkened the very air ibid verse    and seq  no part of that unhappy kingdom having escaped the effects of those dreadful plagues but the land of goshen where the israelites dwelt ibid ix      and alib pass   by this time therefore the egyptians whom we may reasonably suppose to have applied in vain to all their fansied deities for help must be fully convinced of their impotence and their own stupidity in placeing any confidence in them as well as of the vanity of their so much boasted skill in the magic art etc all which had so egregiously failed them in this important contest neither can we well question but pharaohs confession came from his heart when he said to moses i have sinned against the lord your god and against you  entreat the lord for me that he may remove this only one deadly plague more from me and i will dismiss you exodus x    and seq  but what appears indeed almost incredible is that he should suffer his remorse to be blown away as it were by the same wind that drove the destructive locusts into the sea ibid verse    and seq  but here it must be remembered that though the confession was the effect of a full conviction yet the promise being rather extorted from him by the present smart the one was no sooner removed than the other must of course have proved abortive till roused again by a fresh and more efficacious stroke  accordingly the very next proves a more dreadful and awakening one than any of the former as it extended itself beyond the four elements even to the celestial bodies and more particularly over the two grand luminaries which were worshipped by the egyptians as the chief and most powerful of all their deities and as the immediate vicegerents of their great eneph or supreme being see before page    b  for though their course was neither stopped nor retarded as it was afterward in joshuas time joshua x    and seq  yet to be on the sudden deprived of their cheerful light to be doomed to a strange and dismal night not only six times as long as the common ones but which was made still more so by the horror that reigned everywhere must appear to them more extraordinary and dreadful than if they had stood still over their heads because it was not now a bare privation of light but a darkness that might be felt exodus x    and seq  and that in such a degree that they had neither power nor will to stir out of their places so that being left wholly to the horror of their thoughts they either imagined those luminaries together with the whole train of celestial bodies to be totally extinguished or that the whole creation was returning to its original chaos now they had leisure to reflect upon all the former punishments they had undergone and to think with awful dread how punctually the lord god of the hebrews had fulfilled all that moses had foretold to them and how ineffectual all their addresses to their numerous deities had been toward averting or removing any of his punishments they are now convinced to their cost that this lord is as moses truly said the only supreme being to whose irresistible will all things are forced to submit but dare not apply to him for mercy for fear of incensing his anger still more against them the only remedy that pharaoh and his people can think of to support them under their heavy load of dread is to endeavor to appease it both by an immediate compliance with his command and by the most earnest entreaties and generous presents to prevail upon the israelites to intercede for them and to obtain them that pardon from god which they dared not ask for themselves  this at least appears by the sequel to have been the result of pharaohs moody thoughts during the time of this long and dreadful night he had indeed more than once entreated moses and aaron to intercede with god for him vid int al exodus ix    etc x        but we do not find that he ever ventured to address himself to him for he had too often prevaricated with him to hope that his prayers could meet with acceptance and therefore chose to rely on those of two such powerful and tried advocates as moses and aaron for an effectual deliverance in this perplexity both he and his people are joyfully surprised with the return of the wished for light and moses and aaron are once more sent for to be informed that he and his whole nation both small and great are at full liberty to depart only their cattle are to stay behind as a security for their return but upon their absolute refusal to comply with this last condition for which they gave him a sufficient reason exodus x     the haughty monarch falls into an indecent fury with them orders them to be gone and under pain of death never to see his face more and moses retires from him with a promise to comply with his command ibid verses         thus far the competition had been carried on with the most evident and sensible disadvantage to the egyptians in every instance either with respect to their boasted magic art or to the pretended power of all their deities there is not now the least room left to doubt of the lord god of the israelites being the only supreme and absolute governor of all and every stroke of his irresistible arm falls heavier and heavier on that infatuated and idolatrous nation and yet pharaoh refuses to yield and will rather run the risque of a new and severer judgment than let the israelites take their cattle with them and no wonder he should still continue obstinate seeing the greatest of all his crimes remained unpunished by the righteous judge of heaven and earth namely the murder of so many innocent hebrews whom the tyrant had caused to be destroyed as soon as born and which was to be expiated now by the destruction of all the egyptian firstborn for as the dooming of those innocents to immediate death was the completion of the israelitish thraldom and misery and that which brought on their deliverance so the miraculous slaughter of the firstborn was to give the final stroke to the egyptian tyranny and hasten the total subversion of pharaoh and his host which happened soon after and the same divine providence which had so wonderfully brought them into this country and hard bondage shall now the time prescribed for it being fully come genesis xv       by this last display of his almighty power at once fulfill his neverfailing promise and by the deliverance of his chosen people from their thraldom and the just punishment of their oppressors manifest himself both to them and all the earth to be the true and only lord and governor of the universe exclusive of all other pretended deities of the heathen world which was the main scope and design of this whole miraculous transaction see before page    and seq   it is not easy to determine whether this message of the death of the firstborn was delivered to pharaoh at the lastmentioned interview which moses had with him immediately after the three days darkness or at any time after the generality of the jews and not a few christians are for the former as i have already hinted see before page    note f  others think from the order in which the inspired historian relates them exodus xi   and seq  that it was a new one with which moses was forced to comply though he had been so severely forbid to see his face it being of such a nature as must make him overlook all the threatening and overruled his own promise to that haughty monarch however that be we have no reason to doubt but it was openly delivered to him in its full extent seeing it was decreed by the divine providence that he should be warned of it and that it was to be the concluding stroke of the divine vengeance in case he proved obstinate and disobedient exodus iv     so that in this extraordinary trial between the almighty god of the hebrews and the pretended deities of egypt all the former judgments down to the three days dreadful darkness may be looked upon as so many credible witnesses for the former against whose plain evidence nothing of weight had been offered by the latter yet this last was to be the most convincing and irrefragable of all and that in the following respects viz    st because nothing less than an almighty and unerring hand could direct the destroyer whether angel or whatever other instrument was made use of on this dreadful occasion to the only firstborn of every condition and sex from the highest prince of the royal family to the meanest female slave doomed to the lowest degree of servitude and downwards to the most abject animal ibid xi   and seq xii        dly because nothing less than such a powerful and unerring hand could preserve those that belonged to the israelitish nation from sharing in the same dreadful fate so that whilst the whole land of egypt was filled with the utmost confusion and universal grief horror and dread there being no house in it that had not one dead person within it the land of goshen enjoyed the most profound peace and the avenue to each house and family was made safe and impassable to the common destroyer by the blood of the paschal lamb exodus xii        dly this destruction was an infallible proof both of the sovereign power of the god of the hebrews and of the vanity of the egyptian deities because in this and all other nations the priesthood and primogeniture were always joined together so that the firstborn of every family was always the priest of those deities which were the object of their worship that during the patriarchal economy the firstborn or heads of every family were also the priests of it is too plain to need any proof from which we may reasonably infer that this hierarchy was of divine appointment noah as such sacrificed to god for himself and the small remains that were saved with him in the ark genesis viii  0 xii   and seq xv   and seq xxv    and seq xxxiii     0 xxxv   and seq and alib pass  abraham isaac and jacob did the same in their respective families after they became their heads and so doubtless did the twelve sons of jacob after they were parted from him though it is hardly to be doubted but that he still retained a kind of supreme authority over them in this as well as in his civil capacity whilst he lived and which descended after his death to his eldest son unless he were on some account disqualified for it as reuben was who forfeited both the priesthood and primogeniture by his incestuous commerce with his fathers concubine genesis xxxv    xlix   and seq   it is therefore more reasonable to suppose that this hierarchy as the most rational convenient and primitive was continued among the other descendents of noah and that mizraim the first peopler of egypt introduced it thither than that they should leave the choice of their priests to the capricious votes of the people or to the nomination of the heads of them neither is it probable that these would easily give up such a choice prerogative which raised them to the highest rank and power next to their monarchs and entitled them to so great a share in the administration with them which prerogative herodotus tells us lib ii c     passed from the father to the eldest son that is according as a learned modern author understands it not the  as a noble author would represent it intimating thereby that all the sons of a priest were obliged to follow their fathers calling lord shastesburys characterist  but to the  or eldest son which was exactly according to the primitive divine institution see shuckford connect l vi p  0  and seq  but that notion is by far too restrained here and clashes too palpably with mosess account who tells us that there was not an house in which there was not one dead exodus xii  0  so that we must understand him to mean no less than the firstborn or head of every family who though subordinate to the higher class of the priesthood yet were entitled to perform the priestly functions within their own inferior precinct or families as i hinted at the beginning of this note    and being looked upon as more immediately related to them than the laity must be of course the more peculiar objects of their care and concern which if they had had any of that power that was attributed to them they must on this occasion have exerted to the utmost in their preservation from the threatened doom the contest here is no less than between the firstborn of jehovab the god of the hebrews and those of the egyptian deities but if after so fair and various a trial it plainly appears that the former can do all things in favor of his own and the latter prove unable to stir an hand for the preservation of theirs from such a dreadful and universal ruin what can be a more irrefragable demonstration of the omnipotence and sovereignty of the one and the impotence and vanity of the other here is no need of any depth of learning or sagacity to decide the point a common share of unbiassed reason will easily enable a man to judge in so plain a case and so did the egyptians accordingly when they cried out we be all dead men exodus xii     and well they might fear to share in the same fate for if those who were the guardians of their religion the fountain of all learning counsel power and as the psalmist styles them reshith lecol onam the chief of all their strength psalm cv     could not obtain a safeguard from any of their deities against the executioner of the divine vengeance what could they expect but to be involved in the same destruction unless they could happily prevent it by the immediate dismission of his people and by their earnest entreaties as well as by their gifts and presents to hasten their departure and obtain their prayers for them  but   thly the death of the egyptian firstborn was no less an evidence of gods supreme goodness and justice than of his omnipotence and absolute sovereignty for since egypt was now become ripe upon so many accounts for punishment and for such an exemplary one as should convince both its inhabitants and all other nations that heard of it of the overruling power of the great jehovah and of the impotence and vanity of the egyptian deities what could be a more pregnant proof of his mercy and justice than the sparing the guiltless and misguided laity and causing the effects of his anger to fall only on their miscreant guides who instead of preserving had for the most base and selfish ends not barely corrupted but in a great measure obliterated the old patriarchal religion and substituted to it the impious as well as monstrous worship of such a vast variety of false deities and with it the most unnatural and abominable rites and superstitions which as i observed before see before page    and seq  had spread themselves in most countries about them  however this last stroke has the desired effect and the egyptians find themselves everywhere under so dreadful a consternation that they are now more pressing for the israelites to be gone than ever they were willing to obtain them exodus xii    and seq  they even bride them with large presents to go away as conquerors whom they had till now detained as slaves israel now triumphs as the firstborn of the almighty jehovah whilst egypt by the sudden and direful catastrophe of its own experimentally feels by this one stroke the vanity and impotence of its own boasted gods and the irresistible power of that of the hebrews wisdom xix    and seq  and what is still more dreadful they see themselves so far exposed naked and defenseless to the effects of his resentment for their tyrannical treatment of them that they think neither gold nor silver nor jewels too great a price to recompense their former evils and hasten their departure even pharaoh till now unmoved at all the other plagues which his stubborn heart had brought upon his country is now forced to entreat them to be gone and to become intercessors for him to that supreme deity which he had hitherto refused to acknowledge confer exodus v   and xii         and now we are come to the conclusion of this grand and celebrated contest between the lord god of the hebrews and the false deities of the egyptians in which the latter having undergone a great variety of signal trials and been plainly defeated in every one this last and most remarkable of all of the death of the firstborn is brought on as the finishing blow which was reserved as the final execution of those divine judgments which his unerring word had pronounced against the egyptian gods and that in such a conspicuous manner that the most zealous votaries should be forced at once to acknowledge the justice of them and the sense they had of his almighty power by a ready compliance with his divine commands exodus vi   and seq  there remained one thing more to be done to crown this wonderful transaction and that was to have it recorded in such indelible characters that the latest posterity might have all the moral certainty of its truth and reality that the nature of it could possibly admit of and to this end it was that god ordained the grand festival of the passover or eating of the paschal lamb to be yearly celebrated and commanded moreover all the firstborn males both of man and beast to be sanctified to him and to be severally redeemed the former with the price of five shekels as soon as they were thirty days old numb xviii     and the latter by some settled equivalent exodus xii   and seq xiii   and seq xxxiv    and seq levit xxvii    and seq and alib pass  which two institutions were the most proper to perpetuate the memory of it to future ages see lesseys method with the deists  as long as the hebrew nation subsisted which it has done ever since in so astonishing a manner in spite of all their several captivities cruel persecutions and other very many disadvantages and more particularly since their last and total dispersion after the destruction of their city and temple by titus as leaves one no room to doubt but that the divine providence has all along preserved them through so long a series of ages and changes for some wise and important ends which will be made manifest in their own due time see a treatise of the restoration of israel addressed to the jews an       for as the apostle justly observes if the fall and diminishing of them be the riches of the converted gentile world how much more their fullness romans xi          and seq  and if the casting off of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead but this being a subject that is foreign to the present point and has been already handled by so many learned pens i willingly pass it by and for the same reason it is that i have forborne entering into the grand and principal view of the divine providence in this miraculous deliverance of the israelites as it was designed to typify to us that much nobler one which was to be wrought and was accordingly so by the divine redeemer of mankind who is styled the only firstborn of every creature colos i     and firstbegotten of the dead revel i    yet as the firstborn of his virgin mother it is rightly observed by some ancient fathers that christ was the only firstborn of whom it could be truly said according to the letter of the mosaic law that he opened his mothers womb because it was the only one that was unbroken and untouched by natural coition origin homil    in lut i tertul de carn christ c    ambros in lue ii    hieron theophil and al   condescended to be redeemed according to the law abovementioned luke ii     for though in this respect the infinite power wisdom and goodness of god are still more visibly and wonderfully displayed in the conducting of such variety of disparate means to that one glorious end yet that is a point which does not concern the question about the true meaning of the judgments executed by him on the egyptian gods which i hope i have sufficiently shown by this time to be no other than the irrefragable evidence given through the series of the ten plagues inflicted on their senseless votaries of their being no other than imaginary and false deities and that he alone was the true and only supreme governor of heaven and earth  but here i know not whether i shall not be thought guilty of a considerable omission in not joining to the foregoing ten plagues that which was the last and most dreadful as well as the most wonderful of all the miraculous passage of the israelites through the red sea and the total destruction of pharaoh and his host in it exodus xiv pass  especially as the most miraculous part of it the dividing of its waves on each side vid int al ps lxxviii    cxxxvi       isai lxiii       habak iii    and al  has been so boldly attacked by very learned men both jews and christians and attempted to be accounted for in a natural way so discreditable to the account given us by the sacred historian it is plain from the whole account which moses gives us of this transaction that it could be no other than a very miraculous one exodus xiv    and seq  so that one would wonder how it should come into the heads of learned men who acknowledge his divine authority to represent it in a manner so incompatible with it and pretend that he only coasted along some part of the sea or at most crossed some narrow nook of it at a time when he knew it to be low water whilst the egyptians ignorant of that circumstance and venturing to follow the same tract were over whelmed by the waves at the return of the tide a notion which we are told by an ancient writer aristophan ap eusebius praep evang l iv c     went current with the memphitish priests whilst those of heliopolis allowed that fact to be altogether supernatural and so certainly must every thinking man that considers the impossibility of mosess leading such a numerous host consisting of little less than three millions besides a vast quantity of heavy luggage across the smallest arm of the sea in so short a time as that between low water and the return of the tide but for a farther confutation of that and other absurdities that attend that wild supposition i shall refer the reader to the universal history abovequoted where that whole transaction is set in the fairest light un hist fol vol i chapter vii sect   ad fin and   vo vol iii p     and seq   and other inspired writers who have made mention of that extraordinary transaction as if the whole of it consisted in mosess having gained a greater insight into the ebbing and flowing of that sea than the egyptians and choosing the critical time of its low water to cross it at some narrow nook but besides that this wild notion has been fully confuted and the impossibility of such a supposition fairly demonstrated by abler pens to which i willingly refer your opponent see among others on that subject un hist fol vol i chapter vii sect   ad fin and   vo edit vol iii p     and seq sub not  i cannot look upon that signal punishment as a part of the judgment denounced against and executed upon the egyptian gods in the sense i have taken that phrase in their cause having already been determined by the death of the firstborn in such a manner as had effectually convinced pharaoh and his court of the vanity and impotence of those pretended deities the misfortune was that their conviction was so easily overbalanced by their regret of parting with so many myriads of useful hands such numberless herds of cattle and so much of other wealth all at once that his avarice and ambition gets the better of his reason and his eagerness to bring them back permits not him to reflect on the danger of the attempt till he and his host are all swallowed up in one common ruin so that this last punishment is not inflicted upon them for their unbelief or refusing to acknowledge the allpowerful god of the hebrews but for daring to disobey him in spite of all the former and severe instances he had so lately given of his sovereign authority over them and all the world  however that be it cannot but be confessed that this last miraculous catastrophe was a most convincing proof both to the surviving egyptians and to all the other nations round about of the falsehood of their religion which had hitherto so fatally misled them from the knowledge and worship of that one supreme and almighty being into a belief and confidence in their own respective imaginary deities this is elegantly expressed by moses in that excellent poem which he composed upon this occasion to be sung by the israelitish host the people shall hear of it and be dismayed fear shall seize on the inhabitants of palestine the dukes of edom shall be amazed terror shall seize on the mighty men of moab and all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away exodus xv    and seq  all which was punctually verified by the sequel vid int al deuteronomy ii    josh ii   and seq and alib pass  and indeed how could they be otherwise than dismayed to the last degree when they heard of this signal overthrow and to what less than an almighty power could they ascribe it considering the vast disparity between the pursued and the pursuer the former an unwieldy body of fugitive unarmed slaves unused to war and ready to die with fear at the sight of a merciless sea before and an inexorable enemy behind the latter a numerous host of experienced warriors armed capape and with such quantities of horse and foot as make them already sure of victory and yet to find the one safely conveyed over through the yielding waves and the others swallowed up to a man by them and thrown up by the next tide to the opposite shore  from what had hitherto been transacted both in egypt and last of all at the red sea the canaanites and other nations who worshipped the like false deities had all the reason in the world to conclude that theirs would no more be able to stand the trial with the lord god of israel than those of egypt had done  however that there might be no want either of proofs to convince them of his being the true and only supreme being or of motives to induce them to comply with his gracious design and to renounce all future confidence in their idols and false gods and to worship and trust in him alone he is pleased to work as great unheard of wonders among them by the hand of his new servant joshua as he had done by that of moses in egypt and at the same time orders him to proclaim an universal peace and amnesty to as many of them as should accept it upon those terms that is the renouncing all idolatry and embracing the pure ancient patriarchal religion which we have already described elsewhere see the preface and p  0 and seq  and by which the talmudists and jewish rabbis understand the seven precepts pretended to have been given to noah after the flood viz   to abstain from idolatry   from blasphemy   from murder   from adultery   from theft   from blood and things strangled and   to appoint proper judges to maintain the execution of those laws gemar babyl lib sanhedr rabbin fer omn in genesis viii vid and seldom de jur not and gent lib i c ult  but as neither the chaldee paraphrast nor josephus nor pbilo among the jews nor origin or st jerome among the fathers make mention of them their pretended antiquity is much called in question and i should rather think with the judicious maimon yad chazak sepher melakim c   that the six first being the substance of the decalogue or natural religion were given to adam and the seventh to noah cumberland de leg patriarch printed in his origines antiquissimae  either as a check to all kind of cruelty vid arnob cont gent lib v  or perhaps rather as an acknowlegement that our right to feed upon living creatures is not derived to us from nature but from gods free permission  and utter destruction to all recusants  i am sensible that there is some difficulty to reconcile this with the positive anathema which god had pronounced against seven of those canaanitish nations deuteronomy vii      xx    and alib pass  who must therefore be supposed to have been excluded from the benefit of the one and irrecoveraably involved in the sentence of the other on account of their consummate wickedness above all the rest see genesis xv     but even this exclusion a priori might be justly decreed against them by god from a prescience that they would infallibly refuse his more peaceful offers out of an invincible reluctance to exchange their idolatries and impious superstitions for his more pure and rational worship upon which conditions only they were to be admitted to the benefit of them so that this exception with respect to them might mean no more than this as for these seven nations who notwithstanding i have in mercy spared hitherto have now filled the measure of their iniquity by the most horrid and abominable superstitions you may spare all farther offers of pardon and act against them as if they had actually rejected them because i well know that they are determined to do so and are therefore unworthy of any farther invitation or encouragement the event did sufficiently justify it and the confederacy which they unanimously entered into not only against joshua but against the gibeonites who though included in the same anathema had by a lucky stratagem obtained an alliance with him plainly shows how fully determined they were against listening to any offers from the israelites and to hazard their all rather than suffer the gibeonites to enjoy the benefit of their new alliance see josh chapter ix and x pass  from this remarkable instance i would observe further that neither joshua nor the grand council of the hebrews looked upon the divine interdict abovementioned to have been of so absolute a nature as to supersede the oath they had sworn to their new allies for in such a case eleazar the then high priest must have been obliged to absolve them from it as invalid and unlawful at least they could never have looked upon it to be so binding as to oblige them to take up arms in their defense when they found them on the eve of falling a sacrifice to the resentment of the five confederate kings ibid x   and seq  whereas joshua really showed a quite contrary behavior toward them and upon the first news of their imminent danger marches at the head of his army that whole night and on the next morning falls upon the enemy with his usual bravery and slacks not his pursuit of them till he has utterly destroyed them and what is still more remarkable god is so far from reproving him for it that he encourages him to go on with the promise of a complete and even a miraculous victory joshua x      and seq  it is true indeed that the benefit the gibeonites received from this alliance was a very small one since they only saved their lives to be doomed to perpetual servitude but this was as joshua told them josh ix        inflicted on them on account of the fraudulent stratagem by which they overreached him which however was made the lighter and more honorable in that they were made to attend not on the israelites but on the service of their god whereby they still continued as one body or nation and it is not improbable that the noble confession they made to the congregation of israel ibid verses    0 and     might be the main motive of it  thus far went the divine interdict against the seven nations abovementioned but as to the rest of the people to be conquered they were to be treated in a different manner and to have the offers of peace on the conditions lately mentioned sent to every city which if accepted they became tributary and in all other respects were left to enjoy their freedom and laws but if rejected a second offer was sent to them to depart quietly and unmolested whithersoever they would but if this last was still refused then they were at liberty to begin hostilities against them and when subdued to kill every man and seize on their women children and cattle as their spoil deuteronomy xx  0 and seq vid maimon in loc r sam nachmanid in deuteronomy xx  0 etc  but in no case were the israelites to suffer them to continue in their old idolatry but were ordered to destroy their idols altars groves etc neither were they permitted to contract any kind of affinity with them lest they should be enticed by it to the worship of their false deities  however in all the various exploits which they were to go through the divine providence took special care that they should not appear to the canaanites like those vast herds of celtes scythians and other invaders who acknowleged no other right than that of the strongest arm and alleged that as a sufficient indication that the gods were on their side and favored their invasions of other peoples property all canaan was so fully apprised of all the wonders which god had wrought both in egypt on the red sea and in the wilderness in their favor joshua ii   and seq v   and seq ix    0 and alib pass  that the stoutest inhabitants in it were quite overcome with dread and despair and thought on nothing but how to sell their lives and lands as dear as they could to their invincible enemies but lest they should imagine the report of them to have been exaggerated god vouchsafes to signalize their first entrance into their borders with such new and surprising ones as shall leave them no room to doubt of their being assisted in the conquest of that land by such an allpowerful hand as all the canaanitish deities were not able to repel  he begins with the miraculous division of the waters of jordan at a season when they were wont to overflow the land a great way on each side it is plain whatever modern travelers say of the present shallowness and narrowness of the jordan vid sandys thevenot la rocque pedro de la valle maundrel and al  whether through its sinking its bed deeper or any other common change made in it by length of time that it was formerly a large and considerable river even in the time of pliny and strabo plin n hist l v c    strab geogr lib xvi p      and that it was fordable only at some few places probably made so by art comp josh ii    and seq judge iii    xii     kings ii   and seq  and that it overflowed its banks formerly about the time of barleyharvest we are assured of not only by the book of joshua but by some other places of holy writ comp josh iii    iv      chronicles xii    jerem xlix    l    ecclus xxiv     and mr maundrel observed that the descent from its outermost bank to its present chanel was about a furlong though at the time of his viewing it which was at the latter end of march the usual season of its overflowing in former times it ran about two yards below the brink of its chanel journey from aleppo p     so that the crossing of it at that time by the israelites could not but be looked upon as altogether miraculous by the inhabitants of canaan and we are told accordingly that when they heard of it their hearts melted away neither was there any spirit left in them josh v     and opening a passage through it wide enough for their numerous host to go over it in one day josh iii    and seq  in memory of which wonderful transaction he orders his new captain to erect a monument on the opposite shore with the stones which he had caused to be brought out of the midst of its chanel ibid iv   and seq   the next proof which god gave the now disheartened canaanites of his irresistible power was the surprising manner in which they besieged and took the first city in that country and the miraculous downfall of its stout walls by the circumvection of the sacred ark in a formal procession which how strange soever it might appear to the besieged during the first six days could not fail of convincing them of it on the seventh when they beheld their impregnable ramparts prostrate on the earth themselves defenseless and exposed on all sides to the assailing enemy all their stately temples levelled with the ground and all their idols buried under their ruins josh vi pass   but what was to give those infatuated nations the most sensible and irrefragable evidence of the vanity and impotence of their imaginary deities was in making them instrumental to the destruction of their senseless votaries the canaanites at this time worshipped the sun moon stars and the elements and esteemed them as the most powerful of all the deities and these had hitherto showed themselves as idle and impotent spectators of the dreadful havoc which the israelites made both of their temples idols and their unhappy worshipers but now to complete all with one signal stroke of his omnipotence those elements shall be made to assist the israelites in the slaughter of those fugitives which they could not reach in the pursuit and by the miraculous showers of stones or hail which they pour on their heads destroy a much greater number of those unhappy wretches than the sword of the enemy could have done josh x ii  whilst the two grand luminaries are stopped at joshuas prayer in the midst of their course for a whole day to give the hebrews light enough to pursue and complete their victory ibid verse    and seq  here then as well as in egypt was executed a most exemplary judgment on all their false deities for what could be a greater proof of their vanity and impotence than to make them thus remarkably subservient to the utter destruction of their most zealous worshipers but that which still carries a greater weight was that these two signal wonders were wrought not so much in favor of the israelites the professed enemies to all their deities as to save the gibeonites from the imminent danger they were in of being all sacrificed to the resentment of the rest of the hittites for becoming the servants and proselytes of the almighty god of israel for had they been as irrevocably doomed to destruction as their other countrymen they would like them have still persisted in their defiance to his supreme power and been involved in the same fate whereas god here permits his people to be overreached by and to make a solemn alliance with them in vindication of which he displays his almighty power in a more signal manner than ever he had done upon any occasion to preserve them as lasting monuments of his clemency and readiness to receive all that fled to him for protection as to the true and only supreme being  the same may in a great measure be said of all the other canaanites whom if he had absolutely decreed to utter excision he would never have suffered to have been preserved alive and live intermixed with the israelites as he did it is indeed more than probable that the example of the gibeonites encouraged many others to accept of the same peaceable terms and joshua and the israelitish council to admit them to the same benefit for though these last were at first highly provoked at the fraudulent manner by which they obtained them yet when they found soon after how manifestly god declared himself in their favor and what wonders he wrought to save them from the fury of the five amorite kings they might perceive just cause to understand the words of moses in a more moderate sense and confine the sentence of excision only to those who should persist in an obstinate defiance on the other hand the canaanites though exasperated at first at the gibeonites for entering into a private alliance with israel yet when they once saw how well it succeeded with them and how ill it went with all those that were confederate against them they might be easily induced not only to sue for their protection and friendship but to hope for a more ready reception from the jewish chiefs seeing they used now no fraud to obtain it but wholly submitted themselves to their discretion and mercy  it is true that he often upbraids these for not totally destroying them together with all their idolatrous monuments and threatens them that they shall thenceforth prove thorns in their eyes and their gods snares to their feet and scourges to their sides josh xxiii    judge ii    but here the sin of the israelites was not the permitting those nations to live among them but their not obliging them to forsake all their false deities and to worship the only true god it was not their sparing their lives but their temples idols and other superstitious monuments and suffering them to continue in all their abominations and impious rites that occasioned those severe threatenings against them the sequel evidently showed the justness of that reproof since they themselves became ensnared even by those idolatrous monuments the very name and memory of which if they had utterly destroyed as they were injoined their singular happiness which was to attend their obedience and to rise and fall according to it could not but have opened the eyes of those unhappy nations to see the vast difference between serving the great and only god with a pure and holy worship and that of their vain and impotent deities by their abominable rites and that even with regard to their temporal interest which was all they had aimed at or hoped for from all their various superstitions so that in a little while the very remembrance of them would have been quite obliterated and both they and the israelites have shared in the same common blessings and have had cause to rejoice under the blissful sunshine of the divine providence from which none would then have been excluded but the obstinate and irreclaimable  in all these things we may plainly observe if not blinded by prejudice how careful the supreme being was to act both with respect to the israelites and canaanites in a manner equally suitable to his divine attributes of mercy wisdom and justice and consistent with the freedom of his rational creatures when as is excellently expressed by the prophet he strives to draw them to himself with the cords of a man and bonds of love hos xi    the former he chooses as a peculiar people brings them up with a paternal tenderness in the ancient patriarchal religion and rewards their obedience with continual blessings to the end that they may sow the seeds of the same pure worship wherever they go when the predeterminate time is come for them to inherit the promised land he leads them thither by such series of unheard of wonders as could not but convince them and all the world of his almighty power see exodus xxxiv  0  and at the same time prove the most rational preservative against the idolatrous infection that reigned among all its infatuated inhabitants these on the other hand he first tries to awaken to a sense of their horrid superstitions by the fame of those dreadful judgments which he had executed on the egyptians and their false deities these not proving sufficient he alarms them with fresh proofs of his almighty power and threats of his inevitable vengeance and to put an effectual end to all their confidence in their false deities and impious superstitions makes the very elements and two luminaries as my design in this essay reached no farther than the giving a more rational explanation about the divine judgments executed on the egyptian deities than any i had yet met with it will not i hope be expected that i should here enter into an inquiry into that extraordinary fact that is whether it was a real and supernatural solstice or a mere aurora or strange luor which afforded joshuas host light enough to discomfit the confederate amorites much less to account for the inaccuracy of joshuas expression of the sun standing still etc which is quite opposite to the now universally received system of astronomy and of the earths motion round the sun all which would afford matter enough for a particular dissertation in which it would be hardly possible for me to add any thing new to what has been said on that curious subject by much abler heads for which reason i shall content myself with referring your antagonist to the principal authors who have set that matter in the fairest light answered all the cavils and fully confuted every objection raised against that miraculous fact and wherein he may with ease come at a satisfactory knowledge of all that has been written on either side of the question see univ hist fol vol i chapter vii sect     vo edit vol iii p     and seq shuckford connect vol iii p     and seq calmet dissert on that miracle and diction sub joshua   to contribute to the excision of the most hardened and obstinate among them whilst those who accepted the terms of peace and were willing to renounce all their idolatry their brutish unnatural rites sorceries and other abominations and become proselytes of the true god are by the example of the gibeonites encouraged to try to save their lives by accepting of the proffered conditions of peace see before note o  so that it is evident from the whole that the extirpation of the former was not owing to any absolute and irrevocable decree but to the hardness of their own hearts compare josh xix  0 with wisd xii   and seq and with what has been said formerly of gods hardening pharaohs heart page    and seq  which made them reject the most pure and reasonable religion rather than part with their old shameful superstition and where is the wonder that the same supreme judge who rained down fire and sulphur from heaven on sodom and other neighboring cities for their unnatural sins should doom these to utter destruction for more unnatural and impious abominations and for introducing them into the worship of their deities  but what is the most surprising of all is that the ungrateful israelites should so soon cool in their zeal and obedience and instead of either totally abolishing this religion with all its rites or exterminating those that still persisted in them they suffered both to continue in the very midst of them the consequence of which was as had been often foretold to them that they soon became ensnared by them and insensibly fell from the worship of god into a most shameful fondness for the impious superstitions and customs of the canaanites yet even then god did neither suffer them to go on in their apostasy without eminent proofs of his power and displeasure nor did he cease giving them fresh ones of his mercy and goodness as soon as his punishments had brought them to a sense of their impiety their whole history for some centuries after joshua is nothing else but a constant alternative of new defections followed by some severe and longcontinued captivity and of repentance and pardon attended by some signal deliverance both were still so many standing and unexceptionable witnesses of his supreme power justice and goodness and sufficient to render both the israelites and canaanites inexcusable and at the same time leave such strong and sensible traces of his divine providence over the jewish church as should fully answer the allwise designs of it as it effectually did through all its various changes during the space of   00 years that is till all its figurative train of rites and ordinances were plainly fulfilled and superseded by the new and more spiritual dispensation of the gospel and all the bloody typical sacrifices of the patriarchal and jewish economy had their full completion in that of our divine redeemer  essay ii letter iii on the surprising adventure disappointment and punishment of balaam and the sad catastrophe of the midianites number xxii and seq  reverend sir i doubt not but i have by this time paved the way toward accounting in a rational manner for this so much canvassed and burlesqued part of the sacred history and that you at least if not your skeptical antagonists behold it in a much different light than you formerly seemed to do i shall now endeavor to show that it really is no other than a regular and uniform sequel of that miraculous competition between the supreme lord the god of israel and the false deities of the moabites and other heathen nations mentioned in my last essay and with this remarkable difference that balak and the moabites being now so fully convinced of his superior and irresistible power not only by what had been transacted in egypt but by the late fatal catastrophe of sihon king of the amorites and og king of basan number xxi    and seq deuteronomy ii   and seq iii   and seq  had but little heart to hazard a fresh competition between their own deities and him notwithstanding their extreme desire to put some effectual stop to the alarming progress of the successful israelites under their divine guide and protector had balak stayed to be better informed of their design he would easily have found that he had little to fear from them seeing god had expressly forbid them to commit any hostilities against them on account of their being descended from lot deuteronomy ii   and seq  neither could he be ignorant of the friendship and alliance which was between the hospitable jethro one of their chief priests and princes and moses the israelitish chief so that it would have been easy for him by the mediation of the former to have obtained such a firm and lasting peace from the latter as would have put an end to all his fears from that quarter but in that case there would have been no room for this extraordinary contest by which the divine providence designed to display his singular favor to israel and therefore balak is suffered to cherish and heighten his illgrounded fears and to use all the arts against them which his prudence and superstition could suggest to him in consequence of which he first calls the midianites to his assistance and enters into a strong alliance with them and then sends for the celebrated inchanter balaam to come and curse this so dreaded people not doubting by one or both these means to gain some considerable advantage against them number xxii   and seq   whether this famous person was a real prophet and worshiper of the true god or an heathen and a mere conjurer or soothsayer is you know much disputed by the learned among jews and christians both ancient and modern however not to enter too deep into that needless controversy i can see no reason why we may not admit him to have been a real prophet though otherwise a bad man and much given to incantation and other heathenish superstitions and a worshiper of the true god though not in all respects a true worshiper of him the tenor of mosess relation seems plainly to intimate the former and his own words to balaks messengers number xxii     if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of jehovah the lord my god will not give us leave to doubt of the latter we read of many such real prophets among the jews who did yet prostitute their office for lucre and other sorbid ends jerem v    mic iii   and seq zephan iii   and alib pass  and both our savior and st paul assure us that neither the gift of prophecy nor that of miracles deprive a man of the liberty of acting quite opposite to his character matthew vii      cor xiii    for which reason st austin rightly enough reckons balaam among those who shall say to christ at the last day lord have not i prophesied in thy name quaest in number art ix quaest     etc however that be whether we take him to have been a prophet or a bare conjurer here was the interposition of the divine power plainly displayed in obliging him contrary to his inclination and interest as well as in spite of his enchantment to bless in so singular a manner those whom balak sent for him to curse and the sequel sufficiently proves him to have been a true prophet so far whatever character he might bear before or since and the open confession he was forced to make to balak before his whole court and all the midianitish princes how ineffectual all his enchantments and other stratagems would prove against a nation whom god had made choice of to be the object of his special blessing could not but make not only a suitable impression upon them in favor of it but likewise give them a kind of warning and foretaste of the impiety as well as vanity of all their superstitious efforts and stratagems to obstruct their success it could not but convince them of these two great and important truths the inculcating of which into all those nations was the main scope of all this long series of wonders viz that there was an overruling power that governed all things in heaven and earth by his unerring providence and chiefly for the good and benefit of those that acknowleged and relied on him and   dly that all the deities they had adopted and confided in were either imaginary delusions or else creatures subordinate to and wholly directed by him  here your antagonist having nothing material to object against so reasonable a design sets himself wholly to find fault with the strange and as he is pleased to call it unaccountable method by which it was conducted the whole of whose objections may be reduced to the following heads viz    the improbability of gods endowing a person of balaams character with the spirit of prophecy and vouchsafing to converse with him in so peculiar and intimate a manner    of his so strictly forbidding him to go with balaks first messengers and permitting nay ordering him to go with the second    of his being angry with him for going after he had injoined him to do so    of his sending an angel to obstruct his journey yet bidding him to pursue it under such restrictions as he could not transgress without his permission    his opening the mouth of the dumb ass to reprimand him for his pretended illtimd resentment and cruelty  and lastly the strange reproof and strict charge of the angel to him the one for abusing his beast and the other not to act or speak otherwise than god should see fit to direct him see numb xxii       let us now examine each of these articles by the rules of reason and see whether upon an impartial examination they will appear in that ridiculous light in which he has stated them or not rather as uniform and well conducted series of events all tending to the end proposed the reducing those infatuated nations from their vain confidence in their false deities to a due sense of and a steady reliance on gods allwise and overruling providence in a way the most adapted to their capacities and at the same time the most effectual to convince rational creatures without the least infringement on their natural liberty    st then with respect to the pretended improbability of gods endowing a person of balaams character with the gift of prophecy i cannot see whence it arises and it being his declared design to convince those superstitious nations who placed no small confidence in their pretended prophets of his overruling power where is the absurdity or even wonder if in compliance with their notion he should raise a real one among them that should fully answer that end but why should he make choice of one of his vile character most probably because one of a better would not have answered the end proposed and his blessing israel instead of cursing them might have been looked upon as the effect of his zeal for that favorite nation of providence and of his hatred to the idolatrous notions and rites of the moabites and midianites whereas a person of balaams unbounded ambition and avarice and moreover addicted to the reigning sorceries and enchantments of those times being forced against his own inclination and interest to bless those whom balak would have bribed him at any rate to curse could not but convince them as well as all the rest of his behavior on this occasion did that he was driven to it by a superior or rather irresistible power as on the other hand had he been less than a real prophet or had he been as many learned men have supposed him only a mere conjurer or inchanter all that he uttered in favor of the israelitish people might have been imputed either to his want of skill or to a sudden inward fear of bringing some heavy resentment from them upon his head or to any other cause rather than to such a divine and irresistible impulse  but here your antagonist further objects against the probability of gods condescending to converse or as he modestly words it to dialogue it with such an infamous conjurer or at best a base prostituter of the prophetic gift but why not as well as he vouchsafed to discourse with adam and eve after their transgression or with the serpent genesis iii pass  or even with satan job i   ii   and seq  but farther if we consider that this was the same divine person who here spoke to balaam that had manifested himself in so singular a manner to abraham isaac etc and more lately to moses and aaron and was now the chief conductor of all these surprising events in favor of the israelites the same moreover who had been promised to our first parents and was in the fullness of time to appear in our nature see int al shuckf connect vol i lib v vol ii l    where will be the improbability of his now conversing thus familiarly with the very man whom he had pitched upon for the reasons abovementioned as a proper instrument to carry on his present design as for the cavils which your opponent raises against the expressions here made use of by moses and representing the deity as inquiring of balaam who whence and on what errand those messengers came they will hardly be liable to be misunderstood by those who are ever so little versed in the style and genius of the hebrew and other oriental tongues much less be thought to imply that god wanted to be informed about those messengers and the occasion of their errand any more than when he asked adam in paradise where art thou genesis iii    or cain where is thy brother abel ibid iv    hagar sarahs maid whence come thou and whither go thou ibid xvi    where is sarah thy wife ibid xviii    the like may be said of the question with which the prophet isaiah prefaced his message from god to hezekiah upon his receiving the babylonish ambassadors   kings xx     whence are these men what said they what have they seen in thy house etc all which he was fully apprised of before he came to him of the same nature are the questions asked of some of the prophets jeremiah what see thou jerem i     and many more such which need not here be mentioned  and since the event was to end in disgrace and disappointment who could be more deserving of it than he who appeared so ready to prostitute his prophetic office to his own ambitious views  but   dly why says your antagonist should god so strictly forbid him to go with balaks first messengers and yet not only permit him but oblige him to go with the second i answer for the greater pomp and grandeur of the thing had he been suffered to go with the first who the text intimates were but few in number and persons of a lower rank their report of the extraordinary opposition which he was to meet with on the way having no other witnesses than they and the prophets two servants might have been liable to suspicion and so failed of making a due impression on those that had sent them but when balak sees himself obliged to send new ones of an higher rank as well as in greater number who may be supposed to have had a suitable retinue after them being styled princes by the sacred number xxii    historian these i say accompanying the prophet all the way and being eye and ear witnesses of what happened to him in his journey to the land of moab can hardly be supposed to have countenanced much less combined with him to invent a fiction so contrary to his interest and their own sanguine expectations and as this scene of wonders was to be a kind of prelude to balaks disappointment their confirmation of it could not choose but give it an unquestionable sanction among the moabites and midianites and add weight to the prophecies which were to follow in favor of the israelites as being the then only nation among whom god was to establish his pure worship in opposition to the superstitions and idolatries reigning among the rest of the world number xxiii   and seq  0 and seq xxiv   and seq     dly but here the next objection started by your antagonist is why was god angry with balaam for going with the messengers seeing he had not only permitted but ordered him to do so the common solution which the jewish and christian writers give us is that balaam flattered himself that god had or might be prevailed upon to alter his intentions with respect to the israelites either by his sacrifices or enchantments by which means he would gain some considerable preferment as well as great reputation among the moabites but if this had been the only cause of gods anger would he not more probably have suffered him to go on in his fond conceit and then punished his presumption in the face of moab and midian either by forcing him to bless instead of cursing or by turning his curses into blessings which would have equally answered his end without being at the trouble of sending an angel to obstruct his way it must be owned that the crime which the angel here lays to his charge is but obscurely expressed and according to most versions and commentators implies no more than that he had warped or perverted his way before god number xxii    the difficulty is in fixing the true meaning of the verb  jarath as it occurs only in this place and in job xvi    but in a seemingly different sense where the text runs  he god has given me over or shut me up into the hands of the wicked as our version renders it or as it might still be more literally expressed he has bowed me down by he hands of the wicked alluding as the context seems to hint to the depredations which job had suffered from the plundering sabaeans etc mentioned chapter i ver    and    according to which sense the expression made use of by the angel jareth haderek lenegdi thy way or view is base and low in my eyes from the context may thus be paraphrased because thou have stooped so low as to prostitute thy prophetic office to thy own selfish views and have hired thyself to curse that very people who thou were told by god himself were the objects of his favor vid number xxii     nay and to make use of all thy enchanting arts so thou may but obtain the wages of unrighteousness confer number xxii    and   pet ii    jud verse        that is that he either proposed to himself a different issue of this expedition than god had decreed or that he was meditating on some way how to elude or frustrate his designs if he should find them contrary to his own and balaks expectation or perhaps lastly how to palliate the matter with balak and his people in case he did not succeed so as to avoid their resentment in any of which cases he appears to have a greater regard to his own credit and interest than to gods commission and design where then is the improbability of an angel being sent to reprove him for his selfish views and to injoin him to proceed as he was directed and leave the issue of the whole to the divine providence especially as such an extraordinary apparition could not but add a farther weight to what he should be afterward bid to say or do  but this rencounter as related and circumstantiated by the inspired historian is it seems what your antagonist thinks cannot be treated with too great contempt a celebrated prophet and diviner and consequently a person well acquainted of course with such visions is opposed by an angel with a drawn sword yet goes resolutely on insensible of his danger whilst the beast he rides on the most stupid animal of the whole creation is clearsighted enough to perceive and avoid it by turning out of the way and saves her rider from running blindfold into it this is repeated twice more in two such narrow paths that the ass is forced in the one to crush her riders foot against the wall and in the other to crouch down upon her belly to avoid his rushing on his destruction for which extraordinary care and concern she is only rewarded with a severe drubbing which says your friend deserves the greater admiration or laughter the perspicuity and prudence of the dumb creature or the stupidity and ingratitude of the prophet but what is even this compared to the surprising dialogue that ensues between the master and his beast in which the latter has so much the advantage of the former in point of reasoning and temper in that she contents herself with calmly expostulating his unjust severity whilst he on the contrary breaks out into a furious resentment and wishing at that instant for a sword to dispatch her for her extraordinary and repeated services to him number xxii       the angel likewise in his opinion makes but a mean figure amongst them his illtimed anger against the prophet whose eyes he knew to be withheld from seeing him and his rebuking him for his ill requital to his ass whose newacquired gifts of speech and reasoning he thinks made him sufficient amends for his severe drubbing are he supposes very unsuitable to the character of an heavenly messenger ibid verse     and his telling him that he would have killed him upon the spot if the ass had not timely saved him by turning aside out of his reach ibid verse     is what he judges would have rather become the malice of an infernal one so that upon the whole he highly commends josephus for suppressing that part of the dialogue rather than exposing his credulity by trying in vain to palliate it antiq lib iv c     i have now given your antagonists objections their full strength though not couched them in his ludicrous and sarcastical terms to avoid as much as possible the distasteful contrast that would appear between them and the seriousness with which the subject whatever he may think to the contrary deserves to be treated in doing which i shall not like some of the jewish and christian writers have recourse to allegorical and other elusory subterfuges maimonides and some other jewish writers pretend that this whole scene was transacted only in a vision in which they have been followed by some christians others think that the whole transaction must be understood in an allegorical sense that the ass was stopped from going on by some extraordinary impulse that the blows which its rider gave it set it not a speaking articulately but a braying which he however either by his conjuring skill or his acquaintance with the language of brutes rightly interpreted as a just rebuke for striking her others again think that moses copied this whole account out of the memoirs which were found in balaams custody after he had been slain by the israelites and were supposed to have been written by him upon which account moses thought proper to transmit them in the very terms they were couched in not indeed to have them believed as true but merely to expose the vanity of the diviners of his time de his maim mor nevoch and al jud greg nyssen in vit mos tostal le clerc and al in number xxii     all which are justly looked upon as mere evasions and contrary to the express tenor of the text as well as to the sense in which two of the apostles have understood it   pet ii    jude verse      which for aught i know have rather given birth to those satirical reflections with which your friend and many more of the same stamp have treated this and other scriptural subjects but confine myself to making such remarks as naturally result from mosess relation of this singular event and show how every step and circumstance tended to the main design which was to convince both moab and midian in the most sensible and rational manner of the injustice and inefficacy of all their efforts against a nation from whom they had nothing to fear and consequently no grounds for any such hostile stratagems as they were hatching against them and who being under the guidance and protection of an infinitely superior power to all their pretended deities were out of the reach of all their malicious darts unless it were to return them with double force on their own heads  let us then suppose that this celebrated diviner by whose enchantments the moabites and their confederates expected to prove more fatal to the israelitish host than all their united force and valor could be is now in full march at the head of a numerous train of noblemen and in full scent of honor and preserment when on the sudden and contrary to its usual custom his beast makes a full stop without any visible hindrance and will not be set forward again but by dint of dry blows they come next to a narrow path or defile where after a fresh stop and a second drubbing they see the fearful beast squeeze itself quite close to the wall to avoid something in its way which neither he nor his company can perceive and in doing which it is forced to crush its riders foot against the wall this could not but be somewhat surprising to them but still more so when after some miles riding they come into a straight path where they see the frighted beast instead of going forward crouch suddenly on its belly because it saw no way to slide by the unperceived opposer and continue a while motionless under a third and more severe volley of blows all this could not fail of drawing the attention as well as wonder of the whole caravan but whilst they are pondering on the strangeness of the adventure a new scene offers itself in which though the prophet had the largest share of the surprise yet it could not but fill the rest of the company with fresh astonishment for here on the sudden the dumb beasts mouth is unexpectedly opened not in its usual braying tone but in such a manner that the rider feels himself severely reproved for his illtimed severity but whether in such articulate words as were understood by the rest or only by the prophet i shall not presume to determine though there is no doubt but they understood the passionate reply which he made to it they must be no less surprised at his passionate expressions on that occasion when they heard him wish for a sword to slay the guiltless animal without being able so much as to guess at the cause of all this extraordinary behavior both of the ass and its rider whilst they stand in this suspense they see the latter fall prostrate on his face before the angel and making his apology to him for what he had ignorantly done and offering to return to his own home since god seemed now so displeased with his journey to the land of moab number ub sup ver       i will not pretend to decide whether the messengers of balak who were present at this extraordinary scene did see the angel or heard what he said to the prophet because the text hints nothing of it but as they could not but hear what he said to the heavenly messenger and admire his humble behavior to him they must of course suppose that there must be something more than natural that had thus stayed the ass in its way and now at last extorted such language and deportment from its rider for hitherto he had betrayed such uncommon eagerness to go with them and satisfy their desires in hopes of the large rewards promised to him that he could not forbear expressing an indecent resentment against the beast for seeming to oppose or retard his speed whereas after the seeing of this unexpected vision he appears altogether discouraged and ready to desist and give up all further hopes of preferment and as this rencounter made him so strangely alter his behavior and cast such a damp upon his sanguine views so i doubt not but in the account he gave them of it as they went on it produced a different kind of discourse with them and such as would prove a proper preface to the disappointment they were like to meet with for it is plain from the strict charge which the angel gave him of speaking only what god should dictate to him number ub sup verse     that he had no great hopes that the event would prove according to his and their wishes and accordingly upon his first approach to the moabitish king he prepares him in the same way by telling him that now he was come he had no power at all to speak any thing but what the lord should please to put in his mouth number ub sup verse     and it is hardly to be doubted but his messengers took also care to inform him of all that had passed in their journey homewards particularly the rencounter with the angel and the adventure of the ass from both which they might find occasion to infer a likelihoood that their designs against israel were going to be defeated by a superior power and might be more upon their guard to examine every circumstance to prevent their being imposed upon by the person who was pitched upon to be the chief actor in it for hitherto i see no reason to suspect him of any cheat because though he might be easily supposed to have contrived that surprising scene and pretended an extraordinary vision in order to cover his want of power or skill or to avoid balaks resentment yet how could he ever manage his dull beast so artfully as make it contribute its part in and to act it with the same exactness as he did his own without being perceived by some of the bystanders how could he make it stand stock still in one place squeeze itself against a wall in another to avoid something which neither he nor they could see and in the third to crouch at once on its belly and in all three of them to continue motionless under such a volley of dry blows and escape the notice of some or other of his numerous retinue but i shall sufficiently show byandby how inconsistent his deportment in the land of moab the singular manner of his blessing the israelitish tribes and the nature and extent of the prophecy he uttered on that occasion is to such a supposition but before i am come to that it will be necessary to remove the two great difficulties which your antagonist raises against the probability of the adventure viz that of the asss assuming as he terms it an human voice and speech and a reasonable faculty which even according to the mosaic relalation appears much superior to that of its master though a prophet and diviner and   dly the strange rebuke which the angel gives to the latter for his illtimed cruelty to the former allowing the case to have been worthy of the interposition of such an heavenly messenger  as to the first the impossibility of an asss assuming he should have said rather being miraculously endowed with an human voice and rational faculty it will be time enough to answer it when he has proved that pretended impossibility of all miracles of which this is allowed to be one and that no more against nature or above the power of an almighty agent than any of those that were wrought in egypt or at the red sea and for which i shall refer him to what has been said upon that subject in the last essay see before p    and seq  and more particularly against the pretended impossibility of all miracles in general ibid p    and seq    and seq  for if it be once allowed that god has still reserved to himself the power for some wise and important ends to dispense with his own laws and his bare denial of it against all reason and the sense of all nations is no proof that he has not or cannot do so how will he make it appear that it is more above the power of an almighty being to enable a dumb animal to pronounce some few articulate words in a rational order than to cleave the red sea to rain down manna six days and withold it on the seventh or to cure the deadly sting of fiery serpents by the bare looking on an artificial brazen one and if it be farther objected that the dumb beast showed a greater degree of wisdom than the prophet that rode it where even then will be the wonder if we consider who inspired it and if some of the brute creation do in many cases display a greater sagacity in their actions than those of the human species who value themselves so much on their superior faculties need we be surprised here that the most stupid of all animals being on such a particular occasion as this endowed with a much higher degree of rationability which is the utmost extent that can be allowed to the miracle should argue more justly than its master whose judgment was hurried away by the torrent of his boundless ambition and the prospect of some considerable advancement if any thing seems to challenge our admiration on this occasion it must be one would think the method which the divine providence made choice of to expose the stupidity of the prophet   pet ii     and to deter both him and those who sent for him from pursuing their malevolent views against the israelites and his choosing rather by that means to forewarn them of the danger they would bring upon them than to punish them for persisting in them he might as easily have ordered the angel to punish balaam with immediate death as barely to obstruct his career but if he prefers the sparing him in order to make him a more effectual instrument to convince both moab and midian how vain and dangerous all their efforts would prove against a people whom he had taken under his special conduct and favor why should the singularity of the miracle be deemed a sufficient proof against the reality of it when it is in all other respects so agreeable to the divine goodness  i would farther observe here that the opening the mouth of the dumb ass could not but be a convincing proof both to balaam and his company how vain and fruitless it would be for him to attempt or them to bribe him to speak otherwise than god should direct him since the same power that could enable a dumb beast to speak contrary to its nature was no less able to interdict the tongue of its rider from uttering any thing but what should be dictated to him god might indeed without any farther miracle have put it wholly out of his power to have done otherwise but if instead of depriving him of his liberty upon this extraordinary occasion he is rather pleased to deter him from abusing it and his moabitish retinue from tempting him to it by the miraculous speaking of a dumb ass was not this a most rational way of convincing both of his divine interposition in favor of the israelites and here bytheby did your antagonist never read of an ass speaking to bacchus a lamb to phrixius an horse to achilles and adrastus a bull to europa and an elephant to porus vid patric comment in number xxii  should it be said that these fabulous stories probably took their rise from this of moses as that of iphigenia from that of jephthahs daughter judge xi  0 and seq  and others of the like kind would it not rather confirm than confute them does it not show that the original of them had their foundation in truth whatever may be supposed of the copies are not moreover ancient oracles said to have been given by stones trees and other inanimate things and whence had these their origin more probably than from the miraculous urim and thummim worn by the jewish high priest see un hist fol edit vol i chapter vii sect   and   vo vol iii p    and seq sub not     and seq c   however lest the miracle of the dumb beast abovementioned should not prove sufficient to dissuade the ambitious prophet from pursuing his hostile designs god is pleased to add another no less deterring viz the apparition and severe threatening of an angel that as the first plainly showed how easily god could direct and control his words so the other might convince him of the danger of disobeying his express commands  if your antagonist should insist that the above instances out of heathen authors ought to be understood in a figurative or allegorical sense i would ask of him why may not the same be as well said of this i am upon sure i am that it carries with it a much more excellent and instructive moral than any that he can draw out of his profane mythologists whilst it represents to us in the most glaring light the dreadful effects of ambition and avarice in the person of one of the most celebrated diviners of the east who in spite of his great skill learning and other singular qualifications suffers himself to be hurried as it were blindfold by his predominant passion into the greatest danger so that neither gods express prohibition and threats nor his other miraculous warnings can prevent his falling a fatal sacrifice to it i may safely add that such an allegorical application is so far from being inconsistent with the main scope of whole transaction that the most remarkable ones of this nature recorded in holy writ plainly appear to have been conducted by the divine providence with this further view either of prophetic warning to the persons concerned or of instruction to those that should read or hear of them afterward thus i observed in the former essay how aarons rod swallowing up those of the egyptian inchanters was designed most probably to show the ill success that would attend the latter in their illtimed opposition of the former and that the turning the waters into blood did no less presignify the dreadful catastrophe that was to close up the whole contest see before p    and seq   0 and seq  and why may we not suppose this whole transaction to have been thus conducted with the same gracious view not only toward the infatuated prophet whose thirst after honor and preferment made him overlook the most imminent danger to which that had exposed him and at the same time to deter both moab and midian from pursuing their vain and injurious efforts against the israelites your antagonist ought to have known that such allegorical way of writing and interpreting was one of the most esteemed branches of learning in those days and no man was better qualified than balaam to have made a true application of every particular event had his ambition permitted him to reflect seriously upon it however the issue sufficiently explained their intention balak having tried in vain to avert gods special blessing from the israelites by all the ways which his superstition could suggest to him or balaams skill contrive dismisses him with this remarkable speech i thought indeed to promote thee to great honor but the lord jehovah has kept thee back from honor number xxiv     after which we do not find that he tried any further enchantments or other means to annoy the israelites if we except his joining with the midianites in the project of debauching them by the charms of their beautiful females of which most pernicious attempt i shall speak in the sequel but from that time left them to enjoy the divine blessing and guidance unmolested by which he saved himself and his people from that dreadful and universal destruction which the midianites brought upon themselves by too greedily pursuing balaams destructive counsel and in which they quickly became the dreadful victims he of his ambition and avarice and they of their unjust hatred and impiety number xxv pass xxxi pass      by this time i hope another of your antagonists difficulties is pretty well cleared whether the perverse view of the ambitious prophet was a thing of moment enough to deserve the commissioning of an angel to oppose him god might indeed have stopped him short by an immediate and irresistible impulse but how could the bystanders have known whether it was a divine one or only occasioned by some conscious fear either of his own inability or of exposing himself to some dreadful resentment either from the moabitish monarch or from the israelitish host besides such an absolute restraint upon the will would have been inconsistent with the method of gods dealing with rational creatures nor could it have turned to his glory like that of convincing them by arguments suitable to their rational faculties and freedom of will for by this means he no less displays his mercy and goodness than he does his justice in punishing them for their abuse of it as here in the case of balaam and the midianites and can it be said that the declaring of the divine will either to a whole nation or even to one single person for their sakes in order to convince them that their devices and hostile stratagems were quite opposite to it and would not only prove vain and fruitless but dangerous and hurtful was beneath the office or dignity of an angel  but your antagonist seems mostly dissatisfied with the behavior and reproof of the angel to the prophet and thinks that his declaring that he would surely have killed him if his ass had not prevented it by luckily avoiding to come within his reach is more becoming the language of an infernal than that of an heavenly messenger but here again he quite mistakes the case the words of the angel how severe soever being only designed to deter the ambitious prophet from pursuing a design which how interesting soever it might appear to him would surely turn to his destruction and of those who engaged him in it cannot be justly said to savor of the malignancy of an infernal spirit but rather by far to be exactly agreeable to the benevolent nature of an heavenly one and if heartily interpreted according to the hebrew idiom and duly compared with the contest must be readily acknowleged to amount to no more than this how could thou thus unjustly and repeatedly abuse thy innocent beast and not rather conclude from her unusual starting aside and crouching under thee that something extraordinary must have stood in her way and obliged her to do so for behold i was indeed sent on purpose to oppose thee because thy views were perverse before god and opposite to his design in permitting thee to go with all this people this sight of me has made thy ass decline me these three times and well it is for thee that some divine impulse enabled her both to perceive and avoid me which was a sure signal to me that i should spare and let thee go on and that the divine providence designed to cross thy malicious purpose against israel and oblige thee in spite of thy sanguine hopes to declare those signally blessed whom thou were hired to curse for had it not been for that i had certainly put an end at once both to thy life and to thy ambitious attempts and saved thy innocent beast for whatever your antagonist may please to infer from mosess words it is plain that the sparing of the prophet was not owing to the accidental declining of the ass but to her being enabled to perceive and avoid the threatening angel by turning aside from him and where the narrowness of the way would not permit her to do so by stopping short and crouching upon her belly both which being owing to a miraculous impulse gave timely notice to the angel to stay his hand the severer therefore the threatening was the more kindly must we judge it to have been meant as it was indeed the most effectual way to deter the infatuated balaam from rushing farther into his utter ruin number xxii    and seq   i come next to the apology which the prophet makes to the angel which according to our version runs thus number xxii     i have finned for i knew not that thou stoodest in my way but that this cannot be the true meaning of his words is manifest for how could he be guilty in this respect if his eyes were withheld from seeing him but according to the hebrew idiom they carry a much higher sense and more agreeable to the context viz i have sinned or transgressed in that i did not know or duly consider that thou stoodest in my way or in other words that thou did oppose my proceeding much such another apology did st paul make before the sanhedrin when accused of reviling gods high priest for unjustly causing him to be smitten in the mouth i wist not brethren says he that he was the high priest acts xxiii    for it is plain that he could not but know him both by his peculiar habit and by his sitting in the uppermost place of that assembly so that he could mean no other than that in the height of his resentment he had not duly considered who the person was whom he had thus reviled contrary to the mosaic law  some interpreters indeed insist that the words i did not know should be translated i do not acknowledge him to be gods high priest because as that dignity was become venal under the romans see un hist sol edit vol iv chapter xi sect     vo edit vol x p      those pontiffs who were raised to it by that unlawful way were not acknowleged by the stricter sort of jews which may have been the reason of st pauls expressing himself so see le scene essay on a new version tostat jun burkit and al in loc  but either of those senses will be still agreeable to the context and balaam will mean no more than that his ambition or avarice had not permitted him to consider whether his proceeding was indeed of so displeasing a nature to god as to bring upon him such a miraculous opposition    or that it could be displeasing to god who had given me express leave to go but now continues he since i find it to be so i will readily return home again according to this sense balaam artfully evades the charge laid against him by the angel of having perverted his way that is as i explained it a little higher of entertaining views so very opposite to the divine will as he could not but know were sufficient to expose him to the divine displeasure though not enough so to make him apprehensive or even dream of such an extraordinary opposition but the words in the original are still capable of another sense viz i have sinned therefore did not perceive that thou stoodest to oppose my way or in other words it is my fault that i did not perceive that thou were averse to my proceedings for that is the english of that hebrew expression now therefore since they are displeasing unto thee i will get me back again here the angel having thus far deterred balaam from pursuing his ambitious and hostile design gives him fresh leave to go on with balaks messengers but with this express caution however that he should not speak any thing but what was dictated to him number xxii     accordingly he readily declares to that monarch upon his coming to welcome him that he had really no power to speak a word for or against the israelites but what god should please to put into his mouth ibid verse     so far had the rencounter and warning of the heavenly messenger wrought upon the ambitious prophet that he seems to have been fully determined to renounce all hopes of riches or preferment rather than go one step beyond his commission but here your antagonist asks why should two such singular miracles be wrought in vain or could not the divine providence foresee the little effect they would have on the ambitious prophet till it came to the proof to which i answer that god did certainly foresee that his avarice and ambition would so far get the better of his fears as soon as the allurements of balaks great offers came in competition with these warnings and yet it would be very unjust to style those miracles vain whilst they so fully answered the end for which they were wrought viz to display gods goodness toward even that infatuated prophet in trying by rational motives to divert him from his selfish views without infringing on his free will   dly to prepare the moabitish messengers and by their means those who had sent them on that hostile and fruitless errand for the subsequent and more sensible tokens he was going to give them as well of his unalterable purposes in favor of the israelites as of the folly impiety and danger of attempting by whatsoever means to obstruct them can it be reasonably said that those miracles which were wrought in egypt were wrought in vain because they met with so little regard from pharaoh and his court but i shall not repeat here what has been said in a former essay upon that subject see before p    and seq  0  and seq  and the event has but too plainly shown an impartial reader to what cause to attribute their unhappy inefficacy both there and in the land of moab to need our dwelling any farther upon it  it must be owned that mosess account of this extraordinary transaction is very succinct and leaves us to seek for sundry particular circumstances which though he thought of less moment to the main design of his narrative yet would in all likelihood have obviated many of the difficulties started by your antagonist if they had been mentioned by him but if so many of them may be fairly gathered from the whole as will clear up those seeming difficulties we shall have cause rather to admire his wisdom than to complain of his conciseness now it plainly appears from the tenor of his relation that the moabitish king as well as his new allies placed such confidence in the efficacy of balaams blessings and curses which was no extraordinary thing considering the reigning superstition of those times that he would have spared neither rewards nor sumptuous promises to have obtained a plentiful shower of the latter upon the so much dreaded israelitish host number xxii    in consequence of which they would have fallen with the utmost speed and fury upon them and made the most dreadful slaughter they could among them it is true god might easily have turned their hostile designs with a tenfold usury upon their own heads but yet he rather chooses to spare them doubtless out of the same regard to their ancestor lot that had induced him to forbid the israelites to commit any hostilities against them deuteronomy ii    and to convince them in the mildest and most rational manner both of the injustice and dangerous consequences of their enmity as well as of the impiety and folly of all their superstitious projects and attempts against a nation so favored and protected by his unerring providence to the effectual accomplishing of which nothing more was required than the obliging of the infatuated prophet against his own will and interest to bless it in as signal and effectual a manner as he or they could wish to have them cursed  whether balaam did certainly conclude from the angels ambiguous commands not to speak any thing but what was put into his mouth number xxii     that god was determined to make him bless the israelites or no is not clear from the text though enough had been said and shown to make him apprehend that this would be the result of his being permitted to pursue his journey he did not remain long however in suspense about it after his arrival for when on the very next morning he was conducted by the moabitish king unto an eminence from which he could behold the israelitish camp see number xxiii     and  0  he soon concluded as well from their prodigious multitude amounting to no less than  00000 armed warriors as from the strength and regularity of their encampment and their peaceable and orderly discipline how impossible it would be to prevail against an host so numerous so well trained and so divinely protected and how vain and dangerous it would be for him to pronounce a curse on a people so visibly favored and blessed by the supreme being on the other hand the dread of balaks and the midianitish princes resentment who had him now in their power and might suspect his noncompliance to proceed from some secret confederacy with their enemies rather than a divine interposition added to the mortification of seeing himself at once deprived of all his flattering prospects could not but give him the greatest uneasiness so that to extricate himself if possible from so dangerous a dilemma he sees himself obliged to have recourse to some of those enchantments which according to the superstitious theology of those times were imagined to be the most capable of engaging the sun moon stars and all other inferior dignities to espouse the quarrel of moab and midian against the israelites and here again the divine providence pursuing still the same mild and gracious tract is pleased to permit him to try the utmost of his skill in order the more effectually to convince him and his infatuated clients of the vanity and inefficacy of his art and oblige them to acknowledge with him that surely there was no enchantment against jacob nor divination that could prevail against isreal number xxiii      but here it may appear somewhat surprising that balaam should so soon forget his former resolution or obliterate the impression which his late encounter with the angel had made upon him and much more so how he could be so soon prevailed upon to act contrary to that noble declaration he had so lately made to balak that if he would give him his house full of silver and gold he could not be allowed to utter one word beyond what the lord jehovah was pleased to dictate to him but the wonder will soon vanish if we consider   st that balak might take that as an artful grimace chiefly calculated to extort a more ample reward from him and on that account be the more profuse in his promises to him as he could not but plainly see that avarice and ambition were his predominant passions   dly balaam had by this time beheld so much of the splendour of the moabitish court and received such extraordinary honors and caresses both from that and from the midianitish princes as might easily outbalance all other considerations with him and if he still retained as he could hardly do otherwise any fear of the divine displeasure it was now outweighed by a greater and more affecting one to a man of his character viz that of forfeiting all those honors and flattering promises and being dismissed with shame and disgrace however   dly he had still a salvo against his fear of the divine displeasure namely that he did not intend by those enchantments to thwart the purposes of the supreme being but only to try to render them more favorable to his wishes by taking to his assistance all those inferior deities and striving to obtain that by their mediation and benign influence which he could not procure to his generous clients by any other interest there could be nothing in all this inconsistent either with the superstitious theology of those nations or incongruous to the character of balaam both as prophet and worshiper of the true god as i have shown at the entrance on this essay and in case his endeavors to obtain the so much desired favor did not meet with success he could but according to his former resolution comply with gods injunction of blessing israel in what manner and to what degree he should please to order it in which case he would be then so far acquitted by moab and midian that he had done all in his power to answer their requests and that his disappointment was visibly owing to a divine and irresistible interposition to the truth of which the rencounter with the angel and the miracle of the dumb asss speaking as seen and vouched by balaks messengers would give a still greater sanction  accordingly the first essay he made was the ordering of seven altars to be built and a bullock and a ram to be offered upon each of them number xxiii   and seq  where it is worth observing that this kind and number of victims is not only injoined by the mosaic law upon various occasions but likewise to jobs three friends by way of atonement for their trespass job cap ult ver    but as to that number of altars we no where read of any such nor indeed of any more than one at a time either under the patriarchal or mosaic dispensation neither indeed was a greater number compatible with the notion of one supreme being which balaam professed to worship but if he reared them to the seven planets which were esteemed the greatest and most powerful of all the subordinate deities as we have great reason to suppose he did because that kind of theology had been some time in vogue in egypt and spread itself all over those parts see shuckfords connect part iii p     and seq  then it is plain that he applied to them in that manner only as to the most powerful mediators to render the supreme deity propitious to his wishes what makes this interpretation appear to me the most probable is that upon his first rencounter with god at the conclusion of the first of those grand ceremonies he addresses him in these terms i have prepared seven altars and offered upon each of them a bullock and a ram number xxiii    but does not in either part mention the words to thee as he would of course have done had those altars been designedly reared or the victims been offered to him so that he means no more according to the theology then reigning than this i have invoked by the usual rites the seven planets or inferior deities to whom thou have committed the government of the world to interpose their mediation with thee on the behalf of moab and midian what confirms this sense still more is that after he has declared the tenor of the divine answer in terms the most opposite to balaks wishes that monarch does not desire him to apply himself to some other inferior deities there being little reason to hope that these should prove more successful than the former but only desires him to repeat the same sacrifices to them from some other number xxiii    eminence which might prove more favorable than this to which i may add that the last two trials are performed at the desire and in compliance with the superstitious king and not by the prophets advice or choice who could not but certainly conclude from the express tenor of the first divine answer the impossibility of obtaining a reversion of it however as this worship and invocation of the planets was one of the main branches of heathenish idolatry which god had so solemnly declared his displeasure against and done so many wonders both in egypt and other places to extirpate out of the minds of those infatuated nations we may reasonably rank it among the unlawful means which balaam made use of upon this occasion and which moses mentions under the name of divinations or enchantments others he might and probably did use which that lawgiver has given us no farther account of than where he tells us that when he balaam found at the third trial that god was determined to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for them but set his face toward the wilderness that is toward the israelitish host and having received the divine impulse delivered his third blessing on them in more emphatical and magnificent terms than he had done at the two former till balak quite out of all patience at his expressing himself in so high and extraordinary a manner in favor of them and at his still using some fresh and additional expressions of gods peculiar and unalterable favor to them above all other nattons at once silenced and dismissed him with contempt and disgrace number xxiv  0 and seq   here josephus acquaints us with some farther and not improbable particulars relating to this extraordinary transaction which moses did not think worth inserting in his concise narrative and among them balaams apology to the moabitish king in which he assures him that in all that he had uttered in favor of israel he was no more than a passive instrument in the hand of the supreme being and that he neither had power to speak or act nor knowledge of what he said or did much less any remembrance of the design for which he had been sent for by him or of his extreme desire of complying with it every word being forced from him by an irresistible power and quite contrary to his own inclination antiq l iv c    this is no more than balak and his courtiers might easily perceive by his manner of acting and speaking so like what we read was usual not only with the true prophets among the jews as well as with the pretended ones who had apostatized to the worship of baal both which had the character of madmen given them de his vid int al   samuel xix    and seq   kings xviii      kings ix    and alib pass  but was also believed to be the case of the heathenish pythonesses and other oraclemongers but the most convincing argument to them was his acting a part so contrary to his interest and inclination and the extreme mortification and displeasure we may reasonably suppose him to have shown at his disappointment from all which both he his princes and allies might be thoroughly satisfied that their designs against israel were defeated by a divine and irresistible power and that all their future attempts would meet with no better if not worse success than the former had done  however the divine providence took special care to convince not only them but future ages of his prophetic commission before he left the moabitish court for he no sooner had in some measure appeased the kings anger than he felt himself seized with a fresh prophetic impulse and having gained the attention of the whole assembly began to extend his predictions on sundry kingdoms and people and to display their various fates both by sea and land in so plain a manner that whatever slight impression they might make on those that then heard him yet by their timely accomplishment afterward they sufficiently showed that they all flowed from the same divine original number xxiv    and seq  among these none was more remarkable nor more universally spread all over the east than that of the miraculous star that should arise in jacob and the scepter or kingdom that was to be founded in israel ibid verse     the miraculous completion of which in the birth and reign of the messiah though at the distance of above    0 years has given the greatest evidence to his prophetic character and to all his former predictions  all this however did not prevent the disappointed monarchs resentment from showing itself afresh particularly in his dismissing the prophet not only without any recompense but likewise with this mortifying speech for it i thought indeed to have promoted thee to great honors but lo the lord has kept thee back from honor number xxiv  0    and seq  and here had been in all likelihood an end put to all further hostilities against the israelites it being scarcely to be doubted but both the moabites and midianites must have been sufficiently convinced by all that they had heard and seen how hazardous as well as fruitless all further attempts must have proved against a people so visibly protected by the divine providence neither do we find that balak or any of his subjects attempted any thing against them or that moses was ordered to take any farther revenge of them for what had passed than that of stamping a brand of indelible ignominy upon them by excluding them for ever from the israelitish congregation and from being admitted to contract any affinity with them or to be received as proselytes into their commonwealth deuteronomy xxiii      which exclusion entailed a constant hatred between them and was the cause of many a bloody war between them vid int al jud iii    and seq   samuel viii   and seq and alib pass  it fared indeed much worse with the unhappy midianites who became quickly after the dreadful victims of the prophets resentment and of their own obdurate enmity against the israelites but that was for joining with him in one of the most hellish designs that could well be hatched against them for that impious and revengeful wretch vexed at heart at his disgrace and disappointment soon strove to stifle all impression of what had happened to him except what might serve his vindictive malice and rightly judging that their happiness would rise or fall according as they proved obedient to their divine protector immediately bethought himself of an expedient which would make them curse themselves more effectually than all his art and enchantments could possibly have done which was to counsel the moabitish and midianitish princes to send some of their fairest and most tempting women to entice them to lewdness and idolatry his advice was soon put in execution and failed not of answering their expectation as there could not indeed be a more effectual way than that to deprive them of the divine favor and protection however god who had permitted this project to succeed so far that a great number of israelites had been already debauched by those fair tempters to the worship of their filthy deity baalpeor was soon pleased to interpose and nip it in the bud in a manner no less uniform with his former dealings toward them and agreeable to his divine attributes first by causing all those delinquents to be put to immediate death to the number of   000 as a determent to the rest and then by commanding moses forthwith to declare war against the midianites who had in all probability been the most forward in promoting this apostasy for these only are mentioned by moses as involved in the dreadful slaughter that ensued compare number xxv   and seq and    and seq see also chapter xxxi pass  whilst the moabites at least balak and the greater part of his people being deterred by what had passed from engaging with them in that pernicious stratagem were spared by moses either on that account or more probably in obedience to gods express command in their favor as being descended from lot abrahams nephew deuteronomy ii    however that be the israelites made so horrid a slaughter of the former that they destroyed all their males slew their five princes burnt all their cities and brought away an immense spoil in this war balaam the author of this dreadful catastrophe being by some fatal impulse induced to loiter still in midian met with his just reward being slain by the sword of the israelites whom his cursed advice had drawn into so dangerous a defection as must in all likelihood have been attended with fatal consequences had not the divine providence thus timely prevented it see number xxv pass xxxi    and seq deuter iv    we need not therefore wonder either at his falling a victim to his ambitious views who in spite of all the warnings given to him could yet contrive such an hellish design against them or at the sad catastrophe of the midianites when we consider how little occasion there was for their rancour and enmity against or indeed what small cause they had to fear any thing from the israelitish host after the mutual and hospitable kindness that had passed between moses and jethro one of their princes and chief priests before this unhappy and illtimed breach but to attempt to withdraw them from the worship of their divine protector into that of their filthy and abominable deity and that by the prostitution of their own daughters was an instance of such hellish malice as could not but justly deserve the fate they underwent  thus far sir i have i hope sufficiently cleared this extraordinary transaction from all the cavils which your opponent had raised against it and showed how consistent and uniform every step of it was with the main and gracious design of the divine providence and how exactly every thing was calculated to reduce those unhappy nations from their vain confidence in their false deities the practice of the superstitious and abominable rites they used in their worship of them as well as to inspire them with a due sense of his infinite power wisdom and goodness in a way the best suited to their capacity as rational and free agents and without the least infringement on their liberty as such to all which i shall only add a remark or two more upon the whole namely   st on the great condescension of the almighty toward those infatuated nations whose minds being sadly biased by prejudice and custom as well as by the craftiness and artifices of their selfish priests who took special care to calculate their religion and superstitions as best suited with the depraved taste of their votaries were in a great measure incapable of being reduced by arguments drawn from reason and could only be wrought upon by such strong impulses of sense and interesting motives as these i have been animadverting upon and which were indeed the fittest to be set in opposition to and to preponderate those artful and illusory ones by which their minds had been till then captivated by those juggling guides the next is his extreme goodness toward them in delaying to make them examples of his justice for the determent of others till their incorrigible obstinacy plainly proved them to be unworthy of any farther tokens of his forbearance this i have shown in my first essay to have been the case of the egyptians notwithstanding all the wonders which he wrought among them see before p     and seq     and seq  and will no less plainly appear upon an impartial review to be the case of moab and midian here an illgrounded jealousy conceived against a people who by all that god had already done for them appeared to have been designed by his providence to become the happy possessors of the land of canaan instead of the old inhabitants who had polluted it with the most abominable idolatries and the vilest and most inhuman rites engages those two infatuated nations to enter into an unjust and hostile confederacy against them to render which the more effectual balaam a celebrated prophet and inchanter is sent for to supply by his curses what was wanting in them either of courage or strength to destroy them he refuses their first presents and promises telling the messenger that the supreme being had taken them into his protection and would not permit him to attempt any thing to their hurt balak sends a second embassy consisting of a greater number of his nobles and balaam is under some restrictions permitted to go with them that they might be so many credible witnesses of the extraordinary rencounter he was to meet with in his way as a proper check to his perverse and ambitious views and a proper preparative to his moabitish retinue for the disappointment that was to ensue his beast is thrice stopped in the way in a strange and unusual manner at the sight of an angel and forced to crouch at last under the weight of its riders blows before their eyes and being on the sudden endowed with an human voice reproves him for his unjust treatment of her upon which his eyes till then withheld from seeing the heavenly messenger behold him with his sword drawn he hears himself severely reproved for still entertaining such perverse and opposite views to the designs of providence and particularly for his cruelty to his own beast to whose deflexion he owed the preservation of his life seeing he stood there ready to slay him had not the divine providence directed the innocent beast to avoid the danger as often as he stood in his way see before p     and seq  in all which there was nothing as i have elsewhere observed but what was consistent with the common belief of those superstitious nations and the artful practices of their diviners and priests which whether real or pretended that is whether wrought by the help of demons or the effect of juggling or mere delusion a point not yet sufficiently cleared seldom failed of making a deep impression on the beholders nothing therefore could well be more aptly and condescendingly calculated than this real and twofold miracle to convince the superstitious moabites in their own way that if balaam did in the sequel thwart instead of complying with their monarchs request it was owing to the divine interposition which it was out of his power to resist and at the same time nothing could be a properer determent to the prophet from cherishing his ambitious views than this miraculous rencounter and the angels severe reproof and interdiction again when balaks pompous promises to him had so far obliterated those impressions as to set him upon the trying the power of his enchantments in order to oblige that monarch he is foiled again and again in his attempts and forced in spite of his heart to pronounce the noblest and most endearing blessings on those on whom he was hired and earnestly wished to have poured the bitterest curses whilst balak has the singular mortification to find every fresh trial he makes of his art to come out more irksome and discouraging till his disdain and despair provoke him to dismiss him out of his presence and territory lastly balaam irritated at his disgrace and disappointment forgets all the former warnings and in a fit of resentment devises that impious stratagem which he hopes will draw down that curse upon israel which his enchantments could not effect and by his dreadful end and the universal slaughter of the midianites his infatuated accomplices god gives a fresh and irrefragable proof to moab and all the kingdoms round about of his unerring providence his power justice and goodness in defeating and punishing the impious attempts of the enemies of his chosen people and sparing the moabitish nation either as less deep in the guilt of the last execrable plot or out of a tender regard to their consanguinity with the offspring of the great father of the faithful but even in these instances of his rigor on those implacable enemies of israel it is plain that he did not let them feel the effects of it till they had resisted all those rational means which he had been using in order to reclaim them whilst on the other hand he appears to have been no less severe toward the offending israelites in the sudden and exemplary death of those   000 miscreants who had been drawn away to the worship of baalpeor than gracious and merciful to the rest by putting such an effectual and speedy stop by that means to the further spreading of that defection and apostasy conf number xxv and xxxi pass   before i dismiss this subject i must beg leave to take off another difficulty which occurs in mosess relation of this sudden defection to baalpeor and which though not taken notice of by your antagonist may chance to start in his way if what has been said above should incline him to give it a second reading it is where that lawgiver is ordered by god as our and most other versions render it to take all the heads of the people and to hang them up against the sun in order to appease the divine anger number xxv    which must appear exceeding harsh and unjust according to that version it being unreasonable to suppose that all the israelitish chiefs could be engaged in that apostasy or could deserve so severe a punishment if they were not whereas the words of the original if rightly understood and compared with the following verse import no more than this appoint all the heads of israel to sit in judgment over their respective subordinates and order all that were found guilty of it to be executed out of hand or as the text has it in the face of this sun that is on that very day vid targ onkel r salom and abarban in loc jun le scen and al and un hist   vo vol iii p     and seq z  which was the most expeditious way that could be thought on to bring those delinquents to trial and condign punishment as well as to put a speedy stop to the infection  the next point your opponent undertakes to criticize upon being the miraculous solstice obtained by joshua in favor of the gibeonites his new allies and he having offered nothing against the authenticity of that supernatural event but what has been fully answered by the authors of the book last quoted in the margin i shall gladly refer you to it for an answer to all his objections and pass on to the next point in dispute between him and you  essay iii letter iv containing a rational account of the total defeat of jabin king of hazor and his numberless confederates by the israelites joshua xi pass and answering the objections raised against the probability of that signal exploit by proper observation on the art of war and military discipline of the hebrews  sir i do not at all wonder at the difficulties which your incredulous neighbors raise against the probability of this remarkable transaction the swift and miraculous success which joshua and his hebrew host had so lately met with against the confederate forces of the southern canaanites by which he was become master of all that large tract of ground would one might reasonably think have effectually deterred these northern kingdoms from the like hopeless and dangerous attempt how could they imagine it possible for their forces how numerous and valiant soever to stop the hebrew generals career whom they knew to have stop that of the two luminaries their two grand deities in the midst of theirs and to have engaged the very elements to overwhelm so many myriads of the flying confederates with hailstones whilst that day was miraculously lengthened to give him time to cut off their discomfited remains josh x pass  what help could they hope for from their deities who had thus far already contributed to the utter excision of their southern votaries and suffered the israelites to destroy all their temples altars and images see before page     and seq  in so desperate a situation would they not more probably have chosen to abandon their whole country to the irresistible force of such an enemy rather than rush into unavoidable destruction by attempting to oppose him  this difficulty how great soever it may appear will quickly vanish if we consider that these were like the rest given up by god to a judicial infatuation and to a determinate refusal of all offers of peace on the conditions required of them josh xi        0 see before p     and seq  nor is it indeed to be much wondered at that they should be so unanimous in their resolution of dying sword in hand in defense of their liberty religion and country seeing the same spirit reigned almost everywhere among those nations and those among them were held in the greatest contempt and abhorrence that preferred not death in so interesting a cause to an ignominious servitude on such dishonorable terms as they esteemed the exchange of their old idolatrous worship for that of the god of israel whom they looked upon by this time as an incensed and inexorable judge rather than as an object worthy their adoration and love in this desperate situation what could be expected from them but that their resolutions should prove equally desperate and that they should try by one bold stroke of their united force either to save their all or perish in the attempt  accordingly we find that whilst joshua was refreshing his army after his conquest of southern canaan at his standing camp at gilgal on the west side of jordan jabin king of hazor one of the most powerful of all the northern princes josh xi  0  engaged not only several petty kings but a great number of states both on the hills and plains ibid verse   and seq  to enter into a most powerful confederacy against him and though a prodigious number of the more pusillanimous chose to abandon their country to the irresistible conqueror and seek for some more peaceful settlements in distant countries accordingly we are told that great shoals of them removed thence some into egypt and some into africa where they spread themselves far and wide built a great number of cities and retained the ancient language of canaan during a long series of ages procop de bell vandal l ii c  0  procopius also mentions two white columns reared by them in the city of tingis now tangier a city of their founding and capital of the province of tingitania on which was carved an inscription in the phoenician language and character to this purpose we are fugitives that fled to save ourselves from the great robber joshua the son of nun st austin farther assures us that the africans boasted themselves to be descended from the ancient canaanites and preserved their old phoenician language exposit inchoat in epist ad roman  the punic being generally allowed to be very near the hebrew and phoenician  they are likewise supposed by the learned to have come in colonies into greece cilicia and lesser asia and most of the islands of the aegean and mediterranean sea quite to cadiz in spain see bochart de colon and sermon phoenic seldom de jur not l vii c   calmet dissertat de canaanit  and if we may credit the jewish writers they spread themselves as far as germany sclavonia etc gemar hieros ap seld ubi sup  arrian likewise tells us that among the many ambassadors that waited upon alexander the great at babylon some came from africa that were of the canaanitish race and the babylonish gemora adds that they came to beg of him to reinstate them in their ancient seats whence the israelites had driven them tractat sanhedr c   vid seldom ubi sup     rather than run the risk of their lives in a fruitless opposition yet there were still enough left of a more determinate spirit to make up an army of  00000 men  0000 horse and  000 chariots if josephus may be credited antiq lib v c    and fewer we can hardly suppose them to have been seeing the text compares them to the sands of the sea shore for multitude and makes likewise mention of their numerous horse and chariots of war josh xi    and such a threatening appearance they made at their general rendezvous that the hebrew chief though hitherto so accustomed to victory seems here to have wanted fresh assurance from god of his proving equally successful against this as he had lately been against the southern confederacy be not afraid of them says god to him for tomorrow about this time i will deliver them up to thee to be all slain before israel and thou shall hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire ibid verse     but here your opponent raises a very considerable difficulty against the possibility of joshuas whom he supposes to have been still at his camp at gilgal reaching them in so short a time to the place of their rendezvous at the waters of merom which he likewise supposes to be the samachonitish lake situate about halfway between that of genezareth and the springhead of the river jordan for according to that twofold supposition he and his army must have marched at least an hundred miles and a great part of the way over high mountains and narrow defiles in that short time which is evidently impossible your friends may indeed wonder that the sacred historian should have given us so confused and imperfect an account of that signal victory especially if joshua himself was as he is supposed by most interpreters the penman of it for as he was so consummate a general it might be reasonably expected that he would have if not embellished his relation yet at least been more particular in describing the circumstances both of his march and of his engaging the enemy but they ought to have remembered that it is the peculiar character i might have called it excellency of the sacred historians to relate facts with a surprising unaffected simplicity and in all actions of this nature to avoid as much as possible entering into such particulars as relate to their own prudence conduct or valor lest they should appear to assume any share of that glory to themselves which was entirely due to their heavenly protector hence it is that the inspired writer here thought fit to confine himself to the two most material points viz the divine promise of a complete victory over that numerous and so much dreaded host and the event of it in their total defeat other circumstances of that battle might indeed have conveyed to us a clearer idea of the conduct and bravery of the hebrew general but could not have given us so lively an one of the display of the divine power in favor of his people as the representing him here as the sole author of the whole transaction and ascribing the whole glory of it where it was most justly due  however as gilgal the standing camp of the israelites was at too great a distance from the waters of merom where the confederate forces were rendezvousd for joshua to reach it in so short a time whether we suppose the latter to be the samachonitish lake or as i shall show byandby some plain much nearer than the former it were absurd to suppose the divine promise to have been made to him before his decamping from it and not rather upon his being come within a short days march from if not in full view of the enemys army the text seems plainly to be in favor of this latter supposition for joshua could hardly before that time be so sufficiently apprised of their number and strength as to want this fresh assurance from god neither will reason permit us to think that so old and experienced a general would have suffered such a grand confederacy to be made against him without using all possible expedition to go and oppose them especially as so great a tract of south canaan which he had lately conquered lay between him and them and being now in some measure destitute of its old inhabitants might have easily become a prey to them  how long he and his army were in marching from gilgal to merom the text does not tell us josephus says only five days josephus calls the place where they engaged berothe antiq lib v c    but that is most likely a mistake of the transcriber for merothe or according to the hebrew termination meroth mas comment in josh xi  which he tells us is one of the towns of gallilee  which if true plainly shows that those places must have been much nearer to each other and consequently that the merom waters here spoken of could not be the samachonitish lake abovementioned as some commentators conjecture for neither could such an army as his must be supposed to have been have reached it in twice that time it being as i hinted before above an hundred miles over high mountains and narrow passes nor is it likely that the confederate army would choose that for the place of their rendezvous it being almost at the farthest end north of their country and have left so vast a territory on the south exposed to the enemy  what has given birth to that mistake is that josephus mentions the city of hazor the capital of jabin the chief of the confederate kings as situate upon that lake but besides that he does not hint any thing like the battle having been fought there is it not very absurd to suppose that so politic a king and who was the chief promoter of the confederacy should choose his own territory to be the scene of war and a plain so near his metropolis for the field of battle is it not much more reasonable to suppose that both he and his allies would haste all they could to meet the enemy before he could penetrate into any of their territories hence it is generally concluded that the merom here spoken of is the same which eusebius calls merus and places at about twelve miles distance from sebaste or samaria toward dothaim and on this side of the torrent of kishon and in the neighborhood of mount thabor and the waters of megiddo and the city of thaanach for upon that same spot it was that was afterward fought the famous battle between sisera general of jabin king of hazor and barak the hebrew chief about   0 years after in which the former though vastly superior was totally cut off judge iv pass v     for there was a very important pass which guarded the entrance into galilee and so into phoenice or from thence into south canaan it was therefore of the utmost consequence to the confederates to secure it seeing the loss of it would open as it actually did after their defeat a way into all the northern part which they inhabited quite into upper galilee now this spot being at most but between fifty or sixty miles from gilgal it was easy for joshua and his army to reach it in less than five days considering the expeditious way which the hebrews had of marching their armies not only in different columns more or less numerous as the ground would allow but even in small bodies whenever they could do it safe from the attacks and insults of their enemies as they could on this particular occasion through all the south part of canaan where they had already destroyed all that could possibly annoy them and had in all probability left here and there a garrison at proper places to secure either their march or a retreat in case of need for it is to be observed here that they were encumbered with neither artillery nor baggage that could retard their speed they took nothing with them but their arms which were either the sling sword lance or bow all light of carriage besides their provisions which being chiefly of the dry kind as bread parched corn peace dried figs raisins etc they easily carried a sufficient quantity about them for the present occasion or in case of a long march they had their asses mules and other beasts of carriage for the purpose by which means they marched with a surprising expedition from one end of the country to the other but of this i shall give as remarkable an instance in the last of these essays as is to be met with in any history either ancient or modern i must still add one peculiar advantage they had in this respect above other nations from the excellent discipline established among them by their inspired lawgiver and improved by his worthy successor the present hebrew chief joshua and that was that every man that was able to bear arms that is from twenty to sixty years of age was obliged to be enrolled in the musterroll of his own tribe and to appear under the standard of it with his provisions and military accoutrements upon the first summons under the severest penalties these musterrolls were carefully preserved not only by every tribe but a general one of the whole was likewise to be kept in the hands of the chief judge or general the former of those rolls was to be called over at the head of each respective tribe to see that none were absent but such as were detained by some unavoidable impediment as sickness lameness and the like here likewise as many as had married a wife built a new house planted a vineyard etc within the year having made good their claim before the head of the tribe were likewise dismissed to their own home and set down as such in the musterbook after which the rest were to march to the place of rendezvous under their respective heads of thousands hundreds and fifties here their names were called afresh to see whether any were missing and then the whole amount was given to the head commander so that there could hardly be any that dared desert from his colors because they knew not whither to go without danger no other tribe daring to admit them within their roll and they being branded in their own for runaways and liable to be punished with death as soon as found they had still another powerful tie viz their family for all the men were obliged to marry soon after they had attained to their twentieth year and were generally fruitful but in case of desertion should they by good chance have escaped from being taken yet they must be for ever banished from their parents wives and children besides living perhaps under some servitude in a strange place and in constant fear of being discovered to have fled into an enemys country for safety was not only equally dangerous but much more dreaded because that rescinded them from the commonwealth of israel as traitors and apostates which was esteemed the greatest curse that could befall them upon all these accounts desertion was so rare that they could trust their men to march through their own country without that military regularity which was commonly observed by other nations and on all emergencies that required a more than ordinary expedition permit them to divide themselves into small bodies go over mountains or fetch a compass about or take any other method that would bring them soonest to the place of rendezvous it was therefore by this excellent discipline that the hebrew armies though sometimes very numerous were able to make such surprising quick marches either over mountains and defiles or by fetching a compass about as to come upon their enemies when they least dreamed of their being so nigh and by attacking them on the sudden on two or three sometimes on all sides in distinct bodies to give them a total overthrow upon the whole then though gilgal was at least an hundred miles distance from hazor the capital of the chiefest of the confederate kings yet the text tells us that when these last were assembled together they marched their army to the waters of merom in order to engage the israelites josh xi    which as i have showed before were not those of the lake samachon as your friend and others suppose but of kishon or as they are elsewhere styled the waters of megiddo to this i beg leave to add one argument more viz that joshua is said in the text to have pursued the enemy after their defeat to great zidon to mizrephothmajim and to the valley of mizpeh on the east now that mizpeh was in the tract of mount gilead is plain from the story of laban and jacob who gave it both those names genes xxxi    and it is as plain that it lies eastward of the waters of merom or torrent of kishon but full south from the lake samachon and therefore this last could not be the waters of merom mentioned in the text but those of the river kishon to this there can be but one thing objected viz that the text places mizpeh under mount hermon josh xi    which lies above fifty miles north of gilead and northeast of the samachonitish lake so that it cannot be that in the land of gilead for according to that situation it lies east from the lake and from zidon as the text places it in the  th verse but allowing that it will not follow that the battle was fought near that lake but that jabin king of hazor prevailed on all the nations from the hittites that lived under that mount and consequently were situate the farthest north from south canaan quite down to those who inhabited the south parts from the lake genezareth eastward to the borders of dor on the west to join in the confederacy with him that is that he engaged all the nations about him quite to the very borders of south canaan to engage in that war in revenge of which joshua having totally defeated them pursued them to the furthermost part of their respective territories that is to mizrephothmajim west to zidon north and to this mizpeh under hermon eastward which i gladly subscribe to because the text observes that after he had pursued them thus far north he turned back and took and burned the city of hazor josh xi  0  but this cannot affect what i have said either of the field of battle or of joshuas attacking the enemy by distinct bodies but rather confirms it  and accordingly we find zidon on the north of that river and the mizrephothmajim the other place where joshua pursued them may be reasonably supposed to have lain westward toward the sea for the word signifies the burnings of waters and is commonly understood either of salt pits or melting of sand to make glass and both these manufactures were carried on along the western coasts about acra or ptolemais but especially the latter the sand of the river belus which falls into the sea not far from it being reckoned excellent for that use and said to have ministered the first hint to that invention  here then we have the three points to which he pursued them viz to mizpeh eastward to zidon northward and to mizrephothmajim westward for the south being already conquered it is not to be supposed they would venture to flee to any part of it we may therefore reasonably conclude that this was the scene of that memorable action and that it lay near the confines of both and i think it highly probable that the river kishon did at this time divide the southern canaan conquered by joshua from the northern still unsubdued and hither it was that the hebrew chief led his forces to oppose them josh xi    and there it was that he gained the signal victory mentioned a little after which enabled him in four or five years to complete the conquest of the whole northern tract ibid ver   and seq   there remains but one difficulty unanswered and that is how joshua with his small flying army for such it might justly be deemed in comparison of that of the confederates could give them such a total overthrow and chase them so many different ways and at so great a distance from each other and cut them off that none of them should remain but those few that fled into fortified cities burn all their warlike chariots hamstring their horses and open to himself a way through all that hilly country quite to the city of hazor which stood above fifty miles farther north without meeting that we read of any farther opposition from the enemy but here likewise the sacred historian wholly ascribes the glory of the whole expedition to god who delivered up that numerous host into his hand josh xi    and leaves us to guess at the methods which the hebrew general took to accomplish it by some few hints interspersed as it were accidentally in the text but yet sufficient to remove all appearance of improbability in the relation    st then as to the prodigious superiority of the confederates with respect to number it is universally allowed to be a disvantage rather than advantage not only as it is apt to inspire them with too much confidence security and negligence but likewise as it often proves an unwieldy and dead weight especially when engaged against a general who knows how to choose his ground so as to render the greater part of it useless for the truth of which we need not seek for a more pregnant instance than in the two armies of darius and alexander the great   dly by the hint the text gives us of joshuas pursuing the flying enemy quite to great zidon to mizrephothmajim and to the valley of mizpeh and smiting them till none remained that is as the text plainly imports till none remained undispersed we may draw this very probable inference from it viz that joshua had divided his army into several distinct bodies both to attack them on different sides and to pursue and kill those that fled for that was a method much in vogue in those ancient times seeing we find it practiced as early as the time of abraham genesis xiv     another remark i would make on those flying and separate bodies is that they generally aimed at and were designed to surprise the enemy and fall unexpectedly upon them on as many sides as they could by which means such a sudden panic was generally conveyed from the outguards to the main body of the army as seldom failed of being attended with their total overthrow the many instances of this kind of successful stratagems in barak gideon saul and other jewish chiefs and among the maccabees in later ages are not only standing proofs of its use and excellence but give us a moral assurance that joshua who was so well versed in all the arts of war would not omit putting this in practice whenever a fair opportunity offered and where can the improbability be that such a vast army as that of the confederates who in all likelihood lay negligently encamped trusting chiefly in their number and strength should afford him such an one as he could wish especially if he took the opportunity of coming upon them in the night and attacking them upon the first dawn of the day did not gideon with his three hundred men by much the same wellconcerted stratagem inject an universal panic into the numerous host of midian amalek and their confederates in the dead of night and discomfit them on the next morning judge vii    and seq  did not barak with  0000 men defeat sisera and his numerous host with his  00 iron chariots of war ibid iv pass  and saul with an army of  00000 men surprise the ammonitish camp before jabeshgilead and cut them all in pieces   samuel xi pass  and did not his son jonathan with only his armorbearer by luckily surprising one of the stations of the warlike philistines inject such a terror into their whole camp as occasioned their total defeat ibid xiv pass  for in the general confusion and mistrust that reigned through those numerous hosts which was still much greater when they consisted of various nations whether confederates or auxiliaries they commonly fell foul upon one another with such desperate fury that the enemy had little else to do but to stand still and see them sheath their weapons into each others side how much more grievous must the horror and despair of these northern canaanites be at this unhappy juncture to see themselves surprised and on all sides surrounded with such an irresistible enemy all the union of their confederacy at once broken their politics defeated and their united force dissolved by the universal distrust and dread which reigns among them whilst every nation i might almost say every individual forgetting the ties of common alliance can think on nothing but of seeking their own safety by the most dangerous and desperate means such i believe will easily be allowed to be the necessary consequence of such illconcerted confederacies when acting in opposition to a force which how inferior soever in number is so strongly cemented by one common interest directed by a wise and experienced commander kept up by a good martial discipline and inspirited with such frequent divine assureances of victory what wonder is there then that the hebrew army with so many great advantages nay with every advantage but that of numbers if that be really one should thus totally rout and disperse that of so many illunited and intimidated consederates make such a dreadful slaughter among them that fled pursue them to the very farthermost borders of their respective territories and in their return make themselves masters of every part of that northern tract but we may further remember that immediately after their signal defeat joshua cutting off all the men that he could come at hamstringing all their horses and destroying all their chariots in which it is likely their chief strength consisted put it wholly out of their power to make any farther defense against him  the only difficulty that can be started therefore against this signal transaction is that such a numerous host as that of the confederates who had with them such multitudes of horse and warlike chariots and could send scouts enough abroad to give them intelligence of what passed should suffer themselves to be surprised by the hebrew chief and what is more amazing by an old threadbare stratagem that had been in use even since abrahams days and had been so lately practiced with success by him in the relief of gibeon and the defeat of the confederate army of canaanites that were then besieging it on all sides was not all this enough to put them upon keeping a better guard around them than usual to avoid the like surprise to this i answer that nothing is more common than for such large armies to trust so far to their numbers strength advantageous situation and the fortifications of their camp as to become quite negligent of this main point we meet with numberless instances of this both in sacred and profane history and some of them of a much more modern date these confederates having formed their several camps in the properest manner and as is most likely surrounded them with their armed chariots perhaps two or three rows deep and posted their vanguards about them might think themselves sufficiently secured from any sudden attack without troubling themselves about any further precautions this was the case we find above  00 years after of the confederate midianites amalekites and their eastern allies whom the sacred historian represents as lying negligently scattered about like locusts when gideon fell suddenly upon them in the night and gave them such a total overthrow that they dared not show their faces against israel for some scores of years after judge vii    and seq  i have already mentioned other instances out of the sacred books and could produce a much greater out of profane historians were it needful  but   dly joshua who was become master of all south canaan might easily put it out of the power of the enemy to receive any intelligence of his approach by causing all the passes and defiles to be closely guarded for as i observed before the battle was fought near the frontiers between north and south canaan though on which side i will not pretend to affirm it was easy therefore to prevent their scouts or even any of his deserters if any such there had been to bring them notice of his march or route so that hearing nothing from any side they might easily imagine that he dared not come to attack them    dly i likewise observed that he usually marched his army in different columns and that not only for the sake of expedition but likewise that he might attack the enemy on different sides it was easy therefore for him to order one corpse to march toward them by the nearest way but somewhat more slowly whilst he ordered the rest of his army to fetch a compass about both on the right and left and by a speedier march to arrive time enough to fall unexpectedly upon them on the flank or rear whilst these attacked them in front which could not fail of throwing them into disorder and confusion let me add that supposing their camp ever so well fortified joshua had still another stratagem to play against them as he had lately done to the inhabitants of ai josh viii   and seq  viz by making a feint attack with one body in order to draw them out of their intrenchments in pursuit of them and then falling suddenly upon them on the flank and rear  by all therefore that has been said upon this memorable transaction you may plainly see that there was nothing done in it but what might have been performed by any other experienced chief in the common martial way of conquest though he had never been favored with such encouragements and assurances of success as god was pleased so frequently to give to joshua and his troops it is therefore no wonder that the sacred writers instead of dwelling on a long detail of the arts and stratagems that were used by the hebrew chiefs choose rather to ascribe the whole glory of all their signal victories and the happy consequences of them to the divine providence that so visibly prospered their arms since it was chiefly owing to their sure trust and confidence in those repeated assurances that they fought so valiantly and successfully against enemies that wholly relied on their number and strength and on the assistance of their imaginary deities and who by their detestable worship of them had not only forfeited all title to the protection of god but had made themselves worthy of his most severe punishments nevertheless it would be absurd to infer from thence that joshua neglected any art or stratagem that could either secure or facilitate the promised conquest for that were an abuse of rather than a reliance on the divine assistance and such as we have no reason to suspect him to have been capable of if therefore those arts and means are not recorded in the text it cannot be supposed to be done with any other view than to intimate to us the small efficacy they must all have had without such a steady reliance on the one side and gods blessing on the other than which nothing could be more proper to keep up their confidence in him and to fill them with the most grateful sense for all the success they had hitherto or should hereafter be blessed with whilst on the other hand instead of arrogating any share of the glory of it they looked upon themselves only as the mere instruments of his providence and executors of his divine will agreeable to this was that extraordinary precaution which he was pleased to take on a like occasion with regard to gideon and his  0000 men when he made him dismiss them all but  00 tried men viz lest they should boast that their own valor or strength had obtained the promised victory judge vii   and seq  where you will permit me to observe once more that though gideon had had all the assurance he could wish for given him of his totally defeating the midianites and their confederates and delivering his people from their yoke yet he does not venture to fall upon them till his reason furnishes him with a stratagem which by injecting a general panic among them would make them become an easier prey to his conquering sword ibid    and seq  and indeed the author of ecclesiasticus and the inspired writer of the epistle to the hebrews would have had little reason to extol joshua gideon and other hebrew worthies ecclus xlvi   and seq hebr xi    and seq  if all their merit had consisted in a blind obedience to gods directions without contributing so much as one single thought or forming one design for the more effectual execution of his orders but that never was the case of those hebrew worthies and the next letter but one will furnish you with a most signal instance of the contrary  but here i am aware of an objection that will hardly fail of being started by your opponents as it has been by many others in the same way of thinking viz that such stratagems for surprising and routing an enemy cannot but appear below the character of those hebrew chiefs and much more so of the divine providence that is said to have directed and prospered them especially considering how despicably all such artifices were looked upon by the romans celtes gauls greeks and other warlike nations some of which were so far from seeking to surprise their enemies that they apprised them of the time and place where they designed to attack them vid int al grot de jur bell and pac l iii c    0 serrar in josh viii calmet ibid  insomuch that alexander the great would say that he had rather complain of his ill fortune than to have cause to blush at his good one by choosing to fall on the enemy in the night q curt lib iv  but notwithstanding all the specious pretenses in favor of those ancient nations it will be no easy matter to prove that such artifices are so dishonorable or below the character of the greatest monarch or general on the contrary it cannot be thought inglorious in them to use all proper means to save the lives of as many of their subjects as they can seeing a victory that is not gained with this advantage may prove too dearly bought and be perhaps as dishonorable and disadvantageous as a defeat joshua in the case before us was to engage with his small flying army of foot an host of confederates as numerous as the sand on the seashore together with a numerous cavalry and armed chariots josh xi   and scq  and all of them fully determined to blot out if possible the very name of israelite from under heaven what could therefore more become his valor and longtried experience or turn more to his glory than contriving the most effectual means to destroy as many as he could of the one and to save all he could of the other or where would his advantage have been if the loss of each of his men had been attended with that of twenty of the enemy at so great a distance from his main camp as to what we are told of the ancient romans and other nations scorning to fight upon such unequal terms or to gain a victory by artifice stratagem or surprise or any other means but by dint of strength and courage it is well if all this was not rather said by way of wiping off the scandal of some signal defeats they had met with from some more vigilant and expert commander than they chanced to have at those times for we are not without frequent instances of their generals having suffered themselves to be overthrown by such kind of surprises and stratagems which might put them under a necessity of using them afterward if it be really true that they did not at first for nothing is more notorious than that in aftertimes they not only put in practice all kinds of stratagems but even of treachery against those brave ancient nations both in and out of italy which they by degrees brought under their yoke vid polyb hist l iv frontin stratagem pass un hist fol vol i and ii pass   vo vol xi xii etc  as to what we are told of alexanders refusing to steal a victory whilst he had none but effeminate persians indians etc to fight with and against whom he was sure to succeed without artifice or stratagem we need not wonder so much that his unbounded ambition of being thought the invincible son of jupiter did not permit him to descend to such low and derogatory arts but how he would have acted against more warlike nations may be easily guessed at seeing all his actions that one case excepted were but one continued series of the most deeply concerted arts and stratagems against the liberties and properties of so many nations over which he had neither title nor claim and that frequently at the expense of his own faithful macedonian troops whose lives he was justly blamed for being as lavish of as our hebrew heroes were careful to preserve those of their own in a word therefore i can see nothing in these martial artifices but what is highly agreeable to the character of the noblest generals or to the justest notions we can conceive of the divine providence whilst they were principally concerted for the preservation of so many lives appointed several centuries before to be the happy possessors of this fertile land and must have been lost by a more equal warfare and at the same time gave thousands of the dismayed canaanites when recovered from their panic an opportunity of consulting their mutual safety by a timely retreat unless resolutely bent upon their own destruction on the other hand the hebrew worthies were hereby allowed such share of the honor as was requisite to give their authority a due weight whilst that of their divine protector was sufficiently secured by the wonderful success which he gave to their councils and to their arms against all those who continued still determined at all events to fight in defense of their old detestable idolatry and to oppose the israelites settling in their country for it is plain from the text that none but such as those perished by joshuas sword either in southern or northern canaan for as soon as he had finished this expedition by the slaughter of as many as he found still in arms in his return to his standing camp he did not fight one battle more but set himself immediately about the dividing of the land by lot among the tribes josh c xii  xvii  rearing the tabernacle ibid xviii   and seq  appointing cities of refuge josh xx xxi  assigning those of the priests and levites ibid and seq  and executing other parts of his office according to the orders given to him by moses ibid ad fin lib  agreeably to which the book of judges which begins with an account of his death and of what followed it plainly tells us that there was no one tribe on this side jordan in which there were not still remaining vast numbers of those canaanites intermixed with them and some of them still powerful enough to keep up a superiority over them judge i pass  and who could they be but those who had fled from joshuas sword during the time of this conquest and afterward taken the opportunity of settling themselves again in their respective territories whilst he and his people were employed in the division of the land and settling all matters relating to their church and state we are told accordingly that after the tribes were gone each to their own lot they tried in vain to dislodge those old inhabitants ibid ver    ad fin  and no wonder they could not seeing instead of destroying all their altars temples and other monuments of idolatry as moses had commanded they by degrees became themselves ensnared by them upon which account god let them know that he would no longer assist them in the driving them out but that they should continue amongst them to be thorns in their sides judge ii   and seq  as they proved accordinly so that upon the whole the sin of the israelites was not so much the sparing of their lives as suffering them to continue in all their old idolatries instead of obligeing them to become proselytes of the true god see before p   0 and seq   essay iv letter v on the war of the eleven tribes against that of benjamin and the almost utter excision of that impious tribe judge xix and seq  dear sir i should have wondered very much if your skeptic neighbors had let so remarkable a transaction pass unquestioned considering the many difficulties it labors under and expected no other than that they would raise a whole battery of objections against it when i was obliged in the last piece i sent you to quote some particulars of it in order to show how strictly the hebrews kept up their martial discipline see before p     and seq  it is indeed surprising to find in israel so soon after joshuas decease authors are not agreed about the time in which this unnatural action happened but most of them place it soon after the death of joshua that is according to archbishop usher between the year of the world      and      which was the year in which othniel was chosen judge over the israelites vid usser in an  during which anarchy that other transaction is supposed to have happened of the danites seizing on the city of laish and carrying thither the ephod and teraphim of micah together with his young hired levite and setting them up in this their new settlement jud xviii pass  where they continued till the captivity of the land as the original has it or more reasonably till the captivity of the ark   samuel iv    and seq  supposing the word  to be a mistake of the transcriber instead of  it being absurd to think that such a flagrant piece of idolatry should have been suffered either during the administration of samuel or the reign of david and other pious kings of judah see un hist   vo vol iii p     q iv   and seq   not only a second sodom but one more degenerate and wicked than that which god had destroyed by fire from heaven genesis xix pass  inasmuch as the brutal indignity was offered not to a stranger but to an israelite and one of the levitic tribe judge xix   and seq    and seq  it is no less strange that a man of his sacred function having found his concubine a concubine in the hebrew sense was not a bare kept mistress but a wife of the second order and differed only from one of the first in the omission of some ceremony attending the marriage of the latter and a contract by which the husband obliged himself to endow her and make the children he had by her to be his heirs whereas the concubine was taken without such a dowry but was entitled to food raiment and the privilege of his bed equally with the wife and her children claimed a portion of his goods according to his circumstances these two ranks were not only allowed by the mosaic law but a man might take as many of either as he could maintain ibid vol iii p   0 f  both ranks were obliged to be faithful to him but in case of infidelity whether the concubine was liable to the same capital punishment that the wives were is not agreed but if found guilty after full proof he was obliged to divorce her for ever from him if not to prosecute her so that it was altogether irregular in the levite to go in search of or to be reconciled to her after such a breach of fidelity false to his bed should after a four months divorce go so far to seek her venture to be reconciled to and take her home again contrary to the law of moses the butcherly method he took to apprise the tribes of her abuse and death judge xix    and seq  is unprecedented and in the account he gives of the unnatural attempt made on him by the inhabitants of gibeah he artfully conceals his thrusting her out to them to save himself from their more brutish lust but what is the most surprising of all is that the whole tribe of benjamin instead of delivering up those miscreants to a condign punishment or rather instead of offering themselves to the other tribes to become their executioners as that vile action reflected the greatest reproach upon themselves should so unanimously resolve at all events to take up arms in defense of that base and unworthy city against the united forces of the other eleven tribes ibid xx    and seq  but here it ought to be remembered that the inspired writer of this strange transaction begins and ends his relation of it with these remarkable words that in those days there was no king in israel but that every man did that which was right in his own eyes judge xix   xxi     to which give me leave to add that in this the benjamites did but too plainly verify the prophecy of their dying father jacob concerning that fierce and untractable tribe genesis xlix     benjamin shall ravin as a wolf or is like a ravenous wolf which falls foul on his prey in the morning and in the evening divides the spoil nor is this the only instance wherein they verified this character witness among others their bloody wars against the house of david in favor of that of saul who was of that tribe vid int al   samuel ii      and seq and alib pass  but in this and the like cases it were unreasonable to draw any inference from the tumultuous and irregular actions of a tribe or people to the lessening of the authority of the writer of any history who ought rather to be admired for the impartiality with which he relates a fact so little to the credit of his nation  the main difficulty therefore which you are concerned to remove with respect to the bloody war of the eleven tribes against that of benjamin is neither the unnatural behavior of the gibeathites to the levite and his concubine nor that of that whole tribe in refusing to surrender those brutish wretches to condign punishment for how strange soever either of them may appear yet is there nothing in it either improbable or inconsistent with the degeneracy of those times and the character of that haughty and untractable tribe neither will there any thing appear extraordinary in that laudable zeal which the other tribes so unanimously expressed on this occasion nor in the resolution they took of punishing those miscreants with the utmost severity when we call to mind how expressly this had been commanded them by god to the utter extirpation of those that should be found guilty of such vile abominations vid deuteronomy xiii    and seq xxiii    levit xviii    xx    and alib pass  and it was on account of that among many other crying sins that the canaanites were doomed to utter destruction which punishment was no less severely denounced against the israelites that should be found guilty of them it would have indeed been more surprising if in a case of this nature they had expressed less warmth and abhorrence than they did not only against the brutish perpetrators of that unnatural deed but much more against the more wicked benjamites for patronizing it instead of showing themselves the most forward in punishing it  the chief difficulty therefore remaining that is really such and that no small one in your opponents eye lies in accounting for the ill success that attended the laudable resolution of the eleven tribes and for their being so shamefully repulsed and with so considerable a loss especially after having consulted the divine oracle about this war and received such an encouraging answer from it as could hardly be interpreted to import less than a promise of a complete victory as a due reward for their zeal whilst to their great mortification and astonishment they see the arms of that impious and untractable tribe crowned with an undeserved victory these are the strong terms in which your opponent couches his objection in which however he seems to overlook two material points amiss in their behavior on this important and extraordinary occasion namely   st however laudable and conformable to the mosaic law their intention might be to punish the impious gibeathites with the utmost severity yet this sudden and unanimous resolution of declaring an offensive war against the whole tribe of benjamin appears plainly enough by all circumstances to have been the effect of their resentment against it for daring to oppose themselves in defense of such miscreants against the whole israelitish congregation rather than the result of a cool sincere and deliberate debate about the most effectual means to extirpate such shameful impieties out of their commonwealth had they given themselves time to think coolly upon it they must have remembered that if it was not permitted to them to declare war even against strangers without consulting the divine oracle that is the high priest by urim much less was it for them not only to resolve but to bind themselves by a solemn oath to engage in one against one of their own tribes and to pursue it with such furious zeal for it is plain however your antagonist may have overlooked it that they never once thought of consulting the divine will or as the inspired writers commonly word it of inquiring of or asking counsel of the lord till the war was unanimously resolved upon and sworn to and then it was not to inquire about the fitness or lawfulness of it for that they took for granted but only which tribe should have the post of honor and the chief command in this hostile expedition that no jarring or dispute about it might obstruct the execution or success of it the other circumstance which your opponent has overlooked is that the divine oracle or as is commonly understood the answer of the high priest by urim only informs them that the preference inquired after is due to the tribe of judah but this answer was not attended with any promise of success judge xx    and seq  which was rather expected by them as a thing of course or as the natural consequence of so picus and laudable an enterprise the cause they so far rightly judged was gods how could they suppose that it would end in their defeat they were superior by far in number to the rebellious tribe how should they then expect any thing but victory in this persuasion and confidence they never inquire whether god will bless them with one but only ask who shall lead them to it and this it was that proved the cause of their first defeat and that justly too as a condign punishment for their presumption in rashly decreeing the excision of a tribe without either consulting gods will about it or trying some previous method of reducing them to reason by more pacific means for this was in fact making themselves judges and executioners in gods cause without his authority advice or consent to this i may add what the jews farther allege against them that they fought his cause with unhallowed or with hands as guilty as those of that rebellious tribe in suffering a new kind of idolatry to be set and kept up amongst them if they were not for the most part infected with it vid judge xviii  0 and seq  and which it was their duty to have extirpated before they presumed to draw their swords in gods cause upon any other occasion this is indeed the more probable because not only the jewish but most other chronologers place the setting up of micahs idol in their new dan much about the same time that this war happened both transactions being distinguished by the sacred historian ibid xvii   xviii   xix   xxi     that they happened when there was no king in israel but every one did what was right in his own eyes in this state therefore of anarchy and apostasy how little reason had they to expect a blessing on a zeal so partial and blind which in all likelihood would have been as cold and unactive against benjamin as against dan had it not been blown up into a fury against the former partly by the then unheard of circumstance of a concubine hewn and dispatched in pieces to the tribes and partly by the more surprising resolution of the benjamites to stand in the defense of the brutish gibeathites and in this case how could they be more effectually brought to a juster way of thinking than by their being suffered to meet with a signal defeat where they expected nothing less than a complete victory accordingly we find that the first discomfiture brings them to their tears and prayers they now begin to consult god not about a general but about the lawfulness of the war and upon their finding it approved by him judge xx    and seq  renew the onset with fresh vigor though with no better success  it will not be amiss here to observe that the phrase here used upon both these consultations of asking counsel of the lord does often mean no more than consulting their grand council or sanhedrin with the high priest at their head and these were the proper judges of all such things and whose sentence was of equal force though not so infallibly sure as if it had been delivered by the divine oracle deuteronomy xvi    and seq xvii    and seq  so that it was no less than a capital crime to refuse to abide by their determination and this is all the inquiry and application which the israelites seem to have made upon this occasion viz they first inquired of this grand council then solemnly assembled who should have the command of the army and upon their being unexpectedly defeated they consulted them about the lawfulness of the war which they now began to fear was displeasing to god since they had succeeded no better on their first onset for as to their consulting the lord in the usual solemn form that is by the urim and before the ark and the high priest it does not appear from the tenor of the text that they thought of it till after their second defeat for then it is plainly said that all the children of israel even all the people went up unto the house of god where they not only fasted and wept until the evening but prefaced their address to him with the usual sacrifice of burnt and peace offerings upon which phinehas the then high priest standing before the ark asked counsel with the usual solemnity in their name saying shall i go once more to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and received this favorable answer from god go up for tomorrow i will deliver them into thy hand judge xx    and seq  as he accordingly did to the almost total extirpation of that rebellious tribe ibid ad fin  upon the whole therefore the two first battles in which israel lost  0000 men may be justly looked upon as their rash and inconsiderate act and deed in which whatever countenance may be supposed to have been given to that enterprise whether by god or by the sanhedrin yet it was still without any promise of success and i may add without any just grounds to hope for it from any thing that might be inferred from the two first answers and much less from their irregular way of proceeding in a matter of that great and universal concern but now that god is not only applied to in a proper way and prevailed upon by the prayers and tears the sacrifices and other acts of humiliation of the whole people to give them a more encouraging promise they renew their hostilities with more caution and regularity benjamin is soon made to pay dearly not only for the lives of the  0000 they had slain on the two former rencounters but likewise for their daring to take up arms in defense of the impious gibeathites whilst the fire consumes the cities and the sword the lives of those rebellious miscreants insomuch that the whole tribe is now reduced to about  00 fugitive desperadoes who went and fortified themselves upon a barren rock judge xx    and seq  and must in all probability have perished there to the utter excision of that whole tribe had not god inspired the rest with returning sentiments of pity toward that small and unfortunate remnant and with a remorse for having so nearly exterminated one of the tribes of israel ibid xxi   and seq   but there was still another and more dangerous effect to be feared from their too rash and precipitate zeal against the benjamites at first viz the general and solemn curse they had pronounced against any one that should give his daughter in marriage to any of that rebellious tribe whilst they had suffered their furious zeal to transport them so far as to destroy all their females so that the sparing of these  00 men could be of little service toward the saving of that tribe from perishing unless they could also find them wives on whom to beget a new offspring in this perplexity they return all to bethel filling the air with their cries about the feet of the ark but come not so much to inquire of god whether the oath they had thus rashly sworn was lawful or no and if the latter whether he would not in mercy forgive and dispense them from it as to expostulate in a kind of tumultuous manner with him for suffering them to bind themselves by it to the endangering the loss of one of their tribes lord god of israel say they why is this come to pass that there should be today a tribe lacking in israel they proceed next to offer new sacrifices and burntofferings and to implore his pity toward the poor remains of that once flourishing tribe but as the text takes no notice of their consulting him in the usual form nor of their receiving any direction from the high priest we may reasonably suppose either that they omitted that circumstance or that god refused to give them any direction how they should act upon that emergency for we meet with some such instances in scripture in which god has thought fit to suspend his answer when thus asked in the usual form and upon perhaps a less provoking occasion than this as he did some time after to saul upon his son jonathans having incurred his curse by tasting of the forbidden honey vid int al   samuel xiv     and this not so much in all probability to show his displeasure for a transgression unwittingly committed as to inspire the people with a deeper sense of his allseeing eye who would not suffer even so small and inconsiderable a fault to pass by uncensured something parallel to this though more aggravated we may reckon the concealed theft of achan for which not only the guilty person but the rest of the people were punished with an unexpected defeat before ai josh vii pass  though altogether ignorant of it till it was discovered to them by the urim whereas in the case before us the israelites could not but be sensible both of the rashness and unlawfulness of the oath which they had taken against benjamin and now the fury of their zeal against them was abated by the great slaughter they had made of them had still less reason to ask or expect an answer from the divine oracle in so plain a case they had infringed on gods prerogative in dooming a whole tribe to utter excision and bound themselves under an heavy curse to become the executioners of his vengeance without consulting his will and pleasure what remained for them now to do but to bewail their own presumption and beg of him to release them from their oath and permit them to raise up again that tribe which they had so inconsiderately doomed to destruction  had they taken this laudable method i doubt not but god would have either absolved them from their oath or directed them to some means how to supply the remaining  00 benjamites with wives without the breach of it whether by dispensing with the obligation of marrying israelitish women or permitting them to seize on them by force and without their parents consent or lastly by naturalizing such a number of their virgin slaves as would have sufficed for their purpose any of which the high priest in being could have authorized in such an emergency without any infringement of the mosaic law as he was supreme judge in all such doubtful cases especially when invested with the urim and thummim see un hist   vo vol iii p  0 and seq and auct ib citat joseph cont apion buxtorf synag and commentar in deuteronomy xix xxi xxiii calmet prooem in number and al   but here the tribes proceeded in a different that is in their old irregular way and taking their oath against benjamin to be absolutely binding and indispensable only sought how to elude it without incurring the curse they had tacked to it and though they bewailed the quantity of blood it had made them shed yet can they not think of any better expedient for evading it than by shedding of more they blame themselves for the great slaughter they had made of that stubborn tribe and yet resolve to destroy those that did not assist them in it and the inhabitants of jabeshgilead being found by the musterrolls to have absented themselves from this bloody war must be all destroyed men women and children in order to save all the virgins they found amongst them and bestow them upon the remaining  00 benjamites but the number of them proving insufficient they have recourse to another stratagem equally elusory and scandalous viz permitting the other  00 that were still unprovided for to fall foul on a company of damsels coming down from shiloh the then place of israelitish worship and forcing them into matrimony without either their own or their parents consent this proceeding your opponent justly blames as who does not but is unwilling to allow it what it really appears to be the result of a rash and precipitate judgment whether of the sanhedrin or only of the heads of the tribes it matters not so long as it does not appear from the text that the pontiff was consulted about it in the usual form or that it was in the least approved much less dictated by the divine oracle as your opponent would willingly insinuate the very words with which the inspired historian concludes the relation viz that in those days there was no king in israel but every one did what was right in his own eyes sufficiently prove the contrary and that their whole proceeding stands condemned by him as displeasing to the divine being for it plainly intimates that this epoch short as it proved was a time of anarchy and confusion wherein the people for want of proper governors to restrain them had run themselves into all kind of licentiousness the idolatrous worship set up by the danites in their new settlement the abominable attempt made by the gibeathites on the traveling levite the unnatural abuse of his concubine and the tumultuous war with all its dire effects that ensued are brought in as pregnant instances of the then reigning corruption and being so little to the credit of the israelitish nation are no less manifest proofs of the sincerity and impartiality of the inspired historian it is therefore in vain that your antagonist pretends to offer some more rational expedients by which the spilling of so much blood might have been prevented instead of those violent ones into which the israelites suffered themselves to be hurried any man of common sense might do the same and yet so unhappy is he in his choice of them that the most considerable one of all he proposes viz that for the saving the gileadites from destruction can by no means be allowed of as being altogether inconsistent with the laws and martial discipline of the israelites he tells you very gravely that these instead of dooming the inhabitants of gilead to utter excision ought only to have obliged them to give all their unmarried females in marriage to the  00 benjamites which they might the more lawfully have done because as they did not appear in arms at the place of rendezvous they could not be affected by the general oath which the rest of the tribes had sworn but here he should have considered that by their not answering the general summons they had according to the martial laws of israel forfeited their lives and incurred the penalty of military execution from which no power could then exempt them there being at this juncture neither king nor judge among them and if he says that the grand council or sanhedrin could have dispensed with the severity of that law which bytheby he will find an hard matter to prove yet it ought to be considered how impolitic such a step must have been and what an encouragement it might have given to the rest to neglect the excellent discipline which moses and joshua had left amongst them and on which considering as i shall show in my next how they were surrounded everywhere with enemies besides those which they were forced still to entertain within their own bowels was the greatest security they could have against any attempt either from within or from without see before p      and a sufficient reason for their observing it with such exactness and severity  i have by this time gone through every thing worth notice in your opponents letter except the small sting which he leaves at the close of it but which neither carries sharpness or poison enough to fright one from handling it he thinks it very surprising on the one hand that phinehas who as highpontiff sat at the helm of and steered the whole sanhedrin should yet be so far wanting either in zeal courage or conduct as not to make use of all his interest and authority with them to suppress all those shameful disorders that then reigned in israel and on the other that if such was his remissness or want of authority upon such an occasion one would reasonably expect that god should as he has often done before and since have interposed his divine power either to inflame his zeal or give a due weight to his authority both over the grand council and over the rest of the people  with respect to the first i shall only observe that phinehas wanted neither zeal nor courage in gods cause had his authority been equal to either there could never such a general apostasy and corruption have crept into the jewish church and commonwealth a person who had even dared to stop a general defection of the whole nation by the death of the two chief offenders and those of the highest rank see number xxv    cannot be justly supposed to have connived at this general apostasy for want of zeal or courage had he been supported as he ought by the secular power but the whole tenor of the book of judges and the frequent apostasies that crept in again and again after the death of any of those chiefs whom god set up for rulers and deliverers of that rebellious nation is but too plain an evidence of the little influence which the jewish pontiffs and the sanhedrin had over them whenever there happened an interregnum or the want of a strenuous judge to give it a due sanction  but here says your opponent the more visible need was there of the divine interposition to give that sanction to their disregarded authority in order to check that general depravity before i answer this last objection give me leave to observe to you and i would advise you to do the same to him how widely and inconsistently men in this way of thinking are apt to argue as best serves their turn at one time you shall hear them exclaim against the probability of gods interposing so wonderfully and so frequently in favor of such a poor inconsiderable nation which most commonly were apt to repay his signal favors with black ingratitude murmurs and downright apostasy at other times as in the case before us they will not scruple to ascribe all those disorders and corruptions to the want of this extraordinary interposition sometimes these divine interpositions are arraigned either as beneath the dignity of the supreme being or as an infringement on the liberty of rational agents and at other times the want of them is urged as an argument against his providence so that unless he will please to rain or shine to act or not act as they think proper they will at all hazards take the liberty of censuring or calling in question what the sacred books relate of him how vastly short was the great mr lock of these fine reasoners in sagacity and modesty who could freely own that he had spent the latter part of his life in the study of them and could never be weary of admiring the great views of those divine oracles and the just relation of each part in which every discovery he made was a new subject of the deepest admiration see cost in vit lock p    but to return to the objection of gods not interposing to suppress the then reigning degeneracy it is not only without foundation but expressly contrary to what the sacred writer affirms who tells us judge ii    and seq  that he sent them an angel or messenger the hebrew word  signifies both an angel and a messenger but most commonly the former when joined with the word  or  as it is here however the generality of the jews take the person here sent to have been phinebas the high priest to whom with respect to his pontifical dignity that title might properly enough be given as we find it is afterward by st john to the bishops of the several churches he directs his epistle to apocal i  0 ii   and seq  but whether he or a real angel the effect does plainly show a divine interposition since nothing less than that could have ever wrought so quick and universal a change or squeezed so great a pienty of tears out of such stony hearts  to reprove them in his name in such strong terms that he brought the whole congregation to their tears from which the place was called bokim or the place of weeping but as this penitent fit proved but shortlived ibid iii   and seq  and they so quickly relapsed into their old apostasy he punished them with a severe servitude under the king of mesopotamia under which they groaned about eight years and upon their fresh application to him for mercy delivered them from it by the hands of othniel the son of caleb who became their first judge eight years after joshuas death see ushers annals sub a m      and the chronology in the margin of our english bible  so that their slavery lasted just as long as their defection and anarchy this was the method by which god had frequently threatened by the mouth of moses and joshua vid deuteronomy xxviii pass josh xxiii      and seq  to punish their defections and according to which we do not read of any one of them but was attended by some suitable severe slavery under some of the nations round about them and these were as infallibly followed by a signal deliverance as soon as their sufferings had brought them to a sense of their guilt and rendered them fit objects of mercy deuteronomy xxx pass  this was gods constant method with them during the whole period of their being governed by judges and such an one whatever your antagonist neighbors may think of it as even an impartial reader must judge highly agreeable to his divine attributes and no less wisely calculated to reduce not only the wavering israelites but likewise their idolatrous neighbors from their vain confidence in their false deities to let them both see and feel how displeasing the abominable rites they used in their worship of them were to him by the extreme severity with which he punished them both upon his own people and them as on the other hand what could be more effectual to invite those heathen nations too naturally allured by the hopes of worldly prosperity to his more pure and reasonable service it must be remembered here that those heathen nations that became tributary to or were permitted to live among the israelites were not obliged to be circumcised and to observe the mosaic law but only to abjure their false deities and idolatrous worship and to observe the precepts of noah mentioned in a former essay see before p      so that they only became proselytes to the original law of nature  than to behold that of the israelites to rise and fall in proportion to their obedience to his laws and their aversion or propensity to all idolatrous worship but this has been i hope so fully and fairly shown in a former essay see before page     and seq  that there is the less need of my dwelling any longer upon it  essay v letter vi on the quick and surprising deliverance of the city of jabesh and the signal overthrow given to the ammonitish army by saul the first monarch of israel in which that generous and noble exploit is displayed in all its amazing circumstances the cavils and objections raised against the possibility and probability fully answered and the feasibility fairly proved by proper observations upon the excellent constitution and martial discipline of the hebrews interspersed with geographical and other explanatory notes on their expeditious manner of raising completing and equipping their numerous armies marching encamping and engaging a sermon penned by the same lay hand in order to be preached by a proper person at the head of a mutinous body of english forces on a very interesting occasion the farther account of which is given immediately after the opening of the text    samuel xi   and seq and the spirit of the lord came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was greatly kindled and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever comes not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent the occasion of this dreadful and unusual summons of the newly chosen hebrew monarch to the ten tribes on this side jordan you will find mentioned at the beginning of the chapter where nahash king of the ammonites a most inveterate enemy to israel is related to have reduced the inhabitants of jabeshgilead on the other side of that river to such streights that they were upon the point of buying their lives at the expense of a most unworthy slavery and to submit to the cruellest and most ignominious conditions of being deprived of their right eyes as an eternal brand of infamy to their whole nation and an effectual means of rendering them utterly useless in war and incapable of regaining their liberty the pretense for this unjust and inhuman behavior of the ammonitish king you may read in the tenth and following chapter of the book of judges where you will find the case between the two nations fairly stated and the ground of the quarrel as fairly exploded by the then valiant hebrew chief jephthah the gileadite but as his reasons could not prevail upon them to recede till he had forced them by the complete victory he soon after gained over them their defeat had so excited their rage ever since that they thought now no revenge bloody enough for their resentment and this it was that made their haughty monarch to refuse the jabeshites any other than those cruel and ignominious terms you have heard so that the most that their submission and distress could obtain from him was a poor truce or rather reprieve of seven days in which space of time if no relief could be procured from the other ten tribes they agreed to submit to their hard fate and it is indeed a wonder that he who breathed nothing but disgrace and ruin against the israelites should yet yield to them this short respite and run the risk of a delay but here the jewish historian tells us antiq l vi c   that the besieged had already sent to implore the assistance of the two tribes and an half on their side of jordan and that none of them dared to stir an hand to their relief so that there being so little likelihood that the other ten on this side which were still at a greater distance should be able to bring them any in so short a time he might in that confidence easily grant them that breathingtime unless we will rather suppose as most likely that the divine providence so far restrained his resentment in order to give the new jewish monarch an opportunity of signalizing this expedition which was in some measure the first essay of his government with such an eminent proof of his fortitude and conduct and to reward his generosity with such suitable success as should inspire his new subjects with a greater regard to and confidence in him  accordingly the sacred historian tells us that saul upon his return from the field and receiving the first news of the jabeshites extreme distress was inspired with a more than human courage whilst the rest of the people could only express their concern by their doleful outcries and that having in a kind of enthusiastic fury hewed a yoke of oxen into small pieces he dispatched them with all speed by proper messengers to all the tribes with the dreadful threat mentioned in the text whosoever comes not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen etc the consequence of which was that the ten tribes immediately gathered themselves with one consent or as the original elegantly expresses it as one man and obeyed his summons with such surprising readiness and speed as to be able to join him at the time and place appointed by him for the general rendezvous though some of the tribes were seated at above an hundred miles distance from it as will be shown to you in due time  as i am called upon by my duty and office to speak to you from this place on this blessed sabbath day you will have the less cause to wonder at my choosing to entertain you on this occasion with this noble and truly generous expedition of the new hebrew monarch and to remind you of the singular blessing that attended it if you will but seriously reflect that you are now called upon and commanded by your king and country to an enterprise no less glorious and pressing the rescuing of a mother city of this realm from falling into the hands of a no less inveterate enemy and some thousands of your brave fellow subjects from the fatal and unavoidable necessity of sacrificing their lives to avoid being reduced to the lowest state of slavery and whose distress and imminent danger though not perhaps quite so urgent as that of the jabeshites in the text yet calls as loudly for all your wonted valor and quickest dispatch for their relief the next thing i would have you consider is how little hopes the late murmuring and discontent not to call it by a worse name which you have expressed during a two or three days long and difficult march made perhaps somewhat more tiresome by the badness of the weather afford us of your meeting with the same success as those brave hebrews did unless you be brought to a better sense of your duty before you come to engage our common enemy and let me add thirdly and lastly that should this prove the happy case and god should so far prosper what i am now going to deliver to you as to inspire and bless you with an equal courage and readiness which those generous hebrews displayed on the like occasion i must not forbear reminding you that you will even then have the less reason to become arrogant and assuming upon it a thing but too common in the like cases seeing should your returning loyalty and valor atchieve what their steady and unshaken one formerly did the effectual deliverance of the city and the total overthrow of the enemy yet your laurels would come still vastly short of theirs and be no less tarnished by the mutinous reluctance you have hitherto shown on this occasion than theirs must have been imbrightened by the surprising cheerfulness and dispatch which they displayed in that since it plainly appears that this exploit great and arduous as it was did not from first to last that is from their receiving readiness first summons to the war to their putting an effectual end to it by the total overthrow of the ammonites take them up above five or at the most six days  but here it may be perhaps objected that this last and mortifying caution i have been giving you might have more properly been deferred till your singular valor and success against the enemy had called for it than insisted upon at this time when you have still a two days long and difficult march to come at them and the greatest part of you seem to have so little stomach to either it will perhaps be thought that instead of damping your zeal and valor by this mortifying caution i ought rather to try to rouse it up by such enlivening examples as are to be met with in the history of the greek roman and other ancient nations and i might indeed here entertain you with a long detail of hannibals arduous and hazardous march through spain and gaul over the alps and pyrenees and forcing his way through mountains of ice and impenetrable rocks to come and attack the enemies of his dear country in the very heart of theirs i might remind you likewise of those surprising and almost incredible journeys shall i call them or not rather flights which caesar is recorded to have taken from rome either to the rhosne or the rhine to quash some dangerous revolt in the birth and in which he himself tells us that he had already reached the enemy before the news of his departure was known in that capital i might also and with no less pleasure expatiate on that glorious and unparalleled retreat which the celebrated xenophon made at the head of his  0000 greeks by a march of above   000 miles through strange and impassable countries harassed and pursued all the way as they were by their implacable enemies from babylon quite to the euxine sea these and many other the like instances of valor and indefatigableness could i produce out of profane history sufficient one would think the least of them to rouse the most dastardly and desponding amongst you to courage and activity on such a critical juncture as this but what impression can i expect such an elaborate display of oratory would make on such a discontented audience as i am speaking to but that of an obstinate unbelief would not most of you be ready to think or even to say that caesar xenophon and other panegyrical retailers of their own heroic deeds do too plainly appear to have had a greater regard to their own glory than to truth to deserve to be credited in every thing they have said would not you likewise be apt to allege in excuse for your want of zeal or courage that the unbounded ambition thirst after glory revenge and other the like motives which hurried an hannibal or a caesar on such arduous and desperate attempts are of too base a nature to be proposed for imitation to a christian army especially on such a juncture as this and after your late mutinous behavior has so plainly convinced me how hardly you are like to be wrought upon by those of a more noble nature the love and defense of your country and the preservation of your religion and liberties  well then so far i hope i shall be acquitted for not attempting to reduce you to your duty from such precarious and exceptionable examples and for confining myself to such only as are to be found in the sacred books and of whose authority you can have no pretense for any such doubts or objections for this reason i have particularly singled out this instance of readiness quick and effectual relief of the distressed jabeshites not only as it bears a visible analogy to the noble enterprise to which you are commanded by your king and country and against which you have showed such an ungenerous and disloyal reluctance but likewise in hopes that the great and almost insurmountable difficulties which the new jewish monarch and his army were forced to overcome in order to effect it in the short space that was allotted to them and the blessing that attended their zealous endeavors and surprising dispatch will at once quell all your murmurings and discontents and by gods assistance inspire you again with the like generous ardour for your distressed fellow subjects and such as may entitle you in some measure to the same glory and success with them for if you duly compare with me the nature of the exploit i am going to set before your eyes the difficulties that accompanied it and the short space that saul had to perform it with the wonderful success that attended it if you consider that he had but five or at most six days to raise a sufficient force against a powerful inveterate and successful enemy out of the ten tribes on this side jordan and to reach the besieged on the other and that he not only appeared there at the head of   0000 armed men before the expiration of the time but that he forecast his matters with such uncommon prudence as to surprise them on the very morning in which they expected the city with all its inhabitants to have been delivered up into their hands and by falling upon them on every side to give them such a total overthrow as put at once an end to that threatening war i say if you duly weigh all these circumstances together you must be forced to own it to be one of the most considerable actions that can be met with in any historian either sacred or profane especially if you add to it that the whole design was conducted by a young monarch who had hardly reigned three months when he went upon this enterprise had been till then conversant only in rural affairs and was still wholly unaccustomed to martial feats and at a time when the hebrews labored under the most grievous and discouraging circumstances as you will hear by andby only give me leave to observe to you here that this transaction great important and surprising as it was is nevertheless transmitted to us here by the inspired penman not in the pompous and swollen language of profane historians but in the plainest and most unaffected style and such as any one would deem much below the dignity of the subject did we not certainly know this to be an excellency peculiar to the sacred penmen and which is not to be met with in any but their inspired writings  i doubt not but most of you have read this singular price of sacred history over and over and yet i much question whether any of you have looked upon it as any other than a plain relation of some notable fact transacted long ago and in which you at this distance are little or not at all concerned beyond the bare knowledge of it and may it not be chiefly owing to the artless and inimitable simplicity with which it is recorded by the sacred historian that you have overlooked the most surprising and remarkable circumstances of it which could not so easily have escaped you had they been introduced with those florid strokes of rhetoric which historians commonly deal in when they want to raise our attention or admiration but if that be the case it is no wonder i must plainly tell you that you read the scriptures to so little purpose and i hope i shall do you no inconsiderable service if what i have to say on this subject proves an inducement to you to make you admire them the more and to peruse them with greater reverence as well as profit for their being thus divested from all artful ornament but that of conciseness and simplicity of style for though this peculiar excellency of theirs has often exposed them to the cavils and ridicule of some bold critics and daring infidels yet it has never failed upon the strictest search and most impartial scrutiny of making their authority appear the more venerable and worthy of our deepest regard a lively instance of which i shall now give you in the surprising exploit mentioned in my text for the further display of which i propose  in the first place to lay before you all the difficulties that attended it and have been or may be objected against the possibility of the fact    dly to show you how those difficulties great and infurmountable as they are represented by some late critics may have been overcome with ease by the jewish monarch by means of the excellent laws and martial discipline then known among the hebrews and by the strict and prudent use he made of them upon that emergency in order to cause his summons to be obeyed with a suitable readiness and dispatch    dly and by way of application i shall not scruple to remind you in the strongest terms not only of the shame and disgrace but the complicated danger to which your disobedience and disloyalty will expose you should you in spite of the bright and encouraging example i am going to set before your eyes still persist in a shameless disregard of your duty to your king and country on so pressing on occasion as this to which you are called    st then i am to lay before you the vast unsurmountable difficulties that attended this expedition of the new hebrew monarch in the timely relief of his distressed subjects for these upon examination will be found to have been such in the eyes of some otherwise learned critics as exceeded all probability or even possibility with regard to their having been ever surmounted in the manner and in the short space of time that the divine historian assures us they were so that some of them have made no scruple to say the relation would have been as much above their belief as it was above their comprehension had it not been transmitted to us by an inspired penman these difficulties therefore i shall for orders sake reduce under the three following heads   the disadvantageous and distracted state which the hebrew commonwealth was in at the breaking out of this ammonitish war   the unlikelihood there is that the ammonitish king should grant the befieged jabeshites even that poor respite of seven days or if he did that he should be so remiss in that martial discipline for which his nation was no less famed than the hebrews as to have no kind of intelligence of saul and his army being in full march against him but suffer himself to be surprised surrounded and cut in pieces by three distinct bodies consisting in all of   0000 men and   the improbability or rather impossibility of readiness raising so vast an army out of the ten tribes on this side jordan and conducting them to the enemys camp in so short a space as five or six days which is the utmost length of time he had to do it in    st as to the disadvantageous and distracted state the hebrews were in at the breaking out of this unexpected war i must observe to you that though the divine providence had signally displayed itself in their favor since the late dreadful overthrow of the philistines by the grievous plagues he sent successively to each of their five cantons during the seven months in which the sacred ark remained amongst them   samuel iv v and seq pass  and more particularly afterward when samuels prayer obtained for them that signal and miraculous victory over the same enemy which enabled them to recover all the fortresses which they had taken from them ibid cap vii pass  yet they were no sooner threatened with this new war than they assembled themselves before that prophet and in an obstinate and tumultuous manner insisted upon being thenceforth governed by a king like other nations by which they not only introduced a new kind of government till then unknown among them which could not be done without creating some disorder and confusion altogether incompatible with their present distressed state but at the same time cast from them that divine assistance which had so manifestly displayed itself in their favor and of which they never stood in greater need than at this juncture   samuel viii   and seq  and though god did indeed vouchsafe to yield to their unreasonable request yet it was in such a manner as gave them little hopes of bettering their condition by their change and accordingly samuel failed not to expose their folly and ingratitude as well as gods resentment in the strongest terms for thus casting off the divine government and protection to put themselves under that of a weak mortal so that when the prophet came to acquaint them with the news of readiness being appointed king over them they conceived such small hopes of him that they began to think themselves in a worse case than they were before and him to be set over them rather for a punishment than a defender he was indeed taller than the rest by the head and shoulder ibid ix    but unless his courage and conduct were equal to his stature it only exposed him the more to the shots of the enemy and what likelihood was there that they should entertain any such hopes of a young man whose education till then had never reached higher than the plough and cart and whose sheepish behavior in hiding himself among his fathers lumber to avoid being introduced to the people   samuel x     showed nothing less than a soul fit to take the reins of government over such a stubborn nation and at such a critical juncture to which if we add that kish his father who must be best acquainted with him could find no better employment for him than to send him in quest of some straggling asses ibid ix    and that he did not exempt him from following his rural business even after he had been declared king by samuel at the head of all the tribes ibid xi    we shall see little reason to suppose that they could expect any greater feats from him either on this or any other emergency than those malcontents did who in a scoffing manner cried out how shall this man save us and refused to pay him the compliments and presents usual on the like occasions   samuel x      if we now look upon the condition the people were in at the breaking out of this war we shall find it to the full as melancholy and unpromising as that of their despised new monarch josephus informs us antiq l vi c   ad fin  that the distressed jabeshites had sent in vain to implore the assistance of the two tribes and half on the other side jordan and that not a soul dared stir hand or foot to their relief and the text tells us that when their messengers reached the city of gibeah the place of readiness residence and acquaiuted the inhabitants with their extreme distress they could only have recourse to their cries   samuel xi    which plainly shows that their hearts were readier to bewail than to assist those poor sufferers who on their part were so far sunk into despondency that instead of resolving to die sword in hand in defense of their liberty they had already engaged themselves to submit to a base and ignominious slavery if they could not obtain some timely assistance from their brethren on this side   samuel xi    how improbable is it therefore how absurd to suppose that the whole hebrew nation desponding and unprepared as they were for such an exploit should agree as one man so the text expresses it ibid ver    to follow such a novice of a monarch to the number of   0000 on so difficult and dangerous an expedition and against a warlike and inveterate enemy who had been for many years premeditating this war and making all the necessary preparations for as well as made already such a confiderable progress in it especially if we add to all this the great distance of some of the ten tribes to the place of rendezvous and the apparent unlikelihood not to say impossibility of their reaching the besiegers camp soon enough to save the city and thus much may suffice for the first kind of difficulties which are objected against the probability of this piece of sacred history from the disadvantageous and distracted state of the hebrew commonwealth at this jun cture    dly the next is drawn from the great unlikelihood that the ammonitish king should grant the reduced jabeshites even so poor a respite as seven days or allowing that he did so that he should be so remiss in his martial discipline and be so void of all intelligence of saul and his great army being in full march against him as to suffer himself to be surprised surrounded and cut in pieces by three such vast bodies as his army consisted of for with relation to the first the ancient hatred between the two nations of ammon and israel which was still more exasperated by the total overthrow which jephthah the hebrew hero gave them about fifty years before makes it but too probable that they undertook this war with a full design of taking a severe revenge on them for that signal victory this cruel contest of the ammonites for the land of gilead is elegantly described by the prophet amos c i ver    and seq by their ripping open the pregnant women or as the original likewise imports and the margin of our bibles translates it their tearing open the mountains of gilead for which that prophet denounces utter destruction against the ammonitish king and his whole kingdom  and the unmerciful terms which nahash their king imposed on the jabeshites make it very unlikely that he should be so easily prevailed upon to suspend his resentment so long as seven days much more that having agreed to grant them that reprieve he should not be more attentive to what was transacting on the other side of the river than to suffer himself to be thus shamefully surprised by the hebrew monarch at the head of so numerous an army this is the second difficulty that is objected against the probability of this expedition as it is related by the sacred historian and to which i shall endeavor to give likewise a sufficient answer in its proper place but    dly the third and last objection is still stronger and is urged not only against the probability but even against the possibility of the fact as it is circumstantiated by the sacred penman it is drawn from the shortness of the time allowed for completing so signal a deliverance compared with the distance of the several places to which readiness dreadful summons were directed the space of time required for such a vast army to be equipped and ready for a march and the length of the way they had to go to reach the place of rendezvous and thence to come at the camp of the besiegers to make this the more plainly to appear it must be observed   st that the besieged city of jabesh could stand at no less distance from gibeah the place of readiness residence than between sixty and seventy of our miles but perhaps considerably more if we add to it the mountainousness of the country the windings and turnings of the roads and the like so that allowing the seven days time to have been granted to the besieged ever so early in the morning their messengers can hardly be supposed to have reached gibeah till the evening of the next day soul therefore could have but five more days to summon the ten tribes to arms some of which especially on the south side were above an hundred miles from gibeah and above an hundred and sixty from bezek the place appointed for the general rendezvous gibeah the birthplace and residence of saul was situate pretty near the center between the north and south borders of dan and beersheba and between six and eight miles north of jerusalem according to josephus eusebius and st jerome from gibeah to bethshean the place where the army was to cross the jordan were about sixty more and bezek the place of rendezvous was situate within two or three miles from bethshean the authors abovementioned take notice of two towns of the name of bezek but place them only within a mile or two from each other so that which of the two soever it was that saul pitched upon for the meeting of his army their distance from bethshean could not be above five or six miles at most and from this last to jabeshgilead may be computed about ten or twelve more for there is no coming at any exactness as to the true distance of those places and it will be sufficient if we can by the most equitable computation we can make from the authors abovequoted and from reland and other moderns explode the pretended impossibility of readiness performing the exploit abovementioned within the time limited by the sacred historian  where nevertheless upon a review of the whole army they were found to amount to  00000 effective men besides  0000 more of the tribe of judah   samuel xi    from bezek they had still four or five miles to bethshean where they were to cross the jordan and from thence about ten or twelve more to reach the ammonitish camp which considering the vastness of the army and the mountainousness of the canton of gilead could hardly take up less than a whole days march more josephus still increases the difficulty by making the hebrew army to have consisted of  00000 men besides  0000 of the of the tribe of judah antiq l vi c    which if true must have still required a much longer time in mustering in crossing the jordan and in marching through the windings and narrow defiles of the mountainous canton of gilead but we see no reason for preferring his authority to that of the text especially as he so often betrays a particular fondness for magnifying every thing that he thinks contributes to the honor of his nation though at the expense of truth and in contradiction to the hebrew text  this being allowed it will follow that readiness summons must have reached the ten tribes and these must have armed and assembled themselves under their respective standards and have reached the place of rendezvous within the short space of four days or even less than that for the text expressly says that they were all got thither soon enough to be reviewed by their monarch which must take some considerable time after which he had still his messengers to send to the besieged jabeshites with the assurance of an effectual relief by the next mornings dawn before he could decamp from bezek to their assistance all these things duly weighed and the distance considered between gibeah from which the summons were dispatched to the remotest tribes both northward and southward most of which could hardly be less than an hundred miles and from these latter to bezek the place to which they were to repair by a march of at least an hundred and forty miles through some deserts craggy mountains long and difficult defiles it must appear absolutely impossible to have been performed in so short a time for allowing readiness messengers to have traveled night and day and with the utmost dispatch no less than a day and an half can be allowed to them to have reached the remotest tribes so that these could have at most but two days and an half more to assemble themselves under their chiefs and to reach the place of rendezvous through so long and difficult a tract of ground who therefore that barely considers what a long while it requires nowadays to raise and fit up an army of  0 or  0000 men among us or even to equip a general to appear at the head of them can ever imagine that so raw and unexperienced a monarch as saul should ever have been able to raise one of almost ten times that number out of so many distant tribes much less to lead them armed capape against so powerful an enemy and with such speed and secrecy as to fall unexpectedly upon them and give them such a signal overthrow as put an effectual end to the threatening war and to all future hostilities from that quarter during his whole reign and to perform all this in a smaller number of days than a much less difficult and important enterprise would have taken up months amongst us that is within the short space of five or at most six days from the time that saul received the news of the siege of jabesh which the text tells us was in the evening as he was returning from his rural affairs   samuel xi    for considering the distance from that city to gibeah it is hardly credible that the messengers could reach it on the same day in which the truce was granted and if on the next then had he no more than five days to raise lead and dispose his numerous host for attacking the enemy  thus far goes the objection of our hypercritics against the possibility of the fact to which i doubt not nevertheless to give such a full answer as will leave no room for doubting of the feasibleness of it when duly weighed with the excellent constitution and martial discipline of the hebrew nation a circumstance with which the objectors seem not to have been fufficiently acquainted or at least not to have paid due attention to but i am under this next general head to remove the two grand difficulties that are raised against the probability of the sacred narrative    dly then in answer to the first of these difficulties drawn from the disadvantageous situation of the hebrew commonwealth at the breaking out of this ammonitish war both with respect to the apparent inability of their new monarch and the despondency of the people on account of their late defection from god might not the severe threats which samuel pronounced against them which we find extorted so humble and pathetic a confession from them of their guilt and ingratitude prove a most effectual spur to that uncommon readiness with which they complied with readiness commands however it will be sufficient here to observe to you in general that the whole affair appears plainly to have been conducted by the divine providence and with the same gracious and constant view of reducing that ungrateful and rebellious people to their obedience to and steady dependence on him from both which they had so shamefully swerved during the latter end of eli their judge and highpriests remiss government and as a due punishment for which he had suffered them to be thus depressed at this time   samuel ii    and seq iii ii and seq iv pass  the book of judges furnishes us with many signal instances of the like nature wherein god was pleased to suffer them to sink into the lowest state of slavery and despondency for their frequent defections and idolatries and afterward to raise them to their pristine freedom and prosperous state by such unlikely and disparate means as might best direct their eyes and hearts to him this we find was the case when he delivered them from their several thraldoms under the conduct of deborah and barack of gideon jephthah and others of their chiefs vid int al jud vii   and seq  and let me add here that as the people never stood in greater need of such a gracious memento than at this time when in the height of all their distress they seem to have so far cast off the divine protection as to put their sole hope and remedy in having a king set over them for their deliverer so nothing could be more proper to reduce them from their misplaced confidence than the giving them such an unpromising one as saul was and then upon the very first emergency to inspire him with such unexpected fortitude and conduct and to crown it with such wonderful and unhoped for success for this could hardly fail of inspiring both king and people with a fresh and surer trust and dependence on god above any human help accordingly you may remember that god had taken care to encourage the new monarch with such a kind of promise from the very beginning by the mouth of his prophet in these words and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shall become another man and let it be when these things are come unto thee that thou do as occasion shall require for god is with thee   samuel x   and    in consequence of which divine assurance it was no doubt that saul on his returning from the field and hearing the outcries of the people on account of the jabeshites felt such an uncommon warmth at their distress as well as resentment against the pusillanimous and desponding gibeathites that he immediately ordered the two bullocks to be hewn in pieces and sent to each tribe with the dreadful summons mentioned in my text whosoever comes not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen the result of which was that they were struck with fear and dread and made so quick a dispatch to join him at the place of rendezvous that they were all got thither from every tribe with one consent a day at least before the expiration of the truce and to the number of   0000 effective men how easily this might be performed is what i shall show under another head in the mean time i cannot but observe to you from what has been said under this as well with respect to the generous and heroic spirit which saul displayed on this pressing occasion and the extraordinary readiness with which the people obeyed his summons as with respect to the wonderful success with which both were crowned that the whole plainly appears to have been the work of the divine providence for as to the first the text expressly affirms that the spirit of god came upon saul and it is hardly to be supposed that any thing but such an extraordinary impulse could have frighted his heartless and desponding subjects into so ready quick and universal compliance with his commands especially as the danger that threatened them was so far off jabesh being on the other side jordan and at a good distance from the greatest part of the tribes and the loss of it not appearing to them of such consequence as to require so quick a dispatch had there been a much greater probability of their succeeding in their attempt to relieve it so that upon the whole it cannot be doubted that god intended by this singular display of his providence to signalize the first warlike essay of his new anointed in such a manner as should inspire his people with a due regard to him and both him and them with a more sure and steadfast reliance on the divine protection as well as a warmer zeal for his religion than they had hitherto shown for it more especially since that shameful and universal degeneracy which the wickedness of elis and samuels sons had caused among them in all this there is nothing but what is exactly uniform and agreeable to the conduct which the divine providence had shown already upon several occasions of the like nature and more particularly in the cases of moses joshua gideon jephthah and other jewish chiefs and what he continued still to show since then in favor of many of their monarchs and this is indeed what the prophet took care to inculcate into them in the strongest terms in that pathetic speech which he made to them soon after the signal overthrow of nahash and his host wherein he assures them that provided they did cast off all their vain and superstitious confidence in their idols and false deities and trust in god alone and abide in his truth they should never fail of his assistance and protection   samuel xii pass and ver  0 and seq  but concludes he in the last verse if ye shall still go on to do wickedly ye shall surely be consumed both ye and your king and thus much may i hope suffice for an answer to the first difficulty    dly i come now to the second which is objected against the probability of the fact viz the unlikelihood there is that nahash who breathed nothing but ignominy and destruction against israel should yet be prevailed upon to grant to the jabeshites even that short reprieve of seven days and much more that having once granted it he should keep so bad a lookout as to be wholly ignorant of what was transacting on the other side jordan and suffer his camp to be surprised and surrounded by saul and his army on the very morning on which he expected the city to be delivered up to him but as surprising and uncommon soever as that oversight may appear we meet with instances enough of it in sacred and profane history and even among modern and warlike nations to confute the pretended improbability of it i shall here only remind you of that signal infatuation of the french general count tallard who when he might easily have opposed the confederate army under the late glorious duke of marlborough from passing the rhine to come at him did yet suffer them to cross that rapid river unmolested alleging that the more should come over to them the more would be either killed or taken the consequence of which egregious oversight you may well remember was the total defeat of the french army at hockstedt the taking of their insolent general prisoner with a prodigious number of other commanding officers of distinction and the saving of the empire from the most impending danger  but were this presumptuous negligence of the ammonitish king even without any parallel yet when duly weighed with all its circumstances it will appear far enough from having any thing that can exceed your belief josephus tells us in few words that nahash had so mean an opinion of the israelites at this juncture that he made no difficulty to comply with the besiegers request and if we look upon the despicable figure which as i observed to you the jews made at this time under their new government and monarch we shall find nothing among them but what might contribute to lull that inveterate enemy into the fatal security in which they so happily surprised him had even saul ever shown himself a man of a more martial disposition yet what likelihood was there that he should raise so powerful an army in so short a time or be in a condition to attack the enemy in their camp before the expiration of so short a truce where is then the wonder that nahash should consent to suspend his cruelty for so little a while when he had no other prospect before him than that of executeing it with greater satisfaction at the end of it whereas might he not have some cause to fear lest an absolute refusal of their request should force the besieged upon some desperate attempt to save their lives and liberty which might cost him the loss of a good number of his troops or at least prove of much worse consequence to him than a seven days respite could all things considered be possibly supposed to do it is hardly credible indeed that the ammonites should be wholly unapprised of the motions of the ten tribes on this side the river but that they should be intended for the relief of the besieged much less that there should be any possibility of their reaching the place time enough to effect it is what never could come into their heads and the most they could apprehend from them was that they were intended to oppose their farther progress it is also no less unreasonable to suppose that so warlike and welldisciplined a nation should be without their piquet their vanguard scouts spies and other martial precautions at that juncture and all these they may have had and yet several unforeseen accidents may have concurred through the policy of the hebrew monarch to render them ineffectual if not perhaps contribute to their indolence and fatal security saul and some of the tribes might take the advantage of their nearness to the place of rendezvous to secure all the passes and defiles leading from jordan to the enemys camp and thereby intercept all kind of intelligence of his approach from reaching them which would of course make them think themselves the more secure upon that very account they might in all likelihood be still more confirmed in it by those very messengers whom saul sent to acquaint the besieged on the night before his arrival with his design of attacking the enemy by the next morning for whilst they were carrying the most comfortable and encouraging news to the besieged they might take that opportunity to spread a contrary report through the besiegers camp and make them believe that neither saul nor any of his tribes on the other side had either power or courage to come to their assistance but that which in all appearance contributed most to lull them asleep was the subtle message which the jabeshites sent to the ammonitish king that having in vain implored the help of their brethren on the other side jordan they had now no other resource left than to march out by the next morning and cast themselves at his mercy for this news being once spread throughout the camp could hardly fail of rendering both guards and sentinels more remiss and negligent  there was still a further stratagem not unusual in those early days which saul might use with success in order to fall upon them unawares viz fetching a compass about instead of taking the nearest way to them which he might the more easily do as he marched his army in several columns this was a method very usual as well as necessary in these mountainous countries where the frequent desiles and narrow passes must otherwise have obstructed the quickness of the march of a whole army considering how numerous they were wont to be in those days and as for that of dividing them into two three or more bodies as occasion required in order to surprise an enemy we find it was practiced even so early as abrahams time and with good success though his whole force we are told consisted only of     of his own servants and in all likelihood about much the same number of those of his two confederates conf genes xiv    and seq and verse      and most probably under the guidance of some of those jabeshites who had been deputed to apprise him with their distress and who must be supposed to have been best acquainted with all the avenues to it as well as with the situation of the enemys camp so that by continuing their march all that night and with as little noise as possible he might with ease come upon them unperceived and unexpected till their surrounding shouts waked them perhaps out of their profound sleep and the succeeding daylight discovered them on every side of their camp and ready to rush upon them with all their might in the confusion which must be reasonably supposed to have reigned through the whole host of the besiegers we may likewise expect that the jabeshites would not fail to make good their promise of coming out to them and falling upon their rear whilst their front and flanks were no less bravely plied by readiness three powerful corpse no wonder then if with all these advantages the hebrews gained so signal and easy a victory and made such a dreadful slaughter among them which the text tells us lasted from sunrising till the heat of the day obliged them to give it over   samuel xi  0 and seq  by which time those that escaped were so effectually scattered that two of them were not left together nothing indeed was more frequent among the hebrews than this politic way of surprising the enemy by their swift marches by which they injected such a panic among them as seldom failed of ending in their total defeat and it was by that very method that joshua the most consummate general of his time won so many signal victories over the united forces of the canaanites witness that celebrated one which he gained over the five confederate kings who had joined their numerous forces against the gibeonites joshua x pass  and that still more surprising one which he gained with his small flying army over the king of hazor and his confederate princes at the waters of merom though their force the text assures us ibid xi   see essay iii p     and seq  consisted of a vast number of chariots and horsemen and foot as numerous as the sand of the sea of all which i have given you a full account in a foregoing letter josephus more distinctly tells us antiq l v c    that it consisted of  00000 foot  0000 horse and  000 chariots of war against which numerous host he marches with the choice of his troops with such swift and long strides that he comes unexpectedly upon them and falling upon them according to custom in three or four distinct bodies gives them a total defeat seizes upon their camp burns all their chariots hamstrings their horses and having totally dispersed those that escaped from the sword becomes by that single action master of a considerable tract of ground and of such a number of fortified cities as would in all likelihood have taken up some years to reduce by regular sieges but to return to readiness victory josephus adds that nabash the ammonitish king was slain and that saul not content with this signal victory and the timely deliverance of jabesh pursued the war against them laid their country waste enriched his army with the spoil and brought back his victorious troops safe to their respective homes antiq l vi c    laden with glory and plunder however that be the ammonites were so humbled by this signal overthrow that we do not read of any farther hostilities between them during the remainder of readiness reign nor indeed till the latter end of that of david when hanun their newly crowned monarch did by an unheard of affront offered to his ambassadors provoke that warlike prince to use them with much greater severity   kings x xi pass  thus far then i hope i have fully removed the two first difficulties which are objected against the probability of this remarkable exploit  i come now to the third and last in which our unbelievers seem to triumph over us with a credat judoeus and is levelled not only against the probability but against the possibility of the fact as related and circumstantiated by the sacred historian that is as you have already heard the shortness of the time in which it is affirmed to have been effected for if we allow that the jabeshites messengers could not reach saul till after the second evening of the truce it will of necessity follow that he had but five days more to send his summons to every part of his kingdom on this side jordan and to get his vast numerous army punctually ready upon the spot at the general rendezvous which considering the length of the way and other obvious difficulties must needs make such a march appear altogether impracticable and so it must needs appear to those who only reflect on the time that it would take up to raise an army of even the tenth part of that bulk among us and to get it ready equipped and fit for action as this was and that an equal number of months would hardly suffice nowadays to fit out one of our generals to appear at the head of it but the hebrews were in this respect under much better regulations and a more excellent discipline and so they had need indeed considering that they were not only surrounded on all sides with such warlike and powerful enemies but likewise intermixed within with a great number of others equally inveterate and ready to join hands with the rest in every hostile attempt against them the ifraelites were encompassed on the north by the syrians on the east by the ammonites and moabites on the south by the edomites and amalekites and on the west most of their coasts were hemmed in by the philistines and the rest lay exposed to invasion from the tyrians sidonians egyptians and other maritime nations all of them ill affected and the far greater part irreconcilable enemies to them and as for the old canaanitish nations who still lived within the bowels of their land and were tributary to them though they were still permitted to have their own kings such as araunah was in the reign of david   samuel xxiv  0 and seq  these i say were still more dangerous enemies than the rest and their history but too plainly shows how watchful they were of all opportunities of retaliating upon them and bringing them under the severest subjection and slavery see josh pass judge i ii and seq pass   is it therefore a wonder that a nation so situate so hated and surrounded by such a variety of warlike enemies should take all proper methods to secure itself as much as possible from being surprised or overpowered by them  but this is not all they had from their first coming out of egypt been inured to an excellent martial discipline under moses who besides his being thoroughly instructed in all the wisdom of egypt had acted all along under the direction of the divine providence so that nothing was more regular and admirable than their method of encamping decamping marching and engaging notwithstanding the whole israelitish host consisted of no less  00000 fighting men that is males between twenty and sixty besides those above and under that age women servants and an innumerable mixture that followed their camp see exodus xii        all of which put together could hardly amount to less than three millions of souls a prodigious host indeed to be led about during forty whole years through such a wilderness and under such frequent difficulties and discouragements by a single person all which could only be owing to that excellent discipline which he had established among them and to the divine interposition and severe punishments inflicted upon them upon every murmuring or rebellious attempt accordingly as soon as they were directed by the supernatural cloud for a new march they had three signals given through the whole camp the first for taking up their tents and packing up their baggage the second for summoning each tribe to appear under their respective standards and chiefs accoutred and armed or to repair to the several other posts assigned to them and the last for moving in such a number of columns as they were directed or as the ground would permit all which was performed with wonderful order and regularity insomuch that this vast unwieldy body has upon some occasions been able to march eighteen or twenty miles in one day before the fiery pillar gave them the signal to encamp at which time they observed the same order and method for repitching their tents which josephus tells us was done with such exactness that it resembled a most regular city composed of as many quarters as there were tribes with spacious streets lanes and all other conveniences whilst the sacred ark was placed under the stately tabernacle in the center of the whole surrounded by regular rows of tents belonging to moses aaron and the rest of the priests and levites and placed at a due distance from the rest of the tribes  this excellent mosaic discipline was no doubt greatly improved afterward and adapted to the exigencies of their present settlement in canaan by their new general joshua a person no less experienced in martial affairs and equally under the divine conduct with his predecessor their dangerous situation among such vigilant and potent enemies challenged his utmost attention to so important a point and had he not been directed by the divine providence yet necessity must have been the mother of invention and put him upon finding out all possible ways and methods of defending himself and people against all surprises as well as public attacks from any side and upon all such emergencies for conveying the alarm through all the tribes at least those on this side jordan in the most expeditious manner  now it is certain that no country was better furnished with wide and commodious roads for the expedition of messengers and travelers than theirs and this owing chiefly to the injunctions given by moses and closely followed by his worthy successor joshua to have all the roads leading not only to the six cities of refuge on each side the jordan for the innocent manslayers to flee to nam xxxv    and seq deuteronomy xix   and seq  but likewise those which led to the fortyeight cities belonging to the priests and levites and which were likewise places of sanctuary number xxxv   and seq maimon and al rabbin de asylis  kept wide level dry and plain with convenient bridges over rivers posts to direct passengers from place to place with all other necessary conveniences to render their traveling as easy and expeditious as possible all which though chiefly contrived for the benefit of those who were obliged to flee to such places of refuge yet equally contributed to the quick dispatch of couriers and messengers when sent from one part of the kingdom to another upon any important business for those cities and sanctuaries being scattered through the whole country and at proper distances from each other made it requisite to have the greater number of those commodious highways in every tribe and these did not a little facilitate the marches of their armies from one part of the kingdom to the other upon all emergencies  they had another convenience likewise for the quick dispatch of their intelligence viz by their dromedaries a creature very common in all those eastern parts and so swiftfooted that they were chiefly used for expedition by the rich and we are told that they commonly traveled  00 miles and some of them   0 miles a day vincent le blancs travels part ii c     and if so then might the jabeshite messengers reach saul at gibeah on the first evening of the truce and this will give him one day more to atchieve their deliverance than the objectors seem willing to allow but all this will still go but a little way toward accounting for the prodigious dispatch he made in sending his threatening summons to all the ten tribes and they in joining him at the general rendezvous unless we can find out some still more expeditious method from their martial discipline for conveying the alarm throughout the kingdom and for the summoned tribes repairing to their respective standards armed and expedited for such a march  as to the first we may reasonably suppose that the alarm or summons for a general armament were conveyed through the kingdom by beacons or fiery signals kindled upon the tops of the hills which considering the mountainousness of the country and the few plains of any length there were in it might easily spread itself through every part of it in the space of a few hours these beacons we find often mentioned in the prophets and were in use not only among the hebrews but among all the ancient nations that were seated in hilly countries of these fiery signals or beacons we find frequent mention in the prophets vid int al isai v    xi  0 and seq xiii   xviii   xxx    xlix    lxii  0 jerem iv   l   li       and alib pass zechar ix     they were placed on some eminences from which they conveyed the alarm to the next with surprising swiftness and where the ground was too flat they supplied that defect by placing them on the tops of some tall trees or masts or on eminent towers which answered the same end we may likewise reasonably suppose them to have been distinguished by some proper difference according to the nature of the notice they were to convey and in order to direct the alarmtrumpets in the lower lands to spread it by their proper and respective sounds of which they had a variety according to the various exigencies for which they were blown for in some cases only two or three tribes were to be summoned to arms as in the case of deborah gideon jephthah etc and in others as in that of all the tribes against the benjamites jud xix    and seq xx   and seq  and in that we are upon the whole nation was to appear in arms they seem likewise from the different names used by the inspired writers to have had another sort probably for the daytime when the fiery ones could not be so easily perceived and these were ensigns differently displayed on those eminences answering in some sort to those used at sea and serving to convey the summons to the low lands with much the same expedition  and being easily perceived at a vast distance from each other especially in the nightime and being moreover distinguished by some well known difference according to the notice or orders they were to convey were immediately answered by the sounds of the trumpets in the valleys below so that not a city or village whether situate on high or low ground could be exempt from the general alarm or ignorant of the design of it either from the nature of the signal or the different sounding of the trumpets in a less space than a night whenever therefore the import of the alarm was for a general armament every man that was able to bear arms being obliged according to their martial discipline to repair with their proper weapons and accoutrements to their respective standards under the severest penalties they had nothing to do but to hasten to their arms and to furnish themselves with two or three days provisions for the mouth which being commonly of the dried kind such as bread parched corn pulse figs raisins dates and the like was speedily got and to join their brethren of the same tribe at the general rendezvous belonging to it here they were first mustered by their respective chiefs or captains of hundreds of thousands and at last by the head of the whole tribe after which they had nothing to do but to wait till the orders came from above when and whither to begin their march thus gibeah being situate about the center of judea or at about an equal distance from dan and beersheba the two extreme boundaries of it north and south it is reasonable to suppose that the alarm had reached both by these expeditious signals long enough before the next morning whilst those that were seated nearer the center were in all likelihood ready for march as soon as they received their orders and route from their king or chief for i take it for granted that these were not dispatched to every city and village of the kingdom which would have required too long a time as well as too great a number of couriers but were communicated only at this general rendezvous of each tribe and this we may suppose was at or near the place of residence of each respective chief of it for this we find was the method which the levite took to acquaint all the tribes with the indignity offered to his concubine at gibeah viz by sending to each of them a piece of her mangled body and to each of these respective assemblies it must reasonably be sup posed to have been that saul dispatched his threatening summons accompanied with the pieces of the hewn oxen this last circumstance seems very much to confirm my last supposition that the orders consequent to the general alarm were not sent to every city town or village but only to such particular places as were appointed for the men of each tribe to repair to their respective chiefs else the two oxen though hewn ever so small could hardly have sufficed them all and much less so if as josephus affirms and the original word seems to countenance his version of it saul only cut off the legs of the oxen and sent them by the messengers antiq l vi c    i may add that the expression which we translate to all the coasts of israel might be more properly rendered to every boundary or perhaps rather to every place fixed and assigned for a boundary between tribe and tribe or that appointed for their general assemblies whether upon civil or military affairs considering therefore the frequent and sudden irruptions they were exposed to from their enemies within and round about them there could not be a more expeditious way found out than for every tribe to repair armed and accoutred to such appointed places of rendezvous upon every alarm for a general armament and there to wait for further orders from above how to act and whither to march  which inspired them with such a general dread and readiness to obey them by this excellent and expeditious way those tribes that were nearest to the residence of their judge or king being the first that received both the alarm and summons to arms could in few hours be equipped and ready to march to the place appointed and there begin to be reviewed or even dispatched upon any necessary expedition whilst the more distant ones were daily arriving in their turns till they amounted to a sufficient number for the designed enterprise allowing therefore the messengers of jabeshgilead to have reached gibeah on the first evening of the truce and the general alarm to have reached both ends of the kingdom in that one night both which i have shown to have been very feasible where i pray you is the impossibility or even improbability that the most distant tribes from bezek the place of rendezvous which were those of judah simeon and dan the farthest of which was not above   0 miles should reach it in the following six days or even in less time considering that they might take the advantage of marching in columns through a country that abounded with highways kept easy and plain for expedition and that they had no other luggage to retard them than their weapons and provisions nor any enemies to obstruct their way or retard their speed  but farther let me observe to you here that if we compare the muster of readiness army upon this occasion with those we find recorded both before and since that time we shall find it to come so far short of them thus we find in the war which the tribes undertook against the benjamites mentioned in the last essay they amounted to  00000 effective men exclusive of that of benjamin jud xx    whereas here saul had but   0000 in a census likewise which david caused to be made of all israel some time before his death the total sum of israel was  00000 and of judah  00000   kings xxiv    so that the  0000 which joined saul were but a small part of what this last tribe must have amounted to had he staid for the rest who it is probable being the most distant of all were not able to reach him time enough with all the speed they could make which in this case was a sufficient excuse  as to give us room to suppose that he did not stay for the coming of those that were the most remote but that finding those that were already arrived by the last day of the truce to be more than sufficient for his purpose he gave immediate orders for marching against the enemy with all speed leaving the rest to come after as soon as they could since they were equally included in the summons and answerable for nonattendance  for i must take leave here to remind you of another piece of their discipline mentioned in a former essay as established among them by moses and joshua viz that every male from twenty to sixty was to be enrolled in his respective tribe and obliged to appear in arms under his respective standard upon every such alarm under the severest penalties unless hindered by sickness lameness or any other lawful impediment what those other impediments and abatements from the rigor of this martial law were the reader may see among other places in deuteronomy xx   and seq  these rolls were so carefully kept not only by the heads of every tribe but by the inferior captains of the hundreds and thousands and called over before and after the engagement that none could absent themselves without being discovered and called to an account for it and this afforded a farther convenience that as there was no danger of their deserting so there was no necessity of their marching in large regular bodies unless it were through an enemys country but in their own they might safely move on toward the rendezvous in the most convenient or expeditious manner as occasion required so they but reached it time enough to answer to their names at the general review let me add that the dreadful catastrophe of the inhabitants of this very city of jabesh who were all put to the sword except about  00 virgins for not having joined the rest of the tribes in the war they waged against that of benjamin two or three centuries before is a plain indication of the severity with which they punished all such defaults so that the very name of jabeshgilead was enough at this time to remind the whole nation of the danger of disobeying readiness pressing commands thus then you see how possible and even easy it was for that monarch to get such a numerous army ready at the place of rendezvous and to lead them against the besiegers time enough before the expiration of the truce which surprising dispatch however was chiefly owing to the excellent laws and military discipline which had been established among them so that by the help of it he was able to accomplish that in five or six days which without it would have been impracticable in so many weeks and in our times in so many months hence therefore you may plainly see it was not without good grounds that i affirmed that the pretended impossibility urged by our critics does wholly proceed from their ignorance of or inattention to this branch of the jewish constitution  i may therefore by this time presume to hope that i have effectually removed every difficulty that can be reasonably raised against the truth of this remarkable and signal transaction however it may justly appear when considered in all its circumstances and surprising success to exceed any that we meet with either in sacred or profane history so that we need not wonder that it should inspire the hebrews with such extraordinary regard for their new monarch that nothing less could now satisfy them than the immediate death of those malcontents who had lately affronted him by their contemptuous language and behavior   samuel xv    and seq xxii    and seq  and had he been as vindictive and resenting as they were now zealous for him he must unavoidably have sullied the glory of that noble victory by such a mean and unworthy piece of revenge but here also saul showed himself no less worthy to reign by the singular and unhoped for moderation he displayed on this occasion as the lord lives said he there shall no man die this day for today the lord has wrought salvation in israel and it was no small addition to his glory that he who could show such a prodigious ardour and eagerness to shed the blood of his enemies should prove himself no less tender in sparing that of his very worst subjects well might they triumph now that they had a king indeed given to them by god and such an one as they might firmly hope would upon all occasions behave as his chosen and worthy vicegerent whether in protecting his own people suppressing their enemies or in the gaining the love of such of his rebellious subjects by his signal benignity whom neither his dignity valor nor conduct could reduce to their duty happy king happy subjects happy in the protection and favor of the divine providence happy in the zeal and harmony which now reigns between them and the pleasing prospect which they have now before them but neither of them did continue long either in this blissful harmony or under the favor of their almighty protector saul grew proud disobedient and cruel   samuel xxi    and was rejected by god and the people returning to their old superstitions and heathenish idolatries became such dastards and errant cowards that upon the very next danger that threatens them instead of obeying his summons and following him against the enemy with the same courage and readiness they had done against the ammonites they only seek to hide themselves in caves and dens in rocks high places and pits or to cross over the jordan into the land of gilead   samuel xiii   and seq  insomuch that when he came to number his small force he found it dwindled to  00 men ibid ver    and seq  and all of them destitute of warlike weapons so evidently were samuels words verified in both that their success and happiness would rise and fall according to the regard they paid to their divine protector  but it is now high time for me to hasten to my last general head wherein i promised to lay before you by way of application both the shame and disgrace and the complicated danger to which your disobedience and disloyalty must inevitably expose you if you should still persist in imitating the cowardly israelites in this last instance of despondency and disregard for the safety of their king and country rather than in that noble and generous eagerness with which they accompanied their prince to the relief of their distressed brethren you may remember that saul had no sooner mustered his numerous army at bezek and seen the surprising readiness with which they had complied with his commands than both he and they drew from it an happy omen and as if they had been divinely inspired or assured of gaining the victory send a positive promise to the jabeshites that they should receive the desired assistance and be delivered from the impending danger by the next rising sun   samuel xi   and    in which they not only proved true prophets but by the divine blessing performed even more than they had promised and perhaps more than they could have hoped for in the total overthrow they gave to the enemy but now alas how different a prospect does your late behavior afford me from that of the brave and generous hebrews i have been entertaining you with we are here met together to beg the divine blessing on an expedition of no less importance to england than the deliverance of the jabeshites was to the israelitish nation and which would yield you no less an harvest of laurels than that did to them and had you bat shown the same generous ardor for the saving of a mother city and with it some thousands of brave loyal fellow subjects from the impending danger of falling into the hands of a no less cruel and inveterate enemy it might have been justly looked upon as an earnest of the divine assistance crowning you with the same success  but oh what shall i say or hope for when i reflect on your late shameful defection little short of a revolt compared with the glowing and generous heat with which those hebrew soldiers underwent greater fatigues and difficulties than any you can complain of to come at the victory on an occasion of much less consequence to their commonwealth than this you are summoned to is to ours jabesh being on the other side jordan might have been lost without endangering any more than the small canton round about it whereas on the saving or losing of this depends for ought we know the honor and safety of our king and country the preservation of our religion liberties and whatever is or ought to be most dearly valued by us our brave english jabeshites are not indeed threatened with so dreadful a brand of infamy as the loss of their right eyes with that of their liberty but will not their valor and unshaken loyalty expose them to as dismal a fate and to all the cruel insults of an enraged enemy and will they not rather choose to die sword in hand in defense of so noble and interesting a cause than to save their lives at the expense of their honor and loyalty and can it be possible that you should with your eyes open or rather judicially blinded suffer so many thousand noble and valuable lives and never more so than at this fatal crisis to be sacrificed to your baseness and treachery to the shame and reproach of the english name what if your commanders have perhaps showed a little less regard to your convenience than to the urgency of the present occasion which calls you to fight pro aris and focis and justly challenges your utmost courage and speed and in which we must consequently be all either actors or traitors either reach the wished for port of victory or be shipwrecked in the ocean of an ignominious slavery could it ever have been thought that so great a part of an english army should grudge a few more long strides to reach the enemy before they can be joined by the strong reinforcement which they only wait for to renew the attack with greater vigor and efficacy and which if once received will infallibly turn the scale on their side and render all our efforts against them more difficult and dangerous if not to end in our total defeat and the ruin of our country you will please to observe that i have all along forborne entering into a strict inquiry into the motives of your present discontent as a matter quite out of my province and which may be more safely referred to those whom providence has set over you and are best acquainted with our present exigencies and the properest means of supplying of them but it behooves me here to take notice to you of a strange saying now current amongst you which is become a kind of watchword and gives one but to much reason to think that some veterans have been the leaders of this rebellious dance i mean that text in job job xii     that wisdom is with the ancients by which you would seem to insinuate as if those few old leaders knew much better what is sit or not sit to be done upon this emergency than those who sit at the helm and have a right to direct and command you but let me tell you this is another of your bungling ways of interpreting the scriptures and that job meant nothing less than what you would extort from him he expected indeed to have found it so and that his three old visitors would have proved much better counselors and comforters than they did but upon finding himself sadly disappointed you may see plainly enough that he scruples not to expose both their boasted wisdom and kindness in such strong terms as they indeed deserved nay you will find if you read on but to the thirtysecond and following chapters how elihu though a much younger and modester person displayed a much higher degree of wisdom and sublimer theology than they all and how severely god himself reproved those three pretenders for their vanity and folly and i doubt not but those ancients who are the fomenters of your present discontent will upon a fuller inquiry be found to be men of the same if not worse leaven wise indeed in their own and your opinion but traitors in their hearts but what i would gladly know is what arguments these old pretenders to superior wisdom could use to draw you into this dangerous and shameful step not surely such as flow from scripture for that plainly tells you that obedience is better than sacrifice and that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft   samuel xv    nor yet from reason for that goes hand in hand with the word of god and both will tell you that anarchy and ruin must be the necessary consequence of all such unnatural defections if not timely suppressed when our all lies at stake as it does now what then could they urge to fascinate and bewitch you into this base disloyalty have they chilled your dastardly hearts with the false pretense of some great disparity between you and the enemy you are to engage at present thanks be to god you are greatly superior to them in number and might be much more so in strength and courage would but your turbulent spirit suffer you to consider what a just cause you are engaged in and what reason there is to hope that we have a just god on our side and you as well as i may well enough remember the times when this very last consideration would have inspired an english host on an occasion like this with such noble ardour that they would have despised much greater difficulties to attack an enemy though in all other respects superior to them the time was i say and you cannot but know when the greatness of the danger fatigues or other obstacles would on such an emergency as you are now called upon have only served to whet their appetite and inflame their hearts with a noble ardor either to conquer or die in so honorable a cause whence then this strange this shameful this illboding change has your old martial genius forsaken you are loyalty to your king the love of your country and zeal for our religion so far extinguished in you by a few days unusual fatigue that you should all appear thus resolutely or rather treacherously bent against complying with the orders of your commanders and acting with the requisite dispatch which alone for aught you know can prevent our present danger from becoming desperate and the loss of our laws and liberties irretrievable how shall we interpret this monstrous behavior this unnatural defection of yours must we take it as a sad omen that god has forgot to be gracious to this once happy isle and that he will no longer protect our religious and civil rights against the avowed enemies of both good heaven preserve us from so ungrateful a despondency god is still able to save us whether by few or many and is never more ready to do so than when called upon in our greatest extremities and should you still obstinately persist in your disobedience or even turn your arms against your native country  but heaven be praised who bids me by your relenting tears and sudden change to hope for better things and to expect a quite contrary behavior from you a behavior worthy of the english blood you boast of and such as will not only wipe off the shame and disgrace of your base murmurings and complaints but yield you in a few days a plentiful harvest of laurels and to the nation a joyful occasion of thanksgiving whilst the remorse for your late defection inspires your hearts with fresh motives of courage and loyalty and with such confidence in god and pity for your distressed fellow subjects as may bring down a blessing from heaven upon our present expedition heaven alone knows what will be the effect of this happy change i perceive in you i may perhaps have given my hopes too great a scope we are naturally apt to do so in things which we most earnestly wish and for that reason am the more willing to submit the event of it to him who alone could so timely work it in you for if it prove sincere and lasting i shall have much greater cause to ascribe it to his grace than to any thing that i did or could have pressed upon the present occasion from that singular and successful example of the generous hebrew monarch and if his goodness should magnify itself still further in our favor and crown this present enterprise with the desired success if the same divine assistance which seems to have thus timely rekindled your wonted valor and courage in your breasts should farther enable you as it did those noble hebrews not only to free your distressed fellow subjects from the impending danger they are in but to give the enemies of our country as total an overthrow as they did to theirs if this i say should prove the happy issue of this expedition i shall have the less to say to you by way of warning since your late misbehaviour and defection duly laid to heart will be the best antidote i can give you against your becoming insolent and arrogant or your ascribing any part of the glory to any but to his divine and allgracious providence  however as there may be still some cause to fear lest this sudden and unhoped for change should not prove so steady and universal as i do heartily wish it to be and lest there should still remain in any of your breasts some bitter root of discontent and murmuring against your superiors i shall conclude this discourse with one consideration more which i earnestly advise you to mind whatever else you may think unworthy your attention with respect to what i have hitherto said and that is that if there be still any such amongst you that have so far hardened themselves against the sword of the spirit by which i have been striving to reduce you to a sense of your duty and loyalty and is the only kind of weapon that our church is allowed to use they will find to their cost and sorrow that the state is entrusted to and thanks be to heaven is still in possession of one of a much harder metal and keener edge and such as will admit of no resistance and this i am bound in duty to remind you of more particularly at this time not only as it is equally granted by god for the punishment of the stubborn and disloyal as for the preservation and defense of the peaceable and liege subject romans xiii   and seq  but likewise as it cannot be made use of to a better and more honorable end than against the base and cowardly betrayers as well as against the open and avowed invaders of ourcivil and religious rights and properties but i must call to mind that you will in a few hours be summoned to march and shall close this discourse as the prophet samuel did to the murmuring israelites   samuel xii     as for me god forbid that i should cease praying and interceding for you and showing you the good and right way your duty to your king and country and the guilt and danger of opposing yourselves against it and may the divine goodness inspire your breasts with such a sense of both that you may all behave on the approaching juncture as becomes englishmen and protestants that our meeting on the next sabbath day may be such as may afford a joyful subject for praise and thanksgiving for the success of this expedition amen  the conclusion thus far sir went this occasional discourse which as i formerly hinted to you had the desired effect on the lower class of the audience to whom it seemed chieny directed though in fact principally levelled against the heads of those malcontents you will excuse me if my fear of hurting some of them who are still alive and i hope in a better mind restrains me from giving you any farther account of the occasion of it than that the underhand promoters of this defection being mostly professed deists and republicans though in other respects men of figure and authority there was an absolute necessity to draw away the inferior officers and soldiers from the implicit confidence they put in them and this it was thought could not be more effectually done considering the shortness of the time than by causing some such rousing discourse as this to be penned and preached to them and at the same time by making choice of some such curious and uncommon topics as might as much as possible engross the attention of those leaders who were men of parts and polite literature in order to prevent their causing any disturbance which might interrupt the preacher from going on  the task of penning it being imposed upon me the urgency of the occasion and the short time given me to perform it soon brought into my mind that noble and signal overthrow which saul the new hebrew king gave to the ammonites a subject upon which i had formerly bestowed some pains and which now appeared to me so suitable to the occasion that i immediately set about and dressed it up in the form method and very words in which you have seen it above excepting only that i have thrown some geographical and other explanatory remarks into notes which in some measure clogged and interrupted the style of the text an inconveniency which could not be so well avoided in a discourse that was to be delivered offhand to an audience as when it is penned to be read at ones leisure however the piece was listened to without interruption and was scarcely finished before the good effect of it appeared in the surprising change it wrought on the malecontent troops as well as in the success that crowned soon after their retrieved loyalty and bravery  i shall take it as a favor if you will let me know in your next how it is relished by your skeptic neighbors after which i shall readily send you my answers to their remaining queries and objections with all the dispatch i am able to make being in the interim  reverend sir yours etc  finis
