gentlemen are now forbid the scenes yet have i rushed through heroes kings and queens resolved in pity to this polished age to drive these balladheroes from the stage  to drive the deer with hound and horn earl percy took his way the child may rue that is unborn the hunting of that day a pretty basis truly for a modern play what shall a scribbling senseless woman dare to your refinements offer such coarse fare is douglas or is percy fired wtth passion ready for love or glory death to dash on fit company for modern stilllife men of fashion such madness will our hearts but slightly graze we have no such frantic nobles now adays heart strings like fiddlestrings vibrate no tone unless they are tuned in perfect unison and youths of yore with ours can never agree  they are in too sharp ours in too flat a key could we believe old stories those strange fellows married for love  could of their wives be jealous  nay constant to em too  and what is worse the vulgar souls thought cuckoldom a curse most wedded pairs had then site purse one mind one bed too  so preposterously kind  from such barbarity thank heaven we are much refined old songs their happiness at home record from home they separate carriages abhorred  one horse served both  my lady rode behind my lord twas death alone could snap their bonds asunder  now tacked so slightly not to snaps the wonder nay death itself could not their hearts divide they mixed their love with monumental pride for cut in stone they still lie side by side but why these gothic ancestors produce why scour their rusty armours what is the use twould not your nicer optics much regale to see us beaux bend under coats of mail should we our limbs with iron doublets bruise good heaven how much courtplaister we should use we wear no armor now  but en our shoes let not with barbarism true taste be blended old vulgar virtues cannot be defended let the dead rest  we living cannot be mended  advertisement the french drama founded on the famous old story of raoul de coucy suggested to the author foam circumstances in the former part of this tragedy  percy a tragedy act i scene a gothic hall enter edric and birtha birtha what may this mean earl douglas has enjoined thee to meet him here in private   edric yes my sister and this injunction i have often received but when he comes big with some painful secret he starts looks wild then drops ambiguous hints frowns hesitates turns pale and says it was nothing then feigns to smile and by his anxious care to prove himself at ease betrays his pain   birtha since my short sojourn here i have marked this earl and though the ties of blood unite us closely i shudder at his haughtiness of temper which not his gentle wife the bright elwina can charm to rest ill are their spirits paired his is the seat of frenzy here is of softness his love is transport here is is trembling duty rage in his soul is as the whirlwind fierce while here is never felt the power of that rude passion  edric perhaps the mighty soul of douglas mourns because inglorious love detains him here while our bold knights beneath the christian standard press to the bulwarks of jerusalem  birtha though every various charm adorns elwina and though the noble douglas doats to madness yet some dark mystery involves their fate the canker grief devours elwinas bloom and on her brow meek resignation sits hopeless yet uncomplaining  edric it is most strange  birtha once not long since she thought herself alone it was then the pentup anguish burst its bounds with broken voice clasped hands and streaming eyes she called upon her father called him cruel and said her duty claimed far other recompense  edric perhaps the absence of the good lord raby who at her nuptials quitted this fair castle resigning it to her may thus afflict her have thou ever questioned her good birtha  birtha often but hitherto in vain and yet she shows me thendearing kindness of a sisters love but if i speak of douglas    edric see he comes it would offend him should he find you here enter douglas how edric and his sister in close conference do they not seem alarmed at my approach and see how suddenly they part now edric exit birtha was this well done or was it like a friend when i desired to meet thee here alone with all the warmth of trusting confidence to lay my bosom naked to thy view and show thee all its weakness was it well to call thy sister here to let her witness thy friends infirmity  perhaps to tell her   edric my lord i nothing know i came to learn   douglas nay then thou do suspect there is something wrong   edric if we were bred from infancy together if i partook in all thy youthful griefs and every joy thou knewst was doubly mine then tell me all the secret of thy soul or have these few short months of separation the only absence we have ever known have these so rent the bands of love asunder that douglas should distrust his edrics truth  douglas my friend i know thee faithful as you are brave and i will trust she  but not now good edric it is past it is gone it is not worth the telling twas wrong to cherish what disturbed my peace i will think of it no more  edric transportihg news i feared some hidden trouble vexed your quiet in secret i have watched    douglas ha watched in secret a spy employed perhaps to note my actions what have i said forgive me thou art noble yet do not press me to disclose my grief for when thou know it i perhaps shall hate thee as much my edric as i hate myself for my suspicions i am ill at ease  edric how will the fair elwina grieve to hear it   douglas hold edric hold  thou have touched the fatal string that wakes me into madness hear me then but let the deadly secret be secured with bars of adamant in thy close breast think of the curse which waits on broken oaths a knight is bound by more than vulgar ties and perjury in thee were doubly damned well then the king of england   edric is expected from distant palestine   douglas forbid it heaven for with him comes    edric ah who   douglas peace peace for see elwinas here retire my edric when next we meet thou shall know all farewell  exit edric now to conceal with care my bosoms anguish and let her beauty chase away my sorrows  yes i would meet her with a face of smiles  but twill not be   enter elwina elwina alas it is ever thus thus ever clouded is his angry brow aside   douglas i were too blessed elwina could i hope you met me here by choice or that your bosom shared the warm transports mine must ever feel at your approach   elwina my lord if i intrude the cause which brings me claims at least forgiveness i sear you are not well and come unbidden except by faithful duty to enquire if happily in my power my little power i have the means to minister relief to your affliction  douglas what unwonted goodness o i were blessed above the lot of man if tenderness not duty brought elwina cold ceremonious and unfeeling duty that wretched substitute for love but know the heart demands a heart nor will be paid with less than what it gives even now elwina the glistening tear stands trembling in your eyes which casttheir mournful sweetnesson the ground as if they feared to raise their beams to mine and read the language of reproachful love  elwina my lord i hoped the thousand daily proofs of my obedience    douglas death to all my hopes heart rending word obedience what is obedience it is fear it is hate it is terror it is aversion it is the cold debt of ostentatious duty paid with insulting caution to remind me how much you tremble to offend a tyrant so terrible as douglas  o elwina  while duty measures the regard it owes with scrupulous precision and nice justice love never reasons but profusely gives gives like a thoughtless prodigal its all and trembles then left it has done too little  elwiha indeed i am most unhappy that my cares and my solicitude to please offend   douglas true tenderness is less solicitous less prudent and more fond thenamourd heart conscious it loves and blessed in being loved reposes on the object it adores and trusts the passion it inspires and feels  thou have not learnt how terrible it is to feed a hopeless flame  but hear elwina thou most obdurate hear me   elwina say mylord for your own lips shall vindicate my ame since at the altar i became your wife can malice charge me with an act a word i ought to blush at have i not still lived as open to the eye of observation as fearless innocence should ever live i call attesting angels to be witness if in my open deed or secret thought my conduct or my heart they have ought discerned which did not emulate their purity  douglas this vindication ever you were accused this warm defense repelling all attacks ever they are made and construing casual words to formal accusations trust me madam shows rather an alarmed and vigilant spirit for ever on the watch to guard its secret than the sweet calm of fearless innocence who talked of guilt who testified suspicion  elwina learn sir that virtue whiletis free from blame is modest lowly meek and unassuming not apt like fearful vice to shield its weakness beneath the studied pomp of boastful phrase which swells to hide the poverty it shelters but when this virtue feels itself suspected insulted set at naught its whiteness stained it then grows proud forgets its humble worth and rates itself above its real value  douglas i did not mean to chide but think o think what pangs must rend this fearful doting heart to see you sink impatient of the grave to feel distracting thought to feel you hate me  elwina what if the slender thread by which i hold this poor precarious being soon must break is it elwinas crime or heavens decree yet i shall meet i trust the king of terrors submissive and resigned without one pang one fond regret at leaving this gay world  douglas yet madam there is one one man adored for whom your sighs will heave your tears will flow for whom this hated world will still be dear for whom you still would live    elwina hold hold my lord what may this mean   douglas ah i have gone too far what have i said  your father sure your father the good lord raby may at least expect one tender sigh   elwina alas my lord i thought the precious incense of a daughters sighs might rise to heaven and not offend its ruler   douglas it is true yet raby is no more beloved since he bestowed his daughters hand on douglas that was a crime the dutiful elwina can never pardon and believe me madam my loves so nice so delicate my honor i am ashamed to owe my happiness to ties which make you wretched exit douglas elwina ah how is this though i have ever found him fierce and rash full of obscure surmises and dark hints till now he never ventured to accuse me yet there is one one man beloved adored for whom your tears will flow  these were his words  and then the wretched subterfuge of raby  how poor the evasion  but my birtha comes enter birtha birtha crossing the portico i met lord douglas disordered were his looks his eyes shot fire he called upon your name with such distraction i seared some sudden evil had befallen you  elwina not sudden no long has the storm been gathering which threatens speedily to burst in ruin on this devoted head  birtha i never beheld your gentle soul so ruffled yet i have marked you while others thought you happiest of the happy blessed with whatever the world calls great or good with all that nature all that fortune gives i have marked you beuding with a weight of sorrow  elwina o i will tell thee all thou could not find an hour a moment in elwinas life when her full heart so longed to ease its burden and pour its sorrows in thy friendly bosom hear then with pity hear my tale of woe and o forgive kind nature filial piety if my presumptuous lips arraign a father yes birtha that beloved that cruel father has doomed me to a life of hopeless anguish to die of grief ever half my days are numbered doomed me to give my trembling hand to douglas twas all i had to give my heart was  percys  birtha what do i hear   elwina my misery not my crime   elwina long since the battle twixt the rival houses of douglas and of percy for whose hate this mighty globes too small a theater one summers morn my father chased the deer on cheviot hills northumbrias fair domain   birtha on that famed spot where first the seuds commenced between the earls  elwina the same during the chase some of my fathers knights received an insult from the lord percys herdsmen churlish foresters unworthy of the gentle blood they served my father proud and jealous of his honor thou know the fiery temper of our barons swore that northumberland had been concerned in this rude outrage nor would hear of peace or reconcilement which the percy offered but bade me hate renounce and banish him o twas a task too hard for all my duty i strove and wept i strove  but still i loved  birtha indeed twas most unjust but say what followed   elwina why should i dwell on the disastrous tale forbid to see me percy soon embarked with our great king against the saracen soon as the jarring kingdoms were at peace earl douglas whom till then i never had seen came to this castle twas my hapless fate to please him  birtha thou can tell what followed but who shall tell the agonies i felt my barbarous father forced me to dissolve the tender vows himself had bid me form  he dragged me trembling dying to the altar i sighed i struggled fainted and  complied  birtha did douglas know a marriage had been once froposd twixt you and percy   elwina if he did he thought like you it was a match of policy nor knew our love surpassed our fathers prudence   birtha should he now find he was the instrument of the lord rabys vengeance   elwina twere most dreadful my father locked this motive in his breast and feigned to have forgot the chase of cheviot some moons have now completed their slow course since my sad marriage  percy still is absent  birtha nor will return before his sovereign comes   elwina talk not of his return this coward heart can know no thought of peace but in his absence how douglas here again some fresh alarm  enter douglas agitated with letters in his hand douglas madam your pardon    elwina what disturbs my lord nothing  disturb i never was more at ease these letters from your father give us notice he will be here tonight  he further adds the kings each hour expected  elwina how the king said you the king   douglas and it is lord rabys pleasure that you among the foremost bid him welcome you must attend the court  elwina must i my lord   douglas now to observe how she receives the news aside   elwina i must not  cannot  by all the tender love you have so often prosessd for poor elwina indulge this one request  o let me stay  douglas enchanting sounds she does not wish to go  aside   elwina the bustling world the pomp which waits on greatness ill suits my humble unambitious soul  then leave me here to tread the safer path of private life here where my peaceful course shall be as silent as the shades around me nor shall one vagrant wish be ever allowed to stray beyond the bounds of raby castle  douglas o music to my ears aside can you resolve to hide those wondrous beauties in the shade which rival kings would cheaply buy with empire can you renounce the pleasures of a court whole roofs refound with minstrelsy and mirth  elwina my lord retirement is a wifes best duty and virtues safest station is retreat  douglas my soul s in transports aside  but can you forego what wins the soul of woman  admiration a world where charms inferior far to yours only presume to shine when you are absent will you not long to meet the public gaze long to eclipse the fair and charm the brave  elwina these are delights in which the mind partakes not   douglas i will try her farther aside  takes her hand and looks steadfastly at her as he speaks but reflect once more when yon shall hear that englands gallant peers fresh from the fields of war and gay with glory all vain with conquest and elate with same when you shall hear these princely youths contend in many a tournament for beautys prize when you shall hear of revelry and masking of mimic combats and of festive halls of lances shivered in the cause of love will you not then repent then wish your fate your happier fate had till that hour reserved you for some plumed conqueror  elwina my fate my lord is now bound up with yours   douglas here let me kneel  yes i will kneel and gaze and weep and wonder thou paragon of goodness  pardon pardon kisses her hand i am convined  i can no longer doubt nor talk nor hear nor reason nor reflect  i must retire and give a loose to joy exit douglas birtha the king returns   elwina and with him percy comes   birtha you needs must go   elwina shall i folicit ruin and pull destruction on me ere its time i who have held it criminal to name him i will not go  i disobey thee douglas but disobey thee to preserve thy honor  end of the first act act ii scene the hall douglas speaking as be enters see that the traitor instantly be feizd and strictly watched let none have access to him o jealousy thou aggregate of woes were there no hell thy torments would create one but yet she may be guiltless  may she must how beautiful she looked pernicious beauty yet innocent as bright seemed the sweet blush that mantled on her cheek but not for me but not for me those breathing roses blow and then she wept  what can i bear her tears well  let her weep  her tears are for another o did they fall for me to dry their streams i would drain the choicest blood that feeds this heart nor think the drops i shed were half so precious he stands in a musing posture enter lord raby raby sure i mistake  am i in raby castle impossible that was the seat of smiles and cheerfulness and joy were household gods i used to scatter pleasures when icame and every servant shared his lords delight but now suspicion and distrust dwell here and discontent maintains a sullen sway where is the smile unfeigned the jovial welcome which cheered the sad beguiled the pilgrims pain and made dependency forget its bonds where is the ancient hospitable hall whose vaultedroof once rung with harmless mirth where every passing stranger was a guest and every guest a friend i fear me much if once our nobles scorn their rural seats their rural greatness and their vassals love freedom and english grandeur are no more  douglas advancing my lord you are welcome  raby sir i trust i am but yet methinks i shall not feel i am welcome till my elwina bless me with her smiles she was not wont with lingering step to meet me or greet my coming with a cold embrace now i extend my longing arms in vain my child my darling does not come to fill them o they were happy days when she would fly to meet me from the camp or from the chase and with her fondness overpay my toils how eager would her tender hands unbrace the ponderous armor from my warworn limbs and pluck the helmet which opposed her kiss  douglas o sweet delights that never must be mine  raby what do i hear  douglas nothing enquire no farther  raby my lord if you respect an old mans peace if ever you doated on my muchloved child as it is most sure you made me think you did then by the pangs which you may one day feel when you like me shall be a fond fond father and tremble for the treasure of your age tell me what this alarming silence means you sigh yet do not speak nay more you hear not your laboring soul turns inward on itself as there were nothing but your own sad thoughts deserved regard does my child live  douglas she does  raby to bless her father  douglas and to curse her husband  raby ah have a care my lord i am not so old   douglas nor i so base that i should tamely bear it nor am i so inured to infamy that i can say without a burning blush she lives to be my curse  raby how is this  douglas i thought the lily opening to the heavens soft dews was not so fragrant and was not so chaste  raby has she proved otherwise i will not believe it who has traduced my sweet my innocent child yet she is too good to scape calumnious tongues i know that slander loves a lofty mark it saw her soar a flight above her fellows and hurled its arrow to her glorious height to reach her heart and bring her to the ground  douglas had the rash tongue of slander so prefumd my vengeance had not been of that slow sort to need a prompter nor should any arm no not a fathers dare dispute with mine the privilege to die in her defense none dares accuse elwina but   raby but who  douglas but douglas  raby puts his hand to his sword you  o spare my ages weakness you do not know what it is to be a father you do not know or you would pity me the thousand tender throbs the nameless feelings the dread to ask and yet the wish to know when we adore and fear but wherefore fear does not the blood of raby fill her veins  douglas percy  know thou that name  raby how what of percy  douglas he loves elwina and my curses on him he is beloved again  raby i am on the rack  douglas not the two theban brothers bore each other such deep such deadly hate as i and percy  raby but tell me of my child  douglas no minding him as i and percy when at the marriage rites o rites accursed i seized her trembling hand she started back cold horror thrilled her veins her tears flowed fast fool that i was i thought twas maiden fear dull doting ignorance beneath those terrors hatred for me and love for percy lurked  raby what proof of guilt is this  douglas ever since our marriage our days have still been cold and joyless all painful restraint and hatred ill disguised her sole return for all my waste of fondness this very morn i told her twas your will she should repair to court with all those graces which first subdued my soul and still enslave it she begged to stay behind in raby castle for courts and cities had no charms for her curse my blind love i was again ensnared and doated on the sweetness which deceived me just at the hour she thought i should be absent for chance could never have timed their guilt so well arrived young harcourt one of percys knights strictly enjoined to speak to none but her i seized the miscreant hitherto he is silent but tortures soon shall force him to confess  raby percy is absent  they have never met  douglas at what a feeble hold you grasp for succor will it content me that her persons pure no if her alien heart doats on another she is unchaste were not that other percy let vulgar spirits basely wait for proof she loves another  it is enough for douglas  raby be patient  douglas be a tame convenient husband and meanly wait for circumstantial guilt no  i am nice as the first caesar was and start at bare suspicion going raby holding him douglas hear me thou have named a roman husband if she is false i mean to prove myself a roman father exit douglas this marriage was my work and thus i am punished  enter elwina elwina where is my father let me fly to meet him o let me clasp his venerable knees and die of joy in his beloved embrace  raby avoiding her embrace elwina  elwina and is that all so cold  raby sternly elwina  elwina then i am undone indeed how stern his looks i will not be repulsed i am your child the child of that dear mother you adored you shall not throw me off i will grow here and like the patriarch wrestle for a blessing  raby holding her from him before i take thee in these aged arms press thee with transport to this beating heart and give a loose to all a parents fondness answer and see thou answer me as truly as if the dread enquiry came from heaven  does no interior sense of guilt confound thee can thou lay all thy naked soul before me can thy unconscious eye encounter mine can thou endure the probe and never shrink can thy firm hand meet mine and never tremble art thou prepared to meet the rigid judge or to embrace the fond the melting father  elwina mysterious heaven to what am i reserved  raby should some rash man regardless of thy same and in defiance of thy marriage vows presume to plead a guilty passion for thee what would thou do  elwina what honor bids me do  raby come to my arms they embrace elwina my father  raby yes elwina thou art my child  thy mothers perfect image  elwina forgive these tears of mingled joy and doubt for why that question who should seek to please the desolate elwina  raby but if any should so presume can thou resolve to hate him whatever his name whatever his pride of blood whatever his former arrogant pretensions  elwina ha  raby do thou falter have a care elwina  elwina sir do not fear me am i not your daughter  raby thou have a higher claim upon thy honor thou art earl douglas wife  elwina weeps i am indeed  raby unhappy douglas  elwina has he then complained has he presumed to sully my white fame  raby he knows that percy   elwina was my destined husband by your own promise mine a fathers promise and by a tie more strong more sacred still mine by the fast firm bond of mutual love  raby now by my fears thy husband told me truth  elwina if he has told thee that thy only child was forced a helpless victim to the altar torn from his arms who had her virgin heart and forced to make false vows to one she hated then i confess that he has told thee truth  raby her words are barbed arrows in my heart but it is too late aside thou have appointed harcourt to see thee here by stealth in douglas absence  elwina no by my life nor knew i till this moment that harcourt was returned was it for this i taught my heart to struggle with its feelings was it for this i bore my wrongs in silence when the fond ties of early love were broken did my weak soul break out in fond complaints did i reproach thee did i call thee cruel no  i endured it all and wearied heaven to bless the father who destroyed my peace  enter messenger messenger my lord a knight sir hubert as i think but newly landed from the holy wars entreats admittance  raby let the warrior enter exit messenger all private interests sink at his approach all selfish cares be for a moment banished i have now no child no kindred but my country  elwina weak heart be still for what have thou to fear  enter sir hubert raby welcome thou gallant knight sir hubert welcome welcome to raby castle  in one word

was i too old for this crusade i think it would have made me young again could i like thee have seen the hated crescent yield to the christian cross  how now elwina what cold at news which might awake the dead if there is a drop in thy degenerate veins that glows not now thou art not rabys daughter it is religions cause the cause of heaven  elwina when policy assumes religions name and wears the sanctimonious garb of faith only to color fraud and license murder war then is tenfold guilt  raby blaspheming girl  elwina it is not the crosier nor the pontiffs robe the saintly look nor elevated eye nor palestine destroyed nor jordans banks deluged with blood of slaughtered infidels no nor the extinction of the eastern world nor all the mad pernicious bigot rage of your crusades can bribe that power who sees the motive with the act o blind to think that cruel war can please the prince of peace he who erects his altar in the heart abhors the sacrifice of human blood and all the false devotion of that zeal which massacres the world he died to save  raby o impious rage if thou would shun my curse no more i charge thee  tell me good sir hubert say have our arms achieved this glorious deed i fear to ask without much christian bloodshed  elwina now heaven support me aside sir hubert hubert my good lord of raby imperfect is the sum of human glory would i could tell thee that the

clifford walsingham and gray sir harry hastings and the valiant pembroke all men of choicest note  raby o that my name had been enrolled in such a list of heroes if i was too infirm to serve my country i might have proved my love by dying for her  elwina were there no more  sir hubert but few of noble blood but the brave youth who gained the palm of glory the flower of knighthood and the plume of war who bore his banner foremost in the field yet conquered more by mercy than the sword was percy  elwina then he lives aside raby did he did percy o gallant boy then i am thy foe no more

now indulge a dearer joy talk of a richer gift of mercys hand a gift so precious to my doting heart that life preserved is but a second blessing o hubert let my soul indulge its softness the hour the spot is sacred to elwina this was her favorite walk i well remember for who forgets that loves as i have loved twas in that very bower she gave this scarf wrought by the hand of love she bound it on and smiling cried whatever befall us percy be this the sacred pledge of faith between us i knelt and swore called every power to witness no time nor circumstance should force it from me but i would lose my life and that together here i repeat my vow  sir hubert is this the man beneath whose single arm an host was crushed he at whose name the saracen turned pale and when he fell victorious armies wept and mourned a conquest they had bought so dear how has he changed the trumpets martial note and all the stirring clangor of the war for the soft melting of the lovers lute why are thine eyes still bent upon the bower  percy o hubert hubert to a soul enamored there is a sort of local sympathy which when we view the seenes of early passion paints the bright image of the object loved in stronger colors than remoter scenes could ever pant it realizes shade dresses it up in all the charms it wore talks to it nearer frames its answers kinder gives form to fancy and embodies thought  sir hubert i should not be believed in percys camp if i should tell them that their gallant leader the thunder of the war the bold northumberland renouncing mars dissolved in amorous wishes loiterd in shades and pined in rosy bowers to catch a transient glance of two bright eyes  percy enough of conquest and enough of war ambitions cloyed  the heart resumes its rights when englands king and englands good required this arm not idly the keen falchion brandished enough  for vaunting misbecomes a soldier i live i am returned  am near elwina see thou those turrets yes that castle holds her but wherefore tell thee this for thou have seen her how looked what said she did she hear the tale of my imagined death without emotion  sir hubert percy thou have seen the muskrose newly blown disclose its bashful beauties to the sun till an unfriendly chilling storm descended crushed all its blushing glories in their prime bowed its fair head and blasted all its sweetness so drooped the maid beneath the cruel weight of my sad tale  percy so tender and so true  sir hubert i left her fainting in her fathers arms the dying flower yet hanging on the tree even raby melted at the news i brought and envied thee thy glory  percy then i am blessed his hate subdued i have nothing more to fear  sir hubert my embassy dispatched i left the castle nor spoke to any of lord rabys household for fear the king should chide the tardiness of my return my joy to find you living you have already heard  percy but where is harcourt ever this he should have seen her told her all how i survived returned and how i love i tremble at the near approach of bliss and scarcely can sustain the joy which waits me  sir hubert grant heaven the fairone prove but half so true  percy o she is truth itself  sir hubert she may be changed spite of her tears her fainting and alarms i know the sex know them as nature made em not such as lovers wish and poets feign  percy to doubt her virtue were suspecting heaven twere little less than infidelity and yet i tremble why does terror shake these firmstrung nerves but twill be ever thus when fate prepares us more than mortal bliss and gives us only human strength to bear it  sir hubert what beam of brightness breaks through yonder gloom  percy hubert  she comes by all my hopes she comes it is she  the blissful vision is elwina but ah what mean those tears  she weeps for me o transport  go  i will listen unobserved  and for a moment taste the precious joy the banquet of a tear which falls for love exit sir hubert percy goes into the bower enter elwina elwina shall i not weep and have i then no cause if i could break the eternal bands of death and wrench the scepter from his iron grasp if i could bid the yawning sepulcher restore to life its long committed dust if i could teach the slaughtring hand of war to give me back my dear my murdered percy then i indeed might once more cease to weep  percy comes out of the bower percy then cease for percy lives  elwina protest me heaven  percy o joy unspeakable my life my love end of my toils and crown of all my cares kind as consenting peace as conquest bright dearer than arms and lovelier than renown  elwina it is his voice  it is it is my percy and do thou live  percy i never lived till now  elwina and did my sighs and did my sorrows reach thee and art thou come at last to dry my tears how did thou escape the fury of the foe  percy thy guardian genius hovered over the field and turned the hostile spear from percys breast left thy fair image should be wounded there but harcourt should have told thee all my fate how i survived   elwina alas i have not seen him oh i have suffered much  percy of that no more for every minute of our future lives shall be so bless d that we will learn to wonder how we could ever think we were unhappy  elwina percy  i cannot speak  percy those tears how eloquent i would not change this motlionless mute joy for the sweet strains of angels i look down with pity on the rest of human kind however great may be their same of happiness and think their niggard fate has given them nothing not giving thee or granting some small blessing denies them my capacity to feel it  elwina alas what mean you  percy can i speak my meaning it is of such magnitude that words would wrong it but surely my elwinas faithful bosom should beat in kind responses of delight and feel but never question what i mean  elwina hold hold my heart thou have much more to suffer  percy let the slow form and tedious ceremony wait on the splendid victims of ambition love stays for none of these thy fathers softened he will forget the fatal cheviot chase raby is brave and i have served my country i would not boast it was for thee i conquered then come my

waste of ruin married to douglas by my wrongs i like it it is perfidy complete it is finished falsehood it is adding fresh perdition to the sin and filling up the measure of offense  elwina oh twas my fathers deed he made his child an instrument of vengeance on thy head he wept and threatened soothed me and commanded  percy and you complied most duteously complied  elwina i could withstand his fury

and body part and thus but oh with far less agony the poor departing wretch still grasps at being thus clings to life thus dreads the dark unknown thus struggles to the last to keep his hold and when the dire convulsive groan of death dislodges the sad spirit  thus it stays and fondly hovers over the form it loved once and no more  farewell farewell  elwina for ever they look at each other for some time then exit percy after a pause it is past  the conflicts past retire my birtha i would address me to the throne of grace  birtha may heaven restore that peace thy bosom wants exit birtha

sword  percy now you are a noble foe and in the field of honor i will meet thee as knight encountering knight  elwina stay percy stay strike at the wretched cause of all strike here here sheathe thy thirsty sword but spare my husband  douglas turn madam and address those vows to me to spare the precious life of him you love even now you triumph in the death of douglas now your loose fancy kindles
