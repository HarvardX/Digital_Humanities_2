hints to a schoolmaster addressed to the revd dr turnbull  by stephen duck  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane and r dodsley in pall mall mddcxli price sixpence  hints to a schoolmaster i should you my friend employ your time in teaching tuneful pope to rhyme and harmonize his style or should our poet cease to write and teach brave vernon how to fight the wondering world would smile ii not less absurd may i be thought who bred from colleges remote in honest simple truth never studied science at the schools and yet presume to give you rules for educating youth iii yet if the maxims i advance may be of use or right by chance they cannot give offense forgive me then for reasons sake for reason dictates what i speak and says it is common sense iv a man of moderate skill may teach his pupils all the parts of speech perhaps old homers songs but there are other things my friend important things that far transcend this wondrous gift of tongues v o skilled in all the various parts of learning and the liberal arts that polish human kind early instruct your tender youth in heavens unerring law of truth engrave it on their mind vi ere vice the spotless paper foul imprint the volume of the soul with virtues noble mark the mark extending by degrees shall grow like letters carved on trees that widen with the bark vii as virtue shall her charms display charms which increasing every day shall make her more approved your pupils shall adore the dame shall court her with a lovers flame as worthiest to be loved viii to make her beauty more complete the handmaid sciences shall wait around her day and night to polish and adorn the fair to make her pleasing charms appear in more conspicuous light ix be virtue then their chief regard for virtue is her own reward were there no other given let nothing mean their souls entice teach them to tremble more at vice than at the bolts of heaven x for conscious merit is a meed that amply crowns each honest deed with joy of acting well while conscious guilt allows no rest but stings and burns the villains breast worse than the flames of hell xi a sense of honor and of shame will best your erring youth reclaim whenever they give offense by gentle methods guide your school nor follow busbys bloody rule to flog them into sense xii no be not rigid stern and sour display your mercy more than power and imitate your god for tyrants cannot be approved they may be feared but never loved who daily use the rod xiii teach them a reasonable awe of true religion as by law established in the land yet never puzzle truth with lies but leave all heavenly mysteries for heaven to understand xiv avoid the rock where thousands split on purpose to display their wit or folly to expose where he who wrangles best confutes and with rash eloquence disputes of what he nothing knows xv beware your pupils tender age imbibe no superstitious rage which fools religion call such narrow principles remove inculcate universal love and charity to all xvi bid them assert their countrys cause teach them our government and laws all servile precepts shun such as contrived by holy knaves persuade us subjects are but slaves and all were made for one xvii the law of nature alluding to the law of nature and nations lately published by dr turnbull let them know instruct their bosoms how to glow and pant for honest fame make it their business and delight to vindicate the native right which freeborn britons claim xviii yet shun the furious zeal of such who act the patriot overmuch and monarchy invade who mindless of their laws at home would copy those of greece and rome where commonwealthsmen swayed xix where civil wars were often waged where mad ambition hotly raged while public spirit cooled where tyrants now usurped command where now a senate swayed the land and now a rabble ruled xx where wanting pilots at the helm to guide and moderate the realm the bark of state was tossed by waves of faction toandfro sometimes too high sometimes too low and frequently was lost xxi our fathers wisely dared to raise their fabric on the triple base of commons lords and king and hence britannias happy fate hence all the music of our state hence all our blessings spring xxii we see a monarch grace the throne who makes our happiness his own our property defends maintains in spite of party hate the wellpoisd balance of the state on which our bliss depends xxiii let him be cheerfully obeyed instruct your pupils how to aid their king with loyal care that all may some assistance yield for council these and those to wield the thunder of the war xxiv so shall your school increase each day and flourish like the verdant bay or branching vine in spring your youth be virtuously inclined be real patriots of mankind and loyal to their king xxv but whither would my thoughts aspire rash daring muse resign the lyre for shame be not so bold nor useless hints to him impart who knows so well to cast the heart in virtues genuine
