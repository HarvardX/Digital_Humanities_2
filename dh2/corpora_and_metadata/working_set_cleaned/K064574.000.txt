a sixth discourse on the miracles of our savior in view of the present controversy between infidels and apostates  jamque opus exegi  by tho woolston b d sometime fellow of sidneycollege in cambridge  london printed for the author and sold by him next door to the star in aldermanbury and by the booksellers of london and westminster      price one shilling  to the right reverend father in god john lord bishop of oxford my lord when the following discourse was finished and ready for the press i considered to what bishop the dedication of it would be most acceptable for i am resolved that none but bishops as yet shall have the honor of my dedications and i had not long pondered upon the matter before i hit upon your lordship who must needs be pleased with this discourse because of the advantage that you as well as myself in the end will reap by it  by virtue of your professorship at oxford you my lord are a moderator at theological disputations as i am here and whether the execution of your office be as troublesome as mine is i know not but if the design of this discourse take place we shall find that modern controversies about religion are all vain and thereupon be both of us soon eased of the trouble of our moderations at them  it may be my lord you are not so weary of your moderatorship as i am besides that you are better paid for your pains your disputants are more amicable and in the midst of their disputes more tractable tho they may warmly contend at the present for and against the point in debate yet like lawyers who are no less zealous for their clients in the day they commonly agree to drink a bottle together at night and go to bed good friends and this is very well done of them  but my disputants my lord called infidels and apostates at whose controversy i have the trouble by the appointment of the fathers to preside are more stubborn turbulent and refractory what ill treatment they would give each other if it was in their power i know not but my apostates since they cannot be avenged on their adversarys are full of resentment against their moderator because i am not altogether partial to their side and how i shall escape their indignation god alone knows  whatever the clergy my lord whom i dignify with the title of apostates may think i look upon myself as a notable moderator of the controversy i have shown them all the favor i can in it and would have brought them off with honor but for a little flaw here discovered in the foundation of their church which for the determination of our disputes must be confefsd and granted  if your lordship upon reading this discourse should be of the same mind with me i beg of you to stroke the clergy into temper patience and compliance tell them they have been long orthodox and glorious victors over infidels and that it would be now an act of generosity to yield to them in a small point upon which such a pacification would ensue as nothing hereafter would be able to dissolve  but i have another favor my lord here to crave of you that you woud be pleased to persuade my old friend the bishop of london to stay at home this lent and keep to his prayers and fasting for the casting out a certain kind of  that by fits he is unhappily troubled with or upon the ublication of this discourse i shall be in danger of being soon knppd for it  if your lordship will do me that favor then i will do you as good a turn and praise you for your doctrine of passive obedience preached at the coronation tho many may laugh at your revival of that doctrine saying the clergy upon an occasion which our most excellent sovereign will never give them would again have recourse to their reserves and distinctions yet i say it was well done of your lordship to preach it that the tongues and the hands to say nothing of the hearts of the clergy might go together in subscriptions to articles and homilys and so avoid that prevarication and inconsistency which some now have no more wit than to charge them with  so not questioning your lordships approbation of this discourse and the dedication nor doubting but you will make me as bountiful a recompense for it as any of my other episcopal patrons have done i subscribe my self  feb   th       my lord the admirer of your passive obedience sermon thomas woolston  a sixth discourse on the miracles of our savior etc here goes my sixth and last discourse on jesuss miracles the subject whereof is the literal story of his own resurrection which according to the proposition in hand i am to show to consist of absurditys improbabilitys and incredibilitys and i hope our bishops will quietly permit the publication of this discourse especially if i assure them that i mean nothing worse by it than to make way for the understanding what the fathers write of the mystical resurrection of jesus out of the grave of the letter of the law and the prophets of which mystical resurrection of our spiritual jesus the evangelical story of the resurrection of a carnal christ is but mere type and shadow  i am so far from designing any service to infidelity by this discourse that i aim at the accomplishment of some of st johns apocalyptical visions the fathers say that a church built on the letter of the scriptures particularly on the letter of jesuss miracles is babylon and that antiliteral arguments and mystical interpretations will be the downfall of her whether there is any truth in this opinion of the fathers i am minded to make the experiment and tho i should bring the old house of the church over my head and be crushed to pieces in its ruins i cannot forbear it but however i would advise the clergy to make haste and come out of babylon for fear of the worst or they who upon the authority of the fathers are the merchants of babylon will weep revelations chapter xviii    and mourn upon her fall because none will buy their merchandise of the letter any more dear jesu that such a student as i am in the revelations of st john and an interpreter of them too upon the authority of the fathers should be charged with blasphemy and infidelity  so to work i went and i had not been long musing by myself how to sap this foundation of the church before i was sensible of my own insufficiency for it whereupon i sent to my old friend the jewish rabbi for his thoughts on this grand miracle of jesuss resurrection which he gave me some promise of but i desired him to forbear all ludicrousness satire and banter for fear of offense for tho our clergy liked volumes of jests and facetiousness if they were discharged against jews turks and infidels yet when they were levelled at ministers of the letter the case was altered as quoth plowden and they were not to be born with therefore he was to remember that decency seriousness and calmness of argument required by the bishop of london in his pastoral letter p    or i durst not print it  in compliance with my desires he sent me the following letter which having purged it of a few puns and cunundrums because all appearance of wit as of evil was to be abstained from i here publish and it runs thus  sir according to your request i here send you my thoughts on jesuss resurrection in which i shall be shorter than i would be because of the customary bounds of your discourse  the controversy between us jews and you christians about the messiah has hitherto been of a diffusive nature but as the subject of this is the resurrection of your jesus so by my consent well now reduce the controversy to a narrow compass and let it turn entirely on this grand miracle and article of your faith if your divines can prove jesuss resurrection against the following objections then i will acknowledge him to be the messiab and will turn chtistian otherwise he must still pass with us for an impostor and false prophet  i have often lamented the loss of such writings which our ancestors unquestionably dispersed against jesus because of the clar fight they would give us into the cheat and imposture of his religion but i rejoice and thank god there is little or no want of them to the point in hand for i had not long meditated on the story of jesuss resurrection as your evangelists have related it but i plainly discerned it to be the most notorious and monstrous imposture that ever was put upon mankind and if you please to attend to my following arguments which require no depth of judgment and capacity to apprehend i am persuaded that you and every one disinterested will be of the same mind too  to overthrow and confute the story of this monstrous and incredible miracle i was thinking once to premise an argument of the justice of the sentence denounced against and executed upon jesus who was so far from being the innocent person you christians would make of him that as may easily be proved he was so grand a deceiver impostor and malefactor as no punishment could be too great for him but this argument which i reserve against a day of perfect liberty to publish by itself in defense of the honor and justice of our ancestors would be too long for the compass of this letter and therefore i pass it by tho it would give force to my following objections it being hard and even impossible to imagine that god would vouchsafe the favor of a miraculous resurrection to one who for his crimes deservedly suffered and underwent death  but waveing i say that argument for the present which of itself would be enough to prejudice a reasonable man against the belief of jesuss resurrection i will allow jesus to have been a much better man than i believe him to have been or as good a one in morals as your divines do suppose him and will only consider the circumstances of the evangelical story of his resurrection from which if i dont prove it to have been the most barefaced imposture that ever was put upon the world i deserve for the vanity of this attempt a much worse punishment than he for his frauds endured  i have sometimes wondered considering the nature and heinousness of jesuss faults for which he died that our chief priests and pharisees had any regard to his prediction which was so like a bambouzlement of the populace that he was to rise again the third day after his crucifixion there is no other nation in the world which would not have slighted such a vain prognostication of a known impostor let him foretell with ever so much confidence his speedy return to life i dare say any other magistrates of ordinary prudence would have despised him for a presumptuous enthusiast but when i reflected on the imposture of lazaruss resurrection and of what pernicious consequence it had like to have proved to the peace and welfare of our nation if it had not been happily discovered my wonder here ceased and i as much admire now the wisdom caution and circumspection of our chief priests against all possible fraud and deceit in the foretold resurrection of jesus tho jesus himself the head of the confederacy and prime projector of the designed cheat in the case of lazarus was cut off yet his associates were still numerous and it was not impossible but they might concert a project of a counterfeited resurrection of him in accomplishment of his prophecy that might be of more fatal consequence and tend to such confusions and distractions among the people as would not be soon quelled and quieted whereupon our chief priests very prudently consider of precautions against cheat here and wisely make application to pilat the governor that proper and effectual measures may be taken against a false and feigned resurrection for fear of the ill effects of it and one of them as the spokesman of their company seems according to matthew chapter xxvii to have made the speech following  sir we remember that this deceiver and impostor jesus who was yesterday crucified and justly suffered death for his blasphemy and many delusions of the people that were of bad consequence and might have been of much worse if he had not been timely brought to condign punishment said repeatedly before that notwithstanding the death he was to undergo he should rise again to life the third day after it is not that we are at all apprehensive of such a wonderful and miraculous event which knowing him to have been a false prophet as well as a deceitful juggler we have no fears nor belief of but as it is not long since that the inhabitants in and about bethany had like to have been fatally deluded and imposed on by him in the pretended resuscitation of lazarus one of his disciples and confederates in iniquity so it is not altogether impossible nor improbable bat his disciples and accomplices who are many may project a feigned resurrection of jesus in accomplishment of his prediction by stealing his body away and pretending he is risen from the dead should such a shammiracle be contrived amongst them and cunningly executed it would be   not an error but an imposture of worse consequence to our nation and religion than the former in lazarus could have been if it had never been detected we crave therefore the favor of your excellency to give command for the making his sepulcher sure till the third day is past that neither his dead body may be taken away and a resurrection pretended nor a living one slipped into its place and a miracle counterfeited on that day when we will be present at the opening of the sepulcher and give satisfaction to the people of his being a false prophet   whether pilat was at all intent on the prevention of fraud in this case or would not willingly have connived at it to increase the divisions and distractions of our then unhappy nation may be questioned but the request of our chief priests was so reasonable and their importunitys so urgent that he could not resist them and therefore ordered them a watch for the sepulcher which they might make as sure as they could against fraud and imposture till the third day  whereupon our chief priests deliberate what measures were fittest to be taken to this purpose and as i cannot and dont believe any man else can devise any better for the security of the sepulcher against fraud than what they took so i admire and applaud their prudence circumspection and precaution in the case they sealed the stone at the mouth of the sepulcher and placed a guard of soldiers about it which were two such certain means for the prevention or detection of cheat in a resurrection as are not to be equaled by any other  they sealed the stone of the sepulcher which tho it was no security at all against violence yet was an absolute one against fraud how the stone which fitted the mouth of the sepulcher as a door does the entrance into a room was sealed i need not describe the use and manner of sealing of doors of closets of chests and of papers is common and as it is an obvious expedient for the satisfaction of the signators against deceit so it has been an ancient as well as a modern practice nebuchadnezzar daniel cap vi    sealed the door of the den of lions wherein daniel was cast with his own signet and wherefore did he so for the satisfaction of himself and of his courtiers when he came again to open and compare the signature with his signet that no art nor artifice hid been used for the preservation of daniel so our chief priests sealed the stone of jesuss sepulcher which they designed to be present at the opening of on the third day the time appointed by jesus for his resurrection and then give ample satisfaction to the people that there was a real or could be no resurrection of his body wherefore else did they seal the stone of his sepulcher  your grotius adducor ut credam pilati annulo et hunc lapidem signatum in loc matt thinks that pilats seal was affixed to the stone of the sepulcher but as i believe pilat little concerned himself about the prevention of deceit here so i much question it it is more reasonable to think that the chief priests and other civil magistrates of jerusalem with their several seals which could not be opened but by themselves without suspicion of fraud signed the stone and intended to be present on the day appointed at the opening of the sepulcher not doubting what no body could question but jesus would wait their coming and arise to life if he could in the sight of themselves and of a vast concourse of people that were sure to attend on them to behold the miracle such a resurrection would have been of satisfaction to the whole nation and such a resurrection reasonably speaking jesus would if he could have vouchsafed in accommodation to the sealing of the stone  but notwithstanding this precaution in sealing of the stone the best that could be taken against fraud jesuss body was privately slipped off early in the morning of the day before and a resurrection pretended by his disciples and you would have us and our ancestors to believe there was no deceit in the case tho confessedly none of the sealers of the sepulcher were present who can believe it was or can there be any imposture more against sense and reason palmd upon the understandings of mankind if there had been a real resurrection the sealers of the stone would have been the openers of the sepulcher wherefore else was the stone sealed  a question that here arises is on what day and what time of the day did our chief priests the sealers of the stone expect what they could not think would ever come to pass jesuss resurrection or what was the extent of the time meant by jesus when he said that after three days or on the third day after his passion he should rise again if any impostor or prophet like jesus should in this age so predict his resurrection and be executed on a friday the day for his resurrection would be presumed to be monday and not sunday morning before day and i humbly conceive former ages and nations and our nation in particular did compute after this fashion accordingly on monday our chief priests i dont doubt intended to be present at the opening of the seals of the sepulcher and to behold the miracle but jesuss body was clandestinely moved off early on sunday the day before that signified and predicted for his resurrection to the laughter more than to the surprise of our ancestors at the notoriety of the fraud committed and at the vanity of a resurrection pretended upon it and i may appeal even to your chief priests of the church whether here is not another note of cheat and imposture and whether the disciples were not afraid to trust jesuss body it is full time in the grave because of the greater difficulty to carry it off afterward and pretend a resurrection upon it  but because your divines who have singular knacks at making two nights and a full day that jesus was buried to be three days and three nights and whose various ways of computation i always smile at do assert that sunday was the third day on which in accomplishment of jonahs prophecy and of his own prediction he was to rise again i will suppose so with them and will if they please grant that our chief priests the sealers of the sepulcher expected his resurrection on that day and intended for the opening of the seals to be present at it  but at what time of day were they to come or could be expected at the sepulcher not long before noon but jesuss body was gone betimes in the morning before our chief priests could be out of their beds and a barefaced infringment of the seals of the sepulcher was made against the laws of honor and honesty and a resurrection confidently talked of by the disciples and yet your christian priesthood at this day would have us to believe there was no fraud and deceit in all this o most monstrous  if our chief priests had trespassed upon jesuss patience and would not attend at the sepulcher for the opening of the seals on the day and time appointed if they hid been for confining him longer in the grave than was meet according to prophecy then his resurrection without their presence had been excusable and justifiable but this his pretended rising to life not only a day before the chief priests could imagine he would or earlier in the morning than he should for the sake of their requisite presence is together with the fracture of the seals against the law of security such a manifest and indisputable mark and indication of fraud as is not to be equaled in all or any of the impostures that ever were attempted to be put upon the world  in short by the sealing of the stone of the sepulcher we are to understand nothing less than a covenant enterd into between our chief priests and the apostles by which jesuss veracity power and messiahship was to be tried tho we read not of the apostles giving their consent to the covenant yet it was reasonably presumed and could not have been refused if asked the condition of the sealed covenant was that if jesus arose from the dead in the presence of our chief priests upon their opening the seals of the sepulcher at the time appointed then was he to be acknowledged to be the messiah but if he continued in a corrupt and putrified state of mortality then was he to be granted to be an impostor very wisely and rightly agreed and if the apostles had stood to this covenant christianity had been nipt in its bud and suppressed in its birth but they had other views and another game to play at all adventures the body was to be removed and a resurrection pretended to the delusion it possibe of all mankind in which they have been more successful than could be imagined upon a project that had so little sense or reason so little color of truth or artifice in the contrivance and execution of it our chief priests were apprehensive at first of their stealing the body away and pretending a resurrection bat after the sealing of the stone those fears vanished because upon the stealing the body away against such security and precaution the fraud would be felf evident and want no demonstration and proof of it bur for all this precaution i say the body was in a barefaced manner taken away a resurrection talked of and to the amazement of every one who can think freely has been believed through all ages of the church since upon the whole then i think you may as well say when a sealed closet is broken open and the treasure gone without the privity of the signators that there is no wrong done as that in the resurrection of jesus there was no fraud the cases are equal and parallel what then can your christian priests say to this demonstrative argument of a manifest and barefaced cheat in jesuss resurrection i have been thinking what they will or can say and upon the maturest consideration i dont find they can make any other than one or more of these shuffling answers to it viz   that it was impossible for the disciples to steal the body of jesus away because of the watchfulness of the guards and therefore there was a real resurrection tho the chief priests and sellers of sepulcher were not present at it   that tho the chief priests and sealers of the stone of the sepulcher were not presenr as i say they ought to have been to behold the miracle yet his resurrection was afterward made as manifest to them as if they had been there present   that if jesus did not really arise from the dead the belief of his resurrection could never have been so propagated at first nor would have been retained in the world for so many ages since   i can think of no other answers and believe it impossible for your christian priests to form any other to the foresaid argument of fraud in jesuss resurrection but how weak frivolous and insufficient they all and every one are will appear upon a little examination into them    then against the foresaid demonstrative argument of fraud it may be pretended that it was impossible for the disciples to steal the body of jesus away because of the watchfulness of the guards and therefore there was a real resurrection tho the chief priests the sealers of the sepulcher were not present at it  to which i reply and confess that if it was impossible to evade the guards of the sepulcher then there was a real resurrection but if there was but a bare possibility of evading them then this answer is of no force and i am of opinion that the thing was not only possible but easy feassible and practicable tho the roman soldiers were of as much fidelity and integrity as any of their profession yet it is well known that such creatures are subject to bribery and corruption if the disciples had any money to tempt them with or if their faithfulness to their trust was untainted yet it is not improbable but their officers at the direction of pilat who found his account in the distractions of our nation might give them the hint to wink hard at the commission of such a fraud but not to insist on either of these ways to evade the watch our ancestors said what your evangelist has recorded that the disciples taking the opportunity of the sleep of the guards carried the body of jesus off which was a thing both possible and probable  of what number the watch did consist is uncertain your whitly upon the place in matthew says they were sixty but he has no reason nor authority to think they were so many if they had been to be a guard against violence i should easily have believed they were more but in as much as they were only a watch against fraud and against any casual defaceing of the seals on the stone before the chief priests came to open the sepulcher three or four soldiers were sufficient and i dont think there were any more set to this purpose  it is not then at all improbable that so few soldiers should be fast asleep at that time of night or so early in the morning when the clandestine work was done especially after keeping such a gaudy day as was the feast of the passover which like the festivals of other nations was celebrated with excess foot soldiers then you may be sure upon the bounty of one or other did no more want than they would scruple to take their fill which like an opiat locked up their senses for that night when the disciples being aware of the lucky opportunity carried the body of jesus off safely  and where is the absurdity to suppose that the disciples themselves might contrive the intoxication of the guards herodotus tells us a story of a deadbodys being stolen away by such an artifice and i dont think the disciples of jesus either so foolish or conscientious as not to take the hint and enterprise the like fraud peter who upon occasion could swear and curse like a trooper would hardly scruple to fuddle a few footsoldiers but which way soever it came to pass the watch were asleep which is neither hard to conceive nor believe and then the disciples executed that fraud which has been the delusion of nations and ages since  your evangelists would hint that the chief priests gave money to the soldiers to say they were asleep when the disciples stole the body of jesus away as if they were bribed to a false testimony but there neither was nor could be any such thing if there had been a real resurrection to their astonishment and amazement as it is represented in your gospels no money could so soon have corrupted them to a false witness being under such fears of god and of jesus i dont doubt but our chief priests might reward the soldiers for speaking the truth and exhort them to persist in it with a promise to secure them against the anger of pilat for their sleeping and neglect of their duty  here then is no answer to the foresaid argument or objection against jesuss resurrection it was not at all impossible for the disciples who stole the body away to avoid the guards who were and may reasonably be supposed to be lulled asleep when the disciples did it neither is there any more force in the    second answer to it viz that tho the chief priests the sealers of the stone of ths sepulcher were not present opening the seals and beholding the miracle yet his resurrection was afterward as manifest to them as if they had been there present  ay this is somewhat like an answer if there be any truth in it a manifestation of christ risen afterward to our chief priests would have been equivalent to their presence at and sight of the miracle but how was his resurrection manifested to them did jesus ever afterward appear personally to them to their satisfaction that he was the same person whom they crucified and put to death for a deceiver and false prophet no this is not once asserted by your evangelists or ever insinuated by any ancient or modern writer how then was jesuss resurrection made manifest to our chief priests why your divines say what is all that can be said here that the words of the disciples who being men of honesty simplicity and integrity would not lie are to be taken for it very fine indeed our chief priests are to take the words of the disciples for jesuss resurrection and look upon them as men of veracity when they knew and experienced them to be grand cheats not only in stealing the body of jesus away but in the known imposture of lazaruss resurrection or your evangelist had never implicitly called it so when therefore deceivers will not be liars nor theives dissemblers of the fact they are accused of i will own jesuss resurrection to have been manifest enough to our chief priests there is no need of more argument here he that bestows more words on it loses time  it has been a constant objection of us jews against the resurrection of jesus that he appeared not personally afterward to our chief priests to pilat and to others his crucifiers and insultors to upbraid them with their infidelity and ill treatment of him whether jesus would not have done so if he really arose from the dead and whether he ought not in reason for the conviction and conversion of unbeleivers to have done so with me is no question celsus of old si jesus volebat revera declarare suam divinam potentiam debuerat suis insultatoribus ipsique praesidi qui capitalem sententiam contra se tulerat denique caeteris omnibus se ostendere in orig lib ii contra celsum in the name of the jews made the objection and olibio a late rabbi in limborchii arnica collatione cum judaeo has repeated it but in all my reading and conversation with men or books i never met with a tolerable answer to it origin and limborch the writers against celsus and olibio gently slide over the objection as if it was too hot or weighty to be touched and handled by them to recite the poor short and insufficient answers of those two great authors to the objection would be the exposing of them and giving such strength to the objection which it dont want therefore i will leave the objection which origin magna sane res et miranda occurrit hoc loco quae non solum aliquem  vulgo credentium exercere posset sed perfectiores etiam cur non dominus post resurrectionem aeque ac superioribus temporibus conspiciendum se praebuerit in lib ii cont celsum owns to be a considerable one to the meditation of your modern advocates for christianity and when they can prove that jesus after his resurrection did personally appear to his crucifiers the chief priests and sealers of the sepulcher to their confutation or that according to the law of reason he ought not to have appeared to them then i will turn christian and grant that in the argument above which proves plain fraud in the resurrection there is no force nor truth in the mean time jesuss nonappearance to the chief priests is a confirmation that he did not arise from the dead bat that his body was stolen away or he would have waited in the grave the coming of the sealers of the stone and their regular opening of the sepulcher to the conviction and conversion of all there present and confirmation of the faith of all ages and nations since but    a third answer to the foresaid argument of fraud in the resurrection of jesus drawn from the nature use and design of sealing the stone of the sepulcher is that tho the sealers of the sepulcher were not present opening the seals and beholding the miracle yet jesus did certainly arise from the dead or the belief of his resurrecton could never have been at first propagated by the apostles nor would for so many ages of the church since have stood its ground  here is as little reason in this answer as in either of the two former who knows not that many errors in philosophy and as many frauds in religion have been sometimes accidentally sometimes designedly espoused and palmd upon mankind who in process of time become so wedded  them through prejudice and interest that they will not give themselves leave to enquire into the rise and foundation of them false miracles have been common things among christians and as the resurrection of jesus is their grand and fundamental one so it is not at all difficult to account for the rise propagation and continuance of the belief of it  why it has been believed through these latter ages of the church is no wonder at all the priests had their interest in it the ignorant and superstitious had their comfort in it and the wise and considerate for fear of persection durst not enquire into the grounds of it  the only difficulty here is to know upon what principle the project and story of jesuss resurrection was at first devised and whether it was ambition or revenge upon our ancient and pharisaical priesthood that prompted the apostles to it is all one to me such bad principles too often put men upon desperate attempts but however an imposture it was for the argument above to say the apostles and confederates in the fraud would not have stood to it and have died for it if the resurrection had not been real fact signifies nothing many cheats and criminals besides them have asserted their innocence and denied their guilt in the utmost exrremity of death without the like views of honor and fame the only thing that is surprising and astonishing in this shammiracle is that tho it was the most manifest the most barefaced and the most self evident imposture that ever was put upon the world yet it has been the most fortunate and successful having past through many ages and nations with reputation and renown and might have continued for as many generations to come but for the argument above that perfectly and clearly overthrows its credit  but some may say here where was the wisdom and providence of god all this while to suffer so many ages and nations to labor under such a delusion why i will tell you the providence of god in it was to humble mankind in the end for their vain ostentation of wisdom learning and science falsely so called to shame them for their madness and wickedness to persecute one another for different opinions in that religion whose very foundation is false and groundless to caution them against a blind and implicit faith for the future against believing any thing out of the sight and reach of their understandings to admonish them of the necessity of liberty to think speak and write freely about religion for the correction of errors and discovery of truth and lastly to reduce the world when it should be ripe for it to the golden religion of nature which upon the testimony of our old cabalistical doctors and of your jesus himself is the end of the law and the prophets  and thus have i spoken to the answers which your christian priesthood may be presumed to make to the foresaid argument of fraud in jesuss resurrection drawn from the design of our chief priests in sealing of the stone of his sepulcher i should not have concerned myself to speak to these their supposed answers but to save them the trouble of making them and the imagination of there being some force in them  as to the stories in your evangelists of jesuss several appearances after his pretended resurrection sometimes to the women and at other times to his disciples i am not at all obliged to refute them if these appearances had been more frequent better circumstanced and more solemnly averred they would have wanted no confutation there is no doubt on it but the disciples who for the argument above unquestionably stole jesuss body away in order to pretend a resurrection would talk much of his appearing to them and of the conversation afterward they had with him and if they had told better and more plausible tales of their fight of and conversition with him it would be nothing to the purpose better i say and more plausible tales than those upon record which for absurdity nonsense and incoherence carry their own confutation along with them  whoever blends together the various history of the four evangelists as to jesuss appearances after his resurrection will find himself not only perplexed how to make an intelligible consistent and sensible story of it but must with celsus quamvis celsus has jesu post resurrectionem apparitiones confer conetur cum vulgaribus spectris and visionibus in origin lib ii contra celsum  needs think it if he closely think on it like some of the confused and incredible womanish fables of the apparitions of the ghosts of deceased persons which the christian world in particular has in former ages abounded with the ghosts of the dead in this present age and especially in this protestant country have ceased to appear and we nowadays hardly ever hear of such an apparition and what is the reason of it why the belief of these storys being banished out of mens minds the crafty and vaporous forbear to trump them upon us there has been so much clear proof of fraud in many of these storys that the wise and considerate part of mankind has rejected them all excepting this of jesus which to admiration has stood its ground it is no wonder indeed that the clergy who are more incredulous than other folks as to storys of apparitions do stick to this of jesus the only one excepted out of all others it is a sweet morsel of faith and they readily swallow and digest it because they live by it otherwise this story of jesuss appearances after death had hardly escaped the fate of other apparitions nay would have been rejected one of the first of them there being hardly one i dare say it among all  storys of apparitions were they to be collected together that is more absurd and incredible than this of jesus  i have not here room to make any remarks on your evangelical story of jesuss apparitions after his death and if i had i durst not do it for fear of an offensive ludicrousness and of transgressing the rules of decency sobriety and sedateness of argument you have confined me to but however   cannot read the story without smiling and there are two or three passages in it that put me in mind of robinson crusos filling his pockets with biskets when he had neither coat wastcoat nor breeches on sometimes i think your evangelists wanted wit to adapt their tale to sense and to accommodate the transaction to nature and sometimes i think them crafty and were minded like daniel de foe in his foresaid romance to put the banter upon the credulity of mankind with some disguised and latent absurdities that in the conclusion and discovery they might be heartily laughed at for the belief of them i dare not i say so much a hint at one of these absurdities least i should be unwarily tempted to crack a jest on it but the time i hope is coining when i shall use more freedom and should your priesthood in proof of jesuss resutrection urge any of these storys of his corporal presence and appearance after it then i trust they will permit me to to make as merry descants on them as your bishops when academical jesters used to do on other mens bulls and blunders  in the mean time i depend on the foregoing single sober and sedate argument of fraud in this grand miracle which i found on the nature and design of sealing the sepulcher and for confirmation of my opinion and proof of fraud in it will conclude this letter with a parallel case and story not many years since one dr emms of the society of the french prophets who in their inspirations were like jesus and his disciples of old declaimers against the pharisaical priesthood of this age did by himself or some of his fraternity did for him predict his resurrection on a certain day when there was a concourse of people about his grave in vain to behold the miracle as there would have been about jesuss sepulcher if he had lain in it his full time but supposing in this case that the magistrates and priesthood of this city to prevent a cheat and delusion of the people had interred the doctor in a chnrchvault and sealed the door of it against the day appointed for his resurrection commanding a nightwatch to look to the vault the no violence or deceit be used this would have been a wise precaution against fraud as was in the case of jesus but what if his fraternity having a mind like jesuss disciples to bambouzle the people and priesthood had some of them drawn the watch aside to a ginshop whilst others carried the body off pretending a resurrection what would all reasonable men have said here that it was an impudent and barefaced imposture but to carry on the farce supposing the doctors fraternity had afterward averred that they had seen and conversed with him alive several times as before his death and had told particular storys of their conversation with him as first of all how he appeared to some of their women who were admonished of the certainty of his resurrection by a youth or an angel or two they could not tell whether but they were as like to angels which they never saw before in their lives as youths could be who knew him not by his countenance for their eyes were holden as by his talk on scriptureprophecy which was his usual cant before his death and at another time he appeared to his old acquaintance who knew him not by the features of his face but by an habitual motion and action of his hand in breaking of bread and at another time he was corporally present but they thought they saw a spirit about eight days after that he appeared among more of his old friends but for all their former intimacy with him some of them doubted whether it was the doctor or not at another time he came to them in another form and shape unlike to his pristin one but they were sure it was he by his exposition of the scripture at another time when they were assembled together and the doors were locked for fear of the clergy the doctor slipped unexpectedly into their company either from behind a curtain or miraculously entered at the keyhold and the last time he appeared there was one of his intimate friends had not known him but by a sore in his breast which the power of god in his resurrection did not heal after which they said he vanished away was taken up into heaven and they saw him no more supposing i say the french prophets had told such like storys of doctor emmss resurrection and of his appearances to them what would your priests and all other wise men have said to it why that it was all idle tales manifest lies sham and lmposture and that if the doctor in confutation of the errors of your priests had risen to life god would have kept him in his sepulcher his full time and have raised him in the presenee of priests magistrates and people and that he would have walked afterward publicly in the streets without danger to the satisfaction of all who knew him that he was the same emms who died and was buried without danger i say from the populace who would have been so far from affronting him that they would have almost adored him for the miraculous favor god had done him in his resurrection from the dead and that he would never have skulkd about and absconded himself for forty days together before he was pretendedly translated and therefore there was nothing but notorious deceit and imposture in all these pretenses  i need not make the application of this case and story which your priests know how to do for me to say here that there is none would be so desperate to engage in such a fraud as is the supposed case of dr emms above is a mistake many thousands for their diversion would enterprise it and the storys of the apparitions of ghosts which are almost all the frauds of the crafty to delude the ignorant do prove it i my felf would be forward to concert such an intrigue if it was but to put the banter upon the clergy to ruffle their tempers and secretly to laugh at them nothing would deter me from it but fears of the civil magistrate which was not the danger of the disciples of jesus because pilat for the sake of rule over the jews was a countenancer of every faction amongst them and particularly comminatus est periculum accusatoribus christianorum tertul apol cap v tiberius upon pilats representation of the matter soon commanded that the disciples of jesus should not be molested nor called into question so the disciples stood to the fraud told the story of jesus risen so often till they believed it themselves and drew multitudes into the belief of it which belief must have continued through all generations to come but for my argument of fraud before urged and argued  here sir before i conclude this letter i think it my duty however to give you may opinion of the religion that jesus and his disciples were for introducing into the world tho i believe what i have proved his resurrection to be a piece of fraud and his other miracles to have been all artifice and tho our chief priests and ancient nation are justifiable in the sentence that was passed and executed upon jesus yet i must do him and his disciples the justice to own that the doctrine they taught was for the most part of it good ufeful and popular being no other than the law and religion of nature which all nations being wearied with their own superstitions and sick of the burden of their priests ran apace into accordingly one justin martyr in apol ii of your ancient fathers says that they who lived according to the law of nature were true christians and i must needs say that if christians in process of time had not sophisticated this primitive religion of jesus if they had not built their systematical divinity upon him and brought strange inventions of men into his worship if lastly they had not again subjugated and entangled themselves with another and worse yoke of bondage to an intolerable and tyrannical priesthood of the church the world might have enjoyed great happiness under jesuss religion even that happiness which is now only to be expected upon a disproof of his miraculous resurrection that has been the foundation of a most confused superstructure of wild doctrines and opinions or more truly speaking that happiness of the state of nature religion and liberty which may be looked for upon the coming of our messiah the allegorical accomplisher of the law and the prophets whose advent upon the tradition of our cabalists will be toward the latter end of the sixth grand age of the creation to remove from our faces and our hearts the vail of the letter and in the mean while i adhere to the umbratical rites ceremonies and way of worship derived from our forefathers  thus sir have i finished my letter on jesuss resurrection and whether i hive not said enough to justify our jewish disbeleif of that miracle let your chief priests judge i dont expect my argument against it will be convincing of any of your preachers they have a potent reason for their faith which we jews cannot come at or i dont know but we might believe with them  i trust you will meet with no molestation for the publication of this letter neither do i think it was any thing of mine inserted in your discourses that at any time brought trouble on you it was your own imprudence to rave as you do against ecclesiastics what need had you to talk of the mischeifs and inconveniences of an hireling priesthood what occasion had you to call them ecclesiastical virmin and to speak of the happiness of mankind upon their extinction these things are very provoking and here is the true sourse in my opinion of all your troubles  tho i have here shown that christ is not risen yet i have more wit than to make the inference of paul that their preaching is vain their oratory is still useful if it be but to tickle the ears and amuse the understandings of the people about doctrines they understand not whether true or false and such an order of men as are your priestood are by their habit of long robes an ornament to society and it is an honor to the country to have them well fed and clad had i room for it i could write a curious encomium in prise of them and tell the world of what use and advantage they have been in all ages o what wars and persecutions might have been raised in the world but for their pacifick tempers how would sin and immorality have broke in upon mankind like a deluge but for the goodness of their lives and the excellency of their precepts how has the increase and multitude of their warm sermons been the ruin of satans hot and divided kingdom of darkness and error its owing to their pains and labors that every age for many past has been improving in virtue till the present which for piety and good morals is that perfection of time which is not to be meliorated but by the restitution of the golden age  so could i enlarge in praise of your clergy and so should you have done and then you might have disputed as you do against any doctrines miracles and articles of faith without molestation try if you cannot correct that fundamental error you have committed assert still if you can with dr rogers the necessity of an established priesthood well paid for the service of the king and the country under all changes of religion which may be a means to retrieve their favor and will beget in me a better opinion of your prudence than at present is entertained by your assured friend  n n   so ends the letter of my friend the jewish rabbi in which to my comfort he has conformed himself to the rules of sedateness decency and sobriety of argument prescribed by the two great bishops of london and st davids if the weight and solidity of his argument dont grieve the clergy i am in no pain for the levity and ludicrousness of if and whether the weight and nature of his argument against jesuss resurrection will at all startle and surprise them i know not but i profess for my self that i might have studied long enough for such an argument against it as this rabbi with his great gray beard has presently hit off he told me beforehand that his thoughts on jesuss resurrection should be out of the common road of thinking and i must needs say he has been as good as his word or no man ever kept his promise  there are two things very remarkable in his argument the one is the use and design of sealing the stone of jesuss sepulcher which he lays great stress on to the proof of fraud in his resurrection and the other is his application of these words the last error or as he reads deceit or imposture will be worst than the first or former in which he makes the chief priests in their speech to pilat to refer to lazaruss resurrecrection as the former known imposture if his application be just and true the consequence is that the resurrections of jesus and lazarus are both impostures it grieves me to the heart to think of this consequence which our divines are to see to and evade if they can no sooner did i read his application of the foresaid words but i run to our commentators for another and better exposition of them but alas to my sorrow they made nothing of them but a sort of a proverbial expression which the chief priests must have spoiled and knocked out of joint being then under great trouble for the truth of christianity and the certainty of these two grand miracles i refer the matter to our learned clergy desiring them to be as speedy as they can in another and more proper interpretation of the foresaid words or jews and infidels will run away with them in the rabbis sense to the confutation of our holy religion  i considered lately tint easter drew nigh when it was usual for our divines in their pulpits to insist on the proof of jesuss resurrection and therefore i i hastened the publication of this discourse that they might have these two peculiar texts viz of sealing the stone of the sepulcher and of the last error or imposture will be worse than the first to treat on he that produces a sermon or sermons wresting the foresaid texts out of the hands of my rabbi and putting another sense on them to the credit of jesuss and lazaruss resurrection erit mihi magnus apollo and by my consent shall be the next archbishop of canterbury  but my heart aches a little for our divines and i almost despair of their clean solutions of the foresaid two difficultys what must they do then why they must give up their religion as well as their church or go along with me to fathers for their mystical interpretation of the whole story of jesuss resurrection  that the fathers without questioning their belief of jesuss corporal resurrection universally interpreted the story and every part of it mystically is most certain st hilary quod autem a

which i have not room to translate and illustrate  st augustine ad hoc enim dominus hodie resurrexit ut imaginem nobis futurae resurrectionis enderet in sermon clxviii append says that jesuss resurrection from the dead at that time was to exhibit an image and resemblance of his future and mystical resurrection and elsewhere says quid singula significent quaerere sanctae quidem deliciae sunt in johan evang c xx tract   0 that its a holy pleasure to consider and search for the things signified by the story of it  that origin is of the same opinion no body need question a multitude of his testimonies might be produced to this purpose but i shall mention only one monumentum christi est divina scriptura in qua divinitatis and humanitatis cjus mysteria densitate litterae veluti quadam muniuntur petra in diversos homil    wherein he asserts that by the sepulcher of jesus is to be understood the letter of the scriptures in which as in a rock he is reposited  st john of jercsalem ne

praeferendo anti christum scilicet hominem peccati and diaboli filium potiusque adhortantibus principibus suis eligunt damnationi reservatum quatn salutis authorem in loc mat barabbas is a type of antichrist and by antichrist as i have elsewhere shown but of the fathers is meant the letter of the scriptures which modern commentators and crucifiers of jesus would prefer to the spirit for these are the two letter and spirit the christ and antichrist that are contrary one to another  st jerome velum templi scissun est and omnia legis sacramenta quae prius tegebantur prodita sunt atquc ad gentium populum transierunt in loc mat says that by the vail of the temple rent at jesuss resurrection is to be understood the opening the vail of the letter of the law and the prophets for the manifestation of the divine mysterys contained in them and by the rending of the rocks according petrae scissae id est universa vaticinia prophetarum in epist ad hedibriam to him is to be understood the apertion of the oracles of god that were before as hard as a rock till his spiritual resurrection for the illustration of them and by the earthquake he sed mihi videtur terrae motus and reliqua typum far credentium quod pristinis erroum vitiis derelictis and cordis emollita duritia postea agnoverint creatorem in loc matt says is meant the shakeing of the hearts of men and preparing them by a dereliction of their old errors for the susception of the true knowledge of god  as to the time that jesus was dead and buried which modern divines call three days and three nights st augustine says ipsum autem tridurum non totum and plenum fuisse scriptura testis est in lib iv de trinitate sect  0 that according to the scripture he was not so long dead and buried many says de tribus diebus multi fancti multa hinc senserint atque dixerint  sed nos neutram eorum vacantes sententiam melius tamen si placet in his spiritalem requiramus intellectum tres dies tria tempora saeculi ponentes in sermon de symbolo he have put various constructions on the time of christs burial endeavoring to make three days of it but we without slighting any of their opinions are for a mystical interpretation and suppose that by the three days are to be understood three ages of the world  the day would fail me to collect all the passages out of the fathers in interpretation of one or other of the parts of the story of jesuss resurrection but what i have here said in a few citations is enough to show that they looked upon the whole story as emblematical of his spiritual resurrection out of the grave of the letter of the scriptures in which he has been buried about three days and three nights according to that mystical interpretation of prophetical numbers which i have learned of them  and thus have i done with the miracle of jesuss resurrection which by the help of my friend the jewish rabbi i have shown according to the letter to consist of the greatest incredibilitys and with this i conclude my discourses on his miracles intending to treat on no more of them unless i am invited or provoked to it i had once an inclination to make another discourse on jesuss miraculous conception and on his feeding his thousands in the wilderness with a few loaves and fishes but upon a little consideration on the letter of those two storys i found myself too grave for the work and my rabbis thoughts are too gay and wonton therefore it must be omitted till the clergy importune me to it and signify their curiosity to see it performed by me  my discourses hereafter if god spare me life and liberty which under his providence i dont despair of to publish another volume shall treat on some historical passages of the new testament such as on the storys of jesuss birth and the appearances of angels to the shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night the journey and presents of the wise men to jesus the slaughter of the innocents at bethlehem and of herods cruelty the travels of joseph with the child jesus and his mother into egypt the disputation of jesus with the doctors in the temple and his elopement from his parents his riding on an ass to jerusalem and on other such like passages of his life for i am resolved to give the letter of the scripture no rest so long as god gives me life and abilities to attack it origin cum disputamus adversus eos and cum conquirimus advicem tunc quaeimus logum dogmatis illius in littera legis historiae and ostenditur secundum historiam stare non posse in psalm xxxvi says that when we dispute against ministers of the letter we must select some historical parts of scripture which they understand literally and show that according to the letter they cannot stand their ground but imply absurditys and nonsense and how then is such a work to be performed to best advantage is it to be done in a grave sedate and serious manner no i think ridicule should here take place of sober reasoning as the more proper and effectual means to cure men of their foolish faith and absurd notions as no wise man hardly ever reprehends a blunderbuss for his bull any other way than by laughing at him so the asserters of nonsensical notions in theology should if possible be satirised and jested upon or they will never be put out of countenance for nor desert their absurd doctrines and there never was a polemical divine that if he hid an opportunity and advantage over the weakness of his adversary did not take such a ludicrous and merry course with him  but on such historical passages of the gospel as before mentioned do i trust to publish another volume of discourses like to these on jesuss miracles and at present pass to my third general head at first proposed to be spoken to and that is  iii to consider what jesus means when he appeals to his works and miracles as to a testimony and witness of his authority and to show that he did not properly and ultimately refer to those done in the flesh but to those mystical ones he would do in the spirit of which those done in the flesh are but mere types and shadows  and on this head i shall be short there being no occasion of many words on it the bishop of london pastoral letter p    has collected many sayings of jesus wherein he seems to appeal to the works he then did and had done in flesh as to a witness of him but why might not jesus then prophesy and mean the spiritual works which heinus would do it is the known way of the prophets to speak of things to come as if they were already past because such prophecys are not to be understood till their accomplishment even so did jesus prophesy when he appealed to his works as i could prove from the nature and manner of his expressions but that the argument would be dry and tedious and therefore i refer the matter entirely to the fathers who asserted that jesus prophesied in his miracles as well as in his parables and that the works he then did in the flesh were but types of his mysterious operations that would be the demonstration of his authority and messiahship hence it is that origin adventus quidem christi unus in humilitate completus est alius vero speratur in gloria et hic primus adventus in carne mystico quodam sermon in scripturis sanctis umbra ejus appellatur in jesu nave homil viii says that jesuss first coming was but type and shadow of his spiritual advent and that his vera christi miracula and sanatio infirmorum est spiritalis in matt c xxv true miracles by which his authority is to be proved are spiritual hence it is that st hilary repeatedly says haec licet in prasens gesta sunt quid tamen in futurum significent contuendum est in matt c x s   christi gesta aliud portendunt c xii s   peragunt formam futuri gesta praerfentia c x xi that jesuss works were significative and predictive of mysterious operations which we were especially to look to and hence it is that all the other fathers interpreted the miracles of jesus in a mystical and allegorical sense  the question then is to what miracles did jesus truly and properly appeal in the opinion of the fathers for his authority and messiahship was it to his typical or antitypal works was it to the shadow or to the subsistence of his operations to his substantial operations to be sure which are and will be his spiritual ones upon the soul that are greater than those once done on mens bodies and which will be a proper proof of his divine power and to declare my opinion freely i am only for such a spiritual messiah who will cure the errors called the diseases of mankind which jesus of nazareth has not as yet done  but not to dispute this point with bishop gibson i will leave him in the enjoyment of his opinion of his literal messiah and miraculous operator on mens bodies if he will but indulge me in the belief of my spiritual messiah to come for the healing of modern distempers called the sins and errors of mankind and in the mean time let us draw the comparison between his litteral and my spiritual jesus and let the world judge to whom the preference is to be given for power and authority  bishop gibson is for jesus of nazareths messiahship because he cured the bodily blindness of many miraculously and a good work it was but i am for the messiahship of a spiritual jesus to come who will open the blind eyes of pur understandings to discern truth from error which will be a most glorious operation that his jesus of nazareth has not as yet done  bishop gibson is for jesuss messiahship who once cured bodily deafness in many which was indeed well done of him but i am for the messiahship of a spiritual jesus to come to heal the deafness of our souls or their dullness in apprehension of sublime mysterys which will be a divine work that his jesus has not as yet done  bishop gibson is for jesuss messiahship because he cured mens bodily lameness for which i do praise him but i am for a spiritual jesuss messiahship who will heal mankind of their halting between two and more opinions a more blessed work that jesus of nazareth has not as yet done for us  and so comparing all other diseases of body and soul together i am for the jesus who will heal the diseases of the soul and have a much less regard for bishop gibsons jesus who cured the diseases of a few mens bodies but for all that am not angry with the bishop for his high veneration of his jesus neither would i by any means have him prosesecuted and punished for not being of the same mind with me  but because the bishop suspects me of infidelity in that i have ludicrously treated some of the miracles of his jesus which by the by he has not vindicated from the absurditys and incredibilitys i charged them with i will humor the bishop and supposing jesus wrought literally those miracles which are allegorically interpreted by me will in those very miracles compare his litteral and my spiritual jesus together and appeal to all men of consideration which is the most worthy of the title and honor of the true messiah  bishop gibson is for his jesuss messiahship who miraculously drove the buyers and sellers out of the temple just as if a man was god to invest him with power should furiously drive the butchers and grasiers with their cattle to the confusion of their several propertys out of smithfield a notable miracle that but i am for the spiritual jesuss messiahship who according to the form of that typical story will at his coming expel ecclesiastical merchants out of his church who make merchandise of the gospel selling their bulls and beasts and fatlings of the letter a most glorious and beneficial work to mankind will this be and to prepare mens souls for the susception of such a spiritual jesus i intend to publish a discourse of the mischiefs and inconveniences of an hirelingpriesthood wherein it shall be proved that mankind cannot be either good wise or happy under the kingdom of this messiah to come without an abolition and extirpation of them  bishop gibson is for the messiahship of his jesus who cast the devils out of the madmen and permitted them to enter into the herd of swine that ran violently down a precipice and were choked in the sea how great a miracle it was thus to cure the madmen the bishop may know best being perhaps better acquainted with the devil than i am but was it not for pity to the swineherds for their losses i could even now laugh at the thoughts of the hogs running and tumbling downhill as if the devil drove them but leaving the bishop calmly decently and seriously to admire the wisdom and justice of his jesus in that act i am for the spiritual jesus who according to the typical form of that story exorcisd the furious and diabolical tempers out of the jews and gentiles of old whom no chains of reason could hold from doing violence to the christians till they were converted and tho he permitted the like persecuting and diabolical spirits to enter into ecclesiastical swine yet will they be precipitated into the sea of the knowledge of god wherein they will be absorpt with divine divisions and contemplations o most glorious work that bespeaks the wisdom power and goodness of our spiritual jesus from beginning to the end of it  bishop gibson admires his jesus for his transfiguration on mount tabor tho neither he nor any body else can tell wherein lay the miracle nor into what various figures and shapes jesus was transformed but i am for the spiritual jesus whose glorious transfiguration after six grand days of the creation will be conspicuous when with the eyes of our understanding we shall behold him metamorphosed into the forms of all the types of him under the law i am now ravished with the intellectual view of this transfiguration and believe was i to set about it i could give others except the bishop an idea and conception of it to their astonishment at the glory of jesus in it  bishop gibson is for the messiahship of jesus of nazareth because he cured a woman of an issue of blood after she had spent all she had upon physicians to no purpose which might be or might not be a miracle for any thing he can argue upon it but i am for the spiritual jesuss messiahship who at his coming will according to that typical story cure the woman of the church of her issue of blood that is shed in persecution and war which her ecclesiastical physicians of the clergy have not been able to stop tho they have received large fees and stipends of the church to that purpose will not this be a desirable and beneficial work to all nations and who knows not excepting the bishop that it is of the office of the true messiah to give abundance of peace to mankind to make the lion to lie down with the lamb and to induce men to break their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and to make wars to cease in all the world which prophecys are so far from being fulfilled by jesus of nazareth that there has been nothing but wrangling and jangling and scolding and fighting about him ever since i wonder the want of the accomplishment of the foresaid prophecys has not long before now occasioned the rejection of jesuss messiahship or of the authority of the prophets  bishop gibson is for his jesuss being the messiah because he cured an old woman of a spirit of no body knows what infirmity consequently little or nothing is to be said for the greatness of that miracle but i am for the spiritual jesuss messiahship who according to the figure of that litteral story is to heal the woman of the church of her infirmity of the spirit of prophecy which jesus of nazareth has not done for her or there would not be so many disputes about prophecys and their interpretations so far as there is hardly one prophecy that christians are agreed about the sense of it is the grand characteristick of the true messiah that he is to restore prophecy and the way of interpretation of the prophets upon the allegorical scheme too i speak this not only upon the authority of the prophets themselves but upon an almost infinite number of testimonys of ancient jews and fathers accordingly i expect the advent of a spiritual messiah who alone can do it to heal the church of her present infirmity and to restore the art and gift of prophecy  bishop gibson is an admirer of jesus of nazareth because he told a poor whore of samaria her fortune of having had five husbands and being then an adulteress with another man which according to the letter is such a poor sort of a miracle that i can hardly think of it without blushing but i am an adorer beforehand of the spiritual jesus who according to that type will out of the law and the prophets allegorically interpreted tell the present heretical and adulterous woman of the church all that she has done and how she has been wedded to the sensible things of the five books of moses and is now an adulteress with the antichrist of the letter such an information of the church will be a most stupendous and miraculous work and a demonstration of our jesuss messiahship beyond contradiction in as much as it will be agreeable to the opinion that all antiquity entertained of the true messiah viz that he was to let us into the sight knowledge and understanding of the wisdom and beauty of providence through all ages of the world  bishop gibson admires jesus of nazareth for his cursing the figtree for not bearing fruit out of season shame on that miracle according to the letter and on all admirers of it but i am for the spiritual jesus who at his coming to the figtree of his church will make its present unfruitful state to wither away and cause it to produce the fruits of the spirit and allegorical interpretations of the scriptures that are compared so sweet and ripe figs for such his advent to this miraculous and beneficial purpose i daily pray and say too blessed are all those who love his appearance  after this fashion could i go through the other miracles i have treated on in these discourses and upon the comparison set plainly before the eyes of my readers the difference between the litteral miracles of bishop gibsons carnal jesus and the allegorical ones of my spiritual jesus as to stupendousness use and excellency but what i have here done in the seven instances above is enough to induce us to believe with the fathers that jesuss first coming in the flesh was but type and shadow of his second advent in the spirit and that jesus of old when he appealed to his works then done as to a witness of his authority did only prophesy and re erultimately to his mystical operations that are alone the proof of his godlike and divine power bishop gibson says pastoral letter p   of me that pretending to raise the actions and miracles of our savior to a more exalted and spiritual meaning i have labored to take away the reality of them and by that to destroy one of the principal evidences of christianity but i presume now he will be sensible of the rashness and incogitancy of that accusation if he be not i shall say of him in case he write any more for jesuss litteral miracles in opposition to his allegorical ones that he is like the dog in the fable the bishop will excuse the coarsness of the comparison that let go the substance of his mutton and caught at the shadow and so like a foolish cur as he was lost both  and thus have i done with the three general heads at first proposed to be handled in these discourses now whether i am upon the whole an infidel or beleiver of christianity the world is to judge i will make no more solemn declarations of my belief of it much less at this juncture of time when i am under prosecution for infidelity because it would be a sneaking tame and cowardly act in me and such an argument of that meanness of spirit as i abhor and detest my works shall speak for me in which being conscious of the innocence of my intentions and of the usefulness of my design i mean to proceed not doubting but some of our clergy upon two or three more discourses against the letter of the new testament will find me out what i am and whether i am not a true professor of the religion of the spiritual and holy jesus  in the mean time i will not compound the difference depending between bishop gibson and myself upon any other terms than his making me ample satisfaction for the injurys done to my reputation and low fortunes tho he may thirst after my life or at least my liberty yet under the providence of god i fear not the loss of either god be praised this kingdom is blessed with such a civil administration for wisdom justice and mercy as no nation of the world can equal our magistrates are all philosophers lovers of truth and of an enquiry into it and so tender of the religious as well as of the civil rights of the subject that i have nothing to dread from them  there is somewhat popular indeed tho nothing true nor rational in the clamor and accusations of the clergy against me bishop gibson would insinuate pastoral letter p    that my discourses on miracles strike at the foundation of civil society but by an unnatural consequence of his own making i confess it is an heinous crime to write any thing that tends to the subversion or prejudice of the civil society but how will the bishop make me guilty of it if the clergy will not be disturbers of the peace of the public upon my discourses it is certain that the quiet of the world which i wish and aim at will be inviolably kept and preserved for all me my followers indeed when i walk the streets of this city are numerous and if any of them should break the peace what serves my lord mayors power for but to chastise them for it as for my self and my adherents at home which as yet are without number we are all quietists and should act against our consciences and religion if we should injure any man in his person and property but i smile to see a clergyman all on a sudden like the bishop so tender of the welfare of the public when ecclesiastics in all ages past have been the bane of society and the pest of mankind as appears from the wars and persecutions they have raised in the world and from that strife variance and discords they have occasioned in citys and familys and with submission to the bishop who i hope will not be angry for my saying it i am sure the clergy at this juncture even darkened and obscured the seemingly native simplicity of the story of the life of jesus so leaving you to chew upon this i turn  my address to infidels particularly to the two most renowned writers of the party mr grounds and mr scheme i should gentlemen by right salute you with the title of freethinkers a proper name for your philosophical sect who are for the free exercise of your reason about divine and speculative points in theology and i had distinguished you by this title from your apostatical adversarys but that i had a mind to oblige my old friends the clergy in giving you a no more honorable title than i do them and i trust you will not be offended at the title of infidels since not only your writings seem to have a tendency to infidelity but if there be any fault in your principles you know how to charge it on your adversarys the pretended advocates for christianity whose absurditys false reasonings inconsistencys and foolish glosses on the scriptures have occasioned your departure from the faith in christ  i thank mr scheme for the noble present of his book which i received and read with pleasure but instead of one he should have sent me a dozen for the use of friends and borrowers who are very curious and importunate for the perusal of it for what reason he envys the booksellers the public sale of his work choosing rather to give it away gratis than that they should reap any profit by it i know not surely it is not to bring an odium on the clergy for persecutors as if such an useful and philosophical piece might not appear publicly without danger from them if so i hope the clergy will resent the indignity and invite him to a publication of his book with a promise of impunity which would wipe off the reproach which this clandestine method of disposing of it has cast on them  i once almost despaired sirs of seeing such another piece from your quarter i was afraid the prosecution of the moderator would have deterred you from the press whereby our excellent controversy on foot must have been dropped but the sudden and unexpected appearance of mr scheme has revived me and rejoiced the cockles of my heart go on then great sirs in this controversy which mr grounds happily commenced and if you are denied the liberty of the press and public sale of your books i hope you will for all that as occasion offers it self oblige the learned and curious with some more of your bright lucubrations though you print them and dispose of them in this clancular and subtle method  it is not that i wish well to your cause of infidelity that i thus encourage you you have more sense and reason than to suspect me tainted with unbelieving principles christianity will stand its ground against your battering armor and the church of christ will be the more firmly established on a rock of wisdom for that opposition you make to it though you will entirely vanquish the litteral schemists and ride in triumph over them yet other defenders of the faith called allegorists will arise to your confutation and final overthrow  if i am not mistaken sirs your adversarys the litteral schemists whom i call apostates are about making a retreat and yiedling the field of battle to you the bishop of lichfield the greatest general on their side will not only find it hard to levy any more forces in defense of his twelve litteral prophecys but he knows that if he draw his sword any more against you he must attack too the authority of the fathers for the allegorical interpretation of some of those prophecys already urged in my supplements to the moderator or if the fathers are neglected by him they and i keeping out of the reach of his bugpear will treat him with such familiar language as never was given to one of his order  mr scheme seems to promise us a discourse on the miracles in the scriptures i hope he will be as good as his word and ere long publish it this discourse of mine cannot possibly supersede his as i question not but his thoughts and remarks on miracles will be very considerable so i shall be a little impatient till i see them but be his discourse on miracles of what kind soever i believe it will hardly be an obstruction to my undertaking in hand which i intend by gods leave to go on with to the honor of the holy jesus our spiritual mesiah to whom be glory and praise for ever and ever amen  finis books written by mr woolston and sold by him near moregate and the booksellers of london and
