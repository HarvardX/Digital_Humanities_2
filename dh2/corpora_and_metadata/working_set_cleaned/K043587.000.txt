pudding and dumpling burnt to pot  pudding and dumpling burnt to pot or a complete key to the dissertation on dumpling wherein all the mystery of that dark treatise is brought to light in such a manner and method that the meanest capacity may know who and who is together  published for the general information of mankind by j w author of     treatises yhuchi dandi ocatchu gao emousey  london printed and sold by a dodd without temple bar and h whitridge the corner of castlealley in cornhill m dcc xxvii price   d  preface it very much surprises me that six editions of a mythological pamphlet entitled a dissertation on dumpling should escape your notice of that wonderful unriddler of mysteries the ingenious mr e  c  who has at the same time given such proofs of his abilities in his many and most elaborate keys to gullivers travels keys which gulliver himself could never have found out and withal so pertinent that i shall esteem those at the helm no great lovers of learning if my friend edmund be not forthwith promoted for as the sweetness of a kernel is uncomatable but by the fracture of its shell so is the beauty of a mystery altogether hid till the expounder has riddlemayreed the propounders problem and rendered it obvious to the meanest capacity  the only plea i can use in mr c  s bchalf is that the author of the dissertation has been a little too free with his character which probably occasioned that sullenness in our british oedipus who in order to be revenged has determined not to embelish the work with his interpretation but rather let it rot and perish in oblivion  this and nothing else could be the reason of so profound a silence in so great a mysterymonger to remedy which loss to the public i an unworthy scribler and faint copier of that great artist presume with aching heart and trembling hand to draw the veil which shades the political pamphlet in question and show it to my loving countrymen in puris naturalibus  if i succeed in this i hope mr l  t who all the world knows is a rare chap to his authors will speedily employ me to unriddle or at least make a plot to the rival modes which it seems the author has omitted it is true he ought to have given it the bookseller with the copy but has not so done which makes me wonder he is not sued for breach of covenant but what is that to me if i get a job by the bargain let booksellers beware how they buy plays without plots for the future  i narrowly missed solving the problem called wagner and abericock mr b  had spoke to mr w  to speak to mr c  who had just consented to employ me after having made me abate half my demand but houses running thin colley has undertaken the job himself to save charges intending at the same time to annex a severe criticism on pluto and proserpine  this gentle reader will i hope induce you to look on me as a writer of some regard and at the same time to make a little allowance for whatever errors my great hurry may occasion being obliged to write night and day sundays and working days without the least assistance all our journeymen writers being now turned masters i am left to shist for my self but am bringing up my wife to the business and doubt not but a long war and our mutual industry may rub off old scores and make us begin a new reckoning with all mankind pamphleteering having been so dead for many years last past that god forgive me i have been oftentimes tempted to write treason for mere sustenance  but thanks to better stars and better days the pen revives and authors flourish more money can be made now of a play nay though it be a scurvy one than dryden got by all his works theresore now or never is the time to strike while the iron is hot to write my self out of debt and into place and then grow idle and laugh at the world as my betters have done before me  introduction when a book has met with success it never wants a father there being those good natured souls in the world who rather than let mankind think such productions sprang of themselves will own the vagabond brat and thereby become fathers of other mens offsprings  this was the fate of dumpling whose real father did not take more care to conceal himself than some did to be thought its author but if any one will recollect the time of its publication they will find it within a week after the arrival of d  n s  t from ireland the occasion as i am very well informed was this the d  n one of the first things he did went to pay a visit to mr t  his old bookseller but to his surprise found both the brothers dead and a relation in the shop to whom he was an utter stranger mr m  for such is this persons name gathering from the d  ns enquiries who he was paid him his devoirs in the most respectful manner solicited his friendship and invited him to a dinner which the d  n was pleased to accept by the way you must know he is a great lover of dumpling as well as the bookseller who had ordered one for himself little dreaming of such a guest that day the dinner as twas not provided on purpose was but a family one well enough however for a bookseller that is to say a couple of fowls bacon and sprouts boiled and a forequarter of lamb roasted after the usual complements for the unexpected honor and the old apology of wishing it was better for his sake the maid silly girl came and asked her master if he pleased to have his dumpling he would have chid her but the d  n mollified him insisting at the same time upon the introduction of dumpling which accordingly was done dumpling gave cause of conversation but not till it was eat for the reader must understand that both the gentlemen play a good knife and fork and are too mannerly to talk with their mouths full the dumpling eat as i said before the d  n drank to the bookseller the bookseller to the author and with an obsequious smile seemed to say ah dear doctor you have been a friend to my predecessor can you do nothing for me the d  n took the hint and after a profound contemplation cried why ay  dumpling will do  put me in mind of dumpling anon but not a word more at present and good reason why dinner was coming in so they past the rest of the meal with great silence and application and no doubt dined well far otherwise was it with me that day i remember to my sorrow i had a hogs maw without salt or mustard haing at that time credit with the porkwoman but not with the chandler times are since mended amen to the continuance  the d  n having eat and drank plentifully began his usual pleasantries and made the bookseller measure his ears with his mouth nay burst his sides with laughter however he found interval enough to remind the d  n of dumpling who asked him if he had a quick hand at writing he excused himself being naturally as lazy as the other was indolent so they contrived to ease themselves by sending for a hackney writer out of temple lane to be the d  s amanuensis while he and his new acquaintance cracked the other bottle  this account may be depended upon because i had it from the man himself who scorns to tell a lie  to be short my friend had the worst of it being kept to hard writing without drinking churls that they were about three hours in which time the dissertation was finished that is to say from page   to page    the rest might probably be done at some other leisure time to fill up the chinks but of that he knows nothing sufficient is it that the d  n was the author proceed we now to the other discoveries by drawing the veil from before the book it self  a key to the dissertation on dumpling i shall begin with his motto which says what is better than a pudding the body owns its power the mind its delicacy it will give youth to gray hairs and life to the most desponding therefore are pudding eaters of great use in state affairs  this quotation is of a piece with his motto to the tale of a tub and other writings altogether fictitious and drole he adds to the jest by putting an air of authority or genuine quotation from some great author when alas the whole is mere farce and invention  the dedication is one continued sneer upon authors and their patrons and seems to carry a glance of derision toward men of quality in general by setting a cook above them as a more useful member in a body politic some will have this braund to be sir  others sir  others sir  but i take it to be more railery than mystery and that mr braund at the rummer in queen street is the person who having pleased the author in two or three entertainments he with a view truly epicurean constitutes him his maecenas as being more agreeable to him than a whole circle of stars and garters of what color or denomination soever  in his tale of a tub he has a fling at dependence and attendance where he talks of a body worn out with poxes ill cured and shoes with dependence and attendance not having the book by me i am forced to quote at random but i hope the courteous reader will bear me out he complains of it again in this treatise and makes a complement to mr austin mr braunds late servant who keeps the braunds head in new bondstreet near hanoversquare a house of great elegance and where he used frequently to dine  the distinction of brand braund and barnes is a banter on critics and genealogists who make such a pother about the orthography of names and things that many times three parts in four of a folio treatise is taken up in ascertaining the propriety of a syllable by which means the reader is left undetermined having nothing but the various readings on a single word and that probably of small importance  i heartily wish some of these glossographists would oblige the world with a folio treatise or two on the word rabbet we shall then know whether it is to be spelt with an e or an i for to the shame of the english tongue and this learned age our most eminent physicians surgeons anatomists and men midwives have all been to seek in this affair  st andre howard braithwaite ahlers and manningham spell it with an e  douglas and the gentleman who calls himself gulliver spell it with an i  and some of these great wits have such short memories that they spell it both ways in one and the same page  the masterkey to this mystery is the explanation of its terms for example by dumpling is meant a place or any other reward or encouragement a pudding signifies a p  t and sometimes a c  tee a dumpling eater is a dependant on the court or in a word any one who will rather pocket an affront than be angry at a tip in time a cook is a minister of state the epicurean and peripatetic sects are the two parties of whigg and tory who both are greedy enough of dumpling  the author cannot forbear his old sneer upon foreigners but says in his  st page that finding it a land of plenty they wisely resolved never to go home again and in his  d nay so zealous are they in the cause of bacchus that one of the chief among them made a vow never to say his prayers till he has a tavern of his own in every street in london and in every market town in england if he does not mean sir j  t  i know not who he means  by the invention of eggs page   is meant perquisites he cannot conclude a paragraph in his  th page without owning he received that important part of the history of pudding from old mr lawrence of wilsden green the greatest antiquary of the present age  this old lawrence is a great favorite of the d  s he is a facetious farmer of above eighty years of age now living at wilsden green near kilburn in middlesex the most rural place i ever saw exactly like the wilds of ireland it was here the d  n often retired incog to amuse himself with the simplicity of the place and people where he got together all that rigmayroll of childrens talk which composes his namby pamby old lawrence told me the d  n has sat several hours together to see the children play with the greatest pleasure in life the rest he learned from the old nurses thereabouts of which there are a great many with whom he would go and smoke a pipe frequently and cordially not in his clergymans habit but in a black suit of cloth clothes and without a rose in his hat which made them conclude him to be a presbyterian parson  this mention of old lawrence is in ridicule to a certain great artist who wrote a treatise upon the word connoisseur or a knower and confesses himself to have been many years at a loss for a word to express the action of knowing till the great mr prior gave him ease by furnishing him with the word connoissance our d  n had drawn a drole parallel to this viz boudineur a pudding pyeman and boudinance the making of pudding pies but several men of quality begging it off it was at their request scratched out but my friend the amanuensis remembers particularly its being originally inserted  if the reader should ask who is that k  john mentioned in the fourth page and which i ought to have taken in its place i beg leave to inform him that by k john is meant the late q  with whom the d  of m  was many years in such great favor that he was nick named k john it was in that part of the q  s reign that sir john pudding by whom is meant  you know who came in favor it is true the name is odd and seems to carry an air of ridicule with it but the character given him by this allegorical writer is that of an able statesman and an honest man  and here begging mr d  ns pardon i cannot but think his wit has out run his judgment for he puts the cart before the horse and begins at the latter part of sir  administration but this might be owing to too plentiful a dinner and too much of the creature be that as it will i must follow my copy and explain it as it lies proceed we therefore to the dissertation page    but what raised our hero most in the esteem of this puddingeating monarch was his second edition of pudding he being the first that ever invented the art of broiling puddings which he did to such perfection and so much to the kings liking who had a mortal aversion to cold pudding that he thereupon instituted him knight of the gridiron and gave him a gridiron of gold the ensign of that order which he always wore as a mark of his sovereigns favor  if this does not mean the late revival of an ancient order of knighthood i never will unriddle mystery more to prove which we need but cross over to the next page where he tells us sir john had always a squire who followed him bearing a huge pair of spectacles to saddle his honors nose diss page    after this he very severely runs upon those wouldbe statesmen who put themselves in competition with his favorite sir  with whom he became exceeding intimate and almost inseparable all the time he was in england  the story of the kit cat club dick estcourt and jacob tonson is a mere digression and nothing more to the purpose than that we may imagine it came uppermost he returns to his subject in his  th page  now it was sir johns method every sunday morning to give the courtiers a breakfast which breakfast was every man his dumpling and cup of wine for you must know he was yeoman of the winecellar at the same time  the breakfast is sir  levee the yeomanship of the winecellar is the   the author of the dissertation is a very bad chronologist for at page  0 we are obliged to go back to the former reign where we shall find the lubberly abbots i e the high church priests misrepresenting sir johns actions and never let the q  alone till poor sir john was discarded  this was a great eyesore and heartburning to some lubberly abbots who lounged about the court they took it in great dudgeon they were not invited and stuck so close to his skirts that they never rested till they outed him they told the king who was naturally very hasty that sir john madeaway with his wine and feasted his paramours at his expense and not only so but they were forming a design against his life which they in conscience ought to discover that sir john was not only an heretic but an  nay worse they feared he was a witch and that he had bewitched his majesty into that unaccountable fondness for a puddingmaker they assured the king that on a sunday morning instead of being at mattins he and his trigrimates got together hum jum all snug and performed many hellish and diabolical ceremonies in short they made the king believe that the moon was made of greencheese and to show how the innocent may be belied and the best intentions misrepresented they told the king that he and his associates offered sacrifices to ceres when alas it was only the dumplings they eat  the butter which was melted and poured over them these vile miscreants called libations and the friendly compotations of our dumpling eaters were called bacchanalian rites two or three among them being sweet toothed would strew a little sugar over their dumplings this was represented as an heathenish offering in short not one action of theirs but which these rascally abbots made criminal and never let the king alone till sir john was discarded not but the king did it with the greatest reluctance but they made it a religious concern and he could not get off on it diss page  0  all the world knows that the tory ministry got uppermost for the four last years of the queens reign and by their unaccountable management teased that good lady out of her life which occasioned the d  n in his eleventh page to say then too late he saw his error then he lamented the loss of sir john and in his latest moments would cry out oh that i had never parted from my dear jackpudding would i had never left off pudding and dumpling then i had never been thus basely poisoned never thus treacherously sent out of the world  thus did this good king lament but alas to no purpose the priest had given him his bane and complaints were ineffectual  this alludes to sir  imprisonment and disgrace in the year  nay so barefaced is the d  n in his allegory that he tells us in his   th page norfolk was his asylum this is as plain as the nose on a mans face the subsequent pages are an exact description of the ingratitude of courtiers and his fable of the court pudding page    is the best part of the whole dissertation  one would imagine the d  n had been at sea by his writing catharpingfashion and dodging the story sometimes twentyyears backwards at other times advancing as many so that one knows not where to have him for in his fifteenth page he returns to the present scene of action and brings his hero into the favor of k  harry alias  who being sensible of his abilities restores him into favor and makes use of his admirable skill in cookery alias state affairs  not one of the kings cooks could make a pudding like sir john nay though he made a pudding before their eyes yet they out of the very same materials could not do the like which made his old friends the monks attribute it to witchcraft and it was currently reported the devil was his helper but good king harry was not to be fobbd off so the pudding was good it sat very well on his stomach and he eat very savourly without the least remorse of conscience diss page     this seems to hint at the opposition sir  met with from the contrary party and how sensible the k  was that they were all unable to hold the staff in competition with him  after this the d  n runs into a whimsical description of his heroes personal virtues but draws the picture too much alla carraccatura and is in my opinion not only a little too familiar but wide of his subject for begging his deanships pardon he mightily betrays his judgment when he says sir john was no very great scholar whereas all men of learning allow him to be a most excellent one but as we may suppose he grew pretty warm by this time with the booksellers wine he got into his old knack of raillery and begins to run upon all mankind in this mood he falls upon c  j  n and sir r  bl  re a pair of twin poets who sucked one and the same muse after this he has a fling at handel bononcini and attilio the opera composers and a severe sneer on the late highchurch idol sacheverel as for cluer the printer any body that knows music or bow church yard needs no farther information  and now he proceeds to a digression which is indeed the dissertation it self proving all arts and sciences to owe their origin and existence to pudding and dumpling i e encouragement his hiatus in the  0th page i could but dare not decypher  in his   d page he lashes the authors who oppose the government such as the craftsmain occasional writer and other scribblers past present and to come the dumplingeaters downfall is a title of his own imagination i have run over all wilfords catalogues and see no mention made of such a book all that paragraph therefore is a mere piece of rablaiscism  in his   d page he has another confounded fling at foreigners and after having determinately dubbed his hero the prince of statesmen he concludes his dissertation with a mess of drollery and goes off in a laugh  in a word the whole dissertation seems calculated to ingratiate the d  n in sir  favor he draws the picture of an able and an honest minister painful in his countries service and beloved by his prince yet oftentimes misrepresented and belied nay sometimes on the brink of ruin but always conqueror the fears the jealousies the misrepresentations of an enraged and disappointed party give him no small uneasiness to see the ingratitude of some men the folly of others who shall believe black to be white because prejudiced and designing knaves alarm em with false fears we see every action misconstrued and evil made out of good but as the best persons and things are subject to scandal and ridicule so have they the pleasure of triumphing in the truth which always will prevail  i take the allegory of this dissertation to be partly historical partly prophetical the d  n seeming to have carried his view not only to the present but even succeeding times he sets his hero down at last in peace plenty and a happy retirement not unrelented by his prince his honesty apparent his enemies baffled and confounded and his measures made the standard of good government and a pattern for all just ministers to follow  thus gentle reader have i at the expense of these poor brains cracked this thick shell and given thee the kernel if any should object and say this exposition is a contradiction to the d  ns principles i assure such objector that the d  n is an errant whig by education and choice he may indeed cajole the tories with a belief that he is of their party but it is all a joke he is a whig and i know him to be so nay more i can prove it and defy him to contradict me did he not just after his arrival and promotion in ireland writing to one of his intimate friends in london conclude his letter in this manner  thus dear  from all that has occurred you must conclude me a tory in every thing but my principle which is yet as unmoved as that i am  yours etc  this letter his tale of a tub and in a word all his invectives against enthusiasm and priestcraft plainly prove him to be no tory and if his intimacy not only with sir  himself but most of the prime men in the ministry cannot prove him a whig i have no more to say  finis advertisement to the curious the author is night and day at work in order to get published before the spaniards have raised the siege of gibraltar a treatise entitled truth brought to light or d  n s  t s wilsden prophecy unfolded being a full explanation of a prophetical poem called namby pamby which by most people is taken for a banter on an eminent poet now in ireland when in fact it is a true narrative of the siege of gibraltar the defeat of the spaniards and success of the british arms the author doubts not in this attempt to give manifest proof of his abilities and make it apparent to all mankind that he can see as clearly through a millstone as any other person can through the best optic martial or scarlet ever made and that there is more in many things not taken notice of than the generality of people are aware of
