an epistle to the right honorable sir robert walpole still let low wits who sense nor honor prize sneer at all gratitude all truth disguise at living worth because alive exclaim insult the exiled and the dead defame such paint what pity veils in private woes and what we see with grief with mirth expose studious to urge  whom will mean authors spare the childs the parents and the consorts tear unconscious of what pangs the heart may rend to lose what they have never deserved  a friend such ignorant of facts invent relate exposed persist and answered still debate such but by foils the clearest luster see and deem aspersing others praising thee far from these tracks my honest lays aspire and greet a generous heart with generous fire truth be my guide truth which thy virtue claims this nor the poet nor the patron shames when partyminds shall lose contracted views and history question the recording muse it is this alone to aftertimes must shine and stamp the poet and his theme divine long has my muse from many a mournful cause sung with small power nor sought sublime applause from that great point she now shall urge her scope on that fair promise rest her future hope where policy from state illusion clear can through an open aspect shine sincere where science law and liberty depend and own the patron patriot and the friend that breast to feel that eye on worth to gaze that smile to cherish and that hand to raise whose best of hearts her best of thoughts inflame whose joy is bounty and whose gift is fame where for relief flies innocence distressed to you who chase oppression from the oppressed who when complaint to you alone belongs forgive your own though not a peoples wrongs who still make public property your care and thence bid private grief no more despair ask they what state your sheltering care shall own it is youth it is age the cottage and the throne nor can the prison scape your searching eye your ear still opening to the captives cry nor less was promised from thy early skill ere power enforced benevolence of will to friends refined thy private life adhered by thee improving ere by thee preferred well had thou weighed what truth such friends afford with thee resigning and with thee restored thou taughtst them all extensive love to bear and now mankind with thee their friendships share as the rich cloud by due degrees expands and showers down plenty thick on sundry lands thy spreading worth in various bounty fell made genius flourish and made art excel how many yet deceived all power oppose their fears increasing as decrease their woes jealous of bondage while they freedom gain and most obliged most eager to complain but well we count our bliss if well we view when power oppression not protection grew view present ills that punish distant climes or bleed in memory here from ancient times mark first the robe abused religion wore storied with griefs and stained with human gore what various tortures engines fires reveal studied empowered and sanctified by zeal stop here my muse  peculiar woes descry bid em in sad succession strike thy eye lo to her eye the sad succession springs she looks she weeps and as she weeps she sings see the doomed hebrew of his stores bereft see holy murder justify the theft his ravaged gold some useless shrine shall raise his gems on superstitious idols blaze his wife his babe denied their little home stripped starved unfriended and unpitied roam lo the priests hand the wafergod supplies a king by consecrated poison dies see learning range you broad etherial plain from world to world and godlike science gain ah what avails the curious search sustained the finished toil the godlike science gained sentenced to flames thexpansive wisdom fell and truth from heaven was sorcery from hell see reason bid each mystic wile retire strike out new light and mark  the wise admire zeal shall such heresy like learning hate the same their glory and the same their fate lo from sought mercy one his life receives life worse than death that cruel mercy gives the man perchance who wealth and honors bore slaves in the mine or ceaseless strains the oar so doomed are these and such perhaps our doom owned we a prince avert it heaven from rome nor private worth alone false zeal assails whole nations bleed when bigotry prevails what are sworn friendships what are kindred ties what is faith with heresy the zealot cries see when war sinks the thundering cannons roar when wounds and death and discord are no more when music bids undreading joys advance swell the soft hour and turn the swimming dance when to crown these the social sparkling bowl lifts the cheered sense and pours out all the soul sudden he sends red massacre abroad faithless to man to prove his faith to god what pure persuasive eloquence denies alldrunk with blood the arguing sword supplies the sword which to the assassins hand is given the assassins hand  pronounced the hand of heaven sex bleeds with sex and infancy with age no rank no place no virtue stops his rage shall sword and flame and devastation cease to please with zeal wild zeal the god of peace nor less abuse has scourged the civil state when a kings will became a nations fate enormous power nor noble nor serene now fierce and cruel now but wild and mean see titles sold to raise the unjust supply compelled the purchase or be fined or buy no public spirit guarded well by laws uncensurd censures in his countrys cause see from the merchant forced the unwilling loan who dares deny or deem his wealth his own denying see where dungeondamps arise diseased he pines and unassisted dies far more than massacre that fate accursed as of all deaths the lingering is the worst new courts of censure grieved with new offense taxed without power and fined without pretense explained at will each statutes wrested aim till marks of merit were the marks of shame so monstrous  life was the severest grief and the worst death seemed welcome for relief in vain the subject sought redress from law no senate lived the partial judge to awe senates were void and senators confined for the great cause of nature and mankind who kings superior to the people own yet prove the law superior to the throne who can review without a generous tear a church a state so impious so severe a land unculturd through polemic jars rich  but with carnage from intestine wars the hand of industry employed no more and commerce flying to some safer shore all property reduced to power a prey and sense and learning chased by zeal away who honors not each dear departed ghost that strove for liberty so won so lost so well regained when godlike william rose and first entailed the blessing george bestows may walpole still the growing triumph raise and bid these emulate elizas days still serve a prince who over his people great as far transcends in virtue as in state the muse pursues thee to thy rural seat even there shall liberty inspire retreat when solemn cares in flowing wit are drowned and sportive chat and social laughs go round even then when pausing mirth begins to fail the converse varies to the serious tale the tale pathetic speaks some wretch that owes to some deficient law reliefless woes what instant pity warms thy generous breast how all the legislator stands confessed now springs the hint it is now improved to thought now ripe and now to public welfare brought new bills which regulating means bestow justice preserve yet softening mercy know justice shall low vexatious wiles decline and still thrive most when lawyers most repine justice from jargon shall refined appear to knowledge through our native language clear hence may we learn no more deceived by law whence wealth and life their best assurance draw the freed insolvent with industrious hand strives yet to satisfy the just demand thus ruthless men who would his powers restrain often what severity would lose obtain these and a thousand gifts thy thought acquires which liberty benevolent inspires from liberty the fruits of law increase plenty and joy and all the arts of peace abroad the merchant while the tempests rave adventurous sails nor fears the wind and wave at home untird we find the auspicious hand with flocks and herds and harvests bless the land while there the peasant glads the grateful soil here mark the shipwright there the mason toil hew square and rear magnificent the stone and give our oaks a glory not their own what life demands by this obeys her call and added elegance consummates all thus stately cities statelier navies rise and spread our grandeur under distant skies from liberty each nobler science sprung a bacon brightened and a spenser sung a clarke and lock new tracks of truth explore and newton reaches heights unreachd before what trade sees property that wealth maintain which industry no longer dreads to gain what tender conscience kneels with fears resigned enjoys her worship and avows her mind what genius now from want to fortune climbs and to safe science every thought sublimes what royal power from his superior state sees public happiness his own create but kens those patriotsouls to which he owes of old each source whence now each blessing flows and if such spirits from their heaven descend and blended flame to point one glorious end flame from one breast and thence on britain shine what love what praise
