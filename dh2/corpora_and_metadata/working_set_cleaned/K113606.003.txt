    an history of animals chap i of ruminating animals of all animals those that chew the cud are the most harmless and the most easily tamed as they live entirely upon vegetables it is neither their interest nor their pleasure to make war upon the rest of the brute creation content with the pastures where they are placed they seldom desire to change while they are furnished with a proper supply and fearing nothing from each other they generally go in herds for their mutual security all the fiercest of the carnivorous kinds seek their food in gloomy solitude these on the contrary range together the very meanest of them are found to unite in each others defense and the hare itself is a gregarious animal in those countries where it has no other enemies but the beasts of the forest to guard against  as the food of ruminant animals is entirely of the vegetable kind and as this is very easily procured so these animals seem naturally more indolent and less artful than those of the carnivorous kinds and as their appetites are more simple their instincts seem to be less capable of variation the fox or the wolf are for ever prowling their long habits of want give them a degree of sharpness and cunning their life is a continued scene of stratagem and escape but the patient ox or the deer enjoy the repast that nature has abundantly provided certain of subsistence and content with security  as nature has furnished these animals with an appetite for such coarse and simple nutriment so she has enlarged the capacity of the intestines to take in a greater supply in the carnivorous kinds as their food is nourishing and juicy their stomachs are but small and their intestines short but in these whose pasture is coarse and where much must be accumulated before any quantity of nourishment can be obtained their stomachs are large and numerous and their intestines long and muscular the bowels of a ruminating animal may be considered as an elaboratory with vessels in it fitted for various transmutations it requires a long and tedious process before grass can be transmuted into flesh and for this purpose nature in general has furnished such animals as feed upon grass with four stomachs through which the food successively passes and undergoes the proper separations  of the four stomachs with which ruminant animals are furnished the first is called the paunch which receives the food after it has been slightly chewed the second is called the honeycomb and is properly nothing more than a continuation of the former these two which are very capacious the animal fills as fast as it can and then lies down to ruminate which may be properly considered as a kind of vomiting without effort or pain the two stomachs abovementioned being filled with as much as they can contain and the grass which was slightly chewed beginning to swell with the heat of the situation it dilates the stomachs and these again contract upon their contents the aliment thus squeezed has but two passages to escape at one into the third stomach which is very narrow and the other back by the gullet into the mouth which is wider the greatest quantity therefore is driven back through the largest aperture into the mouth to be chewed a second time while a small part and that only the most liquid is driven into the third stomach through the orifice which is so small the food which is driven to the mouth and chewed a second time is thus rendered more soft and moist and becomes at last liquid enough to pass into the conduit that goes to the third stomach where it undergoes a still farther comminution in this stomach which is called the manyfold from the number of its leaves all which tend to promote digestion the grass has the appearance of boiled spinach but not yet sufficiently reduced so as to make a part of the animals nourishment it requires the operation of the fourth stomach for this purpose where it undergoes a complete maceration and is separated to be turned into chyle  but nature has not been less careful in another respect in fitting the intestines of these animals for their food in the carnivorous kinds they are thin and lean but in ruminating animals they are strong fleshy and well covered with fat every precaution seems taken that can help their digestion their stomach is strong and muscular the more readily to act upon its contents their intestines are lined with fat the better to preserve their warmth and they are extended to a much greater length so as to extract every part of that nourishment which their vegetable food so scantily supplies  in this manner are all quadrupedes of the cow the sheep or the deer kind seen to ruminate being thus furnished with four stomachs for the macerating of their food these therefore may most properly be called the ruminant kinds although there are many others that have this quality in a less observable degree the rhinoceros the camel the horse the rabbit the marmotte and the squirrel all chew the cud by intervals although they are not furnished with stomachs like the former but not these alone there are numberless other animals that appear to ruminate not only birds but fishes and insects among birds are the pelican the stork the heron the pidgeon and the turtle these have a power of disgorging their food to feed their young among fishes are lobsters crabs and that fish called the dorado the salmon also is said to be of this number and if we may believe ovid the scarus likewise of which he says at contra herbosa pisces laxantur arena ut scarus epastas solus qui ruminat escas   of all the fish that graze beneath the flood he only ruminates his former food of insects the ruminating tribe is still larger the mole the cricket the wasp the drone the be the grasshopper and the beetle all these animals either actually chew the cud or seem at least to ruminate they have the stomach composed of muscular fibers by means whereof the food is ground up and down in the same manner as in those which are particularly distinguished by the appellation of ruminants  but not these alone men themselves have been often known to ruminate and some even with pleasure the accounts of these calamities for such i must consider them incident to our fellow creatures are not very pleasant to read yet i must transcribe a short one as given us by slare in the philosophical transactions as it may in some measure show the satisfaction which the lower tribes of animals enjoy while they ruminate the man in question was a citizen of bristol of about twenty years of age and what seemed more extraordinary still of a ruminating family for his father was frequently subject to the same infirmity or amusement as he himself perhaps would call it this young man usually began to chew his meat over again within about a quarter of an hour after eating his ruminating after a full meal generally lasted about an hour and an half nor could he sleep until this task was performed the victuals upon the return tasted even more pleasantly than at first and returned as if they had been beaten up in a mortar if he ate a variety of things that which he ate first came up again first and if this return was interrupted for any time it produced sickness and disorder and he was never well till it returned instances of this kind however are rare and accidental and it is happy for mankind that they are so of all other animals we spend the least time in eating this is one of the great distinctions between us and the brute creation and eating is a pleasure of so low a kind that none but such as are nearly allied to the quadrupede desire its prolongation  chap ii of quadrupedes of the cow kind of all ruminant animals those of the cow kind deserve the first rank both for their size their beauty and their services the horse is more properly an animal belonging to the rich the sheep chiefly thrives in a flock and requires attendance but the cow is more especially the poor mans pride his riches and his support there are many of our peasantry that have no other possession but a cow and even of the advantages resulting from this most useful creature the poor are but the nominal possessors its flesh they cannot pretend to taste since then their whole riches are at once destroyed its calf they are obliged to fatten for sale since veal is a delicacy they could not make any pretensions to its very milk is wrought into butter and cheese for the tables of their masters while they have no share even in their own possession but the choice of their market i cannot bear to hear the rich crying out for liberty while they thus starve their fellow creatures and feed them up with an imaginary good while they monopolize the real benefits of nature  in those countries where the men are under better subordination this excellent animal is of more general advantage in germany poland and switzerland every peasant keeps two or three cows not for the benefit of his master but for himself the meanest of the peasants there kills one cow at least for his own table which he salts and hangs up and thus preserves as a delicacy all the year round there is scarce a cottage in those countries that is not hung round with these marks of hospitality and which often make the owner better contented with hunger since he has it in his power to be luxurious when he thinks proper a piece of beef hung up there is considered as an elegant piece of furniture which though seldom touched at least argues the possessors opulence and ease but it is very different for some years past in this country where our lower rustics at least are utterly unable to purchase meat any part of the year and by them even butter is considered as an article of extravagance  the climate and pasture of great britain however is excellently adapted to this animals moderate nature and the verdure and the fertility of our plains are perfectly suited to the manner of its feeding for wanting the upper fore teeth it loves to graze in an high rich pasture this animal seems but little regardful of the quality of its food provided it be supplied in sufficient abundance it makes no particular distinctions in the choice of its herbage but indiscriminately and hastily devours the proper quantity for this reason in our pastures where the grass is rather high than succulent more flourishing than nutritious the cow thrives admirably and there is no part of europe where the tame animal grows so large yields more milk or more readily fattens than with us  our pastures supply them with abundance and they in return enrich the pasture for of all animals the cow seems to give back more than it takes from the soil the horse and the sheep are known in a course of years to impoverish the ground the land where they have fed becomes weedy and the vegetables coarse and unpalatable on the contrary the pasture where the cow has been bred acquires a finer softer surface and becomes every year more beautiful and even the reason is that the horse being furnished with fore teeth in the upper jaw nips the grass closely and therefore only chooses that which is the most delicate and tender the sheep also though with respect to its teeth formed like the cow only bites the most succulent parts of the herbage these animals therefore leave all the high weeds standing and while they cut the finer grass too closely suffer the ranker herbage to vegetate and overrun the pasture but it is otherwise with the cow as its teeth cannot come so close to the ground as those of the horse nor so readily as those of the sheep which are less it is obliged to feed upon the tallest vegetables that offer thus it eats them all down and in time levels the surface of the pasture  the age of the cow is known by the teeth and horns this animal is furnished with eight cutting teeth in the lower jaw at the age of ten months the two middlemost of these fall out and are replaced by others that are not so white but broader at the age of sixteen months the two next milkwhite teeth fall out likewise and others come up in their room thus at the end of every six months the creature loses and gains till at the age of three years all the cutting teeth are renewed and then they are long pretty white and equal but in proportion as the animal advances in years they become irregular and black their inequalities become smoother and the animal less capable of chewing its food thus the cow often declines from this single cause for as it is obliged to eat a great deal to support life and as the smoothness of the teeth makes the difficulty of chewing great a sufficient quantity of food cannot be supplied to the stomach thus the poor animal sinks in the midst of plenty and every year grows leaner and leaner till it dies  the horns are another and a surer method of determining this animals age at three years old it sheds its horns and new ones arise in their place which continue as long as it lives at four years of age the cow has small pointed neat smooth horns thickest near the head at five the horns become larger and are marked round with the former years growth thus while the animal continues to live the horns continue to lengthen and every year a new ring is added at the root so that allowing three years before their appearance and then reckoning the number of rings we have in both together the animals age exactly  as we have indisputably the best breed of horned cattle of any in europe so it was not without the same assiduity that we came to excel in these as in our horses the breed of cows has been entirely improved by a foreign mixture properly adapted to supply the imperfections of our own such as are purely british are far inferior in size to those on many parts of the continent but those which we have thus improved by far excel all others our lincolnshire kind derive their size from the holstein breed and the large hornless cattle that are bred in some parts of england came originally from poland we were once famous for a wild breed of these animals but these have long since been worn out and perhaps no kingdom in europe can furnish so few wild animals of all kinds as our own cultivation and agriculture are sure to banish these wherever they are found and every addition a country receives from art drives away those animals that are only fitted for a state of nature  of all quadrupedes the cow seems most liable to alteration from its pasture in the different parts of our own country we easily perceive the great varieties produced among these animals by the richness or poverty of the soil in some they grow to a great bulk and i have seen an ox sixteen hands high which is taller than the general run of our horses in others they appear as diminutive being not so large as an ass the breed of the isle of man and most parts of scotland is much less in general than in england or ireland they are differently shaped also the dewlap being much smaller and as the expression is the beast has more of the ewe neck this till some years ago was considered in cattle as a deformity and the cow was chosen according to virgils direction with a large dewlap however at present it is the universal opinion that the cow wants in udder what it has in neck and the larger the dewlap the smaller is the quantity of its milk our graziers now therefore endeavor to mix the two breeds the large holstein with the small northern and from both results that fine milch breed which excels the cattle of any other part of the world  this difference arising from pasture is more observable in other countries than in our own the cow kind is to be found in almost every part of the world large in proportion to the richness of the pasture and small as the animal is stinted in its food thus africa is remarkable for the largest and the smallest cattle of this kind as is also india poland switzerland and several other parts of europe among the eluth tartars where the pastures are remarkably rich and nourishing the cow becomes so large that he must be a tall man who can reach the tip of its shoulder on the contrary in france where the animal is stinted in its food and driven from the most flourishing pastures it greatly degenerates  but the differences in the size of this animal are not so remarkable as those which are found in its form its hair and its horns the difference is so very extraordinary in many of them that they have been even considered as a different kind of creature and names have been given them as a distinct species when in reality they are all the same buffon vol xxiii p     in this manner the urus and the bison have been considered from the variety in their make to be distinct in their production but they are all in fact the descendants of one common stock as they have that certain mark of unity they breed and propagate among each other naturalists have therefore labored under an obvious error when because of the extreme bulk of the urus or because of the hump upon the back of the bison they assigned them different places in the creation and separated a class of animals which was really united it is true the horse and the ass do not differ so much in form as the cow and the bison nevertheless the former are distinct animals as their breed is marked with sterility the latter are animals of the same kind as their breed is fruitful and a race of animals is produced in which the hump belonging to the bison is soon worn away the differences therefore between the cow the urus and the bison are merely accidental the same caprice in nature that has given horns to some cows and denied them to others may also have given the bison an hump or increased the bulk of the urus it may have given the one a mane or denied a sufficiency of hair to the other  but before we proceed farther it may be proper to describe these varieties which have been thus taken for distinct kinds this description is chiefly taken from klein  the urus or wild bull is chiefly to be met with in the province of lithuania and grows to a size that scarce any other animal except the elephant is found to equal it is quite black except a stripe mixed with white that runs from the neck to the tail along the top of the back the horns are short thick and strong the eyes are fierce and fiery the forehead is adorned with a kind of garland of black curled hair and some of them are found to have beards of the same the neck is short and strong and the skin has an odor of musk the female though not so big as the male exceeds the largest of our bulls in size nevertheless her udder and teats are so small that they can scarcely be depiction of the bison the bison de seve del isc tailor sculp perceived upon the whole however this animal resembles the tame one very exactly except in some trifling varieties which his state of wildness or the richness of the pastures where he is found may easily have produced  the bison which is another variety of the cow kind differs from the rest in having a lump between its shoulders these animals are of various kinds some very large others as diminutively little in general to regard this animals fore parts he has somewhat the look of a lion with a long shaggy mane and a beard under his chin his head is little his eyes red and fiery with a furious look the forehead is large and the horns so big and so far asunder that three men might often sit between them on the middle of the back there grows a bunch almost as high as that of a camel covered with hair and which is considered as a great delicacy by those that hunt him there is no pursuing him with safety except in forests where there are trees large enough to hide the hunters he is generally taken by pitfalls the inhabitants of those countries where he is found wild diging holes in the ground and covering them over with boughs of trees and grass then provoking the bison to pursue them they get on the opposite side of the pit fall while the furious animal running head foremost falls into the pit prepared for him and is there quickly overcome and slain  besides these real distinctions in the cow kind there have been many others made that appear to be in name only thus the bonasus of which naturalists have given us long descriptions is supposed by klein and buffon to be no more than another name for the bison as the descriptions given of them by the ancients coincide the bubalus also of the ancients which some have supposed to belong to the cow kind buffon places among the lower class of ruminant quadrupedes as it most resembles them in size shape and the figure of its horns of all the varieties therefore of the cow kind there are but two that are really distinct namely the cow and the buffalo these two are separated by nature they seem to bear an antipathy to each other they avoid each other and may be considered as much removed as the horse is from the ass or the zebra when therefore we have described the varieties of the cow kind we shall pass on to the buffalo which being a different animal requires a separate history  there is scarce a part of the world as was said before in which the cow is not found in some one of its varieties either large like the urus or humped as the bison with strait horns or bending inverted backwards or turning sideways to the cheek like those of the ram and in many countries they are found without any horns whatsoever but to be more particular beginning at the north the few kine which subsist in iceland are without horns although of the same race originally with ours the size of these is rather relative to the goodness of the pasture than the warmth or coldness of the climate the dutch frequently bring great quantities of lean cattle from denmark which they fatten on their own rich grounds these are in general of a larger size than their own natural breed and they fatten very easily the cattle of the ukraine where the pasture is excellent become very fat and are considered as the largest breed of all europe in switzerland where the mountains are covered with a rich nourishing herbage which is entirely reserved for their kine these animals grow to a very large size on the contrary in france where they get no other grass but what is thought unfit for horses they dwindle and grow lean in some parts of spain the cow grows to a good size those wild bulls however which they pride themselves so much in combating are a very mean despicable little animal and somewhat shaped like one of our cows with nothing of that peculiar sternness of aspect for which our bulls are remarkable in barbary and the provinces of africa where the ground is dry and the pasturage short the cows are of a very small breed and give milk in proportion on the contrary in ethiopia they are of a prodigious bigness the same holds in persia and tartary where in some places they are very small and in others of an amazing stature it is thus in almost every part of the world this animal is found to correspond in size to the quantity of its provision  if we examine the form of these animals as they are found tame in different regions we shall find that the breed of the urus or those without an hump chiefly occupies the cold and the temperate zones and is not so much dispersed toward the south on the contrary the breed of the bison or the animal with an hump is found in all the southern parts of the world throughout the vast continent of india throughout africa from mount atlas to the cape of good hope in all these countries the bison seems chiefly to prevail where they are found to have a smooth soft hair are very nimble of foot and in some measure supply the want of horses the bison breed is also more expert and docile than ours many of them when they carry burdens bend their knees to take them up or set them down they are treated therefore by the natives of those countries with a degree of tenderness and care equal to their utility and the respect for them in india has degenerated even into blind adoration but it is among the hottentots where these animals are chiefly esteemed as being more than commonly serviceable they are their fellow domestics the companions of their pleasures and fatigues the cow is at once the hottentots protector and servant assists him in attending his flocks and guarding them against every invader while the sheep are grazing the faithful backely as this kind of cow is called stands or grazes beside them still however attentive to the looks of its master the backely flies round the field herds in the sheep that are straying obliges them to keep within proper limits and shows no mercy to robbers or even strangers who attempt to plunder but it is not the plunderers of the stock alone but even the enemies of the nation that these backelys are taught to combat every army of hottentots is furnished with a proper herd of these which are let loose against the enemy when the occasion is most convenient being thus sent forward they overturn all before them they strike every opposer down with their horns and trample upon them with their feet and thus often procure their masters an easy victory even before they have attempted to strike a blow an animal so serviceable it may be supposed is not without its reward the backely lives in the same cottage with its master and by long habit gains an affection for him and in proportion as the man approaches to the brute so the brute seems to attain even to some share of human sagacity the hottentot and his backely thus mutually assist each other and when the latter happens to die a new one is chosen to succeed him by a council of the old men of the village the new backely is then joined with one of the veterans of his own kind from whom he learns his art becomes social and diligent and is taken for life into human friendship and protection  the bisons or cows with an hump are found to differ very much from each other in the several parts of the world where they are found the wild ones of this kind as with us are much larger than the tame some have horns and some are without any some have them depressed and some raised in such a manner that they are useless as weapons of annoyance or defense some are extremely large and others among them such as the zebu or barbary cow are very small they are all however equally docile and gentle when tamed and in general furnished with a fine lustrous soft hair more beautiful than that of our own breed their hump is also of different sizes in some weighing from forty to fifty pounds in others less it is not however to be considered as a part necessarily belonging to the animal and probably it might be cut away without much injury it resembles a gristly fat and as i am assured cuts and tastes somewhat like a dressed udder the bisons of malabar abyssinia and madagascar are of the great kind as the pastures there are plentiful those of arabia petraea and most parts of africa are small and of the zebu or little kind in america especially toward the north the bison is well known the american bison however is found to be rather less than that of the ancient continent its hair is longer and thicker its beard more remarkable and its hide more lustrous and soft there are many of them brought up tame in carolina however their wild dispositions still seem to continue for they break through all fences to get into the cornfields and lead the whole tame herd after them wherever they penetrate they breed also with the tame kinds originally brought over from europe and thus produce a race peculiar to that country  from all this it appears buffon vol xxiii p   0  that naturalists have given various names to animals in reality the same and only differing in some few accidental circumstances the wild cow and the tame the animal belonging to europe and that of asia africa and america the bonafus and the urus the bison and the zebu are all one and the same propagate among each other and in the course of a few generations the hump wears away and scarce any vestiges of savage fierceness are found to remain of all animals therefore except man alone the cow seems most extensively propagated its nature seems equally capable of the rigours of heat and cold it is an inhabitant as well of the frozen fields of iceland as the burning deserts of lybia it seems an ancient inmate in every climate domestic and tame in those countries which have been civilized savage and wild in the countries which are less peopled but capable of being made useful in all able to defend itself in a state of nature against the most powerful enemy of the forest and only subordinate to man whose force it has experienced and whose aid it at last seems to require however wild the calves are which are taken from the dam in a savage state either in africa or asia they soon become humble patient and familiar and man may be considered in those countries as almost helpless without their assistance other animals preserve their nature or their form with inflexible perseverance but these in every respect suit themselves to the appetites and conveniences of mankind and as their shapes are found to alter so also does their nature in no animal is there seen a greater variety of kinds and in none a more humble and pliant disposition  the buffalo if we should compare the shape of our common cow with that of the bison the difference will appear very great the shaggy mane of the latter the beard the curled forehead the inverted horns the broad breast and the narrow hinder parts give it the appearance rather of a lion than a cow and fit it more for a state of war with mankind than a state of servitude yet notwithstanding these appearances both animals are found to be the same or at least so nearly allied that they breed among each other and propagate a race that continues the kind  on the other hand if we compare the buffalo with our common cow no two animals can be more nearly alike either in their form or their nature both equally submissive to the yoke both often living under the same roof and employed in the same domestic services the make and the turn of their bodies so much alike that it requires a close attention to distinguish them and yet after all this no two animals can be more distinct or seem to have stronger antipathies to each other buffon  were there but one of each kind remaining it is probable the race of both would shortly be extinct however such is the fixed aversion formed between these creatures that the cow refuses to breed with the buffalo which it nearly resembles while it is known to propagate with the bison to which it has in point of form but a very distant similitude  the buffalo is upon the whole by no means so beautiful a creature as the cow his figure is more clumsy and awkward his air is wilder and he carries his head lower and nearer the ground his limbs are less fleshy and his tail more naked of hair his body is shorter and thicker than that of the cow kind his legs are higher his head smaller his horns not so round black and compressed with a bunch of curled hair hanging down between them his skin is also harder and thicker more black and less furnished with hair his flesh which is hard and blackish is not only disagreeable to the taste but likewise to the smell the milk of the female is by no means so good as that of the cow it is however produced in great abundance in the warm countries almost all their cheese is made of the milk of the buffalo and they supply butter also in large quantities the veal of the young buffalo is not better eating than the beef of the old the hide of this animal seems to be the most valuable thing he furnishes the leather made of it is well known for its thickness softness and impenetrability as these animals are in general larger and stronger than the cow they are usefully employed in agriculture they are used in drawing burdens and sometimes in carrying them being guided by a ring which is thrust through their nose two buffaloes yoaked in a wagon are said to draw more than four strong horses as their heads and necks are naturally bent downward they are thus better fitted for the draught and the whole weight of their bodies is applied to the carriage that is to be drawn forward  from the size and bulk of the buffalo we may be easily led to conclude that he is a native of the warmer climates the largest quadrupedes are generally found in the torrid zone and the buffalo is inferior in point of size only to the elephant the rhinoceros or the hippopotamos the camelopard or the camel may indeed be taller but they are neither so long or near so corpulent accordingly we find this animal wild in many parts of india and tamed also wherever the natives have occasion for his services the wild buffaloes are very dangerous animals and are often found to gore travelers to death and then trample them with their feet until they have entirely mangled the whole body however in the woods they are not so much to be feared as in the plains because in the violence of their pursuit their large horns are apt to be entangled in the branches of the trees which gives those who have been surprised by them time to escape the danger there is scarce any other method of avoiding their pursuit they run with great swiftness they overturn a tree of moderate growth and are such swimmers as to cross the largest rivers without any difficulty in this manner like all other large animals of the torrid zone they are very fond of the water and in the midst of their pursuit often plunge in in order to cool themselves the negroes of guinea and the indians of malabar where buffaloes are in great abundance take great delight in hunting and destroying them however they never attempt to face the buffalo openly but generally climbing up a tree shoot at him from thence and do not come down till they find they have effectually dispatched him however when they are tamed no animal can be more patient or humble and though by no means so docile as the cow kind yet they go through domestic drudgeries with more strength and perseverance  although these animals be chiefly found in the torrid zone yet they are bred in several parts of europe particularly in italy where they make the food and the riches of the poor the female produces but one at a time in the same manner as the cow but they are very different in the times of gestation for the cow as we know goes but nine months whereas the buffalo continues pregnant for twelve they are all afraid of fire and perhaps in consequence of this have an aversion to red colors that resemble the color of flame it is said that in those countries where they are found in plenty no person dares to dress in scarlet in general they are inoffensive animals if undisturbed as indeed all those which feed upon grass are found to be but when they are wounded or when even but fired at nothing then can stop their fury they then turn up the ground with their fore feet bellow much louder and more terribly than the bull and make at the object of their resentment with ungovernable rage it is happy in such circumstances if the person they pursue has a wall to escape over or some such obstacle otherwise they soon overtake and instantly destroy him it is remarkable however that although their horns are so very formidable they in general make more use of their feet in combat and rather tread their enemies to death than gore them  having thus gone through the history of these animals it may be proper to observe that no names have been more indiscriminately used than those of the bull the urus the bison and the buffalo it therefore becomes such as would have distinct ideas of each to be careful in separating the kinds the one from the other allowing the cow for the standard of all the urus whether of the large enormous kind of lithuania or the smaller race of spain whether with long or short horns whether with or without long hair in the forehead is every way the same with what our common breed was before they were taken from the forest and reduced to a state of servitude the bison and all its varieties which are known by an hump between the shoulders is also to be ranked in the same class this animal whether with crooked or strait horns whether they be turned toward the cheek or totally wanting whether it be large or diminutive whatever be its color or whatever the length of its hair whether called the bonasus by some or the bubalus by others is but a variety of the cow kind with whom it breeds and with whom of consequence it has the closest connection lastly the buffalo though shaped much more like the cow is a distinct kind by itself that never mixes with any of the former that goes twelve months with young whereas the cow goes but nine that testifies an aversion to the latter and though bred under the same roof or feeding in the same pasture has always kept separate and makes a distinct race in all parts of the world these two kinds are supposed to be the only real varieties in the cow kind of which naturalists have given so many varieties with respect to some circumstances mentioned by travelers such as that of many kinds defending themselves by voiding their dung against their pursuers this is a practice which they have in common with other timid creatures when pursued and arises rather from fear than a desire of defense the musky smell also by which some have been distinguished is found common to many of these kinds in a state of nature and does not properly make the characteristic marks of any the particular kind of noise also which some of them are known to make which rather resembles grunting than bellowing or lowing is but a savage variety which many wild animals have and yet lose when brought into a state of tameness for these reasons mr buffon whom i have followed in this description is of opinion that the zebu or little african cow and the grunting or siberian cow are but different races of the bison as the shape of the horns or the length of the hair are never properly characteristic marks of any animal but are found to vary with climate food and cultivation  depiction of the zebu the zebu de seve del isc tailor sculp   in this manner the number of animals of the cow kind which naturalists have extended to eight or ten sorts are reduced to two and as the utmost deference is paid to the opinion of mr buffon in this particular i have taken him for my guide nevertheless there is an animal of the cow kind which neither he nor any other naturalist that i know of has hitherto described yet which makes a very distinct class and may be added as a third species  this animal was shown some years ago in london and seemed to unite many of the characteristics of the cow and the hog having the head the horns and the tail of the former with the bristles the color and the grunting of the latter it was about the size of an ass but broader and thicker the color resembling that of an hog and the hair bristly as in that animal the hair upon the body was thin as in the hog and a row of bristles ran along the spine rather shorter and softer than in the hog kind the head was rather larger than that of a cow the teeth were entirely resembling those of that animal and the tongue was rough in like manner it fed upon hay and consequently its internal conformation must have resembled that of the cow kind more than the hog whose food is always chosen of a kind more succulent the eyes were placed in the head as with the cow and were pretty nearly of the same color the horns were black and flattish but bent rather backwards to the neck as in the goat kind the neck was short and thick and the back rather rising in the middle it was cloven footed like the cow without those hinder claws that are found in the hog kinds but the greatest variety of all in this extraordinary creature which was a female was that it had but two teats and consequently in that respect resembled neither of the kinds to which in other circumstances it bore so strong a similitude whether this animal was a distinct kind or a monster i will not pretend to say it was shown under the name of the bonafus and it was said by the person who showed it to have come from india but no credit is to be given to interested ignorance the person only wanted to make the animal appear as extraordinary as possible and i believe would scarcely scruple a lie or two to increase that wonder in us by which he found the means of living  chap iii of animals of the sheep and goat kind as no two animals are found entirely the same so it is not to be expected that any two races of animals should exactly correspond in every particular the goat and the sheep are apparently different in the form of their bodies in their covering and in their horns they may from hence be considered as two different kinds with regard to all common and domestic purposes but if we come to examine them closer and observe their internal conformation no two animals can be more alike their feet their four stomachs their suet their appetites all are entirely the same and show the similitude between them but what makes a much stronger connection is that they propagate with each other the buck goat is found to produce with the ewe an animal that in two or three generations returns to the sheep and seems to retain no marks of its ancient progenitor buffon passim  the sheep and the goat therefore may be considered as belonging to one family and were the whole races reduced to one of each they would quickly replenish the earth with their kind  if we examine the sheep and goat internally we shall find as was said that their conformation is entirely the same nor is their structure very remote from that of the cow kind which they resemble in their hoofs and in their chewing the cud indeed all ruminant animals are internally very much alike the goat the sheep or the deer exhibit to the eye of the anatomist the same parts in miniature which the cow or the bison exhibited in the great but the differences between those animals are nevertheless sufficiently apparent nature has obviously marked the distinctions between the cow and the sheep kind by their form and size and they are also distinguished from those of the deer kind by never shedding their horns indeed the form and figure of these animals if there were nothing else would seldom fail of guiding us to the kind and we might almost upon sight tell which belongs to the deer kind and which are to be degraded into that of the goat however the annually shedding the horns in the deer and the permanence in the sheep draws a pretty exact line between the kinds so that we may hold to this distinction only and define the sheep and goat kind as ruminant animals of a smaller size that never shed their horns  if we consider these harmless and useful animals in one point of view we shall find that both have been long reclaimed and brought into a state of domestic servitude both seem to require protection from man and are in some measure pleased with his society the sheep indeed is the more serviceable creature of the two but the goat has more sensibility and attachment the attending upon both was once the employment of the wisest and the best of men and those have been ever supposed the happiest times in which these harmless creatures were considered as the chief objects of human attention in the earliest ages the goat seemed rather the greater favorite and indeed it continues such to this day among the poor however the sheep has long since become the principal object of human care while the goat is disregarded by the generality of mankind or become the possession only of the lowest of the people the sheep therefore and its varieties may be considered first and the goat with all those of its kind will then properly follow  the sheep those animals that take refuge under the protection of man in a few generations become indolent and helpless having lost the habit of selfdefence they seem to lose also the instincts of nature the sheep in its present domestic state is of all animals the most defenseless and inoffensive with its liberty it seems to have been deprived of its swiftness and cunning and what in the ass might rather be called patience in the sheep appears to be stupidity with no one quality to fit it for selfpreservation it makes vain efforts at all without swiftness it endeavors to fly and without strength sometimes offers to oppose but these feeble attempts rather incite than repress the insults of every enemy and the dog follows the flock with greater delight upon seeing them fly and attacks them with more fierceness upon their unsupported attempts at resistance indeed they run together in flocks rather with the hopes of losing their single danger in the crowd than of uniting to repress the attack by numbers the sheep therefore were it exposed in its present state to struggle with its natural enemies of the forest it would soon be extirpated loaded with an heavy fleece deprived of the defense of its horns and rendered heavy slow and feeble it can have no other safety but what it finds from man this animal is now therefore obliged to rely solely upon that art for protection to which it originally owes its degradation  but we are not to impute to nature the formation of an animal so utterly unprovided against its enemies and so unfit for defense the moufflon which is the sheep in a savage state is a bold fleet creature able to escape from the greater animals by its swiftness or to oppose the smaller kinds with the arms it has received from nature it is by human art alone that the sheep is become the tardy defenseless creature we find it every race of quadrupedes might easily be corrupted by the same allurements by which the sheep has been thus debilitated and depressed while undisturbed and properly supplied none are found to set any bounds to their appetite they all pursue their food while able and continue to graze till they often die of disorders occasioned by too much fatness but it is very different with them in a state of nature they are in the forest surrounded by dangers and alarmed with unceasing hostilities they are pursued every hour from one tract of country to another and spend a great part of their time in attempts to avoid their enemies thus constantly exercised and continually practicing all the arts of defense and escape the animal at once preserves its life and native independance together with its swiftness and the slender agility of its form  the sheep in its servile state seems to be divested of all inclinations of its own and of all animals it appears the most stupid every quadrupede has a peculiar turn of countenance a physiognomy if we may so call it that generally marks its nature the sheep seems to have none of those traits that betoken either courage or cunning its large eyes separated from each other its ears sticking out on each side and its narrow nostrils all testify the extreme simplicity of this creature and the position of its horns also show that nature designed the sheep rather for flight than combat it appears a large mass of flesh supported upon four small strait legs ill fitted for carrying such a burden its motions are awkward it is easily fatigued and often sinks under the weight of its own corpulency in proportion as these marks of human transformation are more numerous the animal becomes more helpless and stupid those which live upon a more fertile pasture and grow fat become entirely feeble those that want horns are found more dull and heavy than the rest daubenton upon the sheep  those whose fleeces are longest and finest are most subject to a variety of disorders and in short whatever changes have been wrought in this animal by the industry of man are entirely calculated for human advantage and not for that of the creature itself it might require a succession of ages before the sheep could be restored to its primitive state of activity so as to become a match for its pursuers of the forest  the goat which it resembles in so many other respects is much its superior the one has its particular attachments sees danger and generally contrives to escape it but the other is timid without a cause and secure when real danger approaches nor is the sheep when bred up tame in the house and familiarized with its keepers less obstinately absurd from being dull and timid it then acquires a degree of pert familiarity buts with its head becomes mischievous and shows itself every way unworthy of being singled out from the rest of the flock thus it seems rather formed for slavery than friendship and framed more for the necessities than the amusements of mankind there is but one instance in which the sheep shows any attachment to its keeper and that is seen rather on the continent than among us in great britain what i allude to is their following the sound of the shepherds pipe before i had seen them trained in this manner i had no conception of those descriptions in the old pastoral poets of the shepherd leading his flock from one country to another as i had been used only to see these harmless creatures driven before their keepers i supposed that all the rest was but invention but in many parts of the alps and even some provinces of france the shepherd and his pipe are still continued with true antique simplicity the flock is regularly penned every evening to preserve them from the wolf and the shepherd returns homeward at sunset with his sheep following him and seemingly pleased with the sound of the pipe which is blown with a reed and resembles the chanter of a bagpipe in this manner in those countries that still continue poor the arcadian life is preserved in all its former purity but in countries where a greater inequality of conditions prevail the shepherd is generally some poor wretch who attends a flock from which he is to derive no benefits and only guards those luxuries which he is not fated to share  it does not appear from early writers that the sheep was bred in britain and it was not till several ages after this animal was cultivated that the woollen manufacture was carried on among us british zoology vol i p     that valuable branch of business lay for a considerable time in foreign hands and we were obliged to import the cloth manufactured from our own materials there were notwithstanding many unavailing efforts among our kings to introduce and preserve the manufacture at home henry the second by a patent granted to the weavers in london directed that if any cloth was found made of a mixture of spanish wool it should be burned by the mayor such edicts at length although but slowly operated toward the establishing this trade among us the flemings who at the revival of arts possessed the art of clothworking in a superior degree were invited to settle here and soon after foreign cloth was prohibited from being worn in england in the times of queen elizabeth this manufacture received every encouragement and many of the inhabitants of the netherlands being then forced by the tyranny of spain to take refuge in this country they improved us in those arts in which we at present excel the rest of the world every art however has its rise its meridian and its decline and it is supposed by many that the woollen manufacture has for some time been decaying amongst us the cloth now made is thought to be much worse than that of some years past being neither so firm nor so fine neither so much courted abroad nor so serviceable at home  no country however produces such sheep as england either with larger fleeces or better adapted for the business of clothing those of spain indeed are finer and we generally require some of their wool to work up with our own but the weight of a spanish fleece is no way comparable to one of lincoln or warwickshire and in those counties it is no uncommon thing to give fifty guineas for a ram  the sheep without horns are counted the best sort because a great part of the animals nourishment is supposed to go up into the horns lisles husbandry vol ii p      sheep like other ruminant animals want the upper fore teeth but have eight in the lower jaw two of these drop and are replaced at two years old four of them are replaced at three years old and all at four the new teeth are easily known from the rest by their freshness and whiteness there are some breeds however in england that never change their teeth at all these the shepherds call the leather mouthed cattle and as their teeth are thus longer wearing they are generally supposed to grow old a year or two before the rest lisles husbandry vol ii p      the sheep bring forth one or two at a time and sometimes three or four the first lamb of an ewe is generally potbellied short and thick and of less value than those of a second or third production the third being supposed the best of all they bear their young five months and by being housed they bring forth at any time of the year  but this animal in its domestic state is too well known to require a detail of its peculiar habits or of the arts which have been used to improve the breed indeed in the eye of an observer of nature every art which tends to render the creature more helpless and useless to itself may be considered rather as an injury than an improvement and if we are to look for this animal in its noblest state we must seek for it in the african desert or the extensive plains of siberia among the degenerate descendants of the wild sheep there have been so many changes wrought as entirely to disguise the kind and often to mislead the observer the variety is so great that scarce any two countries has its sheep of the same kind but there is found a manifest difference in all either in the size the covering the shape or the horns  the woolly sheep buffon vol xxiii p      as it is seen among us is found only in europe and some of the temperate provinces of asia when transported into warmer countries either into florida or guinea it loses its wool and assumes a covering fitted to the climate becoming hairy and rough it there also loses its fertility and its flesh no longer has the same flavor in the same manner in the very cold countries it seems equally helpless and a stranger it still requires the unceasing attention of mankind for its preservation and although it is found to subsist as well in greenland as in guinea krantz  yet it seems a natural inhabitant of neither  of the domestic kinds to be found in the different parts of the world besides our own which is common in europe the first variety is to be seen in iceland muscovy and the coldest climates of the north this which may be called the iceland sheep resembles our breed in the form of the body and the tail but differs in a very extraordinary manner in the number of the horns being generally found to have four and sometimes even eight growing from different parts of the forehead these are large and formidable and the animal seems thus fitted by nature for a state of war however it is of the nature of the rest of its kind being mild gentle and timid its wool is very different also from that of the common sheep being long smooth and hairy its color is of a dark brown and under its outward coat of hair it has an internal covering that rather resembles fur than wool being fine short and soft  the second variety to be found in this animal is that of the broad taild sheep so common in tartary arabia persia barbary syria and egypt this sheep is only remarkable for its large and heavy tail which is often found to weigh from twenty to thirty pounds it sometimes grows a foot broad and is obliged to be supported by a small kind of board that goes upon wheels this tail is not covered underneath with wool like the upper part but is bare and the natives who consider it as a very great delicacy are very careful in attending and preserving it from injury mr buffon supposes that the fat which falls into the caul in our sheep goes in these to furnish the tail and that the rest of the body is from thence deprived of fat in proportion with regard to their fleeces in the temperate climates they are as in our own breed soft and woolly but in the warmer latitudes they are hairy yet in both they preserve the enormous size of their tails  the third observable variety is that of the sheep called strepsicheros this animal is a native of the islands of the archipelago and only differs from our sheep in having strait horns surrounded with a spiral furrow  the last variety is that of the guinea sheep which is generally found in all the tropical climates both of africa and the east indies they are of a large size with a rough hairy skin short horns and ears hanging down with a kind of dewlap under the chin they differ greatly in form from the rest and might be considered as animals of another kind were they not known to breed with other sheep these of all the domestic kinds seem to approach the nearest to the state of nature they are larger stronger and swifter than the common race and consequently better fitted for a precarious forest life however they seem to rely depiction of the mouttlon mouflon the mouttlon de seve del isc tailor sculp like the rest on man for support being entirely of a domestic nature and subsisting only in the warmer climates  such are the varieties of this animal which have been reduced into a state of domestic servitude these are all capable of producing among each other all the peculiarities of their form have been made by climate and human cultivation and none of them seem sufficiently independent to live in a state of savage nature they are therefore to be considered as a degenerate race formed by the hand of man and propagated merely for his benefit at the same time while man thus cultivates the domestic kinds he drives away and destroys the savage race which are less beneficial and more headstrong these therefore are to be found in but a very small number in the most uncultivated countries where they have been able to subsist by their native swiftness and strength it is in the more uncultivated parts of greece sardinia corsica and particularly in the deserts of tartary that the mufflon is to be found that bears all the marks of being the primitive race and that has been actually known to breed with the domestic animal  the moufflon or musmon though covered with hair bears a stronger similitude to the ram than to any other animal like the ram it has the eyes placed near the horns and its ears are shorter than those of the goat it also resembles the ram in its horns and in all the particular contours of its form the horns also are alike they are of a yellow color they have three sides as in the ram and bend backwards in the same manner behind the ears the muzzle and the inside of the ears are of a whitish color tinctured with yellow the other parts of the face are of a brownish gray the general color of the hair over the body is of a brown approaching to that of the red deer the inside of the thighs and belly are of a white tinctured with yellow the form upon the whole seems more made for agility and strength than that of the common sheep and the moufflon is actually found to live in a savage state and maintain itself either by force or swiftness against all the animals that live by rapine such is its extreme speed that many have been inclined rather to rank it among the deer kind than the sheep but in this they are deceived as the musmon has a mark that entirely distinguishes it from that species being known never to shed its horns in some these are seen to grow to a surprising size many of them measuring in their convolutions above two else long they are of a yellow color as was said but the older the animal grows the darker the horns become with these they often maintain very furious battles between each other and sometimes they are found broken off in such a manner that the small animals of the forest creep into the cavity for shelter gmelin as quoted by buffon  when the musmon is seen standing on the plain his fore legs are always strait while his hinder legs seem bent under him but in cases of more active necessity this seeming deformity is removed and he moves with great swiftness and agility the female very much resembles the male of this species but that she is less and her horns also are never seen to grow to that prodigious size they are of in the wild ram such is the sheep in its savage state a bold noble and even beautiful animal but it is not the most beautiful creatures that are always found most useful to man human industry has therefore destroyed its grace to improve its utility  the goat and its numerous varieties there are some domestic animals that seem as auxiliaries to the more useful sorts and that by ceasing to be the first are considered as nothing we have seen the services of the ass slighted because inferior to those of the horse and in the same manner those of the goat are held cheap because the sheep so far exceeds it were the horse or the sheep removed from nature the inferior kinds would then be invaluable and the same arts would probably be bestowed in perfecting their kinds that the higher order of animals have experienced but in their present neglected state they vary but little from the wild animals of the same kind man has left them their primitive habits and forms and the less they owe to his assiduity the more they receive from nature  the goat seems in every respect more fitted for a life of savage liberty than the sheep buffon  it is naturally more lively and more possessed with animal instinct it easily attaches itself to man and seems sensible of his caresses it is also stronger and swifter more courageous and more playful lively capricious and vagrant it is not easily confined to its flock but chooses its own pastures and loves to stray remote from the rest it chiefly delights in climbing precipices in going to the very edge of danger it is often seen suspended upon an eminence hanging over the sea upon a very little base and even sleeps there in security nature has in some measure fitted it for traversing these declivities with ease the hoof is hollow underneath with sharp edges so that it walks as securely on the ridge of an house as on the level ground it is an hardy animal and very easily sustained for which reason it is chiefly the property of the poor who have no pastures with which to supply it happily however it seems better pleased with the neglected wild than the cultivated fields of art it chooses the heathy mountain or the shrubby rock its favorite food is the tops of the boughs or the tender bark of young trees it seems less afraid of immoderate heat and bears the warm climates better than the sheep it sleeps exposed to the sun and seems to enjoy its warmest fervours neither is it terrified at the storm or incommoded by the rain immoderate cold alone seems to affect it and is said to produce a vertigo with which this animal is sometimes incommoded the inconstancy of its nature is perceivable in the irregularity of its gait it goes forward stops runs approaches flies merely from caprice and with no other seeming reason than the extreme vivacity of its disposition  there are proofs of this animals being naturally the friend of man and that the goat seldom resumes its primoeval wildness when once reduced into a state of servitude in the year school an english vessel happening to touch at the islands of bonavista two negroes came and offered the sailors as many goats as they chose to take away upon the captains expressing his astonishment at this offer the negroes assured him that there were but twelve persons in the island and that the goats were multiplied in such a manner as even to become a nuisance they added that instead of giving any trouble to catch them they followed the few inhabitants that were left with a sort of obstinacy and rather became importunate with their tameness  the goat produces but two at a time and three at the most but in the warmer climates although the animal degenerates and grows less yet it becomes more fruitful being generally found to bring forth three four and five at a single delivery the buck is capable of propagating at the age of one year and the female at seven months however the fruits of this premature generation are weak and defective and their best breedingtime is generally delayed till the age of two years or eighteen months at least one buck is sufficient for an hundred and fifty goats his appetites are excessive but this ardour brings on a speedy decay so that he is enervated in four years at most and even becomes old before he reaches his seventh year the goat like the sheep continues five months with young and in some places bears twice a year  the milk of the goat is sweet nourishing and medicinal not so apt to curdle upon the stomach as that of the cow and therefore preferable to those whose digestion is but weak the peculiarity of this animals food gives the milk a flavor different from that either of the cow or the sheep for as it generally feeds upon shrubby pastures and heathy mountains there is an agreeable wildness in the taste very pleasing to such as are fond of that aliment in several parts of ireland and the highlands of scotland the goat makes the chief possession of the inhabitants on those mountains where no other useful animal could find subsistence the goat continues to glean a sufficient living and supplies the hardy natives with what they consider as varied luxury they lie upon beds made of their skins which are soft clean and wholesome they live upon their milk with oat bread they convert a part of it into butter and some into cheese the flesh indeed they seldom taste of as it is a delicacy which they find too expensive however the kid is considered even by the city epicure as a great rarity and the flesh of the goat when properly prepared is ranked by some as no way inferior to venison in this manner even in the wildest solitudes the poor find comforts of which the rich do not think it worth their while to dispossess them in these mountainous retreats where the landscape presents only a scene of rocks heaths and shrubs that speak the wretchedness of the soil these simple people have their feasts and their pleasures their faithful flock of goats attends them to these awful solitudes and furnishes them with all the necessaries of life while their remote situation happily keeps them ignorant of greater luxury  as these animals are apt to stray from the flock no man can attend above fifty of them at a time they are fattened in the same manner as sheep but taking every precaution their flesh is never so good or so sweet in our climate as that of mutton it is otherwise between the tropics the mutton there becomes flabby and lean while the flesh of the goat rather seems to improve and in some places the latter is cultivated in preference to the former we therefore find this animal in almost every part of the world as it seems fitted for the necessities of man in both extremes toward the north where the pasture is coarse and barren the goat is fitted to find a scanty subsistence between the tropics where the heat is excessive the goat is fitted to bear the climate and its flesh is found to improve  one of the most remarkable varieties we find in the goat is in that of natolia the natolian goat or as mr buffon calls it the goat of angora has the ears longer than ours and broader in proportion the male has horns of about the same length with the goat of europe but black and turned very differently going out horizontally on each side of the head and twisted round in the manner of a corkscrew the horns of the female are shorter and encircle the ear somewhat like those of the ram they are of a dazzling white color and in all the hair is very long thick fine and glossy which indeed is the case with almost all the animals of syria there are a great number of animals about angora where the inhabitants drive trade with their hair which is sold either raw or manufactured into all parts of europe nothing can exceed the beauty of the stuffs which are made from the hair of almost all the animals of that country these are well known among us by the name of camlet  a second variety is the assyrian goat of gesner which is somewhat larger than ours with ears almost hanging down to the ground and broad in proportion the horns on the contrary are not above two inches and an half long black and bending a little backwards the hair is of a fox color and under the throat there are two excrescences like the gills of a cock these animals are chiefly kept round aleppo for the sake of their milk they are driven through the streets and their milk is sold to the inhabitants as they pass along  in the third variety may be reckoned the little goat of america which is of the size of a kid but the hair is as long as that of the ordinary breed the horns which do not exceed the length of a mans finger are thick and bend downwards so close to the head that they almost enter the skin  there is an animal of this kind at the cape of good hope called the blue goat which may be ranked as the fourth variety it is in shape like the domestic but much larger being nearly of the size of a stag its hair is very short and of a delightful blue but it loses a great deal of its beauty when the animal is dead it has a very long beard but the horns are not so long in proportion as in other goats being turned spirally in the manner of a corkscrew it has very long legs but well proportioned and the flesh is very well tasted but lean for this reason in that plentiful country it is chiefly killed upon account of its skin it is a very shy animal and seldom comes near the dutch settlements but they are found in great abundance in the more uncultivated parts of the country besides these they are found in this extensive region of various colors and many of them are spotted beautifully with red white and brown  in fine the juda goat resembles ours in most parts except in size it being much smaller this animal is common in guinea angola and all along the coasts of africa it is not much larger than a hare but it is extremely fat and its flesh admirably tasted it is in that country universally preferred to mutton  these animals seem all of one kind with very trifling distinctions between them it is true that they differ in some respects such as having neither the same color hair ears or horns but it ought to be considered as a rule in natural history that neither the horns the color the fineness or the length of the hair or the position of the ears are to be considered as making an actual distinction in the kinds these are accidental varieties produced by climate and food which are known to change even in the same animal and give it a seeming difference of form when we see the shapes the inclinations and the internal conformation of seemingly different creatures nearly the same and above all when we see them producing among each other we then have no hesitation in pronouncing the species and asserting that these are of the goat kind with which they are so materially connected  but although these are evidently known to belong to the goat kind there are others nearly resembling the goat of whose kindred we cannot be equally certain these are such as being found in a state of nature have not as yet been sufficiently subjected to human observation hence it is impossible to determine with precision to which class they belong whether they be animals of a particular kind or merely the goat in its state of savage freedom were there but one of these wild animals the enquiry would soon be ended and we might readily allow it for the parent stock but in the present case there are two kinds that have almost equal pretensions to this honor and the claims of which it has been found difficult to determine the animals in question are the shammoy and the ibex these both bear very near approaches to the goat in figure have horns that never shed and at the same time are more different from each other than from the animal in question from which of these two sources our domestic goat is derived is not easy to settle instead therefore of entering into the discussion i will content myself with the result of mr buffons enquiries he is of opinion that the ibex is the principal source that our domestic goat is the immediate descendant and that the shammoy is but a variety from that stock a sort of collateral branch of the same family his principal reason for giving the preference to the ibex is its having a more masculine figure large horns and a large beard whereas the shammoy wants these marks of primitive strength and wildness he supposes therefore in their original savage state that our goat has taken after the male of the parent stock and the shammoy after the female and that this has produced a variety in these animals even before they underwent human cultivation  however this be the two animals in question seem both well fitted for their precarious life being extremely swift and capable of running with ease along the ledges of precipices where even the wolf or the fox though instigated by hunger dares not pursue them they are both natives of the alps the pyrenees and the mountains of greece there they propagate in vast numbers and continue to exist in spite of the hunter and every beast of prey that is found incessantly to pursue them  the ibex resembles the goat in the shape of its body but differs in the horns which are much larger they are bent backward full of knots and it is generally asserted that there is a knot added every year there are some of these found if we may believe bellonius at least two yards long the ibex has a large black beard is of a brown color with a thick warm coat of hair there is a streak of black runs along the top of the back and the belly and back of the thighs are of a fawn color  the shammoy m perouds account as quoted by buffon  though a wild animal is very easily tamed and docile and to be found only in rocky and mountainous places it is about the size of a domestic goat and resembles one in many respects it is most agreeably lively and active beyond expression the shammoys hair is short like that of the do in spring it is of an ash color and in autumn a dun color inclining to black and in winter of a blackish brown this animal is found in great plenty in the mountains of dauphiny of piedmont savoy switzerland and germany they are peaceful gentle creatures and live in society with each other they are found in flocks of from four to fourscore and even an hundred dispersed upon the crags of the mountains the large males are seen feeding detached from the rest except in rutting time when they approach the females and drive away the young the time of their coupling is from the beginning of november to the end of october and they bring forth in april and march the young keeps with the dam for about five months and sometimes longer if the hunters and the wolves do not separate them it is asserted that they live between twenty and thirty years their flesh is good to eat and they are found to have ten or twelve pounds of suet which far surpasses that of the goat in hardness and goodness the shammoy has scarce any cry as most animals are known to have if it has any it is a kind of feeble bleat by which the parent calls its young but in cases of danger and when it is to warn the rest of the flock it uses an hissing noise which is heard at a great distance for it is to be observed that this creature is extremely vigilant and has an eye the quickest and most piercing in nature its smell also is not less distinguishing when it sees its enemy distinctly it stops for a moment and then if the person be near in an instant after it flies off in the same manner by its smell it can discover a man at half a league distance and gives the earliest notice upon any alarm therefore or any apprehensions of danger the shammoy begins his hissing note with such force that the rocks and the forests reecho to the sound the first hiss continues as long as the time of one inspiration in the beginning it is very sharp and deeper toward the close the animal having after this first alarm reposed a moment again looks round and perceiving the reality of its fears continues to hiss by intervals until it has spread the alarm to a very great distance during this time it seems in the most violent agitation it strikes the ground with its forefoot and sometimes with both it bounds from rock to rock it turns and looks round it runs to the edge of the precipice and still perceiving the enemy flies with all its speed the hissing of the male is much louder and sharper than that of the female it is performed through the nose and is properly no more than a very strong breath driven violently through a small apperture the shammoy feeds upon the best herbage and chooses the most delicate parts of the plants the flower and the tender buds it is not less delicate with regard to several aromatic herbs which grow upon the sides of the mountains it drinks but very little while it feeds upon the succulent herbage and chews the cud in the intervals of feeding this animal is greatly admired for the beauty of its eyes which are round and sparkling and which mark the warmth of its constitution its head is furnished with two small horns of about half a foot long of a beautiful black and rising from the forehead almost betwixt the eyes these contrary to what they are found in other animals instead of going backwards or sideways jet out forward and bend a little at their extremities backward in a small circle and end in a very sharp point the ears are placed in a very elegant manner near the horns and there are two stripes of black on each side of the face the rest being of a whitish yellow which never changes the horn of this animal is often used as the head of a cane those of the female are less and not so much bent and some farriers are seen to bleed cattle with them these animals are so much incommoded by heat that they are never found in summer except in the caverns of rocks amidst fragments of unmelted ice under the shade of high and spreading trees or of rough and hanging precipices that face the north and which keep off entirely the rays of the sun they go to pasture both morning and evening and seldom during the heat of the day they run along the rocks with great ease and seeming indifference and leap from one to another so that no dogs are able to pursue them there is nothing more extraordinary than to see them climbing and descending precipices that to all other quadrupedes are inaccessible they always mount or descend in an oblique direction and throw themselves down a rock of thirty feet and light with great security upon some excrescence or fragment on the side of the precipice which is just large enough to place their feet upon they strike the rock however in their descent with their feet three or four times to stop the velocity of their motion and when they have got upon their base below they at once seem fixed and secure in fact to see them jump in this manner they seem rather to have wings than legs some indeed pretend to say that they use their horns for climbing but this wants confirmation certain it is that their legs alone are formed for this arduous employment the hinder being rather longer than the former and bending in such a manner that when they descend upon them they break the force of the fall it is also asserted that when they feed one of them always stands as sentinel but how far this may be true is questionable for certain while they feed there are some of them that keep continually gazing round the rest but this is practiced among all gregarious animals so that when they see any danger they warn the rest of the herd of its approach during the rigours of winter the shammoy sleeps in the thicker forests and feeds upon the shrubs and the buds of the pine tree it sometimes turns up the snow with its foot to look for herbage and where it is green makes a delicious repast the more craggy and uneven the forest the more this animal is pleased with the abode which thus adds to its security the hunting the shammoy is very laborious and extremely difficult the most usual way is to hide behind the clefts of the rocks and shoot them this however must be done with great precaution the sportsman must creep for a vast way upon his belly in silence and take also the advantage of the wind which if it blow from him they would instantly perceive when arrived at a proper distance he then advances his piece which is to be rifle barrelled and to carry one ball and tries his fortune among them some also pursue this animal as they do the stag by placing proper persons at all the passages of a glade or valley and then sending in others to rouse the game dogs are quite useless in this chase as they rather alarm than overtake nor is it without danger even to the men for it often happens that when the animal finds itself overpressed it drives at the hunter with its head and often tumbles him down the neighboring precipice this animal cannot go upon ice when smooth but if there be the least inequalities on its surface it then bounds along in security and quickly evades all pursuit  the skin of the shammoy was once famous when tanned for its softness and warmth at present however since the art of tanning has been brought to greater perfection the leather called shammoy is made also from those of the tame goat the sheep and the deer many medicinal virtues also were said to reside in the blood fat gall and the concretion sometimes found in the stomach of this animal called the german bezoar the fat mixed with milk was said to be good in ulcers of the lungs the gall was said to be useful in strengthening the sight the stone which is generally about the size of a walnut and blackish was formerly in great request for having the same virtues with oriental bezoar however in the present enlightened state of physic all these medicines are quite out of repute and although we have the names of several medicines procurable from quadrupedes yet except the musk or hartshorn alone i know of none in any degree of reputation it is true the fat the urine the beak and even the dung of various animals may be found efficacious where better remedies are not to be had but they are far surpassed by by many at present in use whose operations we know and whose virtues are confirmed by repeated experience  such are the quadrupedes that more peculiarly belong to the goat kind each of these in all probability can engender and breed with the other and were the whole race extinguished except any two these would be sufficient to replenish the world and continue the kind nature however proceeds in her variations by slow and insensible degrees and scarce draws a firm distinguished line between any two neighboring races of animals whatsoever thus it is hard to discover where the sheep ends and the goat begins and we shall find it still harder to fix precisely the boundaries between the goat kind and the deer in all transitions from one kind to the other there are to be found a middle race of animals that seem to partake of the nature of both and that can precisely be referred to neither that race of quadrupedes called the gazelles are of this kind they are properly neither goat nor deer and yet they have many of the marks of both they make the shade between these two kinds and fill up the chasm in nature  the gazelles the gazelles of which there are several kinds can with propriety be referred neither to the goat or the deer and yet they partake of both natures like the goat they have hollow horns that never fall which is otherwise in the deer they have a gallbladder which is found in the goat and not in the deer and like that animal they feed rather upon shrubs than grassy pastures on the other hand they resemble the roebuck in size and delicacy of form they have deep pits under the eyes like that animal they resemble the roebuck in the color and nature of their hair they resemble him in the bunches upon their legs which only differ in being upon the forelegs in these and on the hind legs in the other they seem therefore to be of a middle nature between these two kinds or to speak with greater truth and precision they form a distinct kind by themselves  the distinguishing marks of this tribe of animals by which they differ both from the goat and deer are these their horns are made differently being annulated or ringed round at the same time that there are longitudinated depressions running from the bottom to the point they have bunches of hair upon their forelegs they have a streak of black red or brown running along the lower part of their sides and three streaks of whitish hair in the internal side of the ear these are characters that none of them are without besides these there are others which in general they are found to have and which are more obvious to the beholder of all animals in the world the gazelle has the most beautiful eye extremely brilliant and yet so meek that all the eastern poets compare the eyes of their mistresses to those of this animal a gazelleeyed beauty is considered as the highest cmpliment that a lover can pay and indeed the greeks themselves thought it no inelegant piece of flattery to resemble the eyes of a beautiful woman to those of a cow the gazelle for the most part is more delicately and finely limbed than even the roebuck its hair is as short but finer and more glossy its hinder legs are longer than those before as in the hare which gives it greater security in ascending or descending steep places their swiftness is equal if not superior to that of the roe but as the latter bounds forward so these run along in an even uninterrupted course most of them are brown upon the back white under the belly with a black stripe separating these colors between their tail is of various lengths but in all covered with pretty long hair and their ears are beautiful well placed and terminating in a point they all have a cloven hoof like the sheep they all have permanent horns and the female has them smaller than the male  of these animals mr buffon makes twelve varieties which however is much fewer than what other naturalists have made them the first is the gazella properly so called which is of the size of the roebuck and very much resembling it in all the proportions of its body but entirely differing as was said in the nature and fashion of the horns which are black and hollow like those of the ram or the goat and never fall the second he calls the kevel which is rather less than the former its eyes also seem larger and its horns instead of being round are flatted on the sides as well in the male as the female the third he calls the corin which very much resembles the two former but that it is still less than either its horns also are smaller in proportion smoother than those of the other two and the annular prominences belonging to the kind are scarce discernable and may rather be called wrinkles than prominences some of these animals are often seen streaked like the tiger these three are supposed to be of the same species the fourth he calls the zeiran the horns only of which he has seen which from their size and the description of travelers he supposes to belong to a larger kind of the gazelle found in india and persia under that denomination  the fifth he calls the koba and the sixth the kob these two differ from each other only in size the former being much larger than the latter the muzzle of these animals is much longer than those of the ordinary gazelle the head is differently shaped and they have no depressions under the eyes the seventh he calls after its egyptian name the algazel which is shaped pretty much like the ordinary gazelle except that the horns are much longer being generally three feet from the point to the insertion whereas in the common gazelle they are not above a foot they are smaller also and straiter till near the extremities when they turn short with a very sharp flexure they are black and smooth and the annular prominences are scarcely observable the eighth is called the pazan or by some the bezoar goat which greatly resembles the former except a small variety in their horns and also with this difference that as the algazel feeds upon the plains this is only found in the mountains they are both inhabitants of the same countries and climate being found in egypt arabia and persia this last is the animal famous for that concretion in the intestines or stomach called the oriental bezoar which was once in such repute all over the world for its medicinal virtues the word bezoar is supposed to take its name either from the pazan or pazar which is the animal that produces it or from a word in the arabic language which signifies antidote or counterpoison it is a stone of a glazed blackish color found in the stomach or the intestines of some animal and brought over to us from the east indies like all other animal concretions it is found to have a kind of nucleous or hard substance within upon which the external coatings were formed for upon being sawed through it is seen to have layer over layer as in an onion this nucleus is of various kinds sometimes the buds of a shrub sometimes a piece of stone and sometimes a marcasite this stone is from the size of an acorn to that of a pidgeons egg the larger the stone the more valuable it is held its price increasing like that of a diamond there was a time when a stone of four ounces sold in europe for above two hundred pounds but at present the price is greatly fallen and they are in very little esteem the bezoar is of various colors sometimes of a blood color sometimes of a pale yellow and of all the shades between these two it is generally glossy smooth and has a fragrant smell like that of ambergrease probably arising from the aromatic vegetables upon which the animal that produces it feeds it has been given in vertigoes epilepsies palpitations of the heart cholic jaundice and in those places where the dearness and not the value of medicines is consulted in almost every disorder incident to man in all perhaps it is equally efficacious acting only as an absorbent powder and possessing virtues equal to common chalk or crabs claws judicious physicians have therefore discarded it and this celebrated medicine is now chiefly consumed in countries where the knowledge of nature has been but little advanced when this medicine was in its highest reputation many arts were used to adulterate it and many countries endeavored to find out a bezoar of their own thus we had occidental bezoar brought from america german bezoar which has been mentioned before cow bezoar and monkey bezoar in fact there is scarce an animal except of the carnivorous kinds that does not produce some of these concretions in the stomach intestines kidneys bladder and even in the heart to these ignorance may impute virtues that they do not possess experience has found but few cures wrought by their efficacy but it is well known that they often prove fatal to the animal that bears them these concretions are generally found in cows by their practice of licking off their hair which gathers in the stomach into the shape of a ball acquires a surprising degree of hardness and sometimes a polish like leather they are often as large as a gooseegg and when become too large to pass block up the passage of the food and the animal dies the substance of these balls however is different from the bezoar mentioned above being rather a concretion of hair than of stone there is a bezoar found in the gallbladder of a boar and thence called hog bezoar in very great esteem but perhaps with as little justice as any of the former in short there is scarce an animal or scarce a part of their bodies in which concretions are not formed and it is more than probable as mr buffon justly remarks that the bezoar so much in use formerly was not the production of the pazar or any one animal only but that of the whole gazelle kind who feeding upon odoriferous herbs and plants gave this admirable fragrance to the accidental concretions which they were found to produce as this medicine however is but little used at present our curiosity is much abated as to the cause of its formation to return therefore to the varieties in the gazelle tribe the ninth is called the ranguer and is a native of senegal this differs somewhat in shape and color from the rest but particularly in the shape of its horns which are strait to near the points where they crook forward pretty much in the same manner as in the shammoy they crook backward the tenth variety of the gazelle is the antelope so well known to the english who have given it the name this animal is of the size of a roebuck and resembles the gazelle in many particulars but differs in others it has deeper eyepits than the former the horns are formed differently also being about sixteen inches long almost touching each other at the bottom and spreading as they rise so as at their tips to be sixteen inches asunder they have the annular prominences of their kind but not so distinguishable as in the gazelle however they have a double flexure which is very remarkable and serves to distinguish them from all others of their kind at the root they have a tuft of hair which is longer than that of any part of the body like others of the same kind the antelope is brown on the back and white under the belly but these colors are not separated by the black streak which is to be found in all the rest of the gazelle kinds there are different sorts of this animal some with larger horns than others and others with less the one which makes the eleventh variety in the gazelle kind mr buffon calls the lidme which has very large horns and the other which is the twelfth and last he calls the indian antelope the horns of which are very small  to these may be added three or four varieties more which it is not easy to tell whether to refer to the goat or the gazelle as they equally resemble both the first of these is the bubalus an animal that seems to partake of the mixed natures of the cow the goat and the deer it resembles the stag in the size and the figure of its body and particularly in the shape of its legs but it has permanent horns like the goat and made entirely like those of the gazelle kind it also resembles that animal in its way of living however it differs in the make of its head being exactly like the cow in the length of its muzzle and in the disposition of the bones of its scull from which similitude it has taken its name this animal has a narrow long head the eyes are placed very high the forehead short and narrow the horns permanent about a foot long black thick annulated and the rings of the gazelle kind remarkably large its shoulders are very high and it has a kind of bunch on them that terminates at the neck the tail is about a foot long and tufted with hair at the extremity the hair of this animal is remarkable in being thicker at the middle than at the root in all other quadrupedes except the elk and this the hair tapers off from the bottom to the point but in these each hair seems to swell in the middle like a ninepin the bubalus also resembles the elk in size and the color of its skin but these are the only similitudes between them as the one has a very large branching head of solid horns that are annually deciduous the other has black unbranching hollow horns that never fall the bubalus is common enough in barbary and has often been called by the name of the barbary cow from which animal it differs so widely it partakes pretty much of the nature of the antelope like that having the hair short the hide black the ears pointed and the flesh good for food  the second anomalous animal of the goatkind mr buffon calls the condoma it is supposed to be equal in size to the largest stag but with hollow horns like those of the goat kind and with varied flexures like those of the antelope they are above three feet long and at their extremities about two feet asunder all along the back there runs a white list which ends at the insertion of the tail another of the same color crosses this at the bottom of the neck which it entirely surrounds there are two more of the same kind running round the body one behind the fore legs and the other running parallel to it before the hinder the color of the rest of the body is greyish except the belly which is white it has also a long gray beard and its legs though long are well proportioned  the third that may be mentioned he calls the guiba it resembles the gazelles in every particular except in the color of the belly which as we have seen is white in them but in this is of a deep brown its horns also are not marked with annular prominences but are smooth and polished it is also remarkable for white lists on a brown ground that are disposed along the animals body as if it were covered with a harness like the former it is a native of africa  the african wild goat of grimmius is the fourth it is of a dark ash color and in the middle of the head is an hairy tuft standing upright on both sides between the eyes and the nose there are very deep cavities greater than those of the other kinds which contain a yellow oily liquor which coagulates into a black substance that has a smell between musk and civet this being taken away the liquor again runs out and coagulates as before these cavities have no communication with the eyes and consequently this oozing substance can have nothing of the nature of tears  to this we may add the chevrotin or little guinea deer which is the least of all cloven footed quadrupedes and perhaps the most beautiful its legs at the smallest part are not much thicker than the shank of a tobaccopipe it is about seven inches high and about twelve from the point of the nose to the insertion of the tail it is the most delicately shaped animal in the world being completely formed like a stag in miniature except that its horns when it has any are more of the gazelle kind being hollow and annulated in the same manner it has two canine teeth in the upper jaw in which respect it differs from all other animals of the goat or deer kind and thus makes a species entirely distinct by itself this wonderful animals color is not less pleasing the hair which is short and glossy being in some of a beautiful yellow except on the neck and belly which is white they are natives of india guinea and the warm climates between the tropics and are found in great plenty but though they are amazingly swift for their size yet the negroes often overtake them in the pursuit and knock them down with their sticks they may be easily tamed and then they become familiar and pleasing but they are of such delicate constitutions that they can bear no climate but the hottest and they always perish with the rigours of ours when they are brought over the male in guinea has horns the female is without any as are all the kinds of this animal to be found either in java or ceylon where they chiefly abound  such is the list of the gazelles all which pretty nearly resemble the deer in form and delicacy of shape but have the horns hollow single and permanent like those of the goat they properly fill up as has been already observed the interval between these two kinds of animals so that it is difficult to tell where the goat ends and the deer may be said to begin if we compare the gazelles with each other we shall find but very slight distinctions between them the turn or the magnitude of the horns the different spots on the skin or a difference of size in each are chiefly the marks by which their varieties are to be known but their way of living their nature and their peculiar swiftness all come under one description  the gazelles are in general inhabitants of the warmer climates and contribute among other embellishments to add beauty to those forests that are for ever green they are often seen feeding in herds on the sides of the mountain or in the shade of the woods and fly all together upon the smallest approaches of danger they bound with such swiftness and are so very shy that dogs or men vainly attempt to pursue them they traverse those precipices with ease and safety which to every quadrupede else are quite impracticable nor can any animals but of the winged kind overtake them accordingly in all those countries where they are chiefly found they are pursued by falcons and this admirable manner of hunting makes one of the principal amusements of the upper ranks of people all over the east  the arabians persians and turks breed up for this purpose that kind of hawk called the falcon gentle with which when properly trained they go forth on horseback among the forests and the mountains the falcon perching upon the hand of the hunter their expedition is conducted with profound silence their dogs are taught to hang behind while the men on the fleetest coursers look round for the game whenever they spy a gazelle at the proper distance they point the falcon to its object and encourage it to pursue the falcon with the swiftness of an arrow flies to the animal that knowing its danger endeavors but too late to escape the falcon soon coming up with its prey fixes its talons one into the animals cheek the other into its throat and deeply wounds it on the other hand the gazelle attempts to escape but is generally wounded too deeply to run far the falcon clings with the utmost perseverance nor ever leaves its prey till it falls upon which the hunters from behind approaching take up both and reward the falcon with the blood of the spoil they also teach the young ones by applying them to the dead animals throat and accustoming them betimes to fix upon that particular part for if it should happen that the falcon fixed upon any other part of the gazelle either its back or its haunches the animal would easily escape among the mountains and the hunter would also lose his falcon  they sometimes also hunt these animals with the ounce this carnivorous and fierce creature being made tame and domestic generally sits on horseback behind the hunter and remains there with the utmost composure until the gazelle is shown it is then that it exerts all its arts and fierceness it does not at once fly at its prey but approaches slyly turning and winding about until it comes within the proper distance when all at once it bounds upon the heedless animal and instantly kills it and sucks its blood if on the other hand it misses its aim it rests in the place without attempting to pursue any farther but seems ashamed of its own inability  there is still another way of taking the gazelle which seems not so certain nor so amusing as either of the former a tame gazelle is bred up for this purpose who is taught to join those of its kind wherever it perceives them when the hunter therefore perceives a herd of these together he fixes a noose round the horns of the tame gazelle in such a manner that if the rest but touch it they are entangled and thus prepared he sends his gazelle among the rest the tame animal no sooner approaches but the males of the herd instantly sally forth to oppose him and in butting with their horns are caught in the noose in this both struggling for some time fall together to the ground and at last the hunter coming up disengages the one and kills the other upon the whole however these animals whatever be the arts used to pursue them are very difficult to be taken as they are continually subject to alarms from carnivorous beasts or from man they keep chiefly in the most solitary and inaccessible places and find their only protection from situations of the greatest danger  chap iv of the musk animal the more we search into nature the more we shall find how little she is known and we shall more than once have occasion to find that protracted enquiry is more apt to teach us modesty than to produce information although the number and nature of quadrupedes at first glance seems very little known yet when we come to examine closer we find some with which we are very partially acquainted and others that are utterly unknown there is scarce a cabinet of the curious but what has the spoils of animals or the horns or the hoofs of quadrupedes which do not come within former descriptions there is scarce a person whose trade is to dress or improve furs but knows several creatures by their skins which no naturalist has hitherto had notice of but of all quadrupedes there is none so justly the reproach of natural historians as that which bears the musk this perfume so well known to the elegant and so very useful in the hands of the physician a medicine that has for more than a century been imported from the east in great quantities and during all that time has been improving in its reputation is nevertheless so very little understood that it remains a doubt whether the animal that produces it be an hog an ox a goat or a deer when an animal with which we are so nearly connected is so utterly unknown how little must we know of many that are more remote and unserviceable yet naturalists proceed in the same train enlarging their catalogues and their names without endeavoring to find out the nature and fix the precise history of those with which we are very partially acquainted it is the spirit of the scholars of the present age to be fonder of increasing the bulk of our knowledge than its utility of extending their conquests than of improving their empire  the musk which comes to europe is brought over in small bags about the size of a pidgeons egg which when cut open appear to contain a kind of dusky reddish substance like coagulated blood and which in large quantities has a very strong smell but when mixed and diffused becomes a very agreeable perfume indeed no substance now known in the world has a stronger or a more permanent smell a grain of musk perfumes a whole room and its odor continues for some days without diminution but in a larger quantity it continues for years together and seems scarce wasted in its weight although it has filled the atmosphere to a great distance with its parts it is particularly used in medicine in nervous and hysteric disorders and is found in such cases to be the most powerful remedy now in use however the animal that furnishes this admirable medicine has been very variously described and is known but very imperfectly  the description given of this animal by grew is as follows the musk animal is properly neither of the goat nor deer kind for it has no horns and it is uncertain whether it ruminates or not however it wants the fore teeth in the upper jaw in the same manner as in ruminating animals but at the same time it has tusks like those of a hog it is three feet six inches in length from the head to the tail and the head is above half a foot long the fore part of the head is like that of a greyhound and the ears are three inches long and erect like those of a rabbit but the tail is not above two inches it is cloven footed like beasts of the goat kind the hair on the head and legs is half an inch long on the belly an inch and an half and on the back and buttocks three inches and proportionably thicker than in any other animal it is brown and white depiction of the musk deer the musk de seve del isc tailor sculp alternately from the root to the point on the head and thighs it is brown but under the belly and tail white and a little curled especially on the back and belly on each side of the lower jaw under the corners of the mouth there is a tuft of thick hair which is short and hard and about three quarters of an inch long the hair in general of this animal is remarkable for its softness and fine texture but what distinguishes it particularly are the tusks which are an inch and an half long and turn back in the form of an hook and more particularly the bag which contains the musk which is three inches long two broad and stands out from the belly an inch and an half it is a very fearful animal and therefore it has long ears and the sense of hearing is so quick that it can discover an enemy at a great distance  after so long and circumstantial a description of this animal its nature is but very little known nor has any anatomist as yet examined its internal structure or been able to inform us whether it be a ruminant animal or one of the hog kind how the musk is formed or whether those bags in which it comes to us be really belonging to the animal or are only the sophistications of the venders indeed when we consider the immense quantities of this substance which are consumed in europe alone not to mention the east where it is in still greater repute than here we can hardly suppose that any one animal can furnish the supply and particularly when it must be killed before the bag can be obtained we are told it is true that the musk is often deposited by the animal upon trees and stones against which it rubs itself when the quantity becomes uneasy but it is not in that form which we receive it but always in what seems to be its own natural bladder of these taverner brought home near two thousand in one year and as the animal is wild so many must during that space have been hunted and taken but as the creature is represented very shy and as it is found but in some particular provinces of the east the wonder is how its bag should be so cheap and furnished in such great plenty the bag in common does not cost if i do not forget above a crown by retail and yet this is supposed the only one belonging to the animal and for the obtaining of which it must have been hunted and killed the only way of solving this difficulty is to suppose that these bags are in a great measure counterfeit taken from some other animal or from some part of the same filled with its blood and a very little of the perfume but enough to impregnate the rest with a strong and permanent odor it comes to us from different parts of the east from china tunquin bengal and often from muscovy that of thibet is reckoned the best and sells for fourteen shillings an ounce that of muscovy the worst and sells but for three the odor of this though very strong at first being quickly found to evaporate  musk was some years ago in the highest request as a perfume and but little regarded as a medicine but at present its reputation is totally changed and having been found of great benefit in physic it is but little regarded for the purposes of elegance it is thus that things which become necessary cease to continue pleasing and the consciousness of their use destroys their power of administering delight  chap v animals of the deer kind if we compare the stag and the bull as to shape and form no two animals can be more unlike and yet if we examine their internal structure we shall find a striking similitude between them indeed their differences except to a nice observer will scarcely be perceivable all of the deer kind want the gallbladder their kidneys are formed differently their spleen is also proportionably larger their tail is shorter and their horns which are solid are renewed every year such are the slight internal discriminations between two animals one of which is among the swiftest and the other the heaviest of the brute creation  the stag is one of those innocent and peaceable animals that seems made to embellish the forest and animate the solitudes of nature the easy elegance of his form the lightness of his motions those large branches that seem made rather for the ornament of his head than its defense the size the strength and the swiftness of this beautiful creature all sufficiently rank him among the first of quadrupedes among the most noted objects of human curiosity  the stag or heart whose female is called a hind and the young a calf differs in size and in horns from a fallowdeer he is much larger and his horns are round whereas in the fallow kind they are broad and palmated by these the animals age is known the first year the stag has no horns but an horny excrescence which is short rough and covered with a thin hairy skin the next year the horns are single and straight the third year they have two antlers three the fourth four the fifth and five the sixth this number is not always certain for sometimes there are more and often less when arrived at the sixth year the antlers do not always increase and although the number may amount to six or seven on each side yet the animals age is then estimated rather from the size of the antlers and the thickness of the branch which sustains them than from their variety  these horns large as they seem are notwithstanding shed every year and new ones come in their place the old horns are of a firm solid texture and usually employed in making handles for knives and other domestic utensils but while young nothing can be more soft or tender and the animal as if conscious of his own imbecility at those times instantly upon shedding his former horns retires from the rest of his fellows and hides himself in solitudes and thickets never venturing out to pasture except by night during this time which most usually happens in the spring the new horns are very painful and have a quick sensibility of any external impression the flies also are extremely troublesome to him when the old horn is fallen off the new does not begin immediately to appear but the bones of the skull are seen covered only with a transparent periosteum or skin which as anatomists teach us covers the bones of all animals after a short time however this skin begins to swell and to form a soft tumor which contains a great deal of blood and which begins to be covered with a downy substance that has the feel of velvet and appears nearly of the same color with the rest of the animals hair this tumor every day buds forward from the point like the graft of a tree and rising by degrees from the head shoots out the antlers on either side so that in a few days in proportion as the animal is in condition the whole head is completed however as was said above in the beginning its consistence is very soft and has a sort of bark which is no more than a continuation of the integument of the skull it is velveted and downy and every where furnished with blood vessels that supply the growing horns with nourishment as they creep along the sides of the branches the print is marked over the whole surface and the larger the blood vessels the deeper these marks are found to be from hence arises the inequality of the surface of the deers horns which as we see are furrowed all along the sides the impressions diminishing toward the point where the substance is as smooth and as solid as ivory but it ought to be observed that this substance of which the horns is composed begins to harden at the bottom while the upper part remains soft and still continues growing from whence it appears that the horns grow differently in deer from those of sheep or cows in which they are always seen to increase from the bottom however when the whole head has received its full growth the extremities then begin to acquire their solidity the velvet covering or bark with its blood vessels dry up and then begin to fall and this the animal hastens by rubbing its antlers against every tree it meets in this manner the whole external surface being stripped off by degrees at length the whole head acquires its complete hardness expansion and beauty  it would be a vain task to enquire into the cause of the animal production of these horns it is sufficient to observe that if a stag is castated when its horns are fallen off they will never grow again and on the contrary if the same operation is performed when they are on they will never fall off if only one of his testicles are taken out he will want the horn on that side if one of the testicles only be tied up he will want the horn of the opposite side the increase of their provision also tends to facilitate the growth and the expansion of the horns and mr buffon thinks it possible to retard their growth entirely by greatly retrenching their food buffon vol xi p      as a proof of this nothing can be more obvious than the difference between a stag bred in fertile pastures and undisturbed by the hunter and one often pursued and ill nourished the former has his head expanded his antlers numerous and the branches thick the latter has but few antlers the traces of the blood vessels upon them are but slight and the expansion but little the beauty and size of their horns therefore mark their strength and their vigor such of them as are sickly or have been wounded never shooting out that magnificent profusion so much admired in this animal thus the horns may in every respect be resembled to a vegetable substance grafted upon the head of an animal like a vegetable they grow from the extremities like a vegetable they are for a while covered with a bark that nourishes them like a vegetable they have their annual production and decay and a strong imagination might suppose that the leafy productions on which the animal feeds go once more to vegetate in his horns mr buffon has supposed something like this vid passim   the stag is usually a twelvemonth old before the horns begin to appear and then a single branch is all that is seen for the year ensuing about the beginning of spring all of this kind are seen to shed their horns which fall off of themselves though sometimes the animal assists the efforts of nature by rubbing them against a tree it seldom happens that the branches on both sides fall off at the same time there often being two or three days between the dropping of the one and the other the old stags usually shed their horns first which generally happens toward the latter end of february or the beginning of march those of the second head namely such as are between five and six years old shed their horns about the middle or latter end of march those still younger in the month of april and the youngest of all not till the middle or the latter end of may they generally shed them in pools of water whither they retire from the heat and this has given rise to the opinion of their always hiding their horns these rules though true in general are yet subject to many variations and universally it is known that a severe winter retards the shedding of the horns  the horns of the stag generally increase in thickness and in height from the second year of its age to the eighth in this state of perfection they continue during the vigor of life but as the animal grows old the horns feel the impressions of age and shrink like the rest of the body no branch bears more than twenty or twentytwo antlers even in the highest state of vigor and the number is subject to great variety for it happens that the stag at one year has either less or more than the year preceding in proportion to the goodness of his pasture or the continuance of his security as these animals seldom thrive when often rouzed by the hunters the horns are also found to partake of the nature of the soil in the more fertile pastures they are large and tender on the contrary in the barren soil they are hard stunted and brittle  as soon as the stags have shed their horns they separate from each other and seek the plainer parts of the country remote from every other animal which they are utterly unable to oppose they then walk with their heads stooping down to keep their horns from striking against the branches of the trees above in this state of imbecility they continue near three months before their heads have acquired their full growth and solidity and then by rubbing them against the branches of every thicket they at length clear them of the skin which had contributed to their growth and nourishment it is said by some that the horn takes the color of the sap of the tree against which it is rubbed and that some thus become red when rubbed against the heath and others brown by rubbing against the oak this however is a mistake since stags kept in parks where there are no trees have a variety in the color of their horns which can be ascribed to nothing but nature  a short time after they have furnished their horns they begin to feel the impressions of the rut or the desire of copulation the old ones are the most forward and about the end of august or the beginning of september they quit their thickets and return to the mountain in order to seek the hind to whom they call with a loud tremulous note at this time their neck is swolen they appear bold and furious fly from country to country strike with their horns against the trees and obstacles and continue restless and fierce until they have found the female who at first flies from them but is at last compelled and overtaken when two stags contend for the same female how timorous soever they may appear at other times they then seem agitated with an uncommon degree of ardour they paw up the earth menace each other with their horns bellow with all their force and striking in a desperate manner against each other seem determined upon death or victory this combat continues till one of them is defeated or flies and it often happens that the victor is obliged to fight several of those battles before it remains undisputed master of the field the old ones are generally the conquerors upon these occasions as they have more strength and greater courage and these also are preferred by the hind itself to the young ones as the latter are more feeble and less ardent however they are all equally inconstant keeping to the female but a few days and then seeking out for another not to be enjoyed perhaps without a repetition of their former danger  in this manner the stag continues to range from one to the other for about three weeks the time the rut continues during which he scarce eats sleeps or rests but continues to pursue to combat and to enjoy at the end of this period of madness for such in this animal it seems to be the creature that was before fat sleek and glossy becomes lean feeble and timid he then retires from the herd to seek plenty and repose he frequents the side of the forest and chooses the most nourishing pastures remaining there till his strength is renewed thus is his whole life passed in the alternations of plenty and want of corpulence and inanition of health and sickness without having his constitution much affected by the violence of the change as he is above five years coming to perfection he lives about forty years and it is a general rule that every animal lives about seven or eight times the number of years which it continues to grow what therefore is reported concerning the life of this animal has arisen from the credulity of ignorance some say that a stag having been taken in france with a collar on which were written these words caesar hoc me donavit this was interpreted of julius caesar but it is not considered that caesar is a general name for kings and that one of the emperors of germany who are always styled caesars might have ordered the inscription  this animal may differ in the term of his life according to the goodness of his pasture or the undisturbed repose he happens to enjoy these are advantages that influence not only his age but his size and his vigor the stags of the plains the valleys and the little hills which abound in corn and pasture are much more corpulent and much taller than such as are bred on the rocky waste or the heathy mountain the latter are low small and meagre incapable of going so swift as the former although they are found to hold out much longer they are also more artful in evading the hunters their horns are generally black and short while those of the lowland stags are reddish and flourishing so that the animal seems to increase in beauty and stature in proportion to the goodness of the pasture which he enjoys in security  the usual color of the stag in england is red nevertheless the greater number in other countries are brown there are some few that are white but these seem to have obtained this color in a former state of domestic tameness of all the animals that are natives of this climate there are none that have such a beautiful eye as the stag it is sparkling soft and sensible his senses of smelling and hearing are in no less perfection when he is in the least alarmed he lifts the head and erects the ears standing for a few minutes as if in a listening posture whenever he ventures upon some unknown ground or quits his native covering he first stops at the skirt of the plain to examine all around he next turns against the wind to examine by the smell if there be any enemy approaching if a person should happen to whistle or call out at a distance the stag is seen to stop short in his slow measured pace and gazes upon the stranger with a kind of awkward admiration if the cunning animal perceives neither dogs nor firearms preparing against him he goes forward quite unconcerned and slowly proceeds without offering to fly man is not the enemy he is most afraid of on the contrary he seems to be delighted with the sound of the shepherds pipe and the hunters sometimes make use of that instrument to allure the poor animal to his destruction  the stag eats slowly and is very delicate in the choice of his pasture when he has eaten a sufficiency he then retires to the covert of some thicket to chew the cud in security his rumination however seems performed with much greater difficulty than with the cow or sheep for the grass is not returned from the first stomach without much straining and a kind of hiccup which is easily perceived during the whole time it continues this may proceed from the greater length of his neck and the narrowness of the passage all those of the cow and the sheep kind having it much wider  this animals voice is much stronger louder and more tremulous in proportion as he advances in age in the time of rut it is even terrible at that season he seems so transported with passion that nothing obstructs his fury and when at bay he keeps the dogs off with great intrepidity some years ago the duke of cumberland caused a tiger and a stag to be enclosed in the same area and the stag made so bold a defense that the tiger was at last obliged to fly the stag seldom drinks in the winter and still less in the spring while the plants are tender and covered over with dew it is in the heat of the summer and during the time of rut that he is seen constantly frequenting the side of rivers and lakes as well to slake his thirst as to cool his ardour he swims with great ease and strength and best at those times when he is fattest his fat keeping him buoyant like oil upon the surface of the water during the time of rut he even ventures out to sea and swims from one island to another although there may be some leagues distance between them  the cry of the hind or female is not so loud as that of the male and is never excited but by apprehension for herself or her young it need scarce be mentioned that she has no horns or that she is more feeble and unfit for hunting than the male when once they have conceived they separate from the males and then they both herd together apart the time of gestation continues between eight and nine months and they generally produce but one at a time their usual season for bringing forth is about the month of may or the beginning of june during which they take great care to hide their young in the most obscure thickets nor is this precaution without reason since almost every creature is then a formidable enemy the eagle the falcon the osprey the wolf the dog and all the rapacious family of the cat kind are in continual employment to find out her retreat but what is more unnatural still the stag himself is a professed enemy and she is obliged to use all her arts to conceal her young from him as from the most dangerous of her pursuers at this season therefore the courage of the male seems transferred to the female she defends her young against her less formidable opponents by force and when pursued by the hunter she ever offers herself to mislead him from the principal object of her concern she flies before the hounds for half the day and then returns to her young whose life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own the calf for so the young of this animal is called never quits the dam during the whole summer and in winter the hind and all the males under a year old keep together and assemble in herds which are more numerous in proportion as the season is more severe in the spring they separate the hinds to bring forth while none but the year olds remain together however these animals are in general fond of herding and grazing in company it is danger or necessity alone that separates them  the dangers they have to fear from other animals are nothing when compared to those from man the men of every age and nation have made the chase of the stag one of their most favorite pursuits and those who first hunted from necessity have continued it for amusement in our own country in particular hunting was ever esteemed as one of the principal diversions of the great british zoology  at first indeed the beasts of chase had the whole island for their range and knew no other limits than those of the ocean  the roman jurisprudence which was formed on the manners of the first ages established it as a law that as the natural right of things which have no master belongs to the first possessor wild beasts birds and fishes are the property of whosoever could first take them but the northern barbarians who overran the roman empire bringing with them the strongest relish for this amusement and being now possessed of more easy means of subsistence from the lands they had conquered their chiefs and leaders began to appropriate the right of hunting and instead of a natural right to make it a royal one when the saxon kings therefore had established themselves into an heptarchy the chaces were reserved by each sovereign for his own particular amusement hunting and war in those uncivilized ages were the only employment of the great their active but uncultivated minds were susceptible of no pleasures but those of a violent kind such as gave exercise to their bodies and prevented the uneasiness of thinking but as the saxon kings only appropriated those lands to the business of the chase which were unoccupied before so no individuals received any injury but it was otherwise when the norman kings were settled upon the throne the passion for hunting was then carried to an excess and every civil right was involved in general ruin this ardour for hunting was stronger than the consideration of religion even in a superstitious age the village communities nay even the most sacred edifices were thrown down and all turned into one vast waste to make room for animals the objects of a lawless tyrants pleasure sanguinary laws were enacted to preserve the game and in the reigns of william rufus and henry the first it was less criminal to destroy one of the human species than a beast of chase thus it continued while the norman line filled the throne but when the saxon line was restored under henry the second the rigor of the forest laws were softened the barons also for a long time imitated the encroachments as well as the amusements of the monarch but when property became more happily divided by the introduction of arts and industry these extensive hunting grounds became more limited and as tillage and husbandry increased the beasts of chase were obliged to give way to others more useful to community those vast tracts of land before dedicated to hunting were then contracted and in proportion as the useful arts gained ground they protected and encouraged the labors of the industrious and repressed the licentiousness of the sportsman it is therefore among the subjects of a despotic government only that these laws remain in full force where large wastes lie uncultivated for the purposes of hunting where the husbandman can find no protection from the invasions of his lord or the continual depredations of those animals which he makes the objects of his pleasure  in the present cultivated state of this country therefore the stag is unknown in its wild natural state and such of them as remain among us are kept under the name of red deer in parks among the fallow deer but they are become less common than formerly its excessive viciousness during the rutting season and the badness of its flesh inducing most people to part with the species the few that still remain wild are to be found on the moors that border on cornwall and devonshire and in ireland on most of the large mountains of that country  in england the hunting the stag and the buck are performed in the same manner the animal is driven from some gentlemans park and then hunted through the open country but those who pursue the wild animal have a much higher object as well as a greater variety in the chase to let loose a creature that was already in our possession in order to catch it again is in my opinion but a poor pursuit as the reward when obtained is only what we before had given away but to pursue an animal that owns no proprietor and which he that first seizes may be said to possess has something in it that seems at least more rational this rewards the hunter for his toil and seems to repay his industry besides the superior strength and swiftness of the wild animal prolongs the amusement it is possessed of more various arts to escape the hunter and leads him to precipices where the danger ennobles the chase in pursuing the animal let loose from a park as it is unused to danger it is but little versed in the stratagems of escape the hunter follows as sure of overcoming and feels none of those alternations of hope and fear which arise from the uncertainty of success but it is otherwise with the mountain stag having spent his whole life in a state of continual apprehension having frequently been followed and as frequently escaped he knows every trick to mislead to confound or intimidate his pursuers to stimulate their ardour and enhance their success  those who hunt this animal have their peculiar terms for the different objects of their pursuit the professors in every art take a pleasure in thus employing a language known only to themselves and thus accumulate words which to the ignorant have the appearance of knowledge in this manner the stag is called the first year a calf or hind calf the second year a knobber the third a brock the fourth a staggard the fifth a stag the sixth an heart the female is called an hind the first year she is a calf the second a hearse the third a hind this animal is said to harbor in the place where he resides when he cries he is said to bell the print of his hoof is called the slot his tail is called the single his excrement the fewmet his horns are called his head when simple the first year they are called broches the third year spears the fourth year that part which bears the antlers is called the beam and the little impressions upon its surface glitters that which rise from the crust of the beam are called pearls the antlers also have distinct names the first that branches off is called the antler the second the sur antler all the rest which grow afterward till you come to the top which is called the crown are called royal antlers the little buds about the tops are called croches the impression on the place where the stag has lain is called the layer if it be in covert or a thicket it is called his harbor where a deer has passed into a thicket leaving marks whereby his bulk may be guessed it is called an entry when they cast their heads they are said to mew when they rub their heads against trees to bring off the peel of their horns they are said to fray when a stag hard hunted takes to swimming in the water he is said to go sail when he turns his head against the hounds he is said to bay and when the hounds pursue upon the scent until they have unharboured the stag they are said to draw on the slot  such are but a few of the many terms used by hunters in pursuing of the stag most of which are now laid aside or in use only among gamekeepers the chase however is continued in many parts of the country where the red deer is still preserved and still makes the amusement of such as have not found out more liberal entertainments in those few places where the animal is perfectly wild the amusement as was said above is still superior the first great care of the hunter when he leads out his hounds to the mountain side where the deer are generally known to harbor is to make choice of a proper stag to pursue his ambition is to unharbour the largest and the boldest of the whole herd and for this purpose he examines the track if there be any which if he finds long and large he concludes that it must have belonged to a stag and not an hind the print of whose foot is rounder those marks also which he leaves on trees by the rubbing of his horns show his size and point him out as the proper object of pursuit now to seek out a stag in his haunt it is to be observed that he changes his manner of feeding every month from the conclusion of ruttingtime which is november he feeds in heaths and broomy places in december they herd together and withdraw into the strength of the forests to shelter themselves from the severer weather feeding on holm elder trees and brambles the three following months they leave herding but keep four or five in a company and venture out to the corners of the forest where they feed on winter pasture sometimes making their incursions into the neighboring cornfieldsd to feed upon the tender shoots just as they peep above ground in april and may they rest in thickets and shady places and seldom venture forth unless rouzed by approaching danger in september and october their annual ardour returns and then they leave the thickets boldly facing every danger without any certain place for food or harbor when by a knowledge of these circumstances the hunter has found out the residence and the quality of his game his next care is to uncouple and cast off his hounds in the pursuit these no sooner perceive the timorous animal that flies before them but they altogether open in full cry pursuing rather by the scent than the view encouraging each other to continue the chase and tracing the flying animal with the most amazing sagacity the hunters also are not less ardent in their speed on horseback cheering up the dogs and directing them where to pursue on the other hand the stag when unharboured flies at first with the swiftness of the wind leaving his pursuers several miles in the rear and at length having gained his former coverts and no longer hearing the cries of the dogs and men that he had just left behind he stops gazes round him and seems to recover his natural tranquillity but this calm is of short duration for his inveterate pursuers slowly and securely trace him along and he once more hears the approaching destruction from behind he again therefore renews his efforts to escape and again leaves the pursuers at almost the former distance but this second effort makes him more feeble than before and when they come up a second time he is unable to outstrip them with equal velocity the poor animal now therefore is obliged to have recourse to all his little arts of escape which sometimes though but seldom avail him in proportion as his strength fails him the ardour of his pursuers is enflamed he tracks more heavily on the ground and this increasing the strength of the scent redoubles the cries of the hounds and enforces their speed it is then that the stag seeks for refuge among the herd and tries every artifice to put off some other head for his own sometimes he will send forth some little deer in his stead in the mean time lying close himself that the hounds may overshoot him he will break into one thicket after another to find deer rouzing them gathering them together and endeavoring to put them upon the tracks he has made his old companions however with a true spirit of ingratitude now all forsake and shun him with the most watchful industry leaving the unhappy creature to take his fate by himself thus abandoned of his fellows he again tries other arts by doubling and crossing in some hard beaten highway where the scent is least perceivable he now also runs against the wind not only to cool himself but the better to hear the voice and judge of the distance of his implacable pursuers it is now easily perceivable how sorely he is pressed by his manner of running which from the bounding easy pace with which he begun is converted into a stiff and short manner of going his mouth also is black and dry without foam on it his tongue hangs out and the tears as some say are seen starting from his eyes his last refuge when every other method of safety has failed him is to take the water and to attempt an escape by crossing whatever lake or river he happens to approach while swimming he takes all possible care to keep in the middle of the stream lest by touching the bough of a tree or the herbage on the banks he may give scent to the hounds he is also ever found to swim against the stream whence the huntsmen have made it into a kind of proverb that he that would his chase find must up with the river and down with the wind on this occasion too he will often cover himself under water so as to show nothing but the tip of his nose every resource and every art being at length exhausted the poor creature tries the last remains of his strength by boldly opposing those enemies he cannot escape he therefore faces the dogs and men threatens with his horns guards himself on every side and for some time stands at bay in this manner quite desperate he furiously aims at the first dog or man that approaches and it often happens that he does not die unrevenged at that time the more prudent both of the dogs and men seem willing to avoid him but the whole pack quickly coming up he is soon surrounded and brought down and the huntsman winds a treble mort as it is called with his horn  such is the manner of pursuing this animal in england but every country has a peculiar method of its own adapted either to the nature of the climate or the face of the soil the ancient manner was very different from that practiced at present they used their dogs only to find out the game but not to rouse it hence they were not curious as to the music of their hounds or the composition of their pack the dog that opened before he had discovered his game was held in no estimation it was their usual manner silently to find out the animals retreat and surround it with nets and engines then to drive him up with all their cries and thus force him into the toils which they had previously prepared  in succeeding times the fashion seemed to alter and particularly in sicily the manner of hunting was as follows pier hieroglyph lib vii cap vi  the nobles and gentry being informed which way an herd of deer passed gave notice to one another and appointed a day of hunting for this purpose every one was to bring a crossbow or a long bow and a bundle of staves shod with iron the heads bored with a cord passing through them all thus provided they came to where the herd continued grazing and casting themselves about in a large ring surrounded the deer on every side then each taking his stand unbound his faggot set up his stake and tied the end of the cord to that of his next neighbor at the distance of about ten feet one from the other between each of these stakes was hung a bunch of crimson feathers and so disposed that with the least breath of wind they would whirl round and preserve a sort of fluttering motion this done the persons who set up the staves withdrew and hid themselves in the neighboring coverts then the chief huntsman entering with his hounds within the lines rouzed the game with a full cry the deer frighted and flying on all sides upon approaching the lines were scared away by the fluttering of the feathers and wandered about within this artificial paling still awed by the shining and fluttering plumage that encircled their retreat the huntsman however still pursuing and calling every person by name as he passed by their stand commanded him to shoot the first third or sixth as he pleased and if any of them missed or singled out another than that assigned him it was considered as a most shameful mischance in this manner however the whole herd was at last destroyed and the day concluded with mirth and feasting  the stags of china are of a particular kind for they are no taller than a common housedog and hunting them is one of the principal diversions of the great their flesh while young is exceedingly good but when they arrive at maturity it begins to grow hard and tough however the tongue the muzzle and the ears are in particular esteem among that luxurious people their manner of taking them is singular enough they carry with them the heads of some of the females stuffed and learn exactly to imitate their cry upon this the male does not fail to appear and looking on all sides perceives the head which is all that the hunter who is himself concealed discovers upon their nearer approach the whole company rise surround and often take him alive  there are very few varieties in the red deer of this country and they are mostly found of the same size and color but it is otherwise in different parts of the world where they are seen to differ in form in size in horns and in color  the stag of corsica is a very small animal being not above half the size of those common among us his body is short and thick his legs short and his hair of a dark brown  there is in the forests of germany a kind of stag named by the ancients the tragelaphus and which the natives call the bran deer or the brown deer this is of a darker color than the common stag of a lighter shade upon the belly long hair upon the neck and throat by which it appears bearded like the goat  there is also a very beautiful stag which by some is said to be a native of sardinia but others among whom is mr buffon are of opinion that it comes from africa or the east indies he calls it the axis after pliny and considers it as making the shade between the stag and the fallow deer the horns of the axis are round like those of the stag but the form of its body entirely resembles that of the buck and the size also is exactly the same the hair is of four colors namely fallow white black and gray the white is predominant under the belly on the inside of the thighs and the legs along the back there are two rows of spots in a right line but those on other parts of the body are very irregular a white line runs along each side of this animal while the head and neck are gray the tail is black above and white beneath and the hair upon it is six inches long  although there are but few individuals of the deer kind yet the race seems diffused over all parts of the earth the new continent of america in which neither the sheep the goat nor the gazelle have been originally bred nevertheless produces stags and other animals of the deer kind in sufficient plenty the mexicans have a breed of white stags in their parks which they call stags royal buffon vol xii p     the stags of canada differ from ours in nothing except the size of the horns which in them is greater and the direction of the antlers which rather turn back than project forward as in those of europe the same difference of size that obtains among our stags is also to be seen in that country and as we are informed by ruysch the americans have brought them into the same state of domestic tameness that we have our sheep goats or black cattle they send them forth in the daytime to feed in the forests and at night they return home with the herdsman who guards them the inhabitants have no other milk but what the hind produces and use no other cheese but what is made from thence in this manner we find that an animal which seems made only for mans amusement may be easily brought to supply his necessities nature has many stores of happiness and plenty in reserve which only want the call of industry to be produced and now remain as candidates for human approbation  the fallow deer no two animals can be more nearly allied than the stag and the fallow deer buffon vol xii p     alike in form alike in disposition in the superb furniture of their heads in their swiftness and timidity and yet no two animals keep more distinct or avoid each other with more fixed animosity they are never seen to herd in the same place they never engender together or form a mixed breed and even in those countries where the stag is common the buck seems to be entirely a stranger in short they both form distinct families which though so seemingly near are still remote and although with the same habitudes yet retain an unalterable aversion  the fallow deer as they are much smaller so they seem of a nature less robust and less savage than those of the stag kind they are found but rarely wild in the forests they are in general bred up in parks and kept for the purposes of hunting or of luxury their flesh being preferred to that of any other animal it need scarce be mentioned that the horns of the buck make its principal distinction being broad and palmated whereas those of the stag are in every part round in the one they are flatted and spread like the palm of the hand in the other they grow like a tree every branch being of the shape of the stem that bears it the fallow deer also has the tail longer and the hair lighter than the stag in other respects they pretty nearly resemble one another  the head of the buck as of all other animals of this kind is shed every year and takes the usual time for repairing the only difference between it and the stag is that this change happens later in the buck and its ruttingtime consequently falls more into the winter it is not found so furious at this season as the former nor does it so much exhaust itself by the violence of its ardour it does not quit its natural pastures in quest of the female nor does it attack other animals with indiscriminate ferocity however the males combat for the female among each other and it is not without many contests that one buck is seen to become master of the whole herd  it often happens also that an herd of fallow deer is seen to divide into two parties and engage each other with great ardour and obstinacy buffon vol xii p     they both seem desirous of gaining some favorite spot of the park for pasture and of driving the vanquished party into the coarser and more disagreeable parts each of these factions has its particular chief namely the two oldest and strongest of the herd these lead on to the engagement and the rest follow under their direction these combats are singular enough from the disposition and conduct which seems to regulate their mutual efforts they attack with order and support the assault with courage they come to each others assistance they retire they rally and never give up the victory upon a single defeat the combat is renewed for several days together until at length the most feeble side is obliged to give way and is content to escape to the most disagreeable part of the park where only they can find safety and protection  the fallow deer is easily tamed and feeds upon many things which the stag refuses by this means it preserves its venison better and even after rutting it does not appear entirely exhausted it continues almost in the same state through the whole year although there are particular seasons when its flesh is chiefly in esteem this animal also browzes closer than the stag for which reason it is more prejudicial among young trees which it often strips too close for recovery the young deer eat much faster and more greedily than the old they seek the female at their second year and like the stag are fond of variety the do goes with young above eight months like the hind and commonly brings forth one at a time but they differ in this that the buck comes to perfection at three and lives till sixteen whereas the stag does not come to perfection till seven and lives till forty  as this animal is a beast of chase like the stag so the hunters have invented a number of names relative to him the buck is the first year called a fawn the second a pricket the third a sorel the fourth a sore the fifth a buck of the first head and the sixth a great buck the female is called a do the first year a fawn and the second a tegg the manner of hunting the buck is pretty much the same as that of stag hunting except that less skill is required in the latter the buck is more easily rouzed it is sufficient to judge by the view and mark what grove or covert it enters as it is not known to wander far from thence nor like the stag to change his layer or place of repose when hard hunted it takes to some strong hold or covert with which it is acquainted in the more gloomy parts of the wood or the steeps of the mountain not like the stag flying far before the hounds nor crossing nor doubling nor using any of the subtleties which the stag is accustomed to it will take the water when sorely pressed but seldom a great river nor can it swim so long nor so swiftly as the former in general the strength the cunning and the courage of this animal are inferior to those of the stag and consequently it affords neither so long so various nor so obstinate a chase besides being lighter and not tracking so deeply it leaves a less powerful and lasting scent and the dogs in the pursuit are more frequently at a fault  as the buck is a more delicate animal than the stag so also is it subject to greater varieties british zoology  we have in england two varieties of the fallowdeer which are said to be of foreign origin the beautiful spotted kind which is supposed to have been brought from bengal and the very deep brown sort that are now so common in several parts of this kingdom these were introduced by king james the first from norway for having observed their hardiness and that they could endure the winter even in that severe climate without fodder he brought over some of them into scotland and disposed of them among his chaces since that time they have multiplied in many parts of the british empire and england is now become more famous for its venison than any other country in the world whatever pains the french have taken to rival us in this particular the flesh of their fallowdeer of which they keep but a few has neither the fatness nor the flavor of that fed upon english pasture  however there is scarce a country in europe except far to the northward in which this animal is a stranger the spanish fallowdeer are as large as stags but of a darker color and a more slender neck their tails are longer than those of ours they are black above and white below the virginian deer are larger and stronger than ours with great necks and their color inclinable to gray other kinds have the hoofs of their hind legs marked outwardly with a white spot and their ears and tails much longer than the common one of these has been seen full of white spots with a black list down the middle of his back in guiana a country of south america according to labat there are deer without horns which are much less than those of europe but resembling them in every other particular they are very lively light of course and excessively fearful their hair is of a reddish sallow their heads are small and lean their ears little their necks long and arched the tail short and the sight piercing when pursued they fly into places where no other animal can follow them the negroes who pursue them stand to watch for them in narrow paths which lead to the brook or the meadow where they feed there waiting in the utmost silence for the slightest sound will drive them away the negroe when he perceives the animal within reach shoots and is happy if he can bring down his game their flesh though seldom fat is considered as a great delicacy and the hunter is well rewarded for his trouble  the roebuck the roebuck is the smallest of the deer kind known in our climate and is now almost extinct among us except in some parts of the highlands of scotland it is generally about three feet long and about two feet high the horns are from eight to nine inches long upright round and divided into only three branches the body is covered with very long hair well adapted to the rigor of its mountainous abode the lower part of each hair is ash color near the ends is a narrow bar of black and the points are yellow the hairs on the face are black tipped with ash color the ears are long their insides of a pale yellow and covered with long hair the spaces bordering on the eyes and mouth are black the chest belly and legs and the inside of the thighs are of a yellowish white the rump is of a pure white and the tail very short the make of this little animal is very elegant and its swiftness equals its beauty it differs from the fallowdeer in having round horns and not flatted like theirs it differs from the stag in its smaller size and the proportionable paucity of its antlers and it differs from all of the goat kind as it annually sheds its head and obtains a new one which none of that kind are ever seen to do  as the stag frequents the thickest forests and the sides of the highest mountains the roebuck with humbler ambition courts the shady thicket and the rising slope although less in size and far inferior in strength to the stag it is yet more beautiful more active and even more courageous its hair is always smooth clean and glossy and it frequents only the dryest places and of the purest air though but a very little animal as we have already observed yet when its young is attacked it faces even the stag himself and often comes off victorious buffon vol xii p     all its motions are elegant and easy it bounds without effort and continues the course with but little fatigue it is also possessed of more cunning in avoiding the hunter is more difficult to pursue and although its scent is much stronger than that of the stag it is more frequently found to make good a retreat it is not with the roebuck as with the stag who never offers to use art until his strength is beginning to decline this more cunning animal when it finds that its first efforts to escape are without success returns upon its former track again goes forward and again returns until by its various windings it has entirely confounded the scent and joined the last emanations to those of its former course it then by a bound goes to one side lies flat upon its belly and permits the pack to pass by very near without offering to stir  but the roebuck differs not only from the stag in superior cunning but also in its natural appetites its inclinations and its whole habits of living instead of herding together these animals live in separate families the sire the dam and the young ones associate together and never admit a stranger into their little community all others of the deer kind are inconstant in their affection but the roebuck never leaves its mate and as they have been generally bred up together from their first fawning they conceive so strong an attachment the male for the female that they never after separate their ruttingseason continues but fifteen days from the latter end of october to about the middle of november they are not at that time like the stag overloaded with fat they have not that strong odor which is perceived in all others of the deer kind they have none of those furious excesses nothing in short that alters their state they only drive away their fawns upon these occasions the buck forcing them to retire in order to make room for a succeeding progeny however when the copulating season is over the fawns return to their does and remain with them some time longer after which they quit them entirely in order to begin an independent family of their own the female goes with young but five months and an half which alone serves to distinguish this animal from all others of the deer kind that continue pregnant more than eight in this respect she rather approaches more nearly to the goat kind from which however this race is separated by the males annual casting its horns  when the female is ready to bring forth she seeks a retreat in the thickest part of the woods being not less apprehensive of the buck from whom she then separates than of the wolf the wild cat and almost every ravening animal of the forest she generally produces two at a time and three but very rarely in about ten or twelve days these are able to follow their dam except in cases of warm pursuit when their strength is not equal to the fatigue upon such occasions the tenderness of the dam is very extraordinary leaving them in the deepest thickets she offers herself to the danger flies before the hounds and does all in her power to lead them from the retreat where she has lodged her little ones such animals as are nearly upon her own level she boldly encounters attacks the stag the wild cat and even the wolf and while she has life continues her efforts to protect her young yet all her endeavors are often vain about the month of may which is her fawning time there is a greater destruction among those animals than at any other season of the year numbers of the fawns are taken alive by the peasants numbers are found out and worried by the dogs and still more by the wolf which has always been their most inveterate enemy by these continual depredations upon this beautiful creature the roebuck is every day becoming scarcer and the whole race in many countries is wholly worn out they were once common in england the huntsmen who characterised only such beasts as they knew have given names to the different kinds and ages as to the stag thus they called it the first year an hind the second a gyrle and the third an hemuse but these names at present are utterly useless since the animal no longer exists among us even in france where it was once extremely common it is now confined to a few provinces and it is probable that in an age or two the whole breed will be utterly extirpated mr buffon indeed observes that in those districts where it is mostly found it seems to maintain its usual plenty and that the balance between its destruction and increase is held pretty even however the number in general is known to decrease for wherever cultivation takes place the beasts of nature are known to retire many animals that once flourished in the world may now be extinct and the descriptions of aristotle and pliny though taken from life may be considered as fabulous as their archetypes are no longer existing  the fawns continue to follow the deer eight or nine months in all and upon separating their horns begin to appear simple and without antlers the first year as in those of the stag kind buffon vol xii p     these they shed at the latter end of autumn and renew during the winter differing in this from the stag who sheds them in spring and renews them in summer when the roebucks head is completely furnished it rubs the horns against trees in the manner of the stag and thus strips them of the rough skin and the blood vessels which no longer contribute to their nourishment and growth when these fall and new ones begin to appear the roebuck does not retire as the stag to the covert of the wood but continues its usual haunts only keeping down its head to avoid striking its horns against the branches of trees the pain of which it seems to feel with exquisite sensibility the stag who sheds his horns in summer is obliged to seek a retreat from the flies that at that time greatly incommode him but the roebuck who sheds them in winter is under no such necessity and consequently does not separate from its little family but keeps with the female all the year round buffon ibid   as the growth of the roebuck and its arrival at maturity is much speedier than that of the stag so its life is proportionably shorter it seldom is found to extend above twelve or fifteen years and if kept tame it does not live above six or seven it is an animal of a very delicate constitution requiring variety of food air and exercise it must be paired with a female and kept in a park of at least an hundred acres they may easily be subdued but never thoroughly tamed no arts can teach them to be familiar with the feeder much less attached to him they still preserve a part of their natural wildness and are subject to terrors without a cause they sometimes in attempting to escape strike themselves with such force against the walls of their enclosure that they break their limbs and become utterly disabled whatever care is taken to tame them they are never entirely to be relied on as they have capricious fits of fierceness and sometimes strike at those they dislike with a degree of force that is very dangerous  the cry of the roebuck is neither so loud nor so frequent as that of the stag the young ones have a particular manner of calling to the dam which the hunters easily imitate and often thus allure the female to her destruction upon some occasions also they become in a manner intoxicated with their food which during the spring is said to ferment in their stomachs and they are then very easily taken in summer they keep close under covert of the forest and seldom venture out except in violent heats to drink at some river or fountain in general however they are contented to slake their thirst with the dew that falls on the grass and the leaves of trees and seldom risque their safety to satisfy their appetite they delight chiefly in hilly grounds preferring the tender branches and buds of trees to corn or other vegetables and it is universally allowed that the flesh of those between one and two years old is the greatest delicacy that is known perhaps also the scarceness of it enhances its flavor  in america this animal is much more common than in europe with us there are but two known varieties the red which is the larger sort and the brown with a spot behind which is less but in the new continent the breed is extremely numerous and the varieties in equal proportion in louisiana where they are extremely common they are much larger than in europe and the inhabitants live in a great measure upon its flesh which tastes like mutton when well fatted they are found also in brasil where they have the name of cuguacu apara only differing from ours in some slight deviations in the horns this animal is also said to be common in china although such as have described it seem to confound it with the muskgoat which is of a quite different nature  the elk we have hitherto been describing minute animals in comparison of the elk the size of which from concurrent testimony appears to be equal to that of the elephant itself it is an animal rather of the buck than the stag kind as its horns are flatted toward the top but it is far beyond both in stature some of them being known to be above ten feet high it is a native both of the old and new continent being known in europe under the name of the elk and in america by that of the moosedeer it is sometimes taken in the german and russian forests although seldom appearing but it is extremely common in north america where the natives pursue and track it in the snow the accounts of this animal are extremely various some describing it as being no higher than an horse and others above twelve feet high  as the stature of this creature makes its chief depiction of the moose or elk the female moose or elk de seve del isc tailor sculp peculiarity so it were to be wished that we could come to some precision upon that head if we were to judge of its size by the horns which are sometimes fortuitously dug up in many parts of ireland we should not be much amiss in ascribing them to an animal at least ten feet high one of these i have seen which was ten feet nine inches from one tip to the other from such dimensions it is easy to perceive that it required an animal far beyond the size of an horse to support them to bear an head with such extensive and heavy antlers required no small degree of strength and without all doubt the bulk of the body must have been proportionable to the size of the horns i remember some years ago to have seen a small moosedeer which was brought from america by a gentleman of ireland it was about the size of an horse and the horns were very little larger than those of a common stag this therefore serves to prove that the horns bear an exact proportion to the animals size the small elk has but small horns whereas those enormous ones which we have described above must have belonged to a proportionable creature in all the more noble animals nature observes a perfect symmetry and it is not to be supposed she fails in this single instance we have no reason therefore to doubt the accounts of jocelyn and dudley who affirm that they have been found fourteen spans which at nine inches to a span makes the animal almost eleven feet high others have extended their accounts to twelve and fourteen feet which makes this creature one of the most formidable of the forest  there is but very little difference between the european elk and the american moosedeer as they are but varieties of the same animal it may be rather larger in america than with us as in the forests of that unpeopled country it receives less disturbance than in our own in all places however it is timorous and gentle content with its pasture and never willing to disturb any other animal when supplied itself  the european elk grows to above seven or eight feet high in the year      there was a female of this animal shown at paris which was caught in a forest of red russia belonging to the cham of tartary dictionaire raisonnee des animaux an nom elan  it was then but young and its height was even at that time six feet seven inches but the describer observes that it has since become much taller and thicker so that we may suppose this female at least seven feet high there have been no late opportunities of seeing the male but by the rule of proportion we may estimate his size at eight or nine feet at the least which is about twice as high as an ordinary horse the height however of the female which was measured was but six feet seven inches paris measure or almost seven english feet high it was ten feet from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail and eight feet round the body the hair was very long and coarse like that of a wild boar the ears resembled those of a mule and were a foot and an half long the upper jaw was longer by six inches than the lower and like other ruminating animals it had no teeth cutting teeth i suppose the describer means it had a large beard under the throat like a goat and in the middle of the forehead between the horns there was a bone as large as an egg the nostrils were four inches long on each side of the mouth it made use of its fore feet as a defense against its enemies those who showed it asserted that it ran with astonishing swiftness that it swam also with equal expedition and was very fond of the water they gave it thirty pounds of bread every day beside hay and it drank eight buckets of water it was tame and familiar and submissive enough to its keeper  this description differs in many circumstances from that which we have of the moose or american elk which the french call the original of these there are two kinds the common light gray moose which is not very large and the black moose which grows to an enormous height mr dudley observes that a do or hind of the black moose kind of the fourth year wanted but an inch of seven feet high all however of both kinds have flat palmed horns not unlike the fallowdeer only that the palm is much larger having a short trunk at the head and then immediately spreading above a foot broad with a kind of small antlers like teeth on one of the edges in this particular all of the elk kind agree as well the european elk as the gray and the black moosedeer  the gray moosedeer is about the size of an horse and although it has large buttocks its tail is not above an inch long as in all of this kind the upper lip is much longer than the under it is said that they continue to go backward as they feed their nostrils are so large that a man may thrust his hand in a considerable way and their horns are as long as those of a stag but as was observed much broader  the black moose is the enormous animal mentioned above from eight to twelve feet high josseleyn who is the first english writer that mentions it says that it is a goodly creature twelve feet high with exceeding fair horns that have broad palms two fathoms from the top of one horn to another he assures us that it is a creature or rather a monster of superfluity and many times bigger than an english ox this account is confirmed by dudley but he does not give so great an expansion to the horns measuring them only thirtyone inches between one tip and the other however that such an extraordinary animal as josseleyn describes has actually existed we can make no manner of doubt of since there are horns common enough to be seen among us twelve feet from one tip to the other  these animals delight in cold countries feeding upon grass in summer and the bark of trees in winter when the whole country is deeply covered with snow the moosedeer herd together under the tall pinetrees strip off the bark and remain in that part of the forest while it yields them subsistence it is at that time that the natives prepare to hunt them and particularly when the sun begins to melt the snow by day which is frozen again at night for then the icy crust which covers the surface of the snow is too weak to support so great a bulk and only retards the animals motion when the indians therefore perceive an herd of these at a distance they immediately prepare for their pursuit which is not as with us the sport of an hour but is attended with toil difficulty and danger phil trans vol ii p      the timorous animal no sooner observes its enemies approach than it immediately endeavors to escape but sinks at every step it takes still however it pursues its way through a thousand obstacles the snow which is usually four feet deep yields to its weight and embarrasses its speed the sharp ice wounds its feet and its lofty horns are entangled in the branches of the forest as it passes along the trees however are broken down with ease and wherever the moosedeer runs it is perceived by the snapping off the branches of trees as thick as a mans thigh with its horns the chase lasts in this manner for the whole day and sometimes it has been known to continue for two nay three days together for the pursuers are often not less excited by famine than the pursued by fear their perseverance however generally succeeds and the indian who first comes near enough darts his lance with unerring aim which sticks in the poor animal and at first increases its efforts to escape in this manner the moose trots heavily on for that is its usual pace till its pursuers once more come up and repeat their blow upon this it again summons up sufficient vigor to get an head but at last quite tired and spent with loss of blood it sinks as the describer expresses it like a ruined building and makes the earth shake beneath its fall  this animal when killed is a very valuable acquisition to the hunters the flesh is very well tasted and said to be very nourishing the hide is strong and so thick that it has been often known to turn a musketball however it is soft and pliable and when tanned the leather is extremely light yet very lasting the fur is a light gray in some and blackish in others and when viewed through a microscope appears spongy like a bulrush and is smaller at the roots and points than in the middle for this reason it lies very flat and smooth and though beaten or abused never so much it always returns to its former state the horns also are not less useful being applied to all the purposes for which hartshorn is beneficial these are different in different animals in some they resemble entirely those of the european elk which spread into a broad palm with small antlers on one of the edges in others they have a branched browantler between the bur and the palm which the german elk has not and in this they entirely agree with those whose horns are so frequently dug up in ireland this animal is said to be troubled with the epilepsy as it is often found to fall down when pursued and thus becomes an easier prey for this reason an imaginary virtue has been ascribed to the hinder hoof which some have supposed to be a specific against all epileptic disorders this however may be considered as a vulgar error as well as that of its curing itself of this disorder by applying the hinder hoof behind the ear after all this animal is but very indifferently and confusedly described by travelers each mixing his account with something false or trivial often mistaking some other quadrupede for the elk and confounding its history thus some have mistaken it for the reindeer which in every thing but size it greatly resembles some have supposed it to be the same with the depiction of the reindeer the rein deer de seve del isc tailor sculp tapurette condamine  from which it entirely differs some have described it as the common red american stag which scarcely differs from our own and lastly some have confounded it with the bubalus which is more properly a gazelle of africa dappers description de l afrique p      the reindeer of all animals of the deer kind the reindeer is the most extraordinary and the most useful it is a native of the icy regions of the north and though many attempts have been made to accustom it to a more southern climate it shortly feels the influence of the change and in a few months declines and dies nature seems to have fitted it entirely to answer the necessities of that hardy race of mankind that live near the pole as these would find it impossible to subsist among their barren snowy mountains without its aid so this animal can live only there where its assistance is most absolutely necessary from it alone the natives of lapland and greenland supply most of their wants it answers the purposes of an horse to convey them and their scanty furniture from one mountain to another it answers the purposes of a cow in giving milk and it answers the purposes of the sheep in furnishing them with a warm though an homely kind of clothing from this quadrupede alone therefore they receive as many advantages as we derive from three of our most useful creatures so that providence does not leave these poor outcasts entirely destitute but gives them a faithful domestic more patient and serviceable than any other in nature  the reindeer resembles the american elk in the fashion of its horns it is not easy in words to describe these minute differences nor will the reader perhaps have a distinct idea of the similitude when told that both have browantlers very large and hanging over their eyes palmated toward the top and bending forward like a bow but here the similitude between these two animals ends for as the elk is much larger than the stag so the reindeer is much smaller it is lower and stronger built than the stag its legs are shorter and thicker and its hoofs much broader than in that animal its hair is much thicker and warmer its horns much larger in proportion and branching forward over its eyes its ears are much larger its pace is rather a trot than a bounding and this it can continue for a whole day its hoofs are cloven and moveable so that it spreads them abroad as it goes to prevent its sinking in the snow when it proceeds on a journey it lays its great horns on its back while there are two branches which always hang over its forehead and almost cover its face one thing seems peculiar to this animal and the elk which is that as they move along their hoofs are heard to crack with a pretty loud noise this arises from their manner of treading for as they rest upon their cloven hoof it spreads on the ground and the two divisions separate from each other but when they lift it the divisions close again and strike against each other with a crack the female also of the reindeer has horns as well as the male by which the species is distinguished from all other animals of the deer kind whatsoever  when the reindeer first shed their coat of hair they are brown but in proportion as summer approaches their hair begins to grow whitish until at last they are nearly gray for the greatest part of this description of the reindeer i am obliged to mr hoffberg upon whose authority being a native of sweden and an experienced naturalist we may confidently rely  they are however always black about the eyes the neck has long hair hanging down and coarser than upon any other part of the body the feet just at the insertion of the hoof are surrounded with a ring of white the hair in general stands so thick over the whole body that if one should attempt to separate it the skin will no where appear uncovered whenever it falls also it is not seen to drop from the root as in other quadrupedes but seems broken short near the bottom so that the lower part of the hair is seen growing while the upper falls away  the horns of the female are made like those of the male except that they are smaller and less branching as in the rest of the deer kind they sprout from the points and also in the beginning are furnished with an hairy crust which supports the blood vessels of most exquisite sensibility the reindeer shed their horns after ruttingtime at the latter end of november and they are not completely furnished again till toward autumn the female always retains hers till she brings forth and then sheds them about the beginning of november if she be barren however which is not unfrequently the case she does not shed them till winter the castration of the reindeer does not prevent the shedding of their horns those which are the strongest cast them early in winter those which are more weakly not so soon thus from all these circumstances we see how greatly this animal differs from the common stag the female of the reindeer has horns which the hind is never seen to have the reindeer when castrated renews its horns which we are assured the stag never does it differs not less in its habits and manner of living being tame submissive and patient while the stag is wild capricious and unmanageable  the reindeer as was said is naturally an inhabitant of the countries bordering on the arctic circle it is not unknown to the natives of siberia the north americans also hunt it under the name of the caribou but in lapland this animal is converted to the utmost advantage and some herdsmen of that country are known to possess above a thousand in a single herd  lapland is divided into two districts the mountainous and the woody the mountainous part of the country is at best barren and bleak excessively cold and uninhabitable during the winter still however it is the most desirable part of this frightful region and is most thickly peopled during the summer the natives generally reside on the declivity of the mountains three or four cottages together and lead a cheerful and a social life upon the approach of winter they are obliged to migrate into the plains below each bringing down his whole herd which often amounts to more than a thousand and leading them where the pasture is in greatest plenty the woody part of the country is much more desolate and hideous the whole face of nature there presents a frightful scene of trees without fruit and plains without verdure as far as the eye can reach nothing is to be seen even in the midst of summer but barren fields covered only with a moss almost as white as snow no grass no flowery landscapes only here and there a pine tree which may have escaped the frequent conflagrations by which the natives burn down their forests but what is very extraordinary as the whole surface of the country is clothed in white so on the contrary the forests seem to the last degree dark and gloomy while one kind of moss makes the fields look as if they were covered with snow another kind blackens over all the trees and even hides their verdure this moss however which deforms the country serves for its only support as upon it alone the reindeer can subsist the inhabitants who during the summer lived among the mountains drive down their herds in winter and people the plains and woods below such of the laplanders as inhabit the woods and the plains all the year round live remote from each other and having been used to solitude are melancholy ignorant and helpless they are much poorer also than the mountaineers for while one of those is found to possess a thousand reindeer at a time none of these are ever known to rear the tenth part of that number the reindeer makes the riches of this people and the cold mountainy parts of the country agree best with its constitution it is for this reason therefore that the mountains of lapland are preferred to the woods and that many claim an exclusive right to the tops of hills covered in almost eternal snow  as soon as the summer begins to appear the laplander who had fed his reindeer upon the lower grounds during the winter then drives them up to the mountains and leaves the woody country and the low pasture which at that season are truly deplorable the gnats bred by the suns heat in the marshy bottoms and the weedy lakes with which the country abounds more than any other part of the world are all upon the wing and fill the whole air like clouds of dust in a dry windy day the inhabitants at that time are obliged to daub their faces with pitch mixed with milk to shield their skins from their depredations all places are then so greatly infested that the poor natives can scarce open their mouths without fear of suffocation the insects enter from their numbers and minuteness into the nostrils and the eyes and do not leave the sufferer a moment at his ease but they are chiefly enemies to the reindeer the horns of that animal being then in their tender state and possessed of extreme sensibility a famished cloud of insects instantly settle upon them and drive the poor animal almost to distraction in this extremity there are but two remedies to which the quadrupede as well as its master are obliged to have recourse the one is for both to take shelter near their cottage where a large fire of tree moss is prepared which filling the whole place with smoke keeps off the gnat and thus by one inconvenience expels a greater the other is to ascend to the highest summit of the mountains where the air is too thin and the weather too cold for the gnats to come there the reindeer are seen to continue the whole day although without food rather than to venture down into the lower parts where they can have no defense against their unceasing persecutors  besides the gnat there is also a gadfly that during the summer season is no less formidable to them this insect is bred under their skins where the egg has been deposed the preceding summer and it is no sooner produced as a fly than it again endeavors to deposite its eggs in some place similar to that from whence it came whenever therefore it appears flying over an herd of reindeer it puts the whole body how numerous soever into motion they know their enemy and do all they can by tossing their horns and running among each other to terrify or avoid it all their endeavors however are too generally without effect the gadfly is seen to deposite its eggs which burrowing under the skin wound it in several places and often bring on an incurable disorder  in the morning therefore as soon as the lapland herdsman drives his deer to pasture his greatest care is to keep them from scaling the summits of the mountains where there is no food but where they go merely to be at ease from the gnats and gadflies that are ever annoying them at this time there is a strong contest between the dogs and the deer the one endeavoring to climb up against the side of the hill and to gain those summits that are covered in eternal snows the other forcing them down by barking and threatening and in a manner compelling them into the places where their food is in the greatest plenty there the men and dogs confine them guarding them with the utmost precaution the whole day and driving them home at the proper seasons for milking  the female brings forth in the middle of may and gives milk till about the middle of october every morning and evening during the summer the herdsman returns to the cottage with his deer to be milked where the women previously have kindled up a smoky fire which effectually drives off the gnats and keeps the reindeer quiet while milking the female furnishes about a pint which though thinner than that of the cow is nevertheless sweeter and more nourishing this done the herdsman drives them back to pasture as he neither folds nor houses them neither provides for their subsistence during the winter nor improves their pasture by cultivation  upon the return of the winter when the gnats and flies are no longer to be feared the laplander descends into the lower grounds and as there are but few to dispute the possession of that desolate country he has an extensive range to feed them in their chief and almost their only food at that time is the white moss already mentioned which from its being fed upon by this animal obtains the name of the lichen rangiferinus this is of two kinds the woody lichen which covers almost all the desert parts of the country like snow the other is black and covers the branches of the trees in very great quantities however unpleasing these may be to the spectator the native esteems them as one of his choicest benefits and the most indulgent gift of nature while his fields are clothed with moss he envies neither the fertility nor the verdure of the more southern landscape dressed up warmly in his deerskin clothes with shoes and gloves of the same materials he drives his herds along the desert fearless and at ease ignorant of any higher luxury than what their milk and smoke dried flesh afford him hardened to the climate he sleeps in the midst of ice or awaking dozes away his time with tobacco while his faithful dogs supply his place and keep the herd from wandering the deer in the mean time with instincts adapted to the soil pursue their food though covered in the deepest snow they turn it up with their noses like swine and even though its surface be frozen and stiff yet the hide is so hardened in that part that they easily overcome the difficulty it sometimes however happens though but rarely that the winter commences with rain and a frost ensuing covers the whole country with a glazed crust of ice then indeed both the reindeer and the laplander are undone they have no provisions laid up in case of accident and the only resource is to cut down the large pinetrees that are covered with moss which furnishes but a scanty supply so that the greatest part of the herd is then seen to perish without a possibility of assistance it sometimes also happens that even this supply is wanting for the laplander often burns down his woods in order to improve and fertilize the soil which produces the moss upon which he feeds his cattle  in this manner the pastoral life is still continued near the pole neither the coldness of the winter nor the length of the nights neither the wildness of the forest nor the vagrant disposition of the herd interrupt the even tenor of the laplanders life by night and day he is seen attending his favorite cattle and remains unaffected in a season which would be speedy death to those bred up in a milder climate he gives himself no uneasiness to house his herds or to provide a winter subsistence for them he is at the trouble neither of manuring his grounds nor bringing in his harvests he is not the hireling of anothers luxury all his labors are to obviate the necessities of his own situation and these he undergoes with cheerfulness as he is sure to enjoy the fruits of his own industry if therefore we compare the laplander with the peasant of more southern climates we shall have little reason to pity his situation the climate in which he lives is rather terrible to us than to him and as for the rest he is blessed with liberty plenty and ease the reindeer alone supplies him with all the wants of life and some of the conveniences serving to show how many advantages nature is capable of supplying when necessity gives the call thus the poor little helpless native who was originally perhaps driven by fear or famine into those inhospitable climates would seem at first view to be the most wretched of mankind but it is far otherwise he looks round among the few wild animals that his barren country can maintain and singles out one from among them and that of a kind which the rest of mankind have not thought worth taking from a state of nature this he cultivates propagates and multiplies and from this alone derives every comfort that can soften the severity of his situation  the reindeer of this country are of two kinds the wild and the tame the wild are larger and stronger but more mischievous than the others their breed however is preferred to that of the tame and the female of the latter is often sent into the woods from whence she returns home impregnated by one of the wild kind these are fitter for drawing the sledge to which the laplander accustoms them betimes and yoaks them to it by a strap which goes round the neck and comes down between their legs the sledge is extremely light and shod at the bottom with the skin of a young deer the hair turned to slide on the frozen snow the person who sits on this guides the animal with a cord fastened round the horns and encourages it to proceed with his voice and drives it with a goad some of the wild breed though by far the strongest are yet found refractory and often turn upon their drivers who have then no other resource but to cover themselves with their sledge and let the animal vent its fury upon that but it is otherwise with those that are tame no creature can be more active patient and willing when hard pushed they will trot nine or ten swedish miles or between fifty and sixty english miles at one stretch but in such a case the poor obedient creature fatigues itself to death and if not prevented by the laplander who kills it immediately it will die a day or two after in general they can go about thirty miles without halting and this without any great or dangerous efforts this which is the only manner of traveling in that country can be performed only in winter when the snow is glazed over with ice and although it be a very speedy method of conveyance yet it is inconvenient dangerous and troublesome  in order to make these animals more obedient and more generally serviceable they castrate them which operation the laplanders perform with their teeth these become sooner fat when taken from labor and they are found to be stronger in drawing the sledge there is usually one male left entire for every six females these are in rut from the feast of st matthew to about michaelmas at this time their horns are thoroughly burnished and their battles among each other are fierce and obstinate the females do not begin to breed till they are two years old and then they continue regularly breeding every year till they are superannuated they go with young above eight months and generally bring forth two at a time the fondness of the dam for her young is very remarkable it often happens that when they are separated from her she will return from pasture keep calling round the cottage for them and will not desist until dead or alive they are brought and laid at her feet they are at first of a light brown but they become darker with age and at last the old ones are of a brown almost approaching to blackness the young follow the dam for two or three years but they do not acquire their full growth until four they are then broke in and managed for drawing the sledge and they continue serviceable for four or five years longer they never live above fifteen or sixteen years and when they arrive at the proper age the laplander generally kills them for the sake of their skins and their flesh this he performs by striking them on the back of the neck with his knife into the spinal marrow upon which they instantly fall and he then cuts the arteries that lead to the heart and lets the blood discharge itself into the cavity of the breast  there is scarce any part of this animal that is not converted to its peculiar uses as soon as it begins to grow old and some time before the rut it is killed and the flesh dried in the air it is also sometimes hardened with smoke and laid up for traveling provision when the natives migrate from one part of the country to another during the winter the reindeer are slaughtered as sheep with us and every four persons in the family are allowed one reindeer for their weeks subsistence in spring they spare the herd as much as they can and live upon fresh fish in summer the milk and curd of the reindeer makes their chief provision and in autumn they live wholly upon fowls which they kill with a crossbow or catch in springes nor is this so scanty an allowance since at that time the seafowls come in such abundance that their ponds and springs are covered over these are not so shy as with us but yield themselves an easy prey they are chiefly allured to those places by the swarms of gnats which infest the country during summer and now repay the former inconveniences by inviting such numbers of birds as supply the natives with food a fourth part of the year in great abundance  the milk when newly taken is warmed in a cauldron and thickened with rennet and then the curd is pressed into cheeses which are little and well tasted these are never found to breed mites as the cheese of other countries probably because the mite fly is not to be found in lapland the whey which remains is warmed up again and becomes of a consistence as if thickened with the white of eggs upon this the laplanders feed during the summer it is pleasant and well tasted but not very nourishing as to butter they very seldom make any because the milk affords but a very small quantity and this both in taste and consistence is more nearly resembling to suet they never keep their milk till it turns sour and do not dress it into the variety of dishes which the more southern countries are known to do the only delicacy they make from it is with wood sorrel which being boiled up with it and coagulating the whole is put into casks or deerskins and kept under ground to be eaten in winter  the skin is even a more valuable part of this animal than either of the former from that part of it which covered the head and feet they make their strong snow shoes with the hair on the outside of the other parts they compose their garments which are extremely warm and which cover them all over the hair of these also is on the outside and they sometimes line them within with the fur of the glutton or some other warm furred animal of that climate these skins also serve them for beds they spread them on each side of the fire upon the leaves of the dwarf birchtree and in this manner lie both soft and warm many garments made of the skin of the rein deer are so ery year to the inhabitants of the more southern parts of europe and they are found so serviceable in keeping out the cold that even people of the first rank are known to wear them  in short no part of this animal is thrown away as useless the blood is preserved in small casks to make sauce with the marrow in spring the horns are sold to be converted into glue the sinews are dried and divided so as to make the strongest kind of sowing thread not unlike catgut the tongues which are considered as a great delicacy are dried and sold into the more southern provinces the intestines themselves are washed like our tripe and in high esteem among the natives thus the laplander finds all his necessities amply supplied from this single animal and he who has a large herd of these animals has no idea of higher luxury  but although the reindeer be a very hardy and vigorous animal it is not without its diseases i have already mentioned the pain it feels from the gnat and the apprehensions it is under from the gadfly its hide is often found pierced in an hundred places like a sieve from this insect and not a few die in their third year from this very cause their teats also are subject to cracking so that blood comes instead of milk they sometimes take a loathing for their food and instead of eating stand still and chew the cud they are also troubled with a vertigo like the elk and turn round often till they die the laplander judges of their state by the manner of their turning if they turn to the right he judges their disorder but slight if they turn to the left he deems it incurable the reindeer are also subject to ulcers near the hoof which unqualifies them for traveling or keeping with the herd but the most fatal disorder of all is that which the natives call the suddataka which attacks this animal at all seasons of the year the instant it is seized with this disease it begins to breathe with greater difficulty its eyes begin to stare and its nostrils to expand it acquires also an unusual degree of ferocity and attacks all it meets indiscriminately still however it continues to feed as if in health but is not seen to chew the cud and it lies down more frequently than before in this manner it continues every day consuming and growing more lean till at last it dies from mere inanition and not one of these that are attacked with this disorder are ever found to recover notwithstanding it is but very lately known in that part of the world although during the last ten or fifteen years it has spoiled whole provinces of this necessary creature it is contagious and the moment the laplander perceives any of his herd infected he hastens to kill them immediately before it spreads any farther when examined internally there is a frothy substance found in the brain and round the lungs the intestines are lax and flabby and the spleen is diminished almost to nothing the laplanders only cure in all these disorders is to anoint the animals back with tar if this does not succeed he considers the disease as beyond the power of art and with his natural phlegm submits to the severities of fortune  besides the internal maladies of this animal there are some external enemies which it has to fear the bears now and then make depredations upon the herd but of all their persecutors the creature called the glutton is the most dangerous and the most successful the war between these is carried on not less in lapland than in north america where the reindeer is called the caribow and the glutton the carcajou this animal which is not above the size of a badger waits whole weeks together for its prey hid in the branches of some spreading tree and when the wild reindeer passes underneath it instantly drops down upon it fixing its teeth and claws into the neck just behind the horns it is in vain that the wounded animal then flies for protection that it rustles among the branches of the forest the glutton still holds its former position and although it often loses a part of its skin and flesh which are rubbed off against the trees yet it still keeps fast until its prey drops with fatigue and loss of blood the deer has but one only method of escape which is by jumping into the water that element its enemy cannot endure for as we are told it quits its hold immediately and then thinks only of providing for its own proper security  chap vi of quadrupedes of the hog kind animals of the hog kind seem to unite in themselves all those distinctions by which others are separated they resemble those of the horse kind in the number of their teeth which in all amount to fortyfour in the length of their head and in having but a single stomach they resemble the cow kind in their cloven hoofs and the position of their intestines and they resemble those of the clawfooted kind in their appetite for flesh in their not chewing the cud and in their numerous progeny thus this species serves to fill up that chasm which is found between the carnivorous kinds and those that live upon grass being possessed of the ravening appetite of the one and the inoffensive nature of the other we may consider them therefore as of a middle nature which we can refer neither to the rapacious nor the peaceful kinds and yet partaking somewhat of the nature of both like the rapacious kinds they are found to have short intestines their hoofs also though cloven to the sight will upon anatomical inspection appear to be supplied with bones like beasts of prey and the number of their teats also increase the similitude on the other hand in a natural state they live upon vegetables and seldom seek after animal food except when urged by necessity they offend no other animal of the forest at the same time that they are furnished with arms to terrify the bravest  the wild boar which is the original of all the varieties we find in this creature is by no means so stupid nor so filthy an animal as that we have reduced to tameness he is much smaller than the tame hog and does not vary in his color as those of the domestic kind do but is always found of an iron gray inclining to black his snout is much longer than that of the tame hog and the ears are shorter rounder and black of which color are also the feet and the tail he roots the ground in a different manner from the common hog for as this turns up the earth in little spots here and there so the wild boar plows it up like a furrow and does irreparable damage in the cultivated lands of the farmer the tusks also of this animal are larger than in the tame breed some of them being seen almost a foot long buffon vol ix p      these as is well known grow from both the under and upper jaw bend upwards circularly and are exceeding sharp at the points they differ from the tusks of the elephant in this that they never fall and it is remarkable of all the hog kind that they never shed their teeth as other animals are seen to do the tusks of the lower jaw are always the most to be dreaded and are found to give very terrible wounds  the wild boar can properly be called neither a solitary nor a gregarious animal the three first years the whole litter follows the sow and the family lives in a herd together they are then called beasts of company and unite their common forces against the invasions of the wolf or the more formidable beasts of prey upon this their principal safety while young depends for when attacked they give each other mutual assistance calling to each other with a very loud and fierce note the strongest face the danger they form a ring and the weakest fall into the center in this position few ravenous beasts dare venture to attack them but pursue the chase where there is less resistance and danger however when the wild boar is come to a state of maturity and when conscious of his own superior strength he then walks the forest alone and fearless at that time he dreads no single creature nor does he turn out of his way even for man himself he does not seek danger and he does not much seem to avoid it  this animal is therefore seldom attacked but at a disadvantage either by numbers or when found sleeping by moonlight the hunting the wild boar is one of the principal amusements of the nobility in those countries where it is to be found the dogs provided for this sport are of the slow heavy kind those used for hunting the stag or the roebuck would be very improper as they would too soon come up with their prey and instead of a chase would only furnish out an engagement a small mastiff is therefore chosen nor are the hunters much mindful of the goodness of their nose as the wild boar leaves so strong a scent that it is impossible for them to mistake its course they never hunt any but the largest and the oldest which are known by their tracks when the boar is reared as is the expression for driving him from his covert he goes slowly and uniformly forward not much afraid nor very far before his pursuers at the end of every half mile or thereabouts he turns round stops till the hounds come up and offers to attack them these on the other hand knowing their danger keep off and bay him at a distance after they have for a while gazed upon each other with mutual animosity the boar again slowly goes on his course and the dogs renew their pursuit in this manner the charge is sustained and the chase continues till the boar is quite tired and refuses to go any farther the dogs then attempt to close in upon him from behind those which are young fierce and unaccustomed to the chase are generally the foremost and often lose their lives by their ardour those which are older and better trained are content to wait until the hunters come up who strike at him with their spears and after several blows dispatch or disable him the instant the animal is killed they cut off the testicles which would otherwise give a taint to the flesh and the huntsmen celebrate the victory with their horns  the hog in a natural state is found to feed chiefly upon roots and vegetables it seldom attacks any other animal being content with such provisions as it procures without danger whatever animal happens to die in the forest or is so wounded that it can make no resistance becomes a prey to the hog who seldom refuses animal food how putrid soever although it is never at the pains of taking or procuring it alive for this reason it seems a glutton rather by accident than choice content with vegetable food and only devouring flesh when pressed by necessity and when it happens to offer indeed if we behold the hog in its domestic state it is the most sordid and brutal animal in nature buffon vol ix p     the aukwardness of its form seems to influence its appetites and all its sensations are as gross as its shapes are unsightly it seems possessed only of an insatiable desire of eating and seems to make choice only of what other animals find the most offensive but we ought to consider that the hog with us is in an unnatural state and that it is in a manner compelled to feed in this filthy manner from wanting that proper nourishment which it finds in the forest when in a state of wildness it is of all other quadrupedes the most delicate in the choice of what vegetables it shall feed on and rejects a greater number than any of the rest the cow for instance as we are assured by linnaeus eats two hundred and seventysix plants and rejects two hundred and eighteen the goat eats four hundred and fortynine and rejects an hundred and twentysix the sheep eats three hundred and eighty seven and rejects an hundred and fortyone the horse eats two hundred and sixtytwo and rejects two hundred and twelve but the hog more nice in its provision than any of the former eats but seventytwo plants and rejects an hundred and seventyone the indelicacy of this animal is therefore rather in our apprehensions than in its nature since we find it makes a very distinguishing choice in the quality of its food and if it does not reject animal putrefaction it may be because it is abridged in that food which is most wholesome and agreeable to it in a state of nature this is certain that its palate is not insensible to the difference of eatables for where it finds variety it will reject the worst with as distinguishing a taste as any other quadrupede whatsoever british zoology vol i p     in the orchards of peachtrees in north america where the hog has plenty of delicious food it is observed that it will reject the fruit that has lain but a few hours on the ground and continue on the watch whole hours together for a fresh windfall  however the hog is naturally formed in a more imperfect manner than the other animals that we have rendered domestic around us less active in its motions less furnished with instinct in knowing what to pursue or avoid without attachment and incapable of instruction it continues while it lives an useless or rather a rapacious dependant the coarseness of its hair and the thickness of its hide together with the thick coat of fat that lies immediately under the skin render it insensible to blows or rough usage mice have been known to burrow in the back of these animals while fattening in the sty buffon  without their seeming to perceive it their other senses seem to be in tolerable perfection they scent the hounds at a distance and as we have seen they are not insensible in the choice of their provisions  the hog is by nature stupid inactive and drowsy if undisturbed it would sleep half its time but it is frequently awaked by the calls of appetite which when it has satisfied it goes to rest again its whole life is thus a round of sleep and gluttony and if supplied with sufficient food it soon grows unfit even for its own existence its flesh becomes a greater load than its legs are able to support and it continues to feed lying down or kneeling an helpless instance of indulged sensuality the only time it seems to have passions of a more active nature are when it is incited by venery or when the wind blows with any vehemence upon this occasion it is so agitated as to run violently toward its sty screaming horribly at the same time which seems to argue that it is naturally fond of a warm climate it appears also to foresee the approach of bad weather bringing straw to its sty in its mouth preparing a bed and hiding itself from the impending storm nor is it less agitated when it hears any of its kind in distress when a hog is caught in a gate as is often the case or when it suffers any of the usual domestic operations of ringing or spaying all the rest are then seen to gather round it to lend their fruitless assistance and to sympathize with its sufferings they have often also been known to gather round a dog that had teazed them and kill him upon the spot  most of the diseases of this animal arise from intemperance measles imposthumes and scrophulous swellings are reckoned among the number it is thought by some that they wallow in the mire to destroy a sort of louse or insect that is often found to infest them however they are generally known to live when so permitted to eighteen or twenty years and the females produce till the age of fifteen as they produce from ten to twenty young at a litter and that twice a year we may easily compute how numerous they would shortly become if not diminished by human industry in the wild state they are less prolific and the sow of the woods brings forth but once a year probably because exhausted by rearing up her former numerous progeny  it would be superfluous to dwell longer upon the nature and qualities of an animal too well known to need a description there are few even in cities who are unacquainted with its uses its appetites and way of living the arts of fattening rearing guarding and managing hogs fall more properly under the cognizance of the farmer than the naturalist they make a branch of domestic economy which properly treated may be extended to a great length but the history of nature ought always to end where that of art begins it will be sufficient therefore to observe that the wild boar was formerly a native of our country as appears from the laws of hoeldda british zoology vol   p     the famous welsh legislator who permitted his grand huntsman to chase that animal from the the middle of november to the beginning of december william the conqueror also punished such as were convicted of killing the wild boar in his forests with the loss of their eyes at present the whole wild breed is extinct but no country makes greater use of the tame kinds as their flesh which bears salt better than that of any other animal makes a principal part of the provisions of the british navy  as this animal is a native of almost every country there are some varieties found in the species that which we call the east india breed is lower less furnished with hair is usually black and has the belly almost touching the ground it is now common in england to fatten more easily than the ordinary kinds and to make better bacon  there is a remarkable variety of this animal about upsal amaenit accad vol v p      which is single hoofed like the horse but in no other respect differing from the common kinds the authority of aristotle who first made mention of this kind has been often called in question some have asserted that such a quadrupede never existed because it happened not to fall within the sphere of their own confined observation however at present the animal is too well known to admit of any doubt concerning it the hog common in guinea differs also in some things from our own though shaped exactly as ours it is of a reddish color with long ears which end in a sharp point and a tail which hangs down to the pastern the whole body is covered with short red shining hair without any bristles but pretty long near the tail their flesh is said to be excellent and they are very tame  all these from their near resemblance to the hog may be considered as of the same species the eastindian hog we well know breeds with the common kind whether the same obtains between it and those of upsal and guinea we cannot directly affirm but where the external similitude is so strong we may be induced to believe that the appetites and habits are the same it is true we are told that the guinea breed will not mix with ours but keep separate and herd only together however this is no proof of their diversity since every animal will prefer its own likeness in its mate and they will only then mix with another sort when deprived of the society of their own these therefore we may consider as all of the hog kind but there are other quadrupedes that in general resemble this species which nevertheless are very distinct from them travelers indeed from their general form or from their habits and way of living have been content to call these creatures hogs also but upon a closer inspection their differences are found to be such as entirely to separate the kinds and make each a distinct animal by itself  the peccary or tajacu that animal which of all others most resembles an hog and yet is of a formation very distinct from it is called the peccary or tajacu it is a native of america and found there in such numbers that they are seen in herds of several hundreds together grazing among the woods and inoffensive except when offended  the peccary at first view resembles a small hog the form of its body the shape of its head the length of its snout and the form of its legs are entirely alike however when we come to examine it nearer the differences begin to appear the body is not so bulky its legs not so long its bristles much thicker and stronger than those of the hog resembling rather the quills of a porcupine than hair instead of a tail it has only got a little fleshy protuberance which does not even cover its posteriors but that which is still more extraordinary and in which it differs from all other quadrupedes whatsoever is that it has got upon its back a lump resembling the navel in other animals which is found to separate a liquor of a very strong smell the peccary is the only creature that has those kind of glands which discharge the musky substance on that part of its body some have them under the belly and others under the tail but this creature by a conformation peculiar to itself has them on its back this lump or navel is situated on that part of the back which is over the hinder legs it is in general so covered with long bristles that it cannot be seen except they be drawn aside a small space then appears that is almost bare and only beset with a few short fine hairs in the middle it rises like a lump and in this there is an orifice into which one may thrust a common goose quill this hole or bag is not above an inch in depth and round it under the skin are situated a number of small glands which distill a whitish liquor which in color and substance resembles that obtained from the civet animal perhaps it was this analogy that led dr tyson to say that it smelt agreeably also like that perfume but this mr buffon absolutely denies affirming that the smell is at every time and in every proportion strong and offensive and to this i can add my own testimony if that able naturalist should want a voucher  but to be more particular in the description of the other parts of this quadrupede the color of the body is grizly and beset with bristles thicker and stronger than those of a common hog though not near so thick as those of a porcupine they resemble in this respect that they are variegated with black and white rings the belly is almost bare and the short bristles on the sides gradually increase in length as they approach the ridge of the back where some are five inches long on the head also between the ears there is a large tuft of bristles that are chiefly black the ears are about two inches and an half long and stand upright and the eyes resemble those of a common hog only they are smaller from the lower corner of the eye to the snout is usually six inches and the snout itself is like that of an hogs though it is but small one side of the lower lip is generally smooth by the rubbing of the tusk of the upper jaw the feet and hoofs are perfectly like those of a common hog but as was already observed it has no tail there are some anatomical differences in its internal structure from that of the common hog dr tyson was led to suppose that it had three stomachs whereas the hog has but one however in this he was deceived as mr daubenton has plainly shown that the stomach is only divided by two closings which gives it the appearance as if divided into three and there is no conformation that prevents the food in any part of it from going or returning to any other  the peccary may be tamed like the hog and has pretty nearly the same habits and natural inclinations it feeds upon the same aliments its flesh though drier and leaner than that of the hog is pretty good eating it is improved by castration and when killed not only the parts of generation must be taken instantly away but also the navel on the back with all the glands that contribute to its supply if this operation be deferred for only half an hour the flesh becomes utterly unfit to be eaten  the peccary is extremely numerous in all the parts of southern america they go in herds of two or three hundred together and unite like hogs in each others defense they are particularly fierce when their young are attemped to be taken from them they surround the plunderer attack him without fear and frequently make his life pay the forfeit of his rashness when any of the natives are pursued by an herd in this manner they frequently climb a tree to avoid them while the peccaries gather round the root threaten with their tusks and their rough bristles standing erect as in the hog kind they assume a very terrible appearance in this manner they remain at the foot of the tree for hours together while the hunter is obliged to wait patiently and not without apprehensions until they think fit to retire  the peccary is rather fond of the mountainous parts of the country than the lowlands it seems to delight neither in the marshes nor the mud like our hogs it keeps among the woods where it subsists upon wild fruits roots and vegetables it is also an unceasing enemy to the lizard the toad and all the serpent kinds with which these uncultivated forests abound as soon as it perceives a serpent or a viper it at once seizes it with its fore hoofs and teeth skins it in an instant and devours the flesh this is often seen and may therefore be readily credited but as to its applying to a proper vegetable immediately after as an antidote to the poison of the animal it had devoured this part of the relation we may very well suspect the flesh neither of the toad or viper as every one now knows are poisonous and therefore there is no need of a remedy against their venom ray gives no credit to either part of the account however we can have no reason to disbelieve that it feeds upon toads and serpents it is only the making use of a vegetable antidote that appears improbable and which perhaps had its rise in the ignorance and credulity of the natives  the peccary like the hog is very prolific the young ones follow the dam and do not separate till they have come to perfection if taken at first they are very easily tamed and soon lose all their natural ferocity however they never show any remarkable signs of docility but continue stupid and rude without attachment or even seeming to know the hand that feeds them they only continue to do no mischief and they may be permitted to run tame without apprehending any dangerous consequences they seldom stray far from home they return of themselves to the sty and do not quarrel among each other except when they happen to be fed in common at such times they have an angry kind of growl much stronger andharsher than that of an hog but they are seldom heard to scream as the former only now and then when frighted or irritated they have an abrupt angry manner of blowing like the boar  the peccary though like the hog in so many various respects is nevertheless a very distinct race and will not mix nor produce an intermediate breed the european hog has been depiction of the peccary the peccary de seve del isc tailor sculp transplanted into america and suffered to run wild among the woods it is often seen to herd among a drove of peccaries but never to breed from them they may therefore be considered as two distinct creatures the hog is the larger and the more useful animal the peccary more feeble and local the hog subsists in most parts of the world and in almost every climate the peccary is a native of the warmer regions and cannot subsist in ours without shelter and assistance it is more than probable however that we could readily propagate the breed of this quadrupede and that in two or three generations it might be familiarized to our climate but as it is inferior to the hog in every respect so it would be needless to admit a new domestic whose services are better supplied in the old  the capibara or cabiai there are some quadrupedes so entirely different from any that we are acquainted with that it is hard to find a well known animal to which to resemble them in this case we must be content to place them near such as they most approach in form and habits so that the reader may at once have some idea of the creatures shape or disposition although perhaps an inadequate and a very confused one  upon that confused idea however it will be our business to work to bring it by degrees to greater precision to mark out the differences of form and thus give the clearest notions that words can easily convey the known animal is a kind of rude sketch of the figure we want to exhibit from which by degrees we fashion out the shape of the creature we desire should be known as a statuary seldom begins his work till the rude outline of the figure is given by some other hand  in this manner i have placed the capibara among the hog kind merely because it is more like an hog than any other animal commonly known and yet more closely examined it will be found to differ in some of the most obvious particulars  the capibara resembles an hog of about two years old in the shape of its body and the coarseness and color of its hair like the hog it has a thick short neck and a rounded bristly back like the hog it is fond of the water and marshy places brings forth many at a time and like it feeds upon animal and vegetable food but when examined more nearly the differences are many and obvious the head is longer the eyes are larger and the snout instead of being rounded as in the hog is split like that of a rabbit or hare and furnished with thick strong whiskers the mouth is not so wide the number and the form of the teeth are different for it is without tusks like the peccary it wants a tail and unlike to all others of this kind instead of a cloven hoof it is in a manner webfooted and thus entirely fitted for swimming and living in the water the hoofs before are divided into four parts and those behind into three between the divisions there is a prolongation of the skin so that the foot when spread in swimming can beat a greater surface of water  as its feet are thus made for the water so it is seen to delight entirely in that element and some naturalists have called it the waterhog for that reason it is a native of south america and is chiefly seen frequenting the borders of lakes and rivers like the otter it seizes the fish upon which it preys with its hoofs and teeth and carries them to the edge of the lake to devour them at its ease it lives also upon fruits corn and sugarcanes as its legs are long and broad it is often seen sitting up like a dog that is taught to beg its cry more nearly resembles the braying of an ass than the grunting of an hog it seldom goes our except at night and that always in company it never ventures far from the sides of the river or the lake in which it preys for as it runs ill because of the length of its feet and the shortness of its legs so its only place of safety is the water into which it immediately plunges when pursued and keeps so long at the bottom that the hunter can have no hopes of taking it there the capibara even in a state of wildness is of a gentle nature and when taken young is easily tamed it comes and goes at command and even shows an attachment to its keeper its flesh is said to be fat and tender but from the nature of its food it has a fishy taste like that of all those which are bred in the water its head however is said to be excellent and in this it resembles the beaver whose fore parts taste like flesh and the hinder like the fish it feeds on  the babyrouessa or indian hog the babyrouessa is still more remote from the hog kind than the capibara and yet most travelers who have described this animal do not scruple to call it the hog of bouro which is an island in the east indies where it is principally to be found probably the animals figure upon the whole most resembles that of depiction of the cabiai capybara the cabiai de seve del isc tailor sculp depiction of the babirouessa babirusa the babirouessa e martin sc  the hog kind and may have induced them to rank it among the number however when they come to its description they represent it as having neither the hair the bristles the head the stature nor the tail of an hog its legs we are told are longer its snout shorter its body more slender and somewhat resembling that of a stag its hair is finer of a gray color rather resembling wool than bristles and its tail also tufted with the same from these varieties therefore it can scarcely be called an hog and yet in this class we must be content to rank it until its form and nature come to be better known what we at present principally distinguish it by are four enormous tusks that grow out of each jaw the two largest from the upper and the two smallest from the under the jawbones of this extraordinary animal are found to be very thick and strong from whence these monstrous tusks are seen to proceed that distinguish it from all other quadrupedes whatsoever the two that go from the lower jaw are not above a foot long but those of the upper are above half a yard as in the boar they bend circularly and the two lower stand in the jaw as they are seen to do in that animal but the two upper rise from the upper jaw rather like horns than teeth and bending upwards and backwards sometimes have their points directed to the animals eyes and are often fatal by growing into them were it not that the babyrouessa has two such large teeth underneath we might easily suppose the two upper to be horns and in fact their sockets are directed upwards for which reason doctor grew was of that opinion but as the teeth of both jaws are of the same consistence and as they both grow out of sockets in the same manner the analogy between both is too strong not to suppose them of the same nature the upper teeth when they leave the socket immediately pierce the upper lips of the animal and grow as if they immediately went from its cheek the tusks in both jaws are of a very fine ivory smoother and whiter than that of the elephant but not so hard or serviceable  these enormous tusks give this animal a very formidable appearance and yet it is thought to be much less dangerous than the wild boar buffon vol xxv p      like animals of the hog kind they go together in a body are often seen in company with the wild boar with which however they are never known to engender they have a very strong scent which discovers them to the hounds and when pursued they growl dreadfully often turning back upon the dogs and wounding them with the tusks of the lower jaw for those of the upper are rather an obstruction than a defense they run much swifter than the boar and have a more exquisite scent winding the men and the dogs at a great distance when hunted closely they generally plunge themselves into the sea where they swim with great swiftness and facility diving and rising again at pleasure and in this manner they most frequently escape their pursuers although fierce and terrible when offended yet they are peaceable and harmless when unmolested they are easily tamed and their flesh is good to be eaten but it is said to putrefy in a very short time they have a way of reposing themselves different from most other animals of the larger kind which is by hitching one of their upper tusks on the branch of a tree and then suffering their whole body to swing down at ease thus suspended from a tooth they continue the whole night quite secure and out of the reach of such animals as hunt them for prey  the babyrouessa though by its teeth and tusks it seems fitted for a state of hostility and probably is carnivorous yet nevertheless seems chiefly to live upon vegetables and the leaves of trees it seldom seeks to break into gardens like the boar in order to pillage the more succulent productions of human industry but lives remote from mankind content with coarser fare and security it has been said that it was only to be found in the island of borneo but this is a mistake as it is well known in many other parts both of asia and africa as at the celebes at estrila senegal and madagascar andersons natural history of greenland   such are the animals of the hog kind which are not distinctly known and even all these as we see have been but imperfectly examined or described there are some others of which we have still more imperfect notices such as the warree an hog of the isthmus of darien described by wafer with large tusks and small ears and bristles like a coarse fur all over the body this however may be the european hog which has run wild in that part of the new world as no other traveller has taken notice of the same the canary boar seems different from other animals of this kind by the largeness of its tusks and as is judged from the skeleton by the apperture of its nostrils and the number of its grinders i cannot conclude this account of those animals that are thus furnished with enormous tusks without observing that there is a strong consent between these and the parts of generation when castrated it is well known that the tusks grow much smaller and are scarce seen to appear without the lips but what is still more remarkable is that in a boar if the tusks by any accident or design be broke away the animal abates of its fierceness and venery and it produces nearly the same effect upon its constitution as if castration had actually taken place lisles husbandry vol ii p       chap vii animals of the cat kind we have hitherto been describing a class of peaceful and harmless animals that serve as the instruments of mans happiness or at least that do not openly oppose him we come now to a bloody and unrelenting tribe that disdain to own his power and carry on unceasing hostilities against him all the class of the cat kind are chiefly distinguished by their sharp and formidable claws which they can hide and extend at pleasure they lead a solitary ravenous life neither uniting for their mutual defense like vegetable feeders nor for their mutual support like those of the dog kind the whole of this cruel and ferocious tribe seek their food alone and except at certain seasons are even enemies to each other the dog the wolf and the bear are sometimes known to live upon vegetable or farinaceous food but all of the cat kind such as the lion the tiger the leopard and the ounce devour nothing but flesh and starve upon any other provision  they are in general fierce rapacious subtle and cruel unfit for society among each other and incapable of adding to human happiness however it is probable that even the fiercest could be rendered domestic if man thought the conquest worth the trouble lions have been yoked to the chariots of conquerors and tigers have been taught to tend those herds which they are known at present to destroy but these services are not sufficient to recompense for the trouble of their keeping so that ceasing to be useful they continue to be noxious and become rebellious subjects because not taken under equal protection with the rest of the brute creation  other tribes of animals are classed with difficulty have often but few points of resemblance and though alike in form have different dispositions and different appetites but all those of the cat kind although differing in size or in color are yet nearly allied to each other being equally fierce rapacious and artful and he that has seen one has seen all in other creatures there are many changes wrought by human assiduity the dog the hog or the sheep are altered in their natures and forms just as the necessities or the caprice of mankind have found fitting but all of this kind are inflexible in their forms and wear the print of their natural wildness strong upon them the dogs or cows vary in different countries but lions or tigers are still found the same the very color is nearly alike in all and the slightest alterations are sufficient to make a difference in the kinds and to give the animal a different denomination  the cat kind are not less remarkable for the sharpness and strength of their claws which thrust forth from their sheath when they seize their prey than for the shortness of their snout the roundness of their head and the large whiskers which grow on the upper lip their teeth also which amount to the number of thirty are very formidable but are rather calculated for tearing their prey than for chewing it for this reason they feed but slowly and while they eat generally continue growling to deter others from taking a share in the dog kind the chief power lies in the under jaw which is long and furnished with muscles of amazing strength but in these the greatest force lies in the claws which are extended with great ease and their gripe is so tenacious that nothing can open it the hinder parts in all these animals are much weaker than those before and they seem less made for strength than agility nor are they endued with the swiftness of most other animals but generally owe their subsistence rather to catching their prey by surprise than by hunting it fairly down they all seize it with a bound at the same time expressing their fierce pleasure with a roar and their first grasp generally disables the captive from all further resistance with all these qualifications for slaughter they nevertheless seem timid and cowardly and seldom make an attack like those of the dog kind at a disadvantage on the contrary they fly when the force against them is superior or even equal to their own and the lion himself will not venture to make a second attempt where he has been once repulsed with success for this reason in countries that are tolerably inhabited the lion is so cowardly that he is often scared away by the cries of women and children  the cat which is the smallest animal of this kind is the only one that has been taken under human protection and may be considered as a faithless friend brought to oppose a still more insidious enemy this description is nearly translated from mr buffon what is added by me is marked with inverted commas  it is in fact the only animal of this tribe whose services can more than recompense the trouble of their education and whose strength is not sufficient to make its anger formidable the lion or the tiger may easily be tamed and rendered subservient to human command but even in their humblest and most familiar moments they are still dangerous since their strength is such that the smallest fit of anger or caprice may have dreadful consequences but the cat though easily offended and often capricious in her resentments is not endued with powers sufficient to do any great mischief of all animals when young there is none more prettily playful than the kitten but it seems to lose this disposition as it grows old and the innate treachery of its kind is then seen to prevail from being naturally ravenous education teaches it to disguise its appetites and to watch the favorable moment of plunder supple insinuating and artful it has learned the arts of concealing its intentions till it can put them into execution when the opportunity offers it at once seizes upon whatever it finds flies off with it and continues at a distance till it supposes its offense forgotten the cat has only the appearance of attachment and it may easily be perceived by its timid approaches and sidelong looks that it either dreads its master or distrusts his kindness different from the dog whose caresses are sincere the cat is assiduous rather for its own pleasure than to please and often gains confidence only to abuse it the form of its body and its temperament correspond with its disposition active cleanly delicate and voluptuous it loves its ease and seeks the softest cushions to lie on many of its habits however are rather the consequences of its formation than the result of any perverseness in its disposition it is timid and mistrustful because its body is weak and its skin tender a blow hurts it infinitely more than it does a dog whose hide is thick and body muscular the long fur in which the cat is clothed entirely disguises its shape which if seen naked is long feeble and slender it is not to be wondered therefore that it appears much more fearful of chastisement than the dog and often flies even when no correction is intended being also the native of the warmer climates as will be shown hereafter it chooses the softest bed to lie on which is always the warmest  the cat goes with young fiftysix days and seldom brings forth above five or six at a time the female usually hides the place of her retreat from the male who is often found to devour her kittens she feeds them for some weeks with her milk and whatever small animals she can take by surprise accustoming them betimes to rapine before they are a year old they are sit to engender the female seeks the male with cries nor is their copulation performed without great pain from the narrowness of the passage in the female they live to about the age of ten years and during that period they are extremely vivacious suffering to be worried a long time before they die  the young kittens are very playful and amusing but their sport soon turns into malice and they from the beginning show a disposition to cruelty they often look wistfully toward the cage sit sentinels at the mouth of a mousehole and in a short time become more expert hunters than if they had received the instructions of art indeed their disposition is so incapable of constraint that all instruction would be but thrown away it is true that we are told of the greek monks of the isle of cyprus teaching cats to hunt the serpents with which the island is infested but this may be natural to the animal itself and they might have fallen upon such a pursuit without any instruction whatever animal is much weaker than themselves is to them an indiscriminate object of destruction birds young rabbits hares rats and mice bats moles toads and frogs are all equally pursued though not perhaps equally acceptable the mouse seems to be their favorite game and although the cat has the sense of smelling in but a mean degree it nevertheless knows those holes in which its prey resides i have seen one of them patiently watch an whole day until the mouse appeared and continue quite motionless until it came within reach and then seized it with a jump of all the marks by which the cat discovers its natural malignity that of playing and sporting with its little captive before killing it outright is the most flagrant  the fixed inclination which they discover for this peculiar manner of pursuit arises from the conformation of their eyes the pupil in man and in most other animals is capable but of a small degree of contraction and dilatation it enlarges a little in the dark and contracts when the light pours in upon it in too great quantities in the eyes of cats however this contraction and dilatation of the pupil is so considerable that the pupil which by daylight appears narrow and small like the black of ones nail by night expands over the whole surface of the eyeball and as every one must have seen their eyes seem on fire by this peculiar conformation their eyes see better in darkness than light and the animal is thus better adapted for spying out and surprising its prey  although the cat is an inhabitant of our houses yet it cannot properly be called a dependant although perfectly tame yet it acknowledges no obedience on the contrary it does only just what it thinks fit and no art can control any of its inclinations in general it is but half tamed and has its attachments rather to the place in which it resides than to the inhabitant if the inhabitant quits the house the cat still remains and if carried elsewhere seems for a while bewildered with its new situation it must take time to become acquainted with the holes and retreats in which its prey resides with all the little labyrinths through which they often make good an escape  the cat is particularly fearful of water of cold and of ill smells it loves to keep in the sun to get near the fire and to rub itself against those who carry perfumes it is excessively fond of some plants such as valerian marum and catmint against these it rubs smells them at a distance and at last if they be planted in a garden wears them out  this animal eats slowly and with difficulty as its teeth are rather made for tearing than chewing its aliments for this reason it loves the most tender food particularly fish which it eats as well boiled as raw its sleeping is very light and it often seems to sleep the better to deceive its prey when the cat walks it treads very softly and without the least noise and as to the necessities of nature it is cleanly to the last degree its fur also is usually sleek and glossy and for this reason the hair is easily electrified sending forth shining sparks if rubbed in the dark  the wild cat breeds with the tame british zoology  and therefore the latter may be considered only as a variety of the former however they differ in some particulars the cat in its savage state is somewhat larger than the housecat and its fur being longer gives it a greater appearance than it really has its head is bigger and face flatter the teeth and claws much more formidable its muscles very strong as being formed for rapine the tail is of a moderate length but very thick and flat marked with alternate bars of black and white the end always black the hips and hind part of the lower joints of the leg are always black the fur is very soft and fine the general color of these animals in england is a yellowish white mixed with a deep gray these colors though they appear at first sight confusedly blended together yet on a close inspection will be found to be disposed like the streaks on the skin of the tiger pointing from the back downwards rising from a black list that runs from the head along the middle of the back to the tail this animal is found in our larger woods and is the most destructive of the carnivorous kinds in this kingdom it inhabits the most mountainous and woody parts of these islands living mostly in trees and feeding only by night it often happens that the females of the tame kind go into the woods to seek mates among the wild ones it should seem that these however are not original inhabitants of this kingdom but were introduced first in a domestic state and afterward became wild in the woods by ill usage or neglect certain it is the cat was an animal much higher in esteem among our ancestors than it is at present by the laws of howel the price of a kitten before it could see was to be a penny till it caught a mouse two pence and when it commenced mouser four pence it was required besides that it should be perfect in its senses of hearing and seeing be a good mouser have the claws whole and be a good nurse if it failed in any of these qualities the seller was to forfeit to the buyer the third part of its value if any one stole or killed the cat that guarded the princes granary he was to forfeit a milch ewe its fleece and lamb or as much wheat as when poured on the cat suspended by the tail the head touching the floor would form an heap high enough to cover the tip of the former from hence we discover besides a picture of the simplicity of the times a strong argument that cats were not naturally bred in our forests an animal that could be so easily taken could never have been rated so highly and the precautions laid down to improve the breed would have been superfluous in a creature that multiplies to such an amazing degree in our climate we know but of one variety of the wild cat and from the accounts of travelers we learn that there are but very few differences in this quadrupede in all parts of the world the greatest difference indeed between the wild and the tame cat is rather to be found internally than in their outward form of all other quadrupedes the wild cat is perhaps that whose intestines are proportionably the smallest and the shortest the intestines of the sheep for instance unravelled out and measured according to their length will be found to be above thirty times the length of its body whereas the wild cats intestines being measured out will not be found above three times the length of its body this is a surprising difference but we may account for it from the nature of the food in the two animals the one living upon vegetables which requires a longer and a more tedious preparation before they can become a part of its body the other living upon flesh which requires very little alteration in order to be assimilated into the substance of the creature that feeds upon it the one therefore wanted a long canal for the properly digesting and straining its food the other but a short one as the food is already prepared to pass the usual secretions however a difficulty still remains behind the intestines of the wild cat are by one third shorter than those of the tame how can we account for this if we say that the domestic cat living upon more nourishing and more plentiful provision has its intestines enlarged to the quantity with which it is supplied we shall find this observation contradicted in the wild boar and the wolf whose intestines are as long as those of the hog or the dog and yet they lead a savage life and like the wild cat are fed by precarious subsistence the shortness therefore of the wild cats intestines is still unaccounted for and most naturalists consider the difficulty as inextricable we must leave it therefore as one of those difficulties which future observation or accident are most likely to discover    this animal is one of those few which are common to the new continent as well as the old when christopher columbus first discovered that country an hunter brought him one which he had discovered in the woods which was of the ordinary size the tail very long and thick they were common also in peru although they were not rendered domestic they are well known also in several parts of africa and many parts of asia in some of these countries they are of a peculiar color and inclining to blue in persia pietro della valle informs us that there is a kind of cat particularly in the province of chorazan of the figure and form of the ordinary one but infinitely more beautiful in the luster and color of its skin it is of a gray blue without mixture and as soft and shining as silk the tail is very long and covered with hair six inches long which the animal throws upon its back like the squirrel these cats are well known in france and have been brought over into england under the name of the blue cat which however is not their color  another variety of this animal is called by us the lion cat or as others more properly term it the cat of angora these are larger than the common cat and even than the wild one their hair is much longer and hangs about their head and neck giving this creature the appearance of a lion some of these are white and others of a dun color these come from syria and persia two countries which are noted for giving a long soft hair to the animals which are bred in them the sheep the goats the dogs and the rabbits of syria are all remarkable for the fine glossy length and softness of their hair but particularly the cat whose nature seems to be so inflexible conforms to the nature of the climate and soil loses its savage color which it preserves almost in every other part of the world and assumes the most beautiful appearance there are some other varieties in this animal but rather in color than in form and in general it may be remarked that the cat when carried into other countries alters but very little still preserving its natural manners habits and conformation  the lion depiction of the lion the lion de seve del isc tailor sculp   the influence of climate upon mankind is very small this description is principally taken from mr buffon such parts as are added from others i have marked with commas  he is found to subsist in all parts of the earth as well under the frozen poles as beneath the torrid zone but in animals the climate may be considered as congenial and a kind of second nature they almost all have their particular latitudes beyond which they are unable to subsist either perishing with a moderate cold or dying for want of a frozen air even in a temperate climate the reindeer is never seen to depart from the icy fields of the north and on the contrary the lion degenerates when taken from beneath the line the whole earth is the native country of man but all inferior animals have each their own peculiar districts  most terrestrial animals are found larger fiercer and stronger in the warm than in the cold or temperate climates they are also more courageous and enterprizing all their dispositions seeming to partake of the ardour of their native soil the lion produced under the burning sun of africa is of all others the most terrible the most undaunted the wolf or the dog instead of attempting to rival him scarce deserve to attend his motions or become his providers such however of these animals as are bred in a more temperate climate or toward the tops of cold and lofty mountains are far more gentle or to speak more properly far less dangerous than those bred in the torrid valleys beneath the lions of mount atlas the tops of which are covered in eternal snows have neither the strength nor the ferocity of the lions of bildulgerid or zaara where the plains are covered with burning sands it is particularly in these frightful deserts that those enormous and terrible beasts are found that seem to be the scourge and the terror of the neighboring kingdoms happily indeed the species is not very numerous and it seems to be diminishing daily for those who have traveled through these countries assure us that there are by no means so many there at present as were known formerly and mr shaw observes that the romans carried fifty times as many lions from lybia in one year to combat in their amphitheatres as are to be found in the whole country at this time the same remark is made with regard to turkey to persia and the indies where the lions are found to diminish in their numbers every day nor is it difficult to assign the cause of this diminution it is obvious that it cannot be owing to the increase of the force of other quadrupedes since they are all inferior to the lion and consequently instead of lessening the number only tend to increase the supplies on which they subsist it must therefore be occasioned by the increase of mankind who is the only animal in nature capable of making head against these tyrants of the forest and preventing their increase the arms even of an hottentot or a negroe make them more than a match for this powerful creature and they seldom make the attack without coming off victorious their usual manner is to find out his retreat and with spears headed with iron to provoke him to the combat four men are considered as sufficient for this encounter and he against whom the lion flies receives him upon his spear while the others attack him behind the lion finding himself wounded in the rear turns that way and thus gives the man he first attacked an opportunity to recover in this manner they attack him on all sides until at last they entirely disable and then dispatch him this superiority in the numbers and the arts of man that are sufficient to conquer the lion serve also to enervate and discourage him for he is brave only in proportion to the success of his former encounters in the vast deserts of zaara in the burning sands that lie between mauritania and negroland in the uninhabited countries that lie to the north of cafraria and in general in all the deserts of africa where man has not fixed his habitation the lions are found in great numbers and preserve their natural courage and force accustomed to measure their strength with every animal they meet the habit of conquering renders them intrepid and terrible having never experienced the dangerous arts and combinations of man they have no apprehensions from his power they boldly face him and seem to brave the force of his arms wounds rather serve to provoke their rage than repress their ardour they are not daunted even with the opposition of numbers a single lion of the desert often attacks an entire caravan and after an obstinate combat when he finds himself overpowered instead of flying he continues to combat retreating and still facing the enemy till he dies on the contrary the lions which inhabit the peopled countries of morocco or india having become acquainted with human power and experienced mans superiority have lost all their courage so as to be scared away with a shout and seldom attack any but the unresisting flocks or herds which even women and children are sufficient to protect  this alteration in the lions disposition sufficiently shows that he might easily be tamed and admit of a certain degree of education in fact nothing is more common than for the keepers of wild beasts to play with this animal to pull out his tongue and even to chastise him without a cause he seems to bear it all with the utmost composure and we very rarely have instances of his revenging these unprovoked sallies of impertinent cruelty however when his anger is at last excited the consequences are terrible labat tells us of a gentleman who kept a lion in his chamber and employed a servant to attend it who as is usual mixed his blows with caresses this illjudged association continued for some time till one morning the gentleman was awakened by a noise in his room which at first he could not tell the cause of but drawing the curtains he perceived an horrid spectacle the lion growling over the mans head which he had separated from the body and tossing it round the floor he immediately therefore flew into the next room called to the people without and had the animal secured from doing further mischief however this single account is not sufficient to weigh against the many instances we every day see of this creatures gentleness and submission he is often bred up with other domestic animals and is seen to play innocently and familiarly among them and if it ever happens that his natural ferocity returns it is seldom exerted against his benefactors as his passions are strong and his appetites vehement one ought not to presume that the impressions of education will always prevail so that it would be dangerous in such circumstances to suffer him to remain too long without food or to persist in irritating and abusing him however numberless accounts assure us that his anger is noble his courage magnanimous and his disposition grateful he has been often seen to despise contemptible enemies and pardon their insults when it was in his power to punish them he has been seen to spare the lives of such as were thrown to be devoured by him to live peaceably with them to afford them a part of his subsistence and sometimes to want food himself rather than deprive them of that life which his generosity had spared  it may also be said that the lion is not cruel since he is so only from necessity and never kills more than he consumes when satiated he is perfectly gentle while the tiger the wolf and all the inferior kinds such as the fox the polecat and the ferret kill without remorse are fierce without cause and by their indiscriminate slaughter seem rather to satisfy their malignity than their hunger  the outward form of the lion seems to speak his internal generosity his figure is striking his look confident and bold his gait proud and his voice terrible his stature is not overgrown like that of the elephant or rhinoceros nor is his shape clumsy like that of the hippopotamos or the ox it is compact well proportioned and sizeable a perfect model of strength joined with agility it is muscular and bold neither charged with fat or unnecessary flesh it is sufficient but to see him in order to be assured of his superior force his large head surrounded with a dreadful mane all those muscles that appear under the skin swelling with the slightest exertions and the great breadth of his paws with the thickness of his limbs plainly evince that no other animal in the forest is capable of opposing him he has a very broad face that as some have imagined resembles the human it is surrounded with very long hair which gives it a very majestic air the top of the head the temples the cheeks the under jaw the neck the breast the shoulder the hinder part of the legs and the belly are furnished with it while all the rest of the body is covered with very short hair of a tawny color the length of the hair in many parts and the shortness of it in others serves a good deal to disguise this animals real figure the breast for instance appears very broad but in reality it is as narrow and contracted in proportion as that of the generality of dogs and horses for the same reason the tail seems to be of an equal thickness from one end to the other on account of the inequality of the hair with which it is encompassed it being shorter near the insertion where the flesh and bones are large and growing longer in proportion as its real thickness lessens toward the point where it ends in a tuft the hair about the neck and breast is not different from that on the rest of the body except in the length of it nor is each hair pointed as in most other animals but of an equal thickness from one end to the other the neck is very strong but not composed of one solid bone as aristotle has imagined on the contrary though very short and muscular it has as many bones as the camel or the horse for it is universal to all quadrupedes to have seven joints in the neck and not one of them have either more or less however the muscles in the neck of the lion that tie the bones together are extremely strong and have somewhat the appearance of bones so that ancient authors who have treated of this animal have mistaken the whole for a single bone the tongue is rough and beset with prickles as hard as a cats claws these have the grain turned backwards so that it is probable a lion if it should attempt to lick a mans hand as we are told it sometimes does would tear off the skin the eyes are always bright and fiery nor even in death does this terrible look forsake them in short the structure of the paws teeth eyes and tongue are the same as in a cat and also in the inward parts these two animals so nearly resemble each other that the anatomists chief distinction arises merely from the size  the lion has as was observed before a large mane which grows every year longer as the animal grows older the lioness is without this ornament at every age this mane is not coarse or rough as in an horse but composed of the same hair with the rest of the body lengthened and shining the mane as well as the rest of the body is of a yellow color nor is there ever any difference to be found in the color of one lion from that of another what the ancients might have said concerning black lions or white or streaked like the tiger is not confirmed by modern experience so that these varieties have never been seen or exist no longer  it is usually supposed that the lion is not possessed of the sense of smelling in such perfection as most other animals it is also observed that too strong a light greatly incommodes him this is more than probable from the formation of his eyes which like those of the cat seem fitted for seeing best in the dark for this reason he seldom appears in open day but ravages chiefly by night and not only the lion but all other animals of the cat kind are kept off by the fires which the inhabitants light to preserve their herds and flocks the brightness of the lame dazzles their eyes which are only fitted for seeing in the dark and they are afraid to venture blindly into those places which they know to be filled with their enemies it is equally true of all this kind that they hunt rather by the sight than the smell and it sometimes happens that the lion pursues either the jackall or the wild dog while they are hunting upon the scent and when they have run the beast down he comes in and monopolizes the spoil from hence probably may have arisen the story of the lions provider these little industrious animals may often it is true provide a feast for the lion but they have hunted merely for themselves and he is an unwelcome intruder upon the fruits of their toil  the lion when hungry boldly attacks all animals that come in his way but as he is very formidable and as they all seek to avoid him he is often obliged to hide in order to take them by surprise for this purpose he crouches on his belly in some thicket or among the long grass which is found in many parts of the forest in this retreat he continues with patient expectation until his prey comes within a proper distance and he then springs after it fifteen or twenty feet from him and often seizes it at the first bound if he misses the effort and in two or three reiterated springs cannot seize his prey he continues motionless for a time seems to be very sensible of his disappointment and waits for a more successful opportunity in the deserts and forests his most usual prey are the gazelles and the monkeys with which the torrid regions abound the latter he takes when they happen to be upon the ground for he cannot climb trees like the cat or the tiger he devours a great deal at a time and generally fills himself for two or three days to come his teeth are so strong that he very easily breaks the bones and swallows them with the rest of the body it is reported that he sustains hunger a very long time but thirst he cannot support in an equal degree his temperament being extremely hot some have even asserted that he is in a continual fever he drinks as often as he meets with water lapping it like a cat which as we know drinks but slowly he generally requires about fifteen pound of raw flesh in a day he prefers that of live animals and particularly those which he has just killed he seldom devours the bodies of animals when they begin to putrify and he chooses rather to hunt for a fresh spoil than to return to that which he had half devoured before however though he usually feeds upon fresh provision his breath is very offensive and his urine insupportable  the roaring of the lion is so loud that when it is heard in the night and reechoed by the mountains it resembles distant thunder this roar is his natural note for when enraged he has a different growl which is short broken and reiterated the roar is a deep hollow growl which he sends forth five or six times a day particularly before rains the cry of anger is much louder and more formidable this is always excited by opposition and upon those occasions when the lion summons up all his terrors for the combat nothing can be more terrible he then lashes his sides with his long tail which alone is strong enough to lay a man level he moves his mane in every direction it seems to rise and stand like bristles round his head the skin and muscles of his face are all in agitation his huge eyebrows half cover his glaring eye balls he discovers his teeth which are formed rather for destruction than chewing his food he shows his tongue covered with points and extends his claws which appear almost as long as a mans fingers prepared in this manner for war there are few animals that will venture to engage him and even the boldest of the human kind are daunted at his approach the elephant the rhinoceros the tiger and the hippopotamos are the only animals that are not afraid singly to make opposition  nevertheless neither the leopard nor the wild boar if provoked will shun the combat they do not seek the lion to attack but will not fly at his approach they wait his onset which he seldom makes unless compelled by hunger they then exert all their strength and are sometimes successful we are told of the combat of a lion and a wild boar in a meadow near algiers which continued for a long time with incredible obstinacy at last both were seen to fall by the wounds they had given each other and the ground all about them was covered with their blood these instances however are very rare for the lion is in general the undisputed master of the forest man is the only creature that attacks him with almost certain success with the assistance of dogs and horses which are trained to the pursuit these animals that in a state of nature would have fled from the presence of the lion in an agony of consternation when conscious of the assistance of man become pursuers in turn and boldly hunt their natural tyrant the dogs are always of the large breed and the horses themselves as gasner assures us must be of that sort called charossi or lion eyed all others of this kind flying at the sight of the lion and endeavoring to throw their riders when the lion is rouzed he recedes with a slow proud motion he never goes off directly forward nor measures his paces equally but takes an oblique course going from one side to the other and bounding rather than running when the hunters approach him they either shoot or throw their javelins and in this manner disable him before he is attacked by the dogs many of whom he would otherwise destroy he is very vivacious and is never killed at once but continues to fight desperately even after he has received his mortal blow he is also taken by pitfalls the natives digging a deep hole in the ground and covering it slightly over with sticks and earth which however give way beneath his weight and he sinks to the bottom from whence he has no means of escape but the most usual manner of taking this animal is while yet a cub and incapable of resistance the place near the den of the lioness is generally well known by the greatness of her depredations on that occasion the natives therefore watch the time of her absence and aided by a swift horse carry off her cubs which they sell to strangers or to the great men of their country  the lion while young and active lives by hunting in the forest at the greatest distance from any human habitation and seldom quits this retreat while able to subsist by his natural industry but when he becomes old and unfit for the purposes of surprise he boldly comes down into places more frequented attacks the flocks and herds that take shelter near the habitation of the shepherd or the husbandman and depends rather upon his courage than his address for support it is remarkable however that when he makes one of these desperate sallies if he finds men and quadrupedes in the same field he only attacks the latter and never meddles with men unless they provoke him to engage it is observed that he prefers the flesh of camels to any other food he is likewise said to be fond of that of young elephants these he often attacks before their trunk is yet grown and unless the old elephant comes to their assistance he makes them an easy prey  the lion is terrible upon all occasions but particularly at those seasons when he is incited by desire or when the female has brought forth it is then that the lioness is seen followed by eight or ten males who sight most bloody battles among each other till one of them becomes victorious over all the rest she is said to bring forth in spring and to produce but once a year with respect to the time of gestation naturalists have been divided some asserting that the lioness went with young six months and others but two the time also of their growth and their age have hitherto been left in obscurity some asserting that they acquired their full growth in three years and others that they required a longer period to come to perfection some saying and among this number is mr buffon that they lived to but twenty or twentytwo years at most others making their lives even of shorter duration all these doubts are now reduced to certainty for we have had several of these animals bred in the tower so that the manner of their copulation the time of their gestation the number they bring forth and the time they take to come to perfection are all pretty well known although the lion emits his urine backwards yet he couples in the ordinary manner and as was said before his internal structure in almost every respect resembles that of a cat the lioness however is upon these occasions particularly fierce and often wounds the lion in a terrible manner she goes with young as i am assured by her keeper no more than five months the young ones which are never more than two in number when brought forth are about the size of a large pug dog harmless pretty and playful they continue the teat for twelve months and the animal is more than five years in coming to perfection as to its age from its imprisoned state we can have no certainty since it is very probable that being deprived of its natural climate food and exercise its life must be very much abridged however naturalists have hitherto been greatly mistaken as to the length of its existence the great helion called pompey which died in the year    0 was known to have been in the tower for above seventy years and one lately died there which was brought from the river gambia that died above sixtythree the lion therefore is a very longlived animal and very probably in his native forests his age exceeds even that of man himself  in this animal all the passions even of the most gentle kind are in excess but particularly the attachment of the female to her young the lioness though naturally less strong less courageous and less mischievous than the lion becomes terrible when she has got young ones to provide for she then makes her incursions with even more intrepidity than the lion himself she throws herself indiscriminately among men and other animals destroys without distinction loads herself with the spoil and brings it home reaking to her cubs whom she accustoms betimes to cruelty and slaughter she usually brings forth in the most retired and inaccessible places and when she fears to have her retreat discovered often hides her tracks by running back her ground or by brushing them out with her tail she sometimes also when her apprehensions are great transports them from one place to another and if obstructed defends them with determined courage and fights to the last  the lion is chiefly an inhabitant of the torrid zone and as was said is always most formidable there nevertheless he can subsist in more temperate climates and there was a time when even the southern parts of europe were infested by him at present he is only found in africa and the east indies in some of which countries he grows to an enormous height the lion of bildulgedid is said to be nearly five feet high and between nine and ten feet from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail we have in the tower at present one of above four feet high that was brought from morocco which is the largest that for some time past has been seen in europe the ordinary size is between three and four feet the female being in all her dimensions about one third less than the male there are no lions in america the puma which has received the name of the america lion is when compared a very contemptible animal having neither the shape the size nor the mane of the lion being known to be extremely cowardly to climb trees for its prey to subsist rather by its cunning than its courage and to be inferior even to the animal that goes by the name of the american tiger we ought not therefore to confound this little treacherous creature with the lion which all the ancients have concurred in denominating the king of beasts and which they have described as brave and merciful indeed the numerous accounts which they have given us of this animals generosity and tenderness show that there must be some foundation for the general belief of its good qualities for mankind seldom err when they are all found to unite in the same story however perhaps the caution of aristrophanes the comic poet depiction of the lioness the lioness de seve del isc tailor sculp is better followed in practice who advises us to have nothing to do with this creature but to let the lioness suckle her own whelps tantem autem praestat pulchritudine tygris interalius faeras quantum inter volucres pavo   the tiger the ancients had a saying that as the peacock is the most beautiful among birds so is the tiger among quadrupedes   in fact no quadrupede can be more beautiful than this animal the glossy smoothness of his hair which lies much smoother and shines with greater brightness than even that of the leopard the extreme blackness of the streaks with which he is marked and the bright yellow color of the ground which they diversify at once strike the beholder to this beauty of coloring is added an extremely elegant form much larger indeed than that of the leopard but more slender more delicate and bespeaking the most extreme swiftness and agility unhappily however this animals disposition is as mischievous as its form is admirable as if providence was willing to show the small value of beauty by bestowing it on the most noxious of quadrupedes we have at present one of these animals in the tower which to the view appears the most good natured and harmless creature in the world its physiognomy is far from fierce or angry it has not the commanding stern countenance of the lion but a gentle placid air yet for all this it is fierce and savage beyond measure neither correction can terrify it nor indulgence can tame  the chief and most observable distinction in the tiger and in which it differs from all others of the mottled kind is in the shape of its colors which run in streaks or bands in the same direction as his ribs from the back down to the belly the leopard the panther and the ounce are all partly covered like this animal but with this difference that their colors are broken in spots all over the body whereas in the tiger they stretch lengthwise and there is scarce a round spot to be found on his skin besides this there are other observable distinctions the tiger is much larger and often found bigger even than the lion himself it is much slenderer also in proportion to its size its legs shorter and its neck and body longer in short of all other animals it most resembles the cat in shape and if we conceive the latter magnified to a very great degree we shall have a tolerable idea of the former  in classing carnivorous animals we may place the lion foremost the remainder of this description is taken from mr buffon except where marked with commas  and immediately after him follows the tiger which seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion without sharing any of his good ones to pride courage and strength the lion joins greatness clemency and generosity but the tiger is fierce without provocation and cruel without necessity the lion seldom ravages except when excited by hunger the tiger on the contrary though glutted with slaughter is not satisfied still continues the carnage and seems to have its courage only enflamed by not finding resistance in falling in among a flock or an herd it gives no quarter but levels all with indiscriminate cruelty and scarce finds time to appease its appetite while intent upon satisfying the malignity of its nature it thus becomes the scourge of the country where it is found it fears neither the threats nor the opposition of mankind the beasts both wild and tame fall equally a sacrifice to its insatiable fury the young elephant and the rhinoceros become equally its prey and it not unfrequently ventures to attack the lion himself  happily for the rest of nature that this animal is not common and that the species is chiefly confined to the warmest provinces of the east the tiger is found in malabar in siam in bengal and in all the same countries which are inhabited by the elephant or the rhinoceros some even pretend that it has a friendship for and often accompanies the latter in order to devour its excrements which serve it as a purge be this as it will there is no doubt but that they are often seen together at the sides of lakes and rivers where they are probably both compelled to go by the thirst which in that torrid climate they must very often endure it is likely enough also that they seldom make war upon each other the rhinoceros being a peaceable animal and the tiger knowing its strength too well to venture the engagement it is still more likely that the tiger finds this a very convenient situation since it can there surprise a greater number of animals which are compelled thither from the same motives in fact it is generally known to lurk near such places where it has an opportunity of choosing its prey or rather of multiplying its massacres when it has killed one it often goes to destroy others swallowing their blood at large draughts and seeming rather glutted than satiated with its abundance  however when it has killed a large animal such as an horse or a buffalo it immediately begins to devour it on the spot fearing to be disturbed in order to feast at its ease it carries off its prey to the forest dragging it along with such ease that the swiftness of its motion seems scarce retarded by the enormous load it sustains from this alone we may judge of its strength but to have a more just idea of this particular let us stop a moment to consider the dimensions of this most formidable creature some travelers have compared it for size to an horse and others to a buffalo while others have contented themselves with saying that it was much larger than a lion we have recent accounts of this animals magnitude that deserve the utmost confidence mr buffon has been assured by one of his friends that he saw a tiger in the east indies of fifteen feet long supposing that he means including the tail this animal allowing four feet for that must have been eleven feet from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail indeed that which is now in the tower is not so large being as well as i could measure six feet from the tip to the insertion and the tail was three feet more like all the rest of its kind its motions are irregular and defaltory it bounds rather than runs and like them rather chooses to take its prey by surprise than to be at the trouble of hunting it down how large a leap it can take at once we may easily judge by comparing what it might do to what we see so small an animal as the cat actually perform the cat can leap several feet at a bound and the tiger who is ten times as long can no doubt spring proportionably  the tiger is the only animal whose spirit seems untameable neither force nor constraint neither violence nor flattery can prevail in the least on its stubborn nature the caresses of the keeper have no influence on their heart of iron and time instead of mollifying its disposition only serves to increase its fierceness and malignity the tiger snaps at the hand that feeds it as well as that by which it is chastised every object seems considered only as its proper prey which it devours with a look and although confined by bars and chains still makes fruitless efforts as if to show its malignity when incapable of exerting its force  to give a still more complete idea of the strength of this terrible creature we shall quote a passage from father tachard who was an eyewitness of a combat between a tiger and two elephants at siam for this purpose the king ordered a lofty palisade to be built of bambou cane about an hundred feet square and in the midst of this were three elephants appointed for combating the tiger their heads and a part of their trunk was covered with a kind of armor like a mask which defended that part from the assaults of the fierce animal with which they were to engage as soon says this author as we were arrived at the place a tiger was brought forth from its den of a size much larger than we had ever seen before it was not at first let loose but held with chords so that one of the elephants approaching gave it three or four terrible blows with its trunk on the back with such force that the tiger was for some time stunned and lay without motion as if it had been dead however as soon as it was let loose and at full liberty although the first blows had greatly abated its fury it made at the elephant with a loud shriek and aimed at seizing his trunk but the elephant wrinkling it up with great dexterity received the tiger on his great teeth and tossed it up into the air this so discouraged the furious animal that it no more ventured to approach the elephant but made several circuits round the pallisade often attempting to fly at the spectators shortly after three elephants were sent against it and they continued to strike it so terribly with their trunks that it once more lay for dead and they would certainly have killed it had not there been a stop put to the combat  from this account we may readily judge of the strength of this animal which though reduced to captivity and held by chords though first disabled and set alone against three yet ventured to continue the engagement and even that against animals covered and protected from its fury  captain hamilton informs us that in the sundah rajhas dominions there are three forts of tigers in the woods and that the smallest are the fiercest this is not above two feet high appears to be extremely cunning and delights in human flesh the second kind is about three feet high and hunts deer and wild hogs besides the little animal which has been already described under the name of the chevrotain or guinea deer the tiger of the largest sort is above three feet and an half high but although endued with greater powers is by no means so rapacious as either of the former this formidable animal which is called the royal tiger one of which we have at present in the tower does not seem so ravenous nor so dangerous and is even more cowardly a peasant in that country as this traveller informs us had a buffalo fallen into a quagmire and while he went for assistance there came a large tiger that with its single strength drew forth the animal which the united force of many men could not effect when the people returned to the place the first object they beheld was the tiger who had thrown the buffalo over its shoulder as a fox does a goose and was carrying it away with the feet upward toward its den however as soon as it saw the men it let fall its prey and instantly fled to the woods but it had previously killed the buffalo and sucked its blood and no doubt the people were very well satisfied with its retreat it may be observed that some eastindian buffaloes weigh above a thousand pounds which is twice as heavy as the ordinary run of our black cattle so that from hence we may form a conception of the enormous strength of this rapacious animal that could thus run off with a weight at least twice as great as that of itself were this animal as common as the panther or even as the lion himself thus furnished as it is with the power to destroy and the appetite for slaughter the country would be uninhabitable where it resides but luckily the species is extremely scarce and has been so since the earliest accounts we have had of the tiger about the times of augustus we are assured by pliny plin hist not lib viii c     that when panthers were brought to rome by hundreds a single tiger was considered as an extraordinary sight and he tells us that the emperor claudius was able to procure four only which shows how difficultly they were procured the incredible fierceness of this animal may be in some measure the cause of the scarcity which was then at rome since it was the opinion of varo that the tiger was never taken alive tigris vivus capi ad huc non potuit var de ling lat  but its being a native only of the east indies and that particularly of the warmer regions it is not to be wondered that the species should be so few    we may therefore consider the species of true streaked tiger as one of the scarcest of animals and much less diffused than that of the lion as to the number of its young we have no certain accounts however it is said that it brings forth four or five at a time although furious at all times the female upon this occasion exceeds her usual rapacity and if her young are taken from her she pursues the spoiler with incredible rage he to save a part is contented to lose a part and drops one of her cubs with which she immediately returns to her den and again pursues him he then drops another and by the time she has returned with that he generally escapes with the remainder if she loses her young entirely she then becomes desperate boldly approaches even the towns themselves and commits incredible slaughter the tiger expresses its resentment in the same manner with the lion it moves the muscles and skin of its face shows its teeth and shrieks in the most frightful manner its note is very different from that of the lion being rather a scream than a roar and the ancients expressed it very well when they said that tigrides indomitae rancant rugiunt que leones  the skin of these animals is much esteemed all over the east particularly in china the mandarines cover their seats of justice in the public places with it and convert it into coverings for cushions in winter in europe these skins though but seldom to be met with are of no great value those of the panther and the leopard being held in much greater estimation this is all the little benefit we derive from this dreadful animal of which so many falsehoods have been reported as that its sweat was poisonous and the hair of its whiskers more dangerous than an envenomed arrow but the real mischiefs which the tiger occasions while living are sufficient without giving imaginary ones to the parts of its body when dead in fact the indians sometimes eat its flesh and find it neither disagreeable nor unwholesome  there is an animal of america which is usually called the red tiger but mr buffon calls it the cougar which no doubt is very different from the tiger of the east some however have thought proper to rank both together and i will take leave to follow their example merely because the cougar is more like a tiger in every thing except the color than any other animal i know having the head the body and the neck shaped very much in the same manner of these slight differences words would give but a very faint idea it will be therefore sufficient to observe that they are both equally slender and are smaller where the neck joins the head than others of the panther kind there is one at present in the tower and it seemed to me as well as i could see it through the bars that were it properly streaked and colored it would in all things resemble a small tiger it is however of a very different color being of a deep brown and the tail very long and pointed it is rather darker on the back under the chin it is a little whitish as also on the lower part of the belly  of all the american animals this is the most formidable and mischievous even their pretended lion not excepted it is said there are several sorts of them and as well as i can remember i have seen one or two here in england both differing from the present in size and conformation it is indeed a vain endeavor to attempt to describe all the less obvious varieties in the cat kind if we examine them minutely we shall find the differences multiply upon us so much that instead of an history we shall only be paid with a catalogue of distinctions from such of them as i have seen within these last six years i think i could add two animals of this species that have not been hitherto described and with the names of which he that showed them was utterly unacquainted but it is a poor ambition that of being eager to find out new distinctions or adding one noxious animal more to a list that is already sufficiently numerous were the knowing a new variety to open an unknown history or in the least to extend our knowledge the enquiry would be then worth pursuing but what signifies mentioning some trifling difference and from thence becoming authors of a new name when the difference might have originally proceeded either from climate soil or indiscriminate copulation  the cougars are extremely common in south america and where the towns border upon the forest these make frequent incursions by night into the midst of the streets carrying off fowls dogs and other domestic creatures they are however but weak and contemptible compared to the great tiger being found unable to cope with a single man the negroes and indians are very dextrous in encountering them and some even for the sake of their skins seek them in their retreats the arms in this combat seemingly so dangerous are only a lance of two or three yards long made of heavy wood with the point hardened in the fire and a kind of scymitar of about three quarters of a yard in length thus armed they wait till the tiger makes an assault against the left hand which holds the lance and is wrapped up in a short cloak of baize sometimes the animal aware of the danger seems to decline the combat but then its antagonist provokes it with a slight touch of the lance in order while he is defending himself to strike a sure blow as soon therefore as the creature feels the lance it grasps it with one of its paws and with the other strikes at the arm which holds it then it is that the person nimbly aims a blow with his scymetar which he kept concealed with the other hand and hamstrings the creature which immediately draws back enraged but instantly returns to the charge but then receiving another stroke it is totally deprived of the power of motion and the combatant killing it at his leisure strips the skin cuts off the head and returns to his companions displaying these as the trophies of his victory  this animal as we are assured is often more successful against the crocodile and it is the only quadrupede in that part of the world that is not afraid of the engagement it must be no unpleasant sight to observe from a place of safety this extraordinary combat between animals so terrible and obnoxious to man such as have seen it describe it in the following manner when the tiger impelled by thirst that seems continually to consume it comes down to the river side to drink the crocodile which makes no distinction in its prey lifts its head above water to seize it the tiger not less rapacious than the other and unacquainted with the force of the enemy boldly ventures to seize it and plunges its claws into the eyes of the crocodile which is the only vulnerable part of its body upon this the crocodile instantly dives under water and the tiger goes down with him for it will sooner die than let go its hold in this manner the combat continues for some time until the tiger is drowned or escapes as is sometimes the case from its disabled enemy  these animals are common in guiana buffon vol xix p     they were formerly seen swimming over in great numbers into the island of cayenne to attack and ravage the flocks and herds of the inhabitants in the beginning they were a terrible scourge to the infant colony but by degrees they were repulsed and destroyed and are now seen no longer at that place they are found in brazil in paraguay in the country of the amazons and in several other parts of south america they often climb trees in quest of prey or to avoid their pursuers they depiction of the tiger the tiger de seve del isc tailor sculp depiction of the cougar the cougar de seve del isc tailor sculp are deterred by fire like all other animals of the cat kind or more properly speaking they seldom venture near those places where they see it kindled as they are always sure of their enemies being near and their nocturnal eyes are dazzled by the brightness of the blaze from the description of this animal one would be hardly led to suppose that its flesh was good for food and yet we have several accounts which allege the fact some asserting it to be superior even to mutton however what monsieur des marchais observes is most likely to be true namely that the most valuable part of this animal is its skin and that its flesh is but indifferent eating being generally lean and usually having a strong fumet  the panther and the leopard we have hitherto found no great difficulty in distinguishing one animal from another each carrying its own peculiar marks which in some measure serve to separate it from all the rest but it is otherwise when we come to these of the cat kind that fill up the chasm between the tiger and the cat the spots with which their skins are diversified are so various and their size so equivocal that it is no easy matter to distinguish the species particularly as we have little else but the spots and the size to guide us in making the distinction if we regard the figure and diversity of the spots we shall find many varieties not taken notice of by any naturalist if we are led by the size we shall find an imperceptible gradation from the cat to the tiger it would be vain therefore to make as many varieties in these animals as we see differences in spots or stature it will be sufficient to seize the most general distinctions and leave the rest to such as are fond of more minute disquisitions  of all this tribe whose skins are so beautifully spotted and whose natures are so mischievous the panther may be considered as the foremost this animal has been by many naturalists mistaken for the tiger and in fact it approaches next to it in size fierceness and beauty it is distinguished however by one obvious and leading character that of being spotted not streaked for in this particular the tiger differs from the panther the leopard and almost all the inferior ranks of this mischievous family  this animal which mr buffon calls simply the panther linnaeus the pard gesner the pardalis and the modern latins the leopardus this animal i say which goes by too many names and which the english have indiscriminately called by the name of the panther or the leopard may be considered as the largest of the kind and is spotted in a manner somewhat different from those that are smaller as those spots however make the principal difference between it and the lesser animals which it otherwise resembles in shape size disposition and beauty i will first show those slight distinctions and mention the names each animal has received in consequence thereof and then proceed to give their history together still marking any peculiarity observable in one of the species which is not found in the rest  next to the great panther already mentioned is the animal which mr buffon calls the leopard a name which he acknowledges to be given arbitrarily for the sake of distinction other naturalists have not much attended to the slight differences between this and the great panther nor have they considered its discriminations as sufficient to entitle it to another name it has hitherto therefore gone under the name of the leopard or panther of senegal where it is chiefly found the differences between this animal and the former are these the large panther is often found to be six feet long from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail the panther of senegal is not above four the large panther is marked with spots in the manner of a rose that is five or six make a kind of circle and there is generally a large one in the middle the leopard of senegal has a much more beautiful coat the yellow is more brilliant and the spots are smaller and not disposed in rings but in clusters as to the rest they are both whiteish under the belly the tail in both is pretty long but rather longer in proportion in the latter than the former to these two animals whose differences seem to be so very minute we may add a third namely the jaguar or panther of america this in every respect resembles the two former except in the disposition of its spots and that its neck and head are rather streaked than spotted the jaguar is also said to be lower upon its legs and less than the leopard of senegal these three quadrupedes as we see have but very slight differences and the principal distinction used by mr buffon is taken from the size the first as he says is usually six feet long the second four feet and the last about three however it appears from the particular subjects of his description that the panther in his possession was not above three feet seven inches long that depiction of the panther leopard the male panther de seve del isc tailor sculp the leopards skin which he describes was about four and that the jaguar at two years old was between two and three feet long which when come to its full growth would no doubt be four feet long as well as the two former from hence therefore we may conclude that the size in these animals is not sufficient to make a distinction among them and that those who called them all three by the indiscriminate names of the leopard and the panther if not right were at least excuseable of those which are now to be seen in the tower the jaguar or the american panther is rather the largest of the three and is by no means the contemptible animal which mr buffon describes it to be the leopard is the least of them and has by some travelers been supposed to be an animal produced between the panther and the ounce an animal which resembles but is less than any of the former these three animals we may therefore rank together as they agree pretty nearly in their robe their size their dispositions and their ferocity  we come next to an animal confessedly different from any of the former being much smaller and its color more inclining to white its name however in our language has caused no small confusion it has been generally called by foreigners the onza or the ounce and this name some of our own writers have thought proper to give it but others of them and these the most celebrated such as willoughby have given this name to a different animal with a short tail and known to the ancients and moderns by the name of the lynx i confess myself at a loss in this case whom to follow the alteration of names should be always made with great caution and never but in cases of necessity if we follow willoughby there will be an animal of the panther kind very distinguishable from all the rest left without a name and if we recede from him it will serve to produce some confusion among all the numerous class of readers and writers who have taken him for their guide however as he seems himself to have been an innovator the name of the lynx having been long adopted into our language before it was unnecessary to give the animal that bore it another name and to call that creature an ounce which our old writers had been accustomed to know by the latin appellation for this reason therefore we may safely venture to take a name that has been long misapplied from the lynx and restore it to the animal in question we will therefore call that animal of the panther kind depiction of the lynx the lynx de seve del isc tailor sculp which is less than the panther and with a longer tail the ounce and the lynx may remain in possession of that name by which it was known among all our old english writers as well as by all antiquity  the ounce or the onca of linnaeus is much less than the panther being not at most above three feet and a half long however its hair is much longer than that of the panther and its tail still more so the panther of four or five feet long has a tail but of two feet or two feet and an half the ounce which is but about three feet has a tail often longer than the rest of its body the color of the ounce is also apparently different being rather more inclining to a cream color which is deeper on the back and whiter toward the belly the hair on the back is an inch and an half long that on the belly two inches and an half which is much longer than that of the panther its spots are disposed pretty much in the same manner as the large panther except that on the haunches it is rather marked with stripes than with spots  descending to animals of this kind that are still smaller we find the catamountain which is the ocelot of mr buffon or the tiger cat of most of those who exhibit it as a show it is less than the ounce but its robe more beautifully variegated it is an american animal and is about two feet and an half in length from the nose to the insertion of the tail it is extremely like a cat except that it is larger and slenderer that its colors are more beautiful and its tail rather shorter the fur is of a reddish color the whole beautified with black spots and streaks of different figures they are long on the back and round on the belly and paws on the ears are black stripes which run across but in other respects they entirely resemble those of a cat these colors however which naturalists have taken great pains minutely to describe are by no means permanent being differently disposed in different animals of the same species i remember to have seen an animal of this size but whether of this species i will not pretend to say some years ago that was entirely brown and was said also to have come from america  from this tribe of the cat kind with spotted skins and a long tail we come to another with skins diversified in like manner but with a shorter tail the principal of these is the lynx the name by which the animal was known to aelian among the ancients and to all our old english writers among those of a more modern date this name has been corrupted by the portuguese into the word ouze and this corruption has been adopted by ray who has improperly called this animal the ounce after some of the foreign travelers the first striking distinction between the lynx and all those of the panther kind is in its tail which is at least half as short in proportion and black at the extremity its fur is much longer the spots on the skin less vivid and but confusedly mingled with the rest its ears are much longer and tipped at the points with a black tuft of hair the color round the eyes is white and the physiognomy more placid and gentle each hair of this animal is of three different colors the root is of a greyish brown the middle red or of an ash color and the ends white this whiteness at the ends takes up so small a part of the particular hair that it does not prevent us from seeing the principal color which is that of the middle part so that it only makes the surface of the body appear as if it was silvered over however the hair of which the spots consist has no white at the ends and at the roots it is not quite so black as the other part this animal is not above the size of the ounce but is rather stronger built and it has but twentyeight teeth whereas all the rest of the cat kind already mentioned have thirty  another animal of this kind is called the siagush or as mr buffon names it the caracal it is a native of the east indies and resembles the lynx in size in form and even in the singularity of being tufted at the tips of the ears however the siagush differs in not being mottled as the lynx is its fur or rather hair is rougher and shorter its tail is rather longer its muzzle more lengthened its physiognomy more fierce and its nature more savage  the third and last animal that need be mentioned of this kind is that which mr buffon calls the serval and which he has first described it is a native of malabar resembling the panther in its spots but the lynx in the shortness of its tail in its size and in its strong built form  these seem to be all the principal distinctions among animals of the panther kind from the largest of this tribe down to the domestic cat which is the smallest of all these fierce and mischievous varieties in all their nature seems pretty much the same being equally fierce subtle cruel and cowardly the panther including the leopard and the jaguar or american panther as they are the largest so depiction of the syagush caracal the syagush de seve del isc tailor sculp also are they the most dangerous of this kind for the whole race of cats are noxious in proportion to their power to do mischief they inhabit the most torrid latitudes of india africa and america and have never been able to multiply beyond the torrid zone they are generally found in the thickest and the most entangled forests and often near remote habitations where they watch to surprise all kinds of domestic animals they very seldom attack man even though provoked by him they seem rather desirous of finding safety by flight or by climbing trees at which they are very expert in this manner also they often pursue their prey and being expert at seizing it as well above as below they cause a vast destruction of all other animals these are the most sullen and even to a proverb untameable they still preserve their fierce and treacherous spirit and at those places where they are exposed to be seen among others we often observe that while their keeper is familiar with the lion or the bear yet he is apprehensive of the large panther and keeps it bound with the shortest chain  as the ounce differs from these in figure and size so also it seems to differ in disposition being more mild tractable and tame these we frequently see as harmless and innocent as cats and there is one at present in the tower with which the keeper plays without the smallest apprehension i own i was not a little uneasy at first for the man when he put his hand through the bars and called the animal by its name but was a good deal surprised to see the creature which one might suppose irritated by long confinement come gently up to him stroke his hand with its face in the manner of a cat and testify the utmost gentleness of disposition the ounce therefore is remarkable for being easily tamed and in fact it is employed all over the east for the purposes of hunting not indeed but that panthers themselves are sometimes used for this purpose but they are never thoroughly subdued like the former being usually brought to the field in a carriage and kept chained and caged until they are shown the gazelle or the leveret which is their prey this they pursue rather by three or four great springs than by running if they seize it by this sudden effort it finds no mercy but if it escapes from their first effort they never attempt to pursue and appear quite disappointed and confounded at their mischance it sometimes happens that they are so much enraged at it that they attack even their employer and his only resource to avoid their fury is to throw them some small pieces of meat which he has brought with him for that purpose  the ounce however is not so dangerous and is treated with more confidence and familiarity it is usually brought to the field hoodwinked behind one of the horsemen when the game appears the ounce is instantly uncovered and shown where it lies upon which the fierce creature darts like an arrow to the place and seizes it at once or missing it remains motionless in the place it would be vain to attempt retrieving its disgrace by continuing the pursuit for although it bounds with greater agility than most other animals yet it is slow and awkward in running and has no means of finding the animal it pursues by the smell as is common among those of the dog kind from hence therefore it appears how much superior the european method of hunting is to that of the asiatic since whatever amusement this exercise affords must arise from the continuance of the chase and from the fluctuation of doubt and expectation which raise and depress the pursuers by turns all this an asiatic hunter is deprived of and his greatest pleasure can scarcely be more than what among us is called coursing in which the dog pursues the animal and keeps it constantly in view  but it must not be supposed that it is from choice the asiatics use this method of chase for no doubt were dogs serviceable among them as they are in europe they would be employed for the same purposes but the fact is that the extreme heat of the tropical climates produces such universal putrefaction and sends up such various and powerful scents that dogs are at first bewildered in the chase and at last come to lose the delicacy of their scent entirely they are therefore but little used in those warm countries and what could they avail in places where almost every other animal of the forest is stronger and more rapacious the lion the tiger the panther and the ounce are all natural enemies to the dog and attack him wherever he appears with ungovernable fury the breed therefore in those places would quickly be destroyed so that they are obliged to have recourse to those animals which are more fitted to serve them and thus convert the ounce to those purposes for which dogs are employed in europe  the catamountain or ocelot is one of the fiercest and for its size one of the most destructive animals in the world it is as was before observed a native of southamerica and by no means capable of the same education as the ounce which it more approaches in size than in disposition two of these from whom mr buffon has taken his description were brought over from carthagena and having been taken from the dam when very young were afterward suckled by a bitch but before they were three months old they had strength and ingratitude sufficient to kill and devour their nurse their succeeding fierceness and malignity seemed to correspond with their first efforts for no arts could tame or soften their natures and while they continued in their cages they still testified an unceasing disposition for slaughter when their food was given them the male always served himself before the female ventured to touch a bit and it was not till he was satisfied that the other began in their savage state these animals are still more destructive having great strength and agility they very easily find and overtake their prey which they pursue among the tops of the trees as well as on the ground but what renders them still more mischievous is their unceasing appetite rather for the blood than the flesh of their prey they suck this with the greatest avidity but frequently leave the carcass otherwise untouched in order to pursue other animals for the blood in like manner they generally continue on the tops of trees like our wild cats where they make their nest and often bring forth their young when they spy any animal they can master and there are but few in the forest but what are inferior they dart down upon it with inevitable exactness  the whole tribe of animals of the panther kind with long tails are chiefly inhabitants as was said of the torrid zone but those of the short tailed kind and particularly the lynx is principally found in the cold countries that are bordering on the pole the lynx is chiefly to be met with in the north of germany lithuania muscovy siberia and north america those of the new continent however are rather smaller than in europe as is the case with almost all their quadrupedes they are somewhat whiter also but in other respects there is scarce any difference to be found among them buffon  this animal has been called by some lupus cervarius or a creature compounded between a wolf and a stag but for what reason is hard to guess it no way resembles either in shape or in disposition in its nature it exactly resembles the cat except that being bigger and nearly two feet long it is bolder and fiercer like the cat it climbs trees and seeks its prey by surprise like the cat it is delicate and cleanly covering its urine with its paws and it resembles the wolf in nothing except its cry which often deceives the hunters and induces them to think they hear a wolf and not a lynx this animal also is rather more delicate than the cat and after having once feasted upon its prey will never return to it again but hunts the woods for another from hence may have arisen the common report of the lynx having of all other quadrupedes the shortest memory this however is not the only idle story that has been propagated of it as of its seeing with such perspicuity as to perceive objects through walls and mountains as of having its urine of such a quality as to harden and become a precious stone with several others propagated by ignorance or imposture  the siagush and the serval are both so like all the rest of the cat kind in disposition that it is but repeating the same account once more to give their distinct history as the lynx is found only in cold countries so the siagush is to be met with only in the warm tropical climates it is used in the same manner as the ounce for hunting but it seems to have a property which the other has not namely that of being able to overtake its prey by pursuing it whether this is performed by having a finer scent than the former or greater swiftness we are not informed being only told that when it overtakes either the gazelle or the antelope it leaps upon their backs and getting forward to their shoulders scratches their eyes out by which means they become an easy prey to the hunters some have called this animal the lions provider and it is said that when it calls him to pursue his prey its voice very much resembles that of one man calling another thevenot vol ii p      from hence we may conjecture that this animal pursues its prey in full cry and that the lion only follows to partake or seize the spoil the same account is given also of the jackal and very probably it may be true not only of these animals but of some others since it is natural enough to suppose that the lion will pursue whenever he is taught to discover his prey  we had one of these animals a few years ago sent over from the east indies but it was not able to endure the change of climate and it died in a very short time after it was brought to the tower whether consumed by disease or not i cannot tell but it seemed to me much slenderer than the cat or the lynx and its ears were much longer however it is a very strong creature for its size and has been known to kill a large dog in single combat buffon  nevertheless it is like all of the cat kind except the lion remarkable for its cowardice and will never except in cases of necessity attack an animal that is its equal in strength or activity for this reason when brought into the field and put upon a service of danger it obstinately refuses and is alert only in the pursuit of animals that are too feeble for resistance or too timid to exert their strength  from what has been said of this rapacious tribe we perceive a similitude in the manners and dispositions of them all from the lion to the cat the similitude of their internal conformation is still more exact the shortness of their intestines the number of their teeth and the structure of their paws the first of this class is the lion distinguishable from all the rest by his strength his magnitude and his mane the second is the tiger rather longer than the lion but not so tall and known by the streaks and the vivid beauty of its robe including also the american tiger or cougar distinguishable by its size next that of the tiger its tawny color and its spots the third is the panther and the leopard the four this the ounce not so large as any of the former spotted like them but distinguishable by the cream colored ground of its hair and the great length of its tail being above the length of its body the fifth is the catamountain or tiger cat less than the ounce but differing particularly in having a shorter tail and being streaked down the back like a tiger the sixth is the short tailed kind namely the lynx of the size of the former but with a short tail streaked and the tips of its ears tufted with black the seventh is the syagush differing from the lynx in not being mottled like it in not being so large and in having the ears longer though tipped with black as before the eighth is the serval resembling the lynx in its form and the shortness of its tail streaked also like it but not having the tips of its ears tufted lastly the cat wild and tame with all its varieties all less than any of the former but like them equally insidious rapacious and cruel  this whole race may be considered as the most formidable enemy of mankind there are others indeed stronger but they are gentle and never offer injury till injured there are others more numerous but they are more feeble and rather look for safety by hiding from man than opposing him these are the only quadrupedes that make good their ground against him and which may be said to keep some kingdoms of the earth in their own possession how many extensive countries are there in africa where the wild beasts are so numerous that man is deterred from living amongst them reluctantly giving up to the lion and the leopard extensive tracts that seem formed only for his delight and convenience  chap viii animals of the dog kind the second class of carnivorous quadrupedes may be denominated those of the dog kind this class is neither so numerous nor so powerful as the former and yet neither so treacherous rapacious or cowardly this class may be principally distinguished by their claws which have no sheath like those of the cat kind but still continue at the point of each toe without a capability of being stretched forward or drawn back the nose also as well as the jaw of all the dog kind is longer than in the cat the body is in proportion more strongly made and covered with hair instead of fur there are many internal distinctions also as in the intestines which are much longer in the dog kind than in those of the cat the eye is not formed for night vision and the olfactory nerves are diffused in the dog kinds upon a very exrensive membrane within the scull  if we compare the natural habitudes of this class with the former we shall find that the dog kinds are not so solitary as those of the cat but love to hunt in company and encourage each other with their mutual cries in this manner the dog and the jackall pursue their prey and the wolf and fox which are of this kind though more solitary and silent among us yet in countries where less persecuted and where they can more fearless display their natural inclinations they are found to keep together in packs and pursue their game with alternate howlings  animals of the dog kind want some of the advantages of the cat kind and yet are possessed of others in which the latter are deficient upon observing their claws it will easily be perceived that they cannot like cats pursue their prey up the sides of a tree and continue the chase among the branches their unmanageable claws cannot stick in the bark and thus support the body up along the trunk as we see the cat very easily perform whenever therefore their prey flies up the tree from them they can only follow it with their eyes or watch its motions till hunger again brings it to the ground for this reason the proper prey of the dog kind are only those animals that like themselves are unfitted for climbing the hare the rabbit the gazelle or the roebuck  as they are in this respect inferior to the cat so they exceed it in the sense of smelling by which alone they pursue their prey with certainty of success wind it through all its mazes and tire it down by perseverance it often happens however in the savage state that their prey is either too much diminished or too wary to serve for a sufficient supply in this case when driven to an extremity all the dog kinds can live for some time upon fruits and vegetables which if they do not please the appetite at least serve to appease their hunger  of all this tribe the dog has every reason to claim the preference being the most intelligent of all known quadrupedes and the acknowledged friend of mankind the dog the rest of this description of the dog is taken from mr buffon what i have added is marked as before  independent of the beauty of his form his vivacity force and swiftness is possessed of all those internal qualifications that can conciliate the affections of man and make the tyrant a protector a natural share of courage an angry and ferocious disposition renders the dog in its savage state a formidable enemy to all other animals but these readily give way to very different qualities in the domestic dog whose only ambition seems the desire to please he is seen to come crouching along to lay his force his courage and all his useful talents at the feet of his master he waits his orders to which he pays implicit obedience he consults his looks and a single glance is sufficient to put him in motion he is more faithful even than the most boasted among men he is constant in his affections friendly without interest and grateful for the slightest favors much more mindful of benefits received than injuries offered he is not driven off by unkindness he still continues humble submissive and imploring his only hope to be serviceable his only terror to displease he licks the hand that has been just lifted to strike him and at last disarms resentment by submissive perseverance  more docile than man more obedient than any other animal he is not only instructed in a short time but he also conforms to the dispositions and the manners of those who command him he takes his tone from the house he inhabits like the rest of the domestics he is disdainful among the great and churlish among clowns always assiduous in serving his master and only a friend to his friends he is indifferent to all the rest and declares himself openly against such as seem to be dependant like himself he knows a beggar by his clothes by his voice or his gestures and forbids his approach when at night the guard of the house is committed to his care he seems proud of the charge he continues a watchful sentinel he goes his rounds scents strangers at a distance and gives them warning of his being upon duty if they attempt to break in upon his territories he becomes more fierce flies at them threatens fights and either conquers alone or alarms those who have most interest in coming to his assistance however when he has conquered he quietly reposes upon the spoil and abstains from what he has deterred others from abusing giving thus at once a lesson of courage temperance and fidelity  from hence we see of what importance this animal is to us in a state of nature supposing for a moment that the species had not existed how could man without the assistance of the dog have been able to conquer tame and reduce to servitude every other animal how could he discover chase and destroy those that were noxious to him in order to be secure and to become master of all animated nature it was necessary for him to begin by making a friend of a part of them to attach such of them to himself by kindness and caresses as seemed fittest for obedience and active pursuit thus the first art employed by man was in conciliating the favor of the dog and the fruits of this art were the conquest and peaceable possession of the earth  the generality of animals have greater agility greater swiftness and more formidable arms from nature than man their senses and particularly that of smelling are far more perfect they having gained therefore a new assistant particularly one whose scent is so exquisite as that of the dog was the gaining a new sense a new faculty which before was wanting the machines and instruments which we have imagined for perfecting the rest of the senses do not approach to that already prepared by nature by which we are enabled to find out every animal though unseen and thus destroy the noxious and use the serviceable  the dog thus useful in himself taken into a participation of empire exerts a degree of superiority over all animals that require human protection the flock and the herd obey his voice more readily even than that of the shepherd or the herdsman he conducts them guards them keeps them from capriciously seeking danger and their enemies he considers as his own nor is he less useful in the pursuit when the sound of the horn or the voice of the huntsman calls him to the field he testifies his pleasure by every little art and pursues with perseverance those animals which when taken he must not expect to divide the desire of hunting is indeed natural to him as well as to his master since war and the chase are the only employment of savages all animals that live upon flesh hunt by nature the lion and the tiger whose force is so great that they are sure to conquer hunt alone and without art the wolf the fox and the wild dog hunt in packs assist each other and partake the spoil but when education has perfected this talent in the domestic dog when he has been taught by man to repress his ardour to measure his motions and not to exhaust his force by too sudden an exertion of it he then hunts with method and always with success  although the wild dog such as he was before he came under the protection of mankind is at present utterly unknown no such animal being now to be found in any part of the world yet there are many that from a domestic state have turned savage and entirely pursue the dictates of nature in those deserted and uncultivated countries where the dog is found wild they seem entirely to partake of the disposition of the wolf they unite in large bodies and attack the most formidable animals of the forest the cougar the panther and the bison in america where they were originally brought by the europeans and abandoned by their masters they have multiplied to such a degree that they spread in packs over the whole country attack all other animals and even man himself does not pass without insult they are there treated in the same manner as all other carnivorous animals and killed wherever they happen to come however they are easily tamed when taken home and treated with kindness and lenity they quickly become submissive and familiar and continue faithfully attached to their masters different in this from the wolf or the fox who though taken never so young are gentle only while cubs and as they grow older give themselves up to their natural appetites of rapine and cruelty in short it may be asserted that the dog is the only animal whose fidelity is unshaken the only one who knows his master and the friends of the family the only one who instantly distinguishes a stranger the only one who knows his name and answers to the domestic call the only one who seems to understand the nature of subordination and seeks assistance the only one who when he misses his master testifies his loss by his complaints the only one who carried to a distant place can find the way home the only one whose natural talents are evident and whose education is always successful  in the same manner as the dog is of the most complying disposition so also is it the most susceptible of change in its form the varieties of this animal being too many for even the most careful describer to mention the climate the food and the education all make strong impressions upon the animal and produce alterations in its shape its color its hair its size and in every thing but its nature the same dog taken from one climate and brought to another seems to become another animal but different breeds are as much separated to all appearance as any two animals the most distinct in nature nothing appears to continue constant with them but their internal conformation different in the figure of the body in the length of the nose in the shape of the head in the length and the direction of the ears and tail in the color the quality and the quantity of the hair in short different in every thing but that make of the parts which serve to continue the species and keep the animal distinct from all others it is this peculiar conformation this power of producing an animal that can reproduce that marks the kind and approximates forms that at first sight seem never made for conjunction  from this single consideration therefore we may at once pronounce all dogs to be of one kind but which of them is the original of all the rest which of them is the savage dog from whence such a variety of descendants have come down is no easy matter to determine we may easily indeed observe that all those animals which are under the influence of man are subject to great variations such as have been sufficiently independent so as to choose their own climate their own nourishment and to pursue their own habitudes preserve the original marks of nature without much deviation and it is probable that the first of these is even at this day very well represented in their descendants but such as man has subdued transported from one climate to another controlled in their manner of living and their food have most probably been changed also in their forms particularly the dog has felt these alterations more strongly than any other of the domestic kinds for living more like man he may be thus said to live more irregularly also and consequently must have felt all those changes that such variety would naturally produce some other causes also may be assigned for this variety in the species of the dog as he is perpetually under the eye of his master when accident has produced any singularity in its productions man uses all his art to continue this peculiarity unchanged either by breeding from such as had those singularities or by destroying such as happened to want them besides as the dog produces much more frequently than some other animals and lives a shorter time so the chance for its varieties will be offered in greater proportion  but which is the original animal and which the artificial or accidental variety is a question which as was said is not easily resolved if the internal structure of dogs of different sorts be compared with each other it will be found except in point of size that in this respect they are exactly the same this therefore affords no criterion if other animals be compared with the dog internally the wolf and the fox will be found to have the most perfect resemblance it is probable therefore that the dog which most nearly resembles the wolf or the fox externally is the original animal of its kind for it is natural to suppose that as the dog most nearly resembles them internally so he may be near them in external resemblance also except where art or accident has altered his form this being supposed if we look among the number of varieties to be found in the dog we shall not find one so like the wolf or the fox as that which is called the shepherds dog this is that dog with long coarse hair on all parts except the nose pricked ears and a long nose which is common enough among us and receives his name from being principally used in guarding and attending on sheep this seems to be the primitive animal of his kind and we shall be the more confirmed in this opinion if we attend to the different characters which climate produces in this animal and the different races of dogs which are propagated in every country and in the first place if we examine those countries which are still savage or but half civilized where it is most probable the dog like his master has received but few impressions from art we shall find the shepherds dog or one very like him still prevailing amongst them the dogs that have run wild in america and in congo approach this form the dog of siberia lapland and iceland of the cape of good hope of madagascar madura calicut and malabar have all a long nose pricked ears and resemble the shepherds dog very nearly in guinea the dog very speedily takes this form for at the second or third generation the animal forgets to bark his ears and his tail become pointed and his hair drops off while a coarser thinner kind comes in the place this sort of dog is also to be found in the temperate climates in great abundance particularly among those who prefering usefulness to beauty employ an animal that requires very little instruction to be serviceable notwithstanding this creatures deformity his melancholy and savage air he is superior to all the rest of his kind in instinct and without any teaching naturally takes to tending flocks with an assiduity and vigilance that at once astonishes and yet relieves his master  in more polished and civilized places the dog seems to partake of the universal refinement and like the men becomes more beautiful more majestic and more capable of assuming an education foreign to his nature the dogs of albany of greece of denmark and of ireland are larger and stronger than those of any other kind in france germany spain and italy the dogs are of various kinds like the men and this variety seems formed by crossing the breed of such as are imported from various climates  the shepherds dog may therefore be considered as the primitive stock from whence these varieties are all derived he makes the stem of that genealogical tree which has been branched out into every part of the world this animal still continues pretty nearly in its original state among the poor in temperate climates being transported into the colder regions he grows less and more ugly among the laplanders but becomes more perfect in iceland russia and siberia where the climate is less rigorous and the people more civilized whatever differences there may be among the dogs of these countries they are not very considerable as they all have strait ears long and thick hair a savage aspect and do not bark either so often or so loud as dogs of the more cultivated kind  the shepherds dog transported into the temperate climates and among people entirely civilized such as england france and germany will be divested of his savage air his pricked ears his rough long and thick hair and from the single influence of climate and food alone will become either a matin a mastiff or an hound these three seem the immediate descendants of the former and from them the other varieties are produced  the hound the harrier and the beagle seem all of the same kind for although the bitch is covered but by one of them yet in her litters are found puppies resembling all the three this animal transported into spain or barbary where the hair of all quadrupedes becomes soft and long will be there converted into the landspaniel and the waterspaniel and these of different sizes  the gray matin hound which is the second branch transported to the north becomes the great danish dog and this sent into the south becomes the greyhound of different sizes the same transported into ireland the ukraine tartary epirus and albania becomes the great wolf dog known by the name of the irish wolf dog  the mastiff which is the third branch and chiefly a native of england when transported into denmark becomes the little danish dog and this little danish dog sent into the tropical and warm climates becomes the animal called the turkish dog without hair all these races with their varieties are produced by the influence of climate joined to the different food education and shelter which they have received among mankind all other kinds may be considered as mongrel races produced by the concurrence of these and found rather by crossing the breed than by attending to the individual as these are extremely numerous and very different in different countries it would be almost endless to mention the whole besides nothing but experience can ascertain the reality of these conjectures already made although they have so much the appearance of probability and until that gives more certain information we must be excused from entering more minutely into the subject with regard to the dogs of our country in particular the varieties are very great and the number every day increasing and this must happen in a country so open by commerce to all others and where wealth is apt to produce capricious predilection here the ugliest and the most useless of their kinds will be entertained merely for their singularity and being imported only to be looked at they will lose even that small degree of sagacity which they possessed in their natural climates from this importation of foreign useless dogs our own native breed is i am informed greatly degenerated and the varieties now to be found in england much more numerous than they were in the times of queen elizabeth when doctor caius attempted their natural history some of these he mentions are no longer to be found among us although many have since been introduced by no means so serviceable as those which have been suffered to decay  he divides the whole race into three kinds the first is the generous kind which consists of the tarrier the harrier and the bloodhound the gazehound the greyhound the leymmer and the tumbler all these are used for hunting then the spaniel the setter and the waterspaniel or finder were used for fowling and the spaniel gentle or lapdog for amusement the second is the farm kind consisting of the shepherds dog and the mastiff and the third is the mongrel kind consisting of the wappe the turnspit and the dancer to these varieties we may add at present the bulldog the dutch mastiff the harlequin the pointer and the dane with a variety of lapdogs which as they are perfectly useless may be considered as unworthy of a name  the tarrier is a small kind of hound british zoology  with rough hair made use of to force the fox or the badger out of their holes or rather to give notice by their barking in what part of their kennel the fox or badger resides when the sportsmen intend to dig them out  the harrier as well as the beagle and the foxhound are used for hunting of all other animals they have the quickest and most distinguishing sense of smelling the properly breeding matching and training these make up the business of many mens lives  the bloodhound was a dog of great use and in high esteem among our ancestors its employ was to recover any game that had escaped wounded from the hunter or had been killed and stolen out of the forest but it was still more employed in hunting thieves and robbers by their footsteps at that time when the country was less peopled than at present and when consequently the footsteps of one man were less crossed and obliterated by those of others this animal was very serviceable in such pursuits but at present when the country is every where peopled this variety is quite worn out probably because it was found of less service than formerly  the gazehound hunted like our greyhounds by the eye and not by the scent it chaced indifferently the fox hare or buck it would select from the herd the fattest and fairest deer pursue it by the eye and if lost recover it again with amazing sagacity this species is now lost or unknown among us  the greyhound is very well known at present and was formerly held in such estimation that it was the peculiar companion of a gentleman who in the times of semibarbarism was known by his horse his hawk and his greyhound persons under a certain rank of life are forbidden by some late gamelaws from keeping this animal wherefore to disguise it the better they cut off its tail  the leymmer is a species now unknown to us it hunted both by scent and sight and was led in a leyme or thong from whence it received its name  the tumbler was less than the hound more scraggy and had pricked ears so that by the description it seems to answer to the modern lurcher this took its prey by mere cunning depending neither on the goodness of its nose nor its swiftness if it came into a warren it neither barked nor ran on the rabbits but seemingly inattentive approached sufficiently near till it came within reach and then seized them by a sudden spring  the land spaniel which probably had its name from spain where it might have acquired the softness of its hair is well known at present there are two varieties of this kind namely the slater used in hawking to spring the game and the setter that crouches down when it scents the birds till the net be drawn over them i have read somewhere that the famous poet lord surry was the first who taught dogs to set it being an amusement to this day only known in england  the water spaniel was another species used in fowling this seems to be the most docile of all the dog kind and this docility is particularly owing to his natural attachment to man many other kinds will not bear correction but this patient creature though very fierce to strangers seems unalterable in his affections and blows and ill usage seem only to increase his regard  the lapdog at the time of doctor caius was of maltese breed at present it comes from different countries in general the more awkward or extraordinary these are the more they are prized  the shepherds dog has been already mentioned and as for the mastiff he is too common to require a description doctor caius tells us that three of these were reckoned a match for a bear and four for a lion however we are told that three of them overcame a lion in the times of king james the first two of them being disabled in the combat the third obliged the lion to seek for safety by slight  as to the last division namely of the wappe the turnspit and the dancer these were mongrels of no certain shape and made use of only to alarm the family or being taught a variety of tricks were carried about as a show  with regard to those of later importation the bulldog as mr buffon supposes is a breed between the small dane and the english mastiff the large dane is the tallest dog that is generally bred in england it is somewhat between a mastiff and a greyhound in shape being more slender than the one and much stronger than the other they are chiefly used rather for show than service being neither good in the yard nor the field the highest are most esteemed and they generally cut off their ears to improve their figure as some absurdly suppose the harlequin is not much unlike the small dane being an useless animal somewhat between an italian greyhound and a dutch mastiff to these several others might be added such as the pug dog the black breed and the pointer but in fact the varieties are so numerous as to fatigue even the most ardent curiosity    of these of the foreign kinds i shall mention only three which are more remarkable than any of the rest the lion dog greatly resembles that animal in miniature from whence it takes the name the hair of the fore part of its body is extremely long while that of the hinder part is as short the nose is short the tail long and tufted at the point so that in all these particulars it is entirely like the lion however it differs very much from that fierce animal in nature and disposition being one of the smallest animals of its kind extremely feeble timid and inactive it comes originally from malta where it is found so small that women carry it about in their sleeves  that animal falsely called the turkish dog differs greatly from all the rest of the kind in being entirely without hair the skin which is perfectly bare is of a flesh color with brown spots and their figure at first view is rather disgusting these seem to be of the small danish breed brought into a warm climate and there by a succession of generations divested of their hair for this reason they are extremely chilly and unable to endure the cold of our climate and even in the midst of summer they continue to shiver as we see men in a frosty day their spots are brown as was said well marked and easily distinguishable in summer but in the cold of winter they entirely disappear they are called the turkish breed although brought from a much warmer climate for some of them have been known to come from the warmest parts of africa and the east indies  the last variety and the most wonderful of all that i shall mention is the great irish wolf dog that may be considered as the first of the canine species this animal which is very rare even in the only country in the world where it is to be found is rather kept for show than use there being neither wolves nor any other formidable beasts of prey in ireland that seem to require so powerful an antagonist the wolf dog is therefore bred up in the houses of the great or such gentlemen as choose to keep him as a curiosity being neither good for hunting the hare the fox or the stag and equally unserviceable as an house dog nevertheless he is extremely beautiful and majestic to appearance being the greatest of the dog kind to be seen in the world the largest of those i have seen and i have seen above a dozen was about four feet high or as tall as a calf of a year old he was made extremely like a greyhound but rather more robust and inclining to the figure of the french matin or the great dane his eye was mild his color white and his nature seemed heavy and phlegmatic this i ascribed to his having been bred up to a size beyond his nature for we see in man and all other animals that such as are overgrown are neither so vigorous nor alert as those of more moderate stature the greatest pains had been taken with these to enlarge the breed both by food and matching this end was effectually obtained indeed for the size was enormous but as it seemed to me at the expense of the animals fierceness vigilance and sagacity however i was informed otherwise the gentleman who bred them assuring me that a mastiff would be nothing when opposed to one of them who generally seized their antagonist by the back he added that they would worry the strongest bulldogs in a few minutes to death but this strength did not appear either in their figure or their inclinations they seemed rather more timid than the ordinary race of dogs and their skin was much thinner and consequently less fitted for combat whether with these disadvantages they were capable as i was told of singly coping with bears others may determine however they have but few opportunities in their own country of exerting their strength as all wild carnivorous animals there are only of the vermin kind mr buffon seems to be of opinion that these are the true molossian dogs of the ancients he gives no reason for this opinion and i am apt to think it ill grounded not to trouble the reader with a tedious critical disquisition which i have all along avoided it will be sufficient to observe that nemesianus in giving directions for the choice of a bitch advises to have one of spartan or molossian breed and among several other perfections he says that the ears should be dependent and fluctuate as she runs elige tunc cursu facilem facilemque recursu in lacedaemonio natam seu rure molosso  renibus ampla satis validis diductaque coxas cui que nimis molles fluitent in cursibur aures nemesian  this however is by no means the case with the irish wolf dog whose ears resemble those of the greyhound and are far from fluctuating with the animals motions but of whatever kinds these dogs may be whether known among the ancients or whether produced by a later mixture they are now almost quite worn away and are very rarely to be met with even in ireland if carried to other countries they soon degenerate and even at home unless great care be taken they quickly alter they were once employed in clearing the island of wolves which infested it in great plenty but these being destroyed the dogs also are wearing away as if nature meant to blot out the species when they had no longer any services to perform in this manner several kinds of animals fade from the face of nature that were once well known but are now seen no longer the enormous elk of the same kingdom that by its horns could not have been less than eleven feet high the wolf and even the wolfdog are extinct or only continued in such a manner as to prove their former plenty and existence from hence it is probable that many of the nobler kinds of dogs of which the ancients have given us such beautiful descriptions are now utterly unknown since among the whole breed we have not one that will venture to engage the lion or the tiger in single combat the english bulldog is perhaps the bravest of the kind but what are his most boasted exploits to those mentioned of the epirotic dogs by pliny or the indian dogs by aelian the latter gives us a description of a combat between a dog and a lion which i will take leave to translate  when alexander was pursuing his conquests in india one of the principal men or that country was desirous of showing him the value of the dogs which his country produced bringing his dog into the kings presence he ordered a stag to be let loose before him which the dog despising as an unworthy enemy remained quite regardless of the animal and never once stirred from his place his master then ordered a wild boar to be set out but the dog thought even this a despicable foe and remained calm and regardless as before he was next tried with a bear but still despising his enemy he only waited for an object more worthy of his courage and his force at last they brought forth a tremendous lion and then the dog acknowledged his antagonist and prepared for combat he instantly discovered a degree of ungovernable ardour and flying at the lion with fury seized him by the throat and totally disabled him from resistance upon this the indian who was desirous of surprising the king and knowing the constancy and bravery of his dog ordered his tail to be cut off which was easily performed as the bold animal was employed in holding the lion he next ordered one of his legs to be broken which however did not in the least abate the dogs ardour but he still kept his hold as before another leg was then broken but the dog as if he had suffered no pain only pressed the lion still the more in this cruel manner all his legs were cut off without abating his courage and at last when even his head was separated from his body the jaws seemed to keep their former hold a sight so cruel did not fail to affect the king with very strong emotions at once pitying the dogs fate and admiring his fortitude upon which the indian seeing him thus moved presented him with four dogs of the same kind which in some measure alleviated his uneasiness for the loss of the former  the breed of dogs however in that country is at present very much inferior to what this story seems to imply since in many places instead of dogs they have animals of the cat kind for hunting in other places also this admirable and faithful animal instead of being applied to his natural uses is only kept to be eaten all over china there are dogbutchers and shambles appointed for selling their flesh in canton particularly there is a street appointed for that purpose and what is very extraordinary wherever a dogbutcher appears all the dogs of the place are sure to be in full cry after him they know their enemy and persecute him as far as they are able along the coasts of guinea their flesh is esteemed a delicacy by the negroes and they will give one of their cows for a dog but among this barbarous and brutal people scarce any thing that has life comes amiss and they may well take up with a dog since they consider toads lizards and even the flesh of the tiger itself as a dainty it may perhaps happen that the flesh of this animal which is so indifferent in the temperate climates may assume a better quality in those which are more warm but it is more than probable that the diversity is rather in man than in the flesh of the dog since in the cold countries the flesh is eaten with equal appetite by the savages and they have their dogfeasts in the same manner as we have ours for venison  in our climate the wild animals that most approach the dog are the wolf and the fox these in their internal conformation greatly resemble each other and yet in their natures are very distinct the ancients asserted that they bred together and i am assured by credible persons that there are many animals in this country bred between a dog and a fox however all the endeavors of mr buffon to make them engender as he assures us were ineffectual for this purpose he bred up a young wolf taken in the woods at two months old with a matin dog of the same age they were shut up together without any other in a large yard where they had a shelter for retiring they neither of them knew any other individual of their kind nor even any other man but he who had the charge of feeding them in this manner they were kept for three years still with the same attention and without constraining or tying them up during the first year the young animals played with each other continually and seemed to love each other very much in the second year they began to dispute about their victuals although they were given more than they could use the quarrel always began on the wolfs side they were brought their food which consisted of flesh and bones upon a large wooden platter which was laid on the ground just as it was put down the wolf instead of falling to the meat began by driving off the dog and took the platter in his teeth so expertly that he let nothing of what it contained fall upon the ground and in this manner carried it off but as he could not entirely escape he was frequently seen to run with it round the yard five or six times still carrying it in a position that none of its contents could fall in this manner it would continue running only now and then stopping to take breath until the dog coming up the wolf would leave the victuals to attack him the dog however was the stronger of the two but as it was more gentle in order to secure him from the wolfs attack he had a collar put round his neck in the third year the quarrels of these ill paired associates were more vehement and their combats more frequent the wolf therefore had a collar put about its neck as well as the dog who began to be more fierce and unmerciful during the two first years neither seemed to testify the least tendency toward engendering and it was not till the end of the third that the wolf which was the female showed the natural desire but without abating either in its fierceness or obstinacy this appetite rather increased than repressed their mutual animosity they became every day more intractable and ferocious and nothing was heard between them but the sounds of rage and resentment they both in less than three weeks became remarkably lean without ever approaching each other but to combat at length their quarrels became so desperate that the dog killed the wolf who was become more weak and feeble and he was soon after himself obliged to be killed for upon being set at liberty he instantly flew upon every animal he met fowls dogs and even men themselves not escaping his savage fury  the same experiment was tried upon foxes taken young but with no better success they were never found to engender with dogs and our learned naturalist seems to be of opinion that their natures are too opposite ever to provoke mutual desire one thing however must be remarked that the animals on which he tried his experiments were rather too old when taken and had partly acquired their natural savage appetites before they came into his possession the wolf as he acknowledges was two or three months old before it was caught and the foxes were taken in traps it may therefore be easily supposed that nothing could ever after thoroughly tame those creatures that had been suckled in the wild state and had caught all the habitudes of the dam i have seen these animals when taken earlier in the woods become very tame and indeed they rather were displeasing by being too familiar than too shy it were to be wished that the experiment were tried upon such as these and it is more than probable that it would produce the desired success nevertheless these experiments are sufficient to prove that neither the wolf nor the fox are of the same nature with the dog but each of a species perfectly distinct and their joint produce most probably unfruitful  the dog when first whelped is not a completely finished animal in this kind as in all the rest which bring forth many at a time the young are not so perfect as in those which bring forth but one or two they are always produced with the eyes closed the lids being held together not by sticking but by a kind of thin membrane which is torn as soon as the upper eyelid becomes strong enough to raise it from the under in general their eyes are not opened till ten or twelve days old during that time the bones of the scull are not completed the body is puffed up the nose is short and the whole form but ill sketched out in less than a month the puppy begins to use all its senses and from thence makes hasty advances to its perfection at the fourth month the dog loses some of his teeth as in other animals and these are renewed by such as never fall the number of these amount to fortytwo which is twelve more than is found in any of the cat kind which are known never to have above thirty the teeth of the dog being his great and only weapon are formed in a manner much more serviceable than those of the former and there is scarce any quadrupede that has a greater facility in rending cutting or chewing its food he cuts with his incisors or foreteeth he holds with his four great canine teeth and he chews his meat with his grinders these are fourteen in number and so placed that when the jaws are shut there remains a distance between them so that the dog by opening his mouth ever so wide does not lose the power of his jaws but it is otherwise in the cat kind whose incisors or cutting teeth are very small and whose grinding teeth when brought together touch more closely than those of the dog and consequently have less power thus for instance i can squeeze any thing more forcibly between my thumb and fore finger where the distance is greater than between any other two fingers whose distance from each other is less  this animal is capable of reproducing at the age of twelve months to this description i will beg leave to add a few particulars from linnaeus as i find them in the original vomitua gramina purgatur cacat supra lapidem album graecum anti septicum summum mingit ad latus this however not till the animal is nine months old cum hospite saepe centies odorat anum alterius procis rixantibus crudelis menstruans cutulit cum variis mordet illa illos cohaeret copula junctus  goes nine weeks with young and lives to about the age of twelve few quadrupedes are less delicate in their food and yet there are many kinds of birds which the dog will not venture to touch he is even known although in a savage state to abstain from injuring some which one might suppose he had every reason to oppose the dogs and the vultures which live wild about grand cairo in egypt for the mohammedan law has expelled this useful animal from human society continue together in a very sociable and friendly manner hasselquist her palaestin p      as they are both useful in devouring such carcases as might otherwise putrefy and thus infect the air the inhabitants supply them with provisions every day in order to keep them near the city upon these occasions the quadrupedes and birds are often seen together tearing the same piece of flesh without the least enmity on the contrary they are known to live together with a kind of affection and bring up their young in the same nest  although the dog is a voracious animal yet he can bear hunger for a very long time we have an instance in the memoirs of the academy of sciences of this kind in which a bitch that had been forgotten in a country house lived forty days without any other nourishment than the wool of a quilt which she had torn in pieces it should seem that water is more necessary to the dog than food he drinks often though not abundantly and it is commonly believed that when abridged in water he runs mad this dreadful malady the consequences of which are so well known is the greatest inconvenience that results from the keeping this faithful domestic but it is a disorder by no means so frequent as the terrors of the timorous would suppose the dog has been often accused of madness without a fair trial and some persons have been supposed to receive their deaths from his bite when either their own illgrounded fears or their natural disorders were the true cause  the wolf the dog and the wolf are so very much alike internally that the most expert anatomists can scarce perceive the difference and it may be asserted also that externally some dogs more nearly resemble the wolf than they do each other it was this strong similitude that first led some naturalists to consider them as the same animal and to look upon the wolf as the dog in its state of savage freedom however this opinion is entertained no longer the natural antipathy those two animals bear to each other the longer time which the wolf goes with young than the dog the one going over an hundred days and the other not quite sixty the longer period of life in the former than the latter the wolf living twenty years the dog not fifteen all sufficiently point out a distinction and draw a line that must for ever keep them asunder  the wolf from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail is about three feet seven inches long and about two feet five inches high which shows him to be larger than our great breed of mastiffs which are seldom found to be above three feet by two his color is a mixture of black brown and gray extremely rough and hard but mixed toward the roots with a kind of ash colored fur in comparing him to any of our well known breed of dogs the great dane or mongrel greyhound for instance he will appear to have the legs shorter the head larger the muzzle thicker the eyes smaller and more separated from each other and the ears shorter and straiter he appears in every respect stronger than the dog and the length of his hair contributes still more to his robust appearance the feature which principally distinguishes the visage of the wolf from that of the dog is the eye which opens slantingly upwards in the same direction with the nose whereas in the dog it opens more at right angles with the nose as in man the tail also in this animal is long and bushy and he carries it rather more between his hind legs than the dog is seen to do the color of the eye balls in the wolf are of a fiery green and give his visage a fierce and formidable air which his natural disposition does by no means contradict the rest of this history of the wolf is taken from mr buffon and i look upon it as a complete model for natural history if i add or differ i mark it as usual   the wolf is one of those animals whose appetite for animal food is the most vehement and whose means of satisfying this appetite are the most various nature has furnished him with strength cunning agility and all those requisites which fit an animal for pursuing overtaking and conquering its prey and yet with all these the wolf most frequently dies of hunger for he is the declared enemy of man being long proscribed and a reward offered for his head he is obliged to fly from human habitations and to live in the forest where the few wild animals to be found there escape him either by their swiftness or their art or are supplied in too small a proportion to satisfy his rapacity he is naturally dull and cowardly but frequently disappointed and as often reduced to the verge of famine he becomes ingenious from want and courageous from necessity when pressed with hunger he braves danger and comes to attack those animals which are under the protection of man particularly such as he can readily carry away lambs sheep or even dogs themselves for all animal food comes then equally agreeable when this excursion has succeeded he often returns to the charge until having been wounded or hard pressed by the dogs or the shepherds he hides himself by day in the thickest coverts and only ventures out at night he then sallies forth over the country keeps peering round the villages carries off such animals as are not under protection attacks the sheepfolds scratches up and undermines the thresholds of doors where they are housed enters furious and destroys all before he begins to six upon and carry off his prey when these sallies do not succeed he then returns to the thickest part of the forest content to pursue those smaller animals which even when taken afford him but a scanty supply he there goes regularly to work follows by the scent opens to the view still keeps following hopeless himself of overtaking the prey but expecting that some other wolf will come into his assistance and then content to share the spoil at last when his necessities are very urgent he boldly faces certain destruction he attacks women and children and sometimes ventures even to fall upon men becomes furious by his continual agitations and ends his life in madness  the wolf as well externally as internally so nearly resembles the dog that he seems modelled upon the same plan and yet he only offers the reverse of the medal if his form be like his nature is so different that he only preserves the ill qualities of the dog without any of his good ones indeed they are so different in their dispositions that no two animals can have a more perfect antipathy to each other a young dog shudders at the sight of a wolf he even shuns his scent which though unknown is so repugnant to his nature that he comes trembling to take protection near his master a dog who is stronger and who knows his strength bristles up at the sight testifies his animosity attacks him with courage endeavors to put him to slight and does all in his power to rid himself of a presence that is hateful to him they never meet without either flying or fighting fighting for life and death and without mercy on either side if the wolf is the stronger he tears and devours his prey the dog on the contrary is more generous and contents himself with his victory he does not seem to think that the body of a dead enemy smells well he leaves him where he falls to serve as food for birds of prey or for other wolves since they devour each other and when one wolf happens to be desperately wounded the rest track him by his blood and are sure to show him no mercy  the dog even in his savage state is not cruel he is easily tamed and continues firmly attached to his master the wolf when taken young becomes tame but never has an attachment nature is stronger in him than education he resumes with age his natural dispositions and returns as soon as he can to the woods from whence he was taken dogs even of the dullest kinds seek the company of other animals they are naturally disposed to follow and accompany other creatures beside themselves and even by instinct without any education take to the care of flocks and herds the wolf on the contrary is the enemy of all society he does not even keep much company with those of his kind when they are seen in packs together it is not to be considered as a peaceful society but a combination for war they testify their hostile intentions by their loud howlings and by their fierceness discover a project for attacking some great animal such as a stag or a bull or to destroy some more redoubtable watchdog the instant their military expedition is completed their society is at an end they then part and each returns in silence to his solitary retreat there is not even any strong attachments between the male and female they seek each other only once a year and remain but a few days together they always couple in winter at which time several males are seen following one female and this association is still more bloody than the former they dispute most cruelly growl bark fight and tear each other and it sometimes happens that the majority kill the wolf which has been chiefly preferred by the female it is usual for the she wolf to fly from them all with him she has chosen and watches this opportunity when the rest are asleep  the season for coupling does not continue above twelve or fifteen days and usually commences among the oldest those which are young being later in their desires the males have no fixed time for engendering they pass from one female to the other beginning at the end of december and ending at the latter end of february the time of pregnancy is about three months and an half and the young wolves are found from the latter end of april to the beginning of july the long continuance of the wolfs pregnancy is sufficient to make a distinction between it and the dog did not also the fiery fierceness of the eyes the howl instead of barking and the greater duration of its life leave no doubt of its being an animal of its own particular species in other respects however they are entirely alike the wolf couples exactly like the dog the parts are formed in the same manner and their separation hindered by the same cause when the shewolves are near their time of bringing forth they seek some very tufted spot in the thickest part of the forest in the middle of this they make a small opening cutting away the thorns and briars with their teeth and afterward carry thither a great quantity of moss which they form into a bed for their young ones they generally bring forth five or six and sometimes even to nine at a litter the cubs are brought forth like those of the bitch with the eyes closed the dam suckles them for some weeks and teaches them betimes to eat flesh which she prepares for them by chewing it first herself some time after she brings them stronger food hares partridges and birds yet alive the young wolves begin by playing with them and end by killing them the dam then strips them of their feathers tears them in pieces and gives to each of them a share they do not leave the den where they have been littered till they are six weeks or two months old they then follow the old one who leads them to drink to the trunk of some old tree where the water has settled or at some pool in the neighborhood if she apprehends any danger she instantly conceals them in the first convenient place or brings them back to their former retreat in this manner they follow her for some months when they are attacked she defends them with all her strength and more than usual ferocity although at other times more timorous than the male at that season she becomes bold and fearless willing perhaps to teach the young ones future courage by her own example it is not till they are about ten or twelve months old and until they have shed their first teeth and completed the new that she thinks them in a capacity to shift for themselves then when they have acquired arms from nature and have learned industry and courage from her example she declines all future care of them being again engaged in bringing up a new progeny  the males and females are in a capacity to engender when two years old it is probable that the females of this species as well as of most others are sooner completed than the males but this is certain that they never desire to copulate until their second winter from whence we may suppose that they live fifteen or twenty years for allowing three years for their complete growth this multiplied by seven gives them a life of twentyone most animals as has been observed living about seven times the number of years which they take to come to perfection of this however there is as yet no certainty no more than of what huntsmen assert that in all the litters there are more males than females from them also we learn that there are some of the males who attach themselves to the female who accompany her during her gestation until the time of bringing forth when she hides the place of her retreat from the male lest he should devour her cubs but after this when they are brought forth that the then takes the same care of them as the female carries them provisions and if the dam should happen to be killed rears them up in her stead  the wolf grows gray as he grows old and his teeth wear like those of most other animals by using he sleeps when his belly is full or when he is fatigued rather by day than night and always like the dog is very easily waked he drinks frequently and in times of drought when there is no water to be found in the trunks of old trees or in the pools about the forest he comes often in the day down to the brooks or the lakes in the plain although very voracious he supports hunger for a long time and often lives four or five days without food provided he be supplied with water  the wolf has great strength particularly in his foreparts in the muscles of his neck and his jaws he carries off a sheep in his mouth without letting it touch the ground and runs with it much swifter than the shepherds who pursue him so that nothing but the dogs can overtake and oblige him to quit his prey he bites cruelly and always with greater vehemence in proportion as he his least resisted for he uses precautions with such animals as attempt to stand upon the defensive he is ever cowardly and never fights but when under a necessity of satisfying hunger or making good his retreat when he is wounded by a bullet he is heard to cry out and yet when surrounded by the peasants and attacked with clubs he never howls as the dog under correction but defends himself in silence and dies as hard as he lived  his nature is in fact more savage than that of the dog he has less sensibility and greater strength he travels runs and keeps plundering for whole days and nights together he is in a manner indefatigable and perhaps of all animals he is the most difficult to be hunted down the dog is good natured and courageous the wolf though savage is ever fearful if he happens to be caught in a pitfall he is for some time so frightened and astonished that he may be killed without offering to resist or taken alive without much danger at that instant one may clap a collar round his neck muzzle him and drag him along without his ever giving the least signs of anger or resentment at all other times he has his senses in great perfection his eye his car and particularly his sense of smelling which is even superior to the two former he smells a carcass at more than a leagues distance he also perceives living animals a great way off and follows them a long time upon the scent whenever he leaves the wood he always takes care to go out against the wind when just come to its extremity he stops to examine by his smell on all sides the emanations that may come either from his enemy or his prey which he very nicely distinguishes he prefers those animals which he kills himself to those he finds dead and yet he does not disdain these when no better is to be had he is particularly fond of human flesh and perhaps if he were sufficiently powerful he would eat no other wolves have been seen following armies and arriving in numbers upon the field of battle where they devoured such dead bodies as were left upon the field or but negligently interred these when once accustomed to human flesh ever after seek particularly to attack mankind and choose to fall upon the shepherd rather than his flock we have had a late instance of two or three of these keeping a whole province for more than a month in a continual alarm  it sometimes happens that a whole country is called out to extirpate these most dangerous invaders the hunting the wolf is a favorite diversion among the great of some countries and it must be confessed it seems to be the most useful of any these animals are distinguished by the huntsmen into the young wolf the old wolf and the great wolf they are known by the prints of their feet the older the wolf the larger the track he leaves that of the female is narrower and longer than that of the male it is necessary to have a very good starter to put up the wolf and it is even convenient to use every art to encourage him in his pursuit for all dogs have a natural repugnance against this animal and are but cold in their endeavors when the wolf is once put up it is then proper to have greyhounds to let fly at him in leashes one after the other the first leash is sent after him in the beginning seconded by a man on horseback the second are let loose about half a mile farther and the third when the rest of the dogs come up with and begin to bait him he for a long time keeps them off stands his ground threatens them on all sides and often gets away but usually the hunters arriving come in aid of the dog and help to dispatch him with their cutlasses when the animal is killed the dogs testify no appetite to enjoy their victory but leave him where he falls a frightful spectacle and even in death hideous  the wolf is sometimes also hunted with harriers but as he always goes straight forward and often holds his speed for a whole day together this kind of chase is tedious and disagreeable at least if the harriers are not assisted by gray hounds who may harrass him at every view several other arts have been also used to take and destroy this noxious animal he is surrounded and wounded by men and large housedogs he is secured in traps he is poisoned by carcases prepared and placed for that purpose and is caught in pitfalls gesner tells us of a friar a woman and a wolf being taken in one of these all in the same night the woman lost her senses with the fright the friar his reputation and the wolf his life all these disasters however do not prevent this animals multiplying in great numbers particularly in countries where the woods are plenty france spain and italy are great infested with them but england ireland and scotland are happily set free  king edgar is said to be the first who attempted to rid this kingdom of such disagreeable inmates by commuting the punishment for certain crimes into the acceptance of a number of wolfs tongues from each criminal british zoology p     however some centuries after these animals were again increased to such a degree as to become the object of royal attention accordingly edward the first issued out his mandate to one peter corbet to superintend and assist in the destruction of them they are said to have infested ireland long after they were extirpated in england however the oldest men in that country remember nothing of these animals and it is probable that there have been none there for more than a century past scotland also is totally free  the color of this animal differs according to the different climates where it is bred and often changes even in the same country beside the common wolves which are found in france and germany there are others with thicker hair inclining to yellow these are more savage and less noxious than the former neither approaching the flocks nor habitations and living rather by the chase than rapine in the northern climates they are found some quite black and some white all over the former are larger and stronger than those of any other kinds  the species is very much diffused in every part of the world being found in asia africa and in america as well as europe the wolves of senegal resemble those of france except that they are larger and much fiercer than those of europe those of egypt are smaller than those of greece in the east the wolf is trained up for a show being taught to dance and play tricks and one of these thus educated often sells for four or five hundred crowns it is said that in lapland the wolf will never attack a reindeer that is seen haltered for this wary animal being well acquainted with the nature of a trap suspects one wherever it perceives a rope however when he sees the deer entirely at liberty he seldom fails to destroy it the wolf of north america is blacker and much less than those in other parts of the world and approaches nearer in form to the dog than those of the ordinary kind brookess natural history vol   p      in fact they were made use of as such by the savages till the europeans introduced others and even now on the remoter shores or the more inland parts of the country the savages still make use of these animals in hunting they are very tame and gentle and those of this kind that are wild are neither so large nor so fierce as an european wolf nor do they ever attack mankind they go together in large packs by night to hunt the deer which they do as well as any dogs in england and it is confidently asserted that one of them is sufficient to run down a deer dictionaire raisonee loup  whenever they are seen along the banks of those rivers near which the wandering natives pitch their huts it is taken for granted that the bison or the deer are not far off and the savages affirm that the wolves come with the tidings in order to have the garbage after the animal has been killed by the hunters catesby adds a circumstance relative to these animals which if true invalidates many of mr buffons observations in the foregoing history he asserts that these being the only dogs used by the americans before the arrival of the europeans among them they have since engendered together and that their breed has become prolific which proves the dog and the wolf to be of the same species it were to be wished that this fact were better ascertained we should then know to a certainty in what a degree the dog and wolf resemble each other as well in nature as in conformation we might then perhaps be enabled to improve the breed of our dogs by bringing them back to their native forms and instincts we might by crossing the strain restore that race of those bold animals which the ancients assure us were more than a match for the lion    depiction of the wolf the wolf de seve del isc tailor sculp   however this animal may be useful in north america the wolf of europe is a very noxious animal and scarce any thing belonging to him is good except his skin of this the furriers make a covering that is warm and durable though coarse and unsightly his flesh is very indifferent and seems to be disliked by all other animals no other creature being known to eat the wolfs flesh except the wolf himself he breathes a most foetid vapor from his jaws as his food is indiscriminate often putrid and seldom cleanly in short every way offensive a savage aspect a frightful howl an insupportable odor a perverse disposition fierce habits he is hateful while living and useless when dead  the fox the fox very exactly resembles the wolf and the dog internally and although he differs greatly from both in size and carriage yet when we come to examine his shapes minutely there will appear to be very little difference in the description were for instance a painter to draw from a natural historians exactest description the figure of a dog a wolf and a fox without having ever seen either he would be very apt to confound all these animals together or rather he would be unable to catch those peculiar outlines that no description can supply words will never give any person an exact idea of forms any way irregular for although they be extremely just and precise yet the numberless discriminations to be attended to will confound each other and we shall no more conceive the precise form than we should be able to tell when one pebble more was added or taken away from a thousand to conceive therefore how the fox differs in form from the wolf or the dog it is necessary to see all three or at least to supply the defects of description by examining the difference in a print  the fox is of a slenderer make than the wolf and not near so large for as the former is above three feet and a half long so the other is not above two feet three inches the tail of the fox also is longer in proportion and more bushy its nose is smaller and approaching more nearly to that of the greyhound and its hair softer on the other hand it differs from the dog in having its eyes obliquely situated like those of the wolf its ears are directed also in the same manner as those of the wolf and its head is equally large in proportion to its size it differs still more from the dog in its strong offensive smell which is peculiar to the species and often the cause of their death however some are ignorantly of opinion that it will keep off infectious diseases and they preserve this animal near their habitations for that very purpose  the fox has since the beginning been famous for his cunning and his arts and he partly merits his reputation buffon renard  without attempting to oppose either the dogs or the shepherds without attacking the flock or alarming the village he finds an easier way to subsist and gains by his address what is denied to his strength or courage patient and prudent he waits the opportunity for depredation and varies his conduct with every occasion his whole study is his preservation although nearly as indefatigable and actually more swift than the wolf he does not entirely trust to either but makes himself an asylum to which he retires in case of necessity where he shelters himself from danger and brings up his young  as among men those who lead a domestic life are more civilized and more endued with wisdom than those who wander from place to place so in the inferior ranks of animated nature the taking possession of an home supposes a degree of instinct which others are without ibid  the choice of the situation for this domicil the art of making it convenient of hiding its entrance and securing it against more powerful animals are all so many marks of superior skill and industry the fox is furnished with both and turns them to his advantage he generally keeps his kennel at the edge of the wood and yet within an easy journey of some neighboring cottage from thence he listens to the crowing of the cock and the cackling of the domestic fowls he scents them at a distance he seizes his opportunity conceals his approaches creeps slyly along makes the attack and seldom returns without his booty if he be able to get into the yard he begins by levelling all the poultry without remorse and carrying off a part of the spoil hides it at some convenient distance and again returns to the charge taking off another fowl in the same manner he hides that also but not in the same place and this he practices for several times together until the approach of day or the noise of the domestics give him warning to retire the same arts are practiced when he finds birds entangled in springes laid for them by the fowler the fox takes care to be beforehand very expertly takes the bird out of the snare hides it for three or four days and knows very exactly when and where to return to avail himself of hidden treasure he is equally alert in seizing the young hares and rabbits before they have strength enough to escape him and when the old ones are wounded and fatigued he is sure to come upon them in their moments of distress and to show them no mercy in the same manner he finds out birds nests seizes the partridge and the quail while sitting and destroys a large quantity of game the wolf is most hurtful to the peasant but the fox to the gentleman in short nothing that can be eaten seems to come amiss rats mice serpents toads and lizards he will when urged by hunger eat carrots and insects and those that live near the seacoasts will for want of other food eat crabs shrimps and shell fish the hedgehog in vain rolls itself up into a ball to oppose him this determined glutton teizes it until it is obliged to appear uncovered and then he devours it the wasp and the wild be are attacked with equal success although at first they fly out upon their invader and actually oblige him to retire this is but for a few minutes until he has rolled himself upon the ground and thus crushed such as stick to his skin he then returns to the charge and at last by perseverance obliges them to abandon their combs which he greedily devours both wax and honey  the chase of the fox requires less preparation than that of the wolf and it is also more pleasant and amusing as dogs have a natural repugnance to pursue the wolf so they are equally alert in following the fox which chase they prefer even to that of the hare or the buck the huntsmen as upon other occasions have their cant terms for every part of this chase the fox the first year is called a cub the second a fox and the third an old fox his tail is called the brush or drag and his excrement the billiting he is usually pursued by a large kind of harrier or hound assisted by tarriers or a smaller breed that follow him into his kennel and attack him there the instant he perceives himself pursued he makes to his kennel and takes refuge at the bottom of it where for a while he loses the cry of his enemies but the whole pack coming to the mouth redouble their vehemence and rage and the little tarrier boldly ventures in it often happens that the kennel is made under a rock or among the roots of old trees and in such cases the fox cannot be dug out nor is the tarrier able to contend with him at the bottom of his hole by this contrivance he continues secure but when he can be dug out the usual way is to carry him in a bag to some open country and there set him loose before the hounds the hounds and the men follow barking and shouting wherever he runs and the body being strongly employed the mind has not time to make any reflection on the futility of the pursuit what adds to this entertainment is the strong scent which the fox leaves that always keeps up a full cry although as his scent is stronger than that of the hare it is much sooner evaporated his shifts to escape when all retreat is cut off to his kennel are various and surprising he always chooses the most woody country and takes those paths that are most embarrassed with thorns and briars he does not double nor use the unavailing shifts of the hare but flies in a direct line before the hounds though at no very great distance manages his strength takes to the low and plashy grounds where the scent will be less apt to lie and at last when overtaken he defends himself with desperate obstinacy and fights in silence to the very last gasp  the fox though resembling the dog in many respects is nevertheless very distinct in his nature refusing to engender with it and though not testifying the antipathy of the wolf yet discovering nothing more than indifference this animal also brings forth fewer at a time than the dog and that but once a year its litter is generally from four to six and seldom less than three the female goes with young about six weeks and seldom stirs out while pregnant but makes a bed for her young and takes every precaution to prepare for their production when she finds the place of their retreat discovered and that her young have been disturbed during her absence she removes them one after the other in her mouth and endeavors to find them out a place of better security a remarkable instance of this animals parental affection happened while i was writing this history in the county of essex a shefox that had as it should seem but one cub was unkennelled by a gentlemans hounds near chelmsford and hotly pursued in such a case when her own life was in imminent peril one would think it was not a time to consult the safety of her young however the poor animal braving every danger rather than leave her cub behind to be worried by the dogs took it up in her mouth and ran with it in this manner for some miles at last taking her way through a farmers yard she was assaulted by a mastiff and at last obliged to drop her cub which was taken up by the farmer i was not displeased to hear that this faithful creature escaped the pursuit and at last got off in safety the cubs of the fox are born blind like those of the dog they are eighteen months or two years in coming to perfection and live about twelve or fourteen years  as the fox makes war upon all animals so all others seem to make war upon him the dog hunts him with peculiar acrimony the wolf is still a greater and more necessitous enemy who pursues him to his very retreat some pretend to say that to keep the wolf away the fox lays at the mouth of its kennel a certain herb to which the wolf has a particular aversion this which no doubt is a fable at least shows that these two animals are as much enemies to each other as to all the rest of animated nature but the fox is not hunted by quadrupedes alone for the birds who know him for their mortal enemy attend him in his excursions and give each other warning of their approaching danger the daw the magpye and the black bird conduct him along perching on the hedges as he creeps below and with their cries and notes of hostility apprize all other animals to beware a caution which they perfectly understand and put into practice the hunters themselves are often informed by the birds of the place of his retreat and set the dogs into those thickets where they see them particularly noisy and querulous so that it is the fate of this petty plunderer to be detested by every rank of animals all the weaker classes shun and all the stronger pursue him  the fox of all wild animals is most subject to the influence of climate and there are found as many varieties in this kind almost as in any of the domestic animals buffon renard  the generality of foxes as is well known are red but there are some though not in england of a greyish cast and mr buffon asserts that the tip of the tail in all foxes is white which however is not so in those of this country there are only three varieties of this animal in great britain and these are rather established upon a difference of size than of color or form the greyhound fox is the largest tallest and boldest and will attack a grown sheep the mastiff fox is less but more strongly built the cur fox is the least and most common he lurks about hedges and outhouses and is the most pernicious of the three to the peasant and farmer  in the colder countries round the pole the foxes are of all colors black blue gray iron gray silver gray white white with red legs white with black heads white with the tip of the tail black red with the throat and depiction of the fox the fox de seve del isc tailor sculp belly entirely white and lastly with a stripe of black running along the back and another crossing it at the shoulders buffon renard  the common kind however is more universally diffused than any of the former being found in europe in the temperate climates of asia and also in america they are very rare in africa and in the countries lying under the torrid zone those travelers who talk of having seen them at calicut and other parts of southern india have mistaken the jackall for the fox the fur of the white fox is held in no great estimation because the hair falls off the blue fox skins are also bought up with great avidity from their scarceness but the black fox skin is of all others the most esteemed a single skin often selling for forty or fifty crowns the hair of these is so disposed that it is impossible to tell which way the grain lies for if we hold the skin by the head the hair hangs to the tail and if we hold it by the tail it hangs down equally smooth and even to the head these are often made into mens muffs and are at once very beautiful and warm in our temperate climate however furs are of very little service there being scarce any weather so severe in england from which our ordinary clothes may not very well defend us  the jackall the jackall is one of the commonest wild animals in the whole east and yet there is scarce any less known in europe or more confusedly described by natural historians in general we are assured that it resembles the fox in figure and disposition but we are still ignorant of those nice distinctions by which it is known to be of a different species it is said to be of the size of a middling dog resembling the fox in the hinder parts particularly the tail and the wolf in the foreparts especially the nose its legs are shorter than those of the fox and its color is of a bright yellow or sorrel as we express it in horses this is the reason it has been called in latin the golden wolf a name however which is entirely unknown in the countries where they are most common  the species of the jackall is diffused all over asia and is found also in most parts of africa seeming to take up the place of the wolf which in those countries is not so common there seems to be many varieties among them those of the warmest climates appear to be the largest and their color is rather of a reddish brown than of that beautiful yellow by which the smaller jackall are chiefly distinguished  although the species of the wolf approaches very near to that of the dog yet the jackall seems to be placed between them to the savage fierceness of the wolf it adds the impudent familiarity of the dog buffon vol xxvii p     its cry is an howl mixed with barking and a lamentation resembling that of human distress it is more noisy in its pursuits even than the dog and more voracious than the wolf the jackall never goes alone but always in a pack of forty or fifty together these unite regularly every day to form a combination against the rest of the forest nothing then can escape them they are content to take up with the smallest animals and yet when thus united have they courage to face the largest they seem very little afraid of mankind but pursue their game to their very doors without testifying either attachment or apprehension they enter insolently into the sheepfolds the yards and the stables and when they can find nothing else devour the leather harness boots and shoes and run off with what they have not time to swallow  they not only attack the living but the dead they scratch up with their feet the new made graves and devour the corpse how putrid soever in those countries therefore where they abound they are obliged to beat the earth over the grave and to mix it with thorns to prevent the jackalls from scraping it away they always assist each other as well in this employment of exhumation as in that of the chase while they are at this dreary work they exhort each other by a most mournful cry resembling that of children under chastisement and when they have thus dug up the body they share it amicably between them these like all other savage animals when they have once tasted of human flesh can never after refrain from pursuing mankind they watch the burying grounds follow armies and keep in the rear of caravans they may be considered as the vulture of the quadrupede kind every thing that once had animal life seems equally agreeable to them the most putrid substances are greedily devoured dried leather and any thing that has been rubbed with grease how insipid soever in itself is sufficient to make the whole go down  they hide themselves in holes by day and seldom appear abroad till nightfall when the jackall that has first hit upon the scent of some larger beast gives notice to the rest by an howl which it repeats as it runs while all the rest that are within hearing pack in to its assistance the gazelle or whatever other beast it may be finding itself pursued makes off toward the houses and the towns hoping by that means to deter its pursuers from following but hunger gives the jackall the same degree of boldness that scar gives the gazelle and it pursues even to the verge of the city and often along the streets the gazelle however by this means most frequently escapes for the inhabitants sallying our often disturb the jackall in the chase and as it hunts by the scent when once driven off it never recovers it again in this manner we see how experience prompts the gazelle which is naturally a very timid animal and particularly fearful of man himself to take refuge near him considering him as the least dangerous enemy and often escaping by his assistance  but man is not the only intruder upon the jackalls industry and pursuits the lion the tiger and the panther whose appetites are superior to their swiftness attend to its call and follow in silence at some distance behind linnaei systema p  0  the jackall pursues the whole night with unceasing assiduity keeping up the cry and with great perseverance at last tires down its prey but just at the moment it supposes itself going to share the fruits of its labor the lion or the leopard comes in satiates himself upon the spoil and his poor provider must be content with the bare carcass he leaves behind it is not to be wondered at therefore if the jackall be voracious since it so seldom has a sufficiency nor that it feeds on putrid substances since it is not permitted to feast on what it has newly killed beside these enemies the jackall has still another to cope with for between him and the dog there is an irreconcilable antipathy and they never part without an engagement the indian peasants often chase them as we do foxes and have learned by experience when they have got a lion or a tiger in their rear upon such occasions they keep their dogs close as they would be no match for such formidable animals and endeavor to put them to flight with their cries when the lion is dismissed they more easily cope with the jackall who is as stupid as it is impudent and seems much better fitted for pursuing than retreating it sometimes happens that one of them steals silently into an outhouse to seize the poultry or devour the furniture but hearing others in full cry without at a distance without thought it instantly answers the call and thus betrays its own depredations the peasants sally out upon it and the foolish animal finds too late that its instinct was too powerful for its safety  the isatis as the jackall is a sort of intermediate species between the dog and the wolf in this description i have followed mr buffon  so the isatis may be considered as placed between the dog and the fox this animal has hitherto been supposed to be only a variety of the latter but from the latest observations there is no doubt of their being perfectly distinct the isatis is very common in all the northern countries bordering upon the icy sea and is seldom found except in the coldest countries it extremely resembles a fox in the form of its body and the length of its tail and a dog in the make of its head and the position of its eyes the hair of these animals is softer than that of a common fox some are blue some are white at one season and at another of a russet brown although the whole of its hair be two inches long thick tufted and glossy yet the under jaw is entirely without any and the skin appears bare in that part  this animal can bear only the coldest climates and is chiefly seen along the coasts of the icy sea and upon the banks of the great rivers that discharge themselves therein it is chiefly fond of living in the open country and seldom seen in the forest being mostly found in the mountainous and naked regions of norway siberia and lapland it burrows like the fox and when with young the female retires to her kennel in the same manner as the fox is seen to do these holes which are very narrow and extremely deep have many outlets they are kept very clean and are bedded at the bottom with moss for the animal to be more at its ease its manner of coupling time of gestation and number of young are all similar to what is found in the fox and it usually brings forth at the end of may or the beginning of june  such are the particulars in which this animal differs from those of the dog kind and in which it resembles them but its most striking peculiarity remains still to be mentioned namely its changing its color and being seen at one time brown and at another perfectly white as was already said some are naturally blue and their color never changes but such as are to be white are when brought forth of a yellow hue which in the beginning of september is changed to white all except along the top of the back along which runs a stripe of brown and another crossing it down the shoulders at which time the animal is called the crossed fox however this brown cross totally disappears before winter and then the creature is all over white and its fur is two inches long this about the beginning of may again begins to fall and the molting is completed about the middle of july when the isatis becomes brown once more the fur of this animal is of no value unless it be killed in winter  the hyaena the hyaena is the last animal i shall mention among those of the dog kind which it in many respects resembles although too strongly marked to be strictly reduced to any type the hyaena is nearly of the size of a wolf and has some similitude to that animal in the shape of its head and body the head at first sight does not appear to differ except that the ears of the hyaena are longer and more without hair but upon observing more closely we shall find the head broader the nose slatter and not so pointed the eyes are not placed obliquely but more like those of a dog the legs particularly the hinder are longer than those either of the dog or the wolf and different from all other quadrupedes whatsoever in having but four toes as well on the fore feet as on the hinder its hair is of a dirty greyish marked with black disposed in waves down its body its tail is short with pretty long hair and immediately under it above the anus there is an opening into a kind of glandular pouch which separates a substance of the consistence but not of the odor of civet this opening might have given rise to the error of the ancients who asserted that this animal was every year alternately male and female such are the most striking distinctions of the hyaena as given us by naturalists which nevertheless convey but a very confused idea of the peculiarity of its form its manner of holding the head seems remarkable somewhat like a dog pursuing the scent with the nose near the ground the head being held thus low the back appears elevated like that of the hog which with a long bristly band of hair that runs all along gives it a good deal the air of that animal and it is probable that from this similitude it first took its name the word huoina being greek and derived from hus which signifies a sow  but no words can give an adequate idea of this animals figure deformity and fierceness more savage and untameable than any other quadrupede it seems to be for ever in a state of rage or rapacity for ever growling except when receiving its food its eyes then glisten the bristles of its back all stand upright its head hangs low and yet its teeth appear all which give it a most frightful aspect which a dreadful howl tends to heighten this which i have often heard is very peculiar its beginning resembles the voice of a man moaning and its latter part as if he were making a violent effort to vomit as it is loud and frequent it might perhaps have been sometimes mistaken for that of a human voice in distress and have given rise to the accounts of the ancients who tell us that the hyaena makes its moan to attract unwary travelers and then to destroy them however this be it seems the most untractable and for its size the most terrible of all other quadrupedes nor does its courage fall short of its ferocity it defends itself against the lion is a match for the panther and attacks the ounce that it seldom fails to conquer  it is an obscene and solitary animal to be found chiefly in the most desolate and uncultivated parts of the torrid zone of which it is a native buffon  it resides in the caverns of mountains in the clefts of rocks or in dens that it has formed for itself under the earth though taken never so young it cannot be tamed it lives by depredation like the wolf but is much stronger and more courageous it sometimes attacks man carries off cattle follows the flock breaks open the sheep cots by night and ravages with insatiable voracity its eyes shine by night and it is asserted not without great appearance of truth that it sees better by night than by day when destitute of other provision it scrapes up the graves and devours the dead bodies how putrid so ever to these dispositions which are sufficiently noxious and formidable the ancients have added numberless others which are long since known to be fables as for instance that the hyaena was male and female alternately that having brought forth and suckled its young it then changed sexes for a year and became a male this as was mentioned above could only proceed from the opening under the tail which all animals of this species are found to have and which is found in the same manner in no other quadrupede depiction of the hyena the hyaena de seve del isc tailor sculp except the badger there is in the weasel kind indeed an opening but it is lower down and not placed above the anus as in the badger and the hyaena some have said that this animal changed the color of its hair at will others that a stone was found in its eye which put under a mans tongue gave him the gift of prophecy some have said that he had no joints in the neck which however all quadrupedes are known to have and some that the shadow of the hyaena kept dogs from barking these among many other absurdities have been asserted of this quadrupede and which i mention to show the natural disposition of mankind to load those that are already but too guilty with accumulated reproach  chap ix of animals of the weasel kind having described the bolder ranks of carnivorous animals we now come to a minuter and more feeble class less formidable indeed than any of the former but far more numerous and in proportion to their size more active and enterprizing the weasel kind may be particularly distinguished from other carnivorous animals by the length and slenderness of their bodies which are so fitted as to wind like worms into very small openings after their prey and hence also they have received the name of vermin from their similitude to the worm in this particular these animals differ from all of the cat kind in the formation and disposition of their claws which as in the dog kinds they can neither draw in nor extend at pleasure as cats are known to do they differ from the dog kind in being clothed rather with fur than hair and although some varieties of the fox may resemble them in this particular yet the coat of the latter is longer stronger and always more resembling hair beside these distinctions all animals of the weasel kind have glands placed near the anus that either open into it or beneath it furnishing a substance that in some has the most offensive smell in nature in others the most pleasing perfume all of this kind are still more marked by their habitudes and dispositions than their external form cruel voracious and cowardly they subsist only by theft and find their chief protection in their minuteness they are all from the shortness of their legs slow in pursuit and therefore owe their support to their patience assiduity and cunning as their prey is precarious they live a long time without food and if they happen to fall in where it is in plenty they instantly destroy all about them before they begin to satisfy their appetite and suck the blood of every animal before they begin to touch its flesh  these are the marks common to this kind all the species of which have a most striking resemblance to each other and he that has seen one in some measure may be said to have seen all the chief distinction in this numerous class of animals is to be taken from the size for no words can give the minute irregularities of that outline by which one species is to be distinguished from that which is next it i will begin therefore with the least and the best known of this kind and still marking the size will proceed gradually to larger and larger until we come from the weasel to the glutton which i take to be the largest of all the weasel will serve as a model for all the rest and indeed the points in which they differ from this little animal are but very inconsiderable  the weasel british zoology vol i p     as was said is the smallest of this numerous tribe its length not exceeding seven inches from the tip of the nose to the insertion of the tail this length however seems to be very great if we compare it with the height of the animal which is not above an inch and an half in measuring the wolf we find him to be not above once and an half as long as he is high in observing the weasel we find it near five times as long as it is high which shows an amazing disproportion the tail also which is bushy is two inches and an half long and adds to the apparent length of this little animals body the color of the weasel is of a bright red on the back and sides but white under the throat and the belly it has whiskers like a cat and thirty two teeth which is two more than any of the cat kind and these also seem better adapted for tearing and chewing than those of the cat kind are the eyes are little and black the ears short broad and roundish and have a fold at the lower part which makes them look as if they were double beneath the corners of the mouth on each jaw is a spot of brown  this animal though very diminutive to appearance is nevertheless a very formidable enemy to quadrupedes an hundred times its own size it is very common and well known in most parts of this country but seems held in very different estimation in different parts of it in those places where sheep or lambs are bred the weasel is a most noxious inmate and every art is used to destroy it on the contrary in places where agriculture is chiefly followed the weasel is considered as a friend that thins the number of such vermin as chiefly live upon corn however in all places it is one of the most untameable and untractable animals in the world buffon vol xv p     when kept in a cage either for the purposes of amusement or inspection it will not touch any part of its victuals while any body looks on it keeps in a continual agitation and seems frighted so much at the sight of mankind that it will die if not permitted to hide itself from their presence for this purpose it must be provided in its cage with a sufficient quantity of wool or hay in which it may conceal itself and where it may carry whatever it has got to eat which however it will not touch until it begins to putrefy in this state it is seen to pass three parts of the day in sleeping and reserves the night for its times of exercise and eating  in its wild state the night is likewise the time during which it may be properly said to live at the approach of evening it is seen stealing from its hole and creeping about the farmers yard for its prey if it enters the place where poultry are kept it never attacks the cocks or the old hens but immediately aims at the young ones it does not eat its prey on the place but after killing it by a single bite near the head and with a wound so small that the place can scarcely be perceived it carries it off to its young or its retreat it also breaks and sucks the eggs and sometimes kills the hen that attempts to defend them it is remarkably active and in a confined place scarce any animal can escape it it will run up the sides of walls with such facility that no place is secure from it and its body is so small that there is scarce any hole but what it can wind through during the summer its excursions are more extensive but in winter it chiefly confines itself in barns and farmyards where it remains till spring and where it brings forth its young all this season it makes war upon the rats and mice with still greater success than the cat for being more active and slender it pursues them into their holes and after a short resistance destroys them it creeps also into pidgeonholes destroys the young catches sparrows and all kind of small birds and if it has brought forth its young hunts with still greater boldness and avidity in summer it ventures farther from the house and particularly goes into those places where the rat its chiefest prey goes before it accordingly it is found in the lower grounds by the side of waters near mills and often is seen to hide its young in the hollow of a tree  the female takes every precaution to make an easy bed for her little ones she lines the bottom of her hole with grass hay leaves and moss and generally brings forth from three to five at a time all animals of this as well as those of the dog kind bring forth their young with closed eyes but they very soon acquire strength sufficient to follow the dam in her excursions and assist in her projects of petty rapine the weasel like all others of its kind does not run on equably but moves by bounding and when it climbs a tree by a single spring it gets a good way from the ground it jumps in the same manner upon its prey and having an extremely limber body evades the attempts of much stronger animals to seize it  this animal like all of its kind has a very strong smell and that of the weasel is peculiarly foetid this scent is very distinguishable in those creatures when they void their excrement for the glands which furnish this foetid substance which is of the consistence of suet open directly into the orifice of the anus and taint the excrement with the strong effluvia the weasel smells more strongly in summer than in winter and more abominably when irritated or pursued than when at its ease it always preys in silence and never has a cry except when struck and then it has a rough kind of squeaking which at once expresses resentment and pain its appetite for animal food never forsakes it and it seems even to take a pleasure in the vicinity of putrefaction mr buffon tells us of one of them being found with three young ones in the carcass of a wolf that was grown putrid and that had been hung up by the hind legs as a terror to others into this horrid retreat the weasel thought proper to retire to bring forth her young she had furnished the cavity with hay grass and leaves and the young were just brought forth when they were discovered by a peasant passing that way  the ermine or stoat next to the weasel in size and perfectly alike in figure is the ermine the difference between this and the former animal is so very small that many and among the rest linnaeus who gives but one description of both have confounded the two kinds together however their differences are sufficient to induce later naturalists to suppose the two kinds distinct and as their lights seems preferable we choose to follow their descriptions buffon british zoology   the stoat or ermine differs from the weasel in size being usually nine inches long whereas the former is not much above six the tail of the ermine is always tipped with black and is longer in proportion to the body and more furnished with hair the edges of the ears and the ends of the toes in this animal are of a yellowish white and although it is of the same color with the weasel being of a lightish brown and though both this animal as well as the weasel in the most northern parts of europe changes its color in winter and becomes white yet even then the weasel may be easily distinguished from the ermine by the tip of the tail which in the latter is always black  it is well known that the fur of the ermine is the most valuable of any hitherto known and it is in winter only that this little animal has it of the proper color and consistence in summer the ermine as was said before is brown and it may at that time more properly be called the stoat there are few so unacquainted with quadrupedes as not to perceive this change of color in the hair which in some degree obtains in them all the horse the cow and the goat all manifestly change color in the beginning of summer the old long hair falling off and a shorter coat of hair appearing in its room generally of a darker color and yet more glossy what obtains in our temperate climate is seen to prevail still more strongly in those regions where the winters are long and severe and the summers short and yet generally hot in an extreme degree the animal has strength enough during that season to throw off a warm coat of fur which would but incommode it and continues for two or three months in a state somewhat resembling the ordinary quadrupedes of the milder climates at the approach of winter however the cold increasing the coat of hair seems to thicken in proportion from being coarse and short it lengthens and grows finer while multitudes of smaller hairs grow up between the longer thicken the coat and give it all that warmth and softness which are so much valued in the furs of the northern animals  it is no easy matter to account for this remarkable warmth of the furs of northern quadrupedes or how they come to be furnished with such an abundant covering it is easy enough indeed to say that nature fits them thus for the climate and like an indulgent mother when she exposes them to the rigor of an intemperate winter supplies them with a covering against its inclemency but this is only flourishing it is not easy i say to tell how nature comes to furnish them in this manner a few particulars on this subject are all that we yet know it is observable among quadrupedes as well as even among the human species itself that a thin sparing diet is apt to produce hair children that have been ill fed famished dogs and horses are more hairy than others whose food has been more plentiful this may therefore be one cause that the animals of the north in winter are more hairy than those of the milder climates at that season the whole country is covered with deep snow and the provisions which these creatures are able to procure can be but precarious and scanty its becoming finer may also proceed from the severity of the cold that contracts the pores of the skin and the hair consequently takes the shape of the aperture through which it grows as wiers are made smaller by being drawn through a smaller orifice however this may be all the animals of the artic climates may be said to have their winter and summer garments except very far to the north as in greenland where the cold is so continually intense and the food so scarce that neither the bears nor foxes change color at all krantzs history of greenland vol i p      the ermine as was said is remarkable among these for the softness the closeness and the warmth of its fur it is brown in summer like the weasel and changes color before the winter is begun becoming a beautiful cream color all except the tip of the tail as was said before which still continues black mr daubenton had one of these brought him with its white winter ur which he put into a cage and kept in order to observe the manner of moulting its hair he received it in the beginning of march and in a very short time it began to shed its coat and a mixture of brown was seen to prevail among the white so that at the ninth of the same month its head was nearly become of a reddish brown day after day this color appeared to extend at first along the neck and down the back in the manner of a stripe of about half an inch broad the forepart of the legs then assumed the same color a part of the head the thighs and the tail were the last that changed but at the end of the month there was no white remaining except on those parts which are always white in this species particularly the throat and the belly however he had not the pleasure of seeing this animal resume its former whiteness although he kept it for above two years which without doubt was owing to its imprisoned state this color being partly owing to its stinted food and partly to the rigor of the season during its state of confinement this little animal always continued very wild and untractable for ever in a state of violent agitation except when asleep which it often continued for three parts of the day except for its most disagreeable scent it was an extremely pretty creature its eyes sprightly its physiognomy pleasant and its motions so swift that the eye could scarce attend them it was fed with eggs and flesh but it always let them putrify before it touched either as some of this kind are known to be fond of honey it was tried to feed this animal with such food for a while after having for three or four days deprived it of other food it ate of this and died shortly after a strong proof of its being a distinct species from the pole cat or the martin who feed upon honey but otherwise pretty much resemble the ermine in their figure and dispositions  in the north of europe and siberia their skins make a valuable article of commerce and they are found there much more frequently than among us in siberia they burrow in the fields and are taken in traps baited with flesh in norway they are either shot with blunt arrows or taken in traps made of two flat stones one being propped with a stick to which is fastened a baited string which when the animals attempt to pull away the stone drops and crushes them to death this animal is sometimes found white in great britain and is then called a white weasel its furs however among us are of no value having neither the thickness the closeness nor the whiteness of those which come from siberia the fur of the ermine in every country changes by time for as much of its beautiful whiteness is given it by certain arts known to the furriers so its natural color returns and its former whiteness can never be restored again  the ferret the animal next in size to the ermine is the ferret which is a kind of domestic in europe though said to be originally brought from africa into spain which being a country abounding in rabbits required an animal of this kind more than any other however this be it is not to be found at present among us except in its domestic state and it is chiefly kept tame for the purposes of the warren  the ferret is about one foot long being nearly four inches longer than the weasel it resembles that animal in the slenderness of its body and the shortness of its legs but its nose is sharper and its body more slender in proportion to its length the ferret is commonly of a cream color but they are also found of all the colors of the weasel kind white blackish brown and partycolored those that are of the whitish kind have their eyes red as is almost general with all animals entirely of that color but its principal distinction from the weasel is the length of the hair on its tail which is much longer in the ferret than the weasel words will not well express the other distinctions and what might take up a page in dull discrimination a single glance of the eye when the animals themselves are presented can discover  as this animal is a native of the torrid zone buffon  so it cannot bear the rigours of our climate without care and shelter and it generally repays the trouble of its keeping by its great agility in the warren it is naturally such an enemy of the rabbit kind that if a dead rabbit be presented to a young ferret although it has never seen one before it instantly attacks and bites it with an appearance of rapacity if the rabbit be living the ferret is still more eager seizes it by the neck winds itself round it and continues to suck its blood till it be satiated  their chief use in warrens is to enter the holes and drive the rabbits into the nets that are prepared for them at the mouth for this purpose the ferret is muzzled otherwise instead of driving out the rabbit it would content itself with killing and sucking its blood at the bottom of the hole but by this contrivance being rendered unable to seize its prey the rabbit escapes from its claws and instantly makes to the mouth of the hole with such precipitation that it is inextricably entangled in the net placed there for its reception it often happens however that the ferret disengages itself of its muzzle and then it is most commonly lost unless it be dug out for finding all its wants satisfied in the warren it never thinks of returning to the owner but continues to lead a rapacious solitary life while the summer continues and dies with the cold of the winter in order to bring the ferret from his hole the owners often burn straw and other substances at the mouth they also beat above to terrify it but this does not always succeed for as there are often several issues to each hole the ferret is affected neither by the noise or the smoke but continues secure at the bottom sleeping the greatest part of the time and waking only to satisfy the calls of hunger  the female of this species buffon  is sensibly less than the male whom she seeks with great ardour and it is said often dies without being admitted they are usually kept in boxes with wool of which they make themselves a warm bed which serves to defend them from the rigor of the climate they sleep almost continually and the instant they awake they seem eager for food they are usually fed with bread and milk and they breed twice a year some of them devour their young as soon as brought forth and then they become fit for the male again their number is usually from five to six at a litter and this is said to consist of more females than males upon the whole this is an useful but a disagreeable and offensive animal its scent is foetid its nature voracious it is tame without any attachment and such is its appetite for blood that it has been known to attack and kill children in the cradle it is very easy to be irritated and although at all times its smell is very offensive it then is much more so and its bite is very difficult of cure  to the ferret kind we may add an animal which mr buffon calls the vansire the skin of which was sent him stuffed from madagascar it was thirteen inches long a good deal resembling the ferret in figure but differing in the number of its grinding teeth which amounted to twelve whereas in the ferret there are but eight it differed also in color being of a dark brown and exactly the same on all parts of its body of this animal so nearly resembling the ferret we have no other history but the mere description of its figure and in a quadrupede whose kind is so strongly marked perhaps this is sufficient to satisfy curiosity  the polecat the polecat is larger than the weasel the ermine or the ferret being one foot five inches long whereas the weasel is but six inches the ermine nine and the ferret eleven inches it so much resembles the ferret in form that some have been of opinion they were one and the same animal nevertheless there are a sufficient number of distinctions between them it is in the first place larger than the ferret it is not quite so slender and has a blunter nose it differs also internally having but fourteen ribs whereas the ferret has fifteen and wants one of the breast bones which is found in the ferret however warreners assert that the polecat will mix with the ferret and they are sometimes obliged to procure an intercourse between these two animals to improve the breed of the latter which by long confinement is sometimes seen to abate of its rapacious disposition mr buffon denies that the ferret will admit the polecat yet gives a variety under the name of both animals which may very probably be a spurious race between the two  however this be the polecat seems by much the more pleasing animal of the two for although the long slender shape of all these vermin tribes gives them a very disagreeable appearance yet the softness and color of the hair in some of them atones for the defect and renders them if not pretty at least not frightful the polecat for the most part is of a deep chocolate color it is white about the mouth the ears are short rounded and tipped with white a little beyond the corners of the mouth a stripe begins which runs backward partly white and partly yellow its hair like that of all this class is of two sorts the long and the furry but in this animal the two kinds are of different colors the longest is black and the shorter yellowish rays synopsis  the throat feet and tail are blacker than any other parts of the body the claws are white underneath and brown above and its tail is about two inches and an half  it is very destructive to young game of all kinds british zoology vol i p     but the rabbit seems to be its favorite prey a single polecat is often sufficient to destroy a whole warren for with that insatiable thirst for blood which is natural to all the weasel kind it kills much more than it can devour and i have seen twenty rabbits at a time taken out dead which they had destroyed and that by a wound which was hardly perceptible their size however which is so much larger than the weasel renders their retreats near houses much more precarious although i have seen them burrow near a village so as scarcely to be extirpated but in general they reside in woods or thick brakes making holes under ground of about two yards deep commonly ending among the roots of large treets for greater security in winter they frequent houses and make a common practice of robbing the henroost and the dairy  the polecat is particularly destructive among pigeons buffon  when it gets into a dovehouse without making so much noise as the weasel it does a great deal more mischief it dispatches each with a single wound in the head and after killing a great number and satiating itself with their blood it then begins to think of carrying them home this it carefully performs going and returning and bringing them one by one to its hole but if it should happen that the opening by which it got into the dovehouse be not large enough for the body of the pidgeon to get through this mischievous creature contents itself with carrying away the heads and makes a most delicious feast upon the brains  it is not less fond of honey attacking the hives in winter and forcing the bees away it does not remove far from houses in winter as its prey is not so easily found in the woods during that season the female brings forth her young in summer to the number of five or six at a time these she soon trains to her own rapacious habits supplying the want of milk which no carnivorous quadrupede has in plenty with the blood of such animals as she happens to seize the fur of this animal is considered as soft and warm yet it is in less estimation than some of a much inferior kind from its offensive smell which can never be wholly removed or suppressed the polecat seems to be an inhabitant of the temperate climates buffon  scarce any being found toward the north and but very few in the warmer latitudes depiction of the polecat the polecat de seve del isc tailor sculp the species appears to be confined in europe from poland to italy it is certain that these animals are afraid of the cold as they are often seen to come into houses in winter and as their tracks are never found in the snow near their retreats it is probable also that they are afraid of heat as they are but thinly scattered in the southern climates  the martin the martin is a larger animal than any of the former being generally eighteen inches long and the tail ten more it differs from the polecat in being about four or five inches longer its tail also is longer in proportion and more bushy at the end its nose is flatter its cry is sharper and more piercing its colors are more elegant and what still adds to their beauty its scent very unlike the former instead of being offensive is considered as a most pleasing perfume the martin in short is the most beautiful of all british beasts of prey its head is small and elegantly formed its eyes lively its ears are broad rounded and open its back its sides and tail are covered with a fine thick downy fur with longer hair intermixed the roots are ash color the middle of a bright chestnut the points black the head is brown with a slight cast of red the legs and upper sides of the feet are of a chocolate color the palms or under sides are covered with a thick down like that of the body the feet are broad the claws white large and sharp well adapted for the purposes of climbing but as in others of the weasel kind incapable of being sheathed or unsheathed at pleasure the throat and breast are white the belly of the same color with the back but rather paler the hair on the tail is very long especially at the end where it appears much thicker than near the insertion  there is also a variety of this animal called the yellow breasted martin which in no respect differs from the former except that this has a yellow breast whereas the other has a white one the color of the body also is darker and as it lives more among trees than the other martin its fur is more valuable beautiful and glossy the former of these mr buffon calls the fouine the latter simply the martin and he supposes them to be a distinct species but as they differ only in color it is unnecessary to embarrass history by a new distinction where there is only so minute a difference  of all animals of the weasel kind the martin is the most pleasing all its motions show great grace as well as agility and there is scarce an animal in our woods that will venture to oppose it quadrupedes five times as big are easily vanquished the hare the sheep and even the wild cat itself though much stronger is not a match for the martin and although carnivorous animals are not fond of engaging each other yet the wild cat and the martin seldom meet without a combat gesner tells us of one of this kind that he kept tame which was extremely playful and pretty it went among the houses of the neighborhood and always returned home when hungry it was extremely fond of a dog that had been bred up with it and used to play with it as cats are seen to play lying on its back and biting without anger or injury that which was kept tame by mr buffon was not quite so social it was divested of its ferocity but continued without attachment and was still so wild as to be obliged to be held by a chain whenever a cat appeared it prepared for war and if any of the poultry came within its reach it flew upon them with avidity though it was tied by the middle of the body it frequently escaped at first it returned after some hours but without seeming pleased and as if it only came to be fed the next time it continued abroad longer and at last went away without ever returning it was a female and was when it went off a year and an half old and mr buffon supposes it to have gone in quest of the male it ate every thing that was given it except sallad or herbs and it was remarkably fond of honey it was remarked that it drank often and often slept for two days together and that in like manner it was often two or three days without sleeping before it went to sleep it drew itself up into a round hid its head and covered it with its tail when awake it was in continual agitation and was obliged to be tied up not less to prevent its attacking the poultry than to hinder it from breaking whatever it came near by the capricious wildness of its motions  the yellow breasted martin is much more common in france than in england and yet even there this variety is much scarcer than that with the white breast the latter keeps nearer houses and villages to make its petty ravages among the sheep and the poultry the other keeps in the woods and leads in every respect a savage life building its nest on the tops of trees and living upon such animals as are entirely wild like itself about nightfall it usually quits its solitude to seek its prey hunts after squirrels rats and rabbits destroys great numbers of birds and their young takes the eggs from the nest and often removes them to its own without breaking brookes natural history  the instant the martin finds itself pursued by dogs for which purpose there is a peculiar breed that seem fit for this chase only it immediately makes to its retreat which is generally in the hollow of some tree toward the top and which it is impossible to come at without cutting it down their nest is generally the original tenement of the squirrel which that litttle animal bestowed great pains in completing but the martin having killed and dispossessed the little architect takes possession of it for its own use enlarges its dimensions improves the softness of the bed and in that retreat brings forth its young its litter is never above three or four at a time they are brought forth with the eyes closed as in all the rest of this kind and very soon come to a state of perfection the dam compensates for her own deficiency of milk by bringing them eggs and live birds accustoming them from the beginning to a life of carnage and rapine when she leads them from the nest into the woods the birds at once distinguish their enemies and attend them as we before observed of the fox with all the marks of alarm and animosity wherever the martin conducts her young a flock of small birds are seen threatening and insulting her alarming every thicket and often directing the hunter in his pursuit  the martin is still more common in north america than in any part of europe these animals are found in all the northern parts of the world from siberia to china and canada in every country they are hunted for their furs which are very valuable and chiefly so when taken in the beginning of winter the most esteemed part of the martins skin is that part of it which is browner than the rest and stretches along the backbone above twelve thousand of these skins are annually imported into england from hudsons bay and above thirty thousand from canada  the sable most of the classes of the weasel kind would have continued utterly unknown and disregarded were it not for their furs which are finer more glossy and soft than those of any other quadrupede their dispositions are fierce and untameable their scent generally offensive and their figure disproportioned and unpleasing the knowledge of one or two of them would therefore have sufficed curiosity and the rest would probably have been confounded together under one common name as things useless and uninteresting had not their skins been coveted by the vain and considered as capable of adding to human magnificence or beauty  of all these however the skin of the sable is the most coveted and held in the highest esteem it is of a brownish black and the darker it is it becomes the more valuable a single skin though not above four inches broad is often valued at ten or fifteen pounds regnard  the fur differing from others in this that it has no grain so that rub it which way you will it is equally smooth and unresisting nevertheless though this little animals robe was so much coveted by the great its history till of late was but very little known and we are obliged to mr jonelin for the first accurate description of its form and nature buffon vol xxvii p      from him we learn that the sable resembles the martin in form and size and the weasel in the number of its teeth for it is to be observed that whereas the martin has thirtyeight teeth the weasel has but thirtyfour in this respect therefore the sable seems to make the shade between these two animals being shaped like the one and furnished with teeth like the other it is also furnished with very large whiskers about the mouth its feet are broad and as in the rest of its kind furnished with five claws on each foot these are its constant marks but its fur for which it is so much valued is not always the same some of this species are of a dark brown over all the body except the ears and the throat where the hair is rather yellow others are more of a yellowish tincture their ears and throat being also much paler these in both are the colors they have in winter and which they are seen to change in the beginning of the spring the former becoming of a yellow brown the latter of a pale yellow in other respects they resemble their kind in vivacity agility and inquietude in sleeping by day and seeking their prey by night in living upon smaller animals and in the disagreeable odor that chiefly characterizes their race  they generally inhabit along the banks of rivers in shady places and in the thickest woods they leap with great ease from tree to tree and are said to be afraid of the sun which tarnishes the luster of their robes they are chiefly hunted in winter for their skins during which part of the year they are only in season they are mostly found in siberia and but very few in any other country of the world and this scarcity it is which enhances their value the hunting of the sable chiefly falls to the lot of the condemned criminals who are sent from russia into these wild and extensive forests that for a great part of the year are covered with snow and in this instance as in many others the luxuries and ornaments of the vain are wrought out of the dangers and the miseries of the wretched these are obliged to furnish a certain number of skins every year and are punished if the proper quantity be not provided  the sable is also killed by the russian soldiers who are sent into those parts to that end they are ed a certain number of skins yearly like the former and are obliged to shoot with only a single ball to avoid spoiling the skin or else with crossbows and blunt arrows as an encouragement to the hunters they are allowed to share among themselves the surplus of those skins which they thus procure and this in the process of six or seven years amounts to a very considerable sum a colonel during his seven years stay gains about four thousand crowns for his share and the common men six or seven hundred each for theirs  the ichneumon the ichneumon which some have injudiciously denominated the cat of pharaoh is one of the boldest and most useful animals of all the weasel kind in the kingdom of egypt where it is chiefly bred it is used for the same purposes that cats are in europe and is even more serviceable as being more expert in catching mice than they this animal is usually of the size of the martin and greatly resembles it in appearance except that the hair which is of a grisly black is much rougher and less downy the tail also is not so bushy at the end and each hair in particular has three or four colors which are seen in different dispositions of its body under its rougher hairs there is a softer fur of a brownish color the rough hair being about two inches long but that of the muzzle extremely short as likewise that on the legs and paws however being long since brought into a domestic state there are many varieties in this animal some being much larger than the martin others much less some being of a lighter mixture of colors and some being streaked in the manner of a cat  the ichneumon with all the strength of a cat has more instinct and agility a more universal appetite for carnage and a greater variety of powers to procure it the rest of this description is extracted from mr buffon except where marked with commas  rats mice birds serpents lizards and insects are all equally pursued it attacks every living thing which it is able to overcome and indiscriminately preys on flesh of all kinds its courage is equal to the vehemence of its appetite it fears neither the force of the dog nor the insidious malice of the cat neither the claws of the vulture nor the poison of the viper it makes war upon all kinds of serpents with great avidity seizes and kills them how venomous soever they be and we are told that when it begins to perceive the effects of their rage it has recourse to a certain root which the indians call after its name and assert to be an antidote for the bite of the asp or the viper  but what this animal is particularly serviceable to the egyptians for is that it discovers and destroys the eggs of the crocodile it also kills the young ones that have not as yet been able to reach the water and as fable usually goes hand in hand with truth it is said that the ichneumon sometimes enters the mouth of the crocodile when it is found sleeping on the shore boldly attacks the enemy in the inside and at length when it has effectually destroyed it it eats its way out again  the ichneumon when wild generally resides along the banks of rivers and in times of inundation makes to the higher ground often approaching inhabited places in quest of prey it goes forward silently and cautiously changing its manner of moving according to its necessities sometimes it carries the head high shortens its body and raises itself upon its legs sometimes it lengthens itself and seems to creep along the ground it is often observed to sit upon its hind legs like a dog when taught to beg but more commonly it is seen to dart like an arrow upon its prey and seize it with inevitable certainty its eyes are sprightly and full of fire its physiognomy sensible its body nimble its tail long and its hair rough and various like all of its kind it has glands that open behind and furnish an odorous substance its nose is too sharp and its mouth too small to permit its seizing things that are large however it makes up by its courage and activity its want of arms it easily strangles a cat though stronger and larger than itself and often fights with dogs which though never so bold learn to dread the ichneumon as a formidable enemy it also takes the water like an otter and as we are told will continue under it much longer  this animal grows fast and dies soon it is found in great numbers in all the southern parts of asia from egypt to java and it is also found in africa particularly at the cape of good hope it is domestic as was said in egypt but in our colder climates it is not easy to breed or maintain them as they are not able to support the rigor of our winters nevertheless they take every precaution that instinct can dictate to keep themselves warm they wrap themselves up into a ball hiding the head between the legs and in this manner continue to sleep all day long seba had one sent him from the island of ceylon which he permitted to run for some months about the house it was heavy and slothful by day and often could not be awaked even with a blow but it made up this indolence by its nocturnal activity smelling about without either being wholly tame or wholly mischievous it climbed up the walls and the trees with very great ease and appeared extremely fond of spiders and worms which it preferred probably from their resemblance to serpents its most natural food it was also particularly eager to scratch up holes in the ground and this added to its wildness and uncleanliness obliged our naturalist to smother it in spirits in order to preserve and add it to the rest of his collection  this animal was one of those formerly worshipped by the egyptians who considered every thing that was serviceable to them as an emanation of the deity and worshipped such as the best representatives of god below indeed if we consider the number of eggs which the crocodile lays in the sand at a time which often amount to three or four hundred we have reason to admire this little animals usefulness as well as industry in destroying them since otherwise the crocodile might be produced in sufficient numbers to overrun the whole earth  the stinkards this is a name which our sailors give to one or two animals of the weasel kind which are chiefly found in america all the weasel kind as was already observed have a very strong smell some of them indeed approaching to a perfume but the greatest number most insupportably foetid but the smell of our weasels and ermines and polecats is fragrance itself when compared to that of the squash and the skink which have been called the polecats of america these two are found in different parts of america both differing in color and depiction of the squash musquash muskrat the squash de seve del isc tailor sculp fur but both obviously of the weasel kind as appears not only from their figure and odor but also from their disposition the squash is about the size of a polecat its hair of a deep brown but principally differing from all of this kind in having only four toes on the feet before whereas all other weasels have five the skink which i take to be catesbys virginia polecat resembles a polecat in shape and size but particularly differs in the length of its hair and color the hair is above three inches and an half long and that at the end of the tail above four inches the color is partly black and partly white variously disposed over the body very glossy long and beautiful there seem to be two varieties more of this animal which mr buffon calls the conepate and the zorille he supposes each to be a distinct species but as they are both said to resemble the polecat in form and both to be clothed with long fur of a black and white color it seems needless to make a distinction the conepate resembles the skink in all things except in size being smaller and in the disposition of its colors which are more exact having five white stripes upon a black ground running longitudinally from the head to the tail the zorille resembles the skink but is rather smaller and more beautifully colored its streaks of black and white being more distinct and the colors of its tail being black at its insertion and white at the extremity whereas in the skink they are all of one gray color  but whatever differences there may be in the figure or color of these little animals they all agree in one common affection that of being intolerably foetid and loathsome i have already observed that all the weasel kind have glands furnishing an odorous matter near the anus the conduits of which generally have their aperture just at its opening that substance which is stored up in these receptacles is in some of this kind such as in the martin already mentioned and also in the genet and the civet to be described hereafter a most grateful perfume but in the weasel the ermine the ferret and the polecat it is extremely foetid and offensive these glands in the animals now under consideration are much larger and furnish a matter sublimed to a degree of putrescence that is truly amazing as to the perfumes of musk and civet we know that a single grain will diffuse itself over a whole house and continue for months to spread an agreeable odor without diminution however the perfume of the musk or the civet is nothing either for strength or duration to the insupportable odor of these it is usually voided with their excrement and if but a single drop happens to touch any part of a mans garment it is more than probable that he can never wear any part of it more  in describing the effects produced by the excrement of these animals we often hear of its raising this diabolical smell by its urine however of this i am apt to doubt and it should seem to me that as all the weasel kind have their excrements so extremely foetid from the cause abovementioned we may consider these also as being foetid from the same causes besides they are not furnished with glands to give their urine such a smell and the analogy between them and the weasel kind being so strong in other respects we may suppose they resemble each other in this it has also been said that they take this method of ejecting their excrement to defend themselves against their pursuers but it is much more probable that this ejection is the convulsive effect of terror and that it serves as their defense without their own concurrence certain it is that they never smell thus horridly except when enraged or affrighted for they are often kept tame about the houses of the planters of america without being very offensive  the habitudes of all these animals are the same living like all the rest of the weasel kind as they prey upon smaller animals and birds eggs the squash for instance burrows like the polecat in the clefts of rocks where it brings forth its young it often steals into farmyards and kills the poultry eating only their brains nor is it safe to pursue or offend it for then it calls up all its scents which are its most powerful protection at that time neither men nor dogs will offer to approach it the scent is so strong that it reaches for half a mile round and more near at hand is almost stifling if the dogs continue to pursue it does all in its power to escape by getting up a tree or by some such means but if driven to an extremity it then lets fly upon the hunters and if it should happen that a drop of this foetid discharge falls in the eye the person runs the risque of being blinded for ever voyage de kalm as quoted by buffon vol xxvii p      the dogs themselves instantly abate of their ardour when they find this extraordinary battery played off against them they instantly turn tail and leave the animal undisputed master of the field and no exhortations can ever bring them to rally in the year      says kalm one of these animals came near the farm where i lived it was in winter time and during the night and the dogs that were upon the watch pursued it for some time until it discharged against them although i was in my bed a good way off i thought i should have been suffocated and the cows and oxen themselves by their lowings showed how much they were affected by the stench about the end of the same year another of these animals crept into our cellar but did not exhale the smallest scent because it was not disturbed a foolish woman however who perceived it at night by the shining of its eyes killed it and at that moment its stench began to spread the whole cellar was filled with it to such a degree that the woman kept her bed for several days after and all the bread meat and other provisions that were kept there were so infected that they were obliged to be thrown out of doors nevertheless many of the planters and the native americans keep this animal tame about their houses and seldom perceive any disagreeable scents except it is injured or frighted they are also known to eat its flesh which some assert to be tolerable food however they take care to deprive it of those glands which are so horridly offensive  the genett from the squash which is the most offensive animal in nature we come to the genett which is one of the most beautiful and pleasing instead of the horrid stench with which the former affects us this has a most grateful odor more faint than civet but to some for that reason more agreeable this animal is rather less than the martin though there are genetts of different sizes and i have seen one rather larger it also differs somewhat in the form of its body it is not easy in words to give an idea of the distinction it resembles all those of the weasel kind in its length compared to its height it resembles them in having a soft beautiful fur in having its feet armed with claws that cannot be sheathed and in its appetite for petty carnage but then it differs from them in having the nose much smaller and longer rather resembling that of a fox than a weasel the tail also instead of being bushy tapers to a point and is much longer its ears are larger and its paws smaller as to its colors and figure in general the genett is spotted with black upon a ground mixed with red and gray it has two sorts of hair the one shorter and softer the other longer and stronger but not above half an inch long on any part of its body except the tail its spots are distinct and separate upon the sides but unite toward the back and form black stripes which run longitudinally from the neck backwards it has also along the back a kind of mane or longish hair which forms a black streak from the head to the tail which last is marked with rings alternately black and white its whole length  the genett like all the rest of the weasel kinds has glands that separate a kind of perfume resembling civet but which soon flies off these glands open differently from those of other animals of this kind for as the latter have their apertures just at the opening of the anus these have their aperture immediately under it so that the male seems for this reason to the superficial observer to be of two sexes  it resembles the martin very much in its habits and disposition buffon vol xix p      except that it seems tamed much more easily bellonius assures us that he has seen them in the houses at constantinople as tame as cats and that they were permitted to run every where about without doing the least mischief for this reason they have been called the cats of constantinople although they have little else in common with that animal except their skill in spying out and destroying vermin naturalists pretend that it inhabits only the moister grounds and chiefly resides along the banks of rivers having never been found in mountains nor dry places the species is not much diffused it is not to be found in any part of europe except spain and turkey it requires a warm climate to subsist and multiply in and yet it is not to be found in the warmer regions either of india or africa from such as have seen its uses at constantinople i learn that it is one of the most beautiful cleanly and industrious animals in the world that it keeps whatever house it is in perfectly free from mice and rats which cannot endure its smell add to this its nature is mild and gentle its colors various and glossy its fur valuable and upon the whole it seems to be one of those animals that with proper care might be propagated amongst us and might become one of the most serviceable of our domestics  the civet proceeding from the smaller to the greater of this kind we come in the last place to the civet which is much larger than any of the former for as the martin is not above sixteen inches long the civet is found to be above thirty mr buffon distinguishes this species into two kinds one of which he calls the civet and the other the zibet the latter principally differs from the former in having the body longer and more slender the nose smaller the ears longer and broader no mane or long hair running down the back in the latter and the tail is longer and better marked with rings of different colors from one end to the other these are the differences which have induced this great naturalist to suppose them animals of distinct species and to allot each a separate description how far future experience may confirm this conjecture time must discover but certain it is that if such small varieties make a separate class there may be many other animals equally entitled to peculiar distinction that now are classed together we shall therefore content ourselves at present with considering as former naturalists have done these two merely as varieties of the same animal and only altered in figure by climate food or education  the civet resembles animals of the weasel kind in the long slenderness of its body the shortness of its legs the odorous matter that exudes from the glands behind the softness of its fur the number of its claws and their incapacity of being sheathed it differs from them in being much larger than any hitherto described in having the nose lengthened so as to resemble that of the fox the tail long and tapering to a point and its ears strait like those of a cat the color of the civet varies it is commonly ash spotted with black though it is whiter in the female tending to yellow and the spots are much larger like those of a panther the color on the belly and under the throat is black whereas the other parts of the body are black or streaked with gray this animal varies in its color being sometimes streaked as in our kind of cats called tabbies it has whiskers like the rest of its kind and its eye is black and beautiful  the opening of the pouch or bag which is the receptacle of the civet differs from that of the rest of the weasel kind not opening into but under the anus beside this opening which is large there is still another lower down but for what purposes designed is not known the pouch itself is about two inches and an half broad and two long its opening makes a chink from the top downwards that is about two inches and an half long and it is covered on the edges and within with short hair when the two sides are drawn asunder the inward cavity may be seen large enough to hold a small pullets egg all round this are small glands opening and furnishing that strong perfume which is so well known and is found in this pouch of the color and consistence of pomatum those who make it their business to breed these animals for their perfume usually take it from them twice or thrice a week and sometimes oftener the animal is kept in a long sort of a box in which it cannot turn round the person therefore opens this box behind drags the animal backwards by the tail keeps it in this position by a bar before and with a wooden spoon takes the civet from the pouch as carefully as he can then lets the tail go and shuts the box again the perfume thus procured is put into a vessel which he takes care to keep shut and when a sufficient quantity is procured it is sold to very great advantage  the civet buffon vol xix  although a native of the warmest climates is yet found to live in temperate and even cold countries provided it be defended carefully from the injuries of the air wherefore it is not only bred among the turks the indians and africans but great numbers of these animals are also bred in holland where this scraping people make no small gain of its perfume the perfume of amsterdam is reckoned the purest of any the people of other countries adulterating it with gums and other matters which diminish its value but increase its weight the quantity which a single animal affords generally depends upon its health and nourishment it gives more in proportion as it is more delicately and abundantly fed raw flesh hashed small eggs rice birds young fowls and particularly fish are the kinds of food the civet most delights in these are to be changed and altered to suit and entice its appetite and continue its health it gets but very little water and although it drinks but rarely yet it makes urine very frequently and upon such occasions we cannot as in other animals distinguish the male from the female  the perfume of the civet is so strong that it communicates itself to all parts of the animals body the fur is impregnated thereby and the skin penetrated to such a degree that it continues to preserve the odor for a long time after it is stripped off if a person be shut up with one of them in a close room he cannot support the perfume which is so copiously diffused when the animal is irritated as in all the weasel kind its scent is much more violent than ordinary and if it be tormented so as to make it sweat this also is a strong perfume and serves to adulterate or increase what is otherwise obtained from it in general it is sold in holland for about fifty shillings an ounce though like all other commodities its value alters in proportion to the demand civet must be chosen new of a good consistence a whitish color and a strong disagreeable smell there is still a very considerable traffic carried on from busserah calicut and other places in india where the animal that produces it is bred from the levant also from guinea and especially from brasil in south america although mr buffon is of opinion that the animal is a native only of the old continent and not to be found wild in the new the best civet however is furnished as was observed by the dutch though not in such quantities at present as some years past when this perfume was more in fashion civet is a much more grateful perfume than musk to which it has some resemblance and was some years ago used for the same purposes in medicine but at present it is quite discontinued in prescription and persons of taste or elegance seem to proscribe it even from the toilet perfumes like dress have their vicissitudes musk was in peculiar repute until displaced by civet both gave ground upon discovering the manner of preparing ambergrease and even this is now difused for the less powerful vegetable kinds of fragrance spirit of lavender or otter of roses  as to the rest the civet is said to be a wild fierce animal and although sometimes tamed is never thoroughly familiar its teeth are strong and cutting although its claws be feeble and inflexible it is light and active and lives by prey as the rest of its kind pursuing birds and other small animals that it is able to overcome they are sometimes seen stealing into the yards and outhouses to seize upon the poultry their eyes shine in the night and it is very probable that they see better in the dark than by day when they fail of animal food they are found to subsist upon roots and fruits and very seldom drink for which reason they are never found near great waters they breed very fast in their native climates where the heat seems to condue to their propagation but in our temperate latitudes although they furnish their perfume in great quantities yet depiction of the civet the civet de seve del isc tailor sculp they are not found to multiply  a proof that their perfume has no analogy with their appetite for generation  the glutton i will add but one animal more to this numerous class of the weasel kind namely the glutton which for several reasons seems to belong to this tribe and this only we have hitherto had no precise description of this quadrupede some resembling it to a badger some to a fox and some to an hyaena linnaeus places it among the weasels from the similitude of its teeth it should seem to me to resemble this animal still more from the great length of its body and the shortness of its legs from the softness of its fur its disagreeable scent and its insatiable appetite for animal food mr klein who saw one of them which was brought alive from siberia assures us that it was about three feet long he says it was an ell eight inches long i have therefore given its length as supposing it to be a flemish ell which is twentyseven inches  and about a foot and an half high if we compare these dimensions with those of other animals we shall find that they approach more nearly to the class we are at present describing than any other and that the glutton may very justly be conceived under the form of a great overgrown weasel its nose its ears its teeth and its long bushy tail are entirely similar and as to what is said of its being rather corpulent than slender it is most probable that those who described it thus saw it after eating at which time its belly we are assured is most monstrously distended however suspending all certainty upon this subject i will take leave rather to follow linnaeus than buffon in describing this animal and leave future experience to judge between them  the glutton which is so called from its voracious appetite is an animal found as well in the north of europe and siberia as in the north parts of america where it has the name of the carcajou amidst the variety of descriptions which have been given of it no very just idea can be formed of its figure and indeed some naturalists among whom was ray entirely doubted of its existence from the best accounts however we have of it the body is thick and long the legs short it is black along the back and of a reddish brown on the sides its fur is held in the highest estimation for its softness and beautiful gloss the tail is bushy like that of the weasel but rather shorter and its legs and claws better fitted for climbing trees than for running along the ground thus far it entirely resembles the weasel and its manner of taking its prey is also by surprise and not by pursuit  scarce any of the animals with short legs and long bodies pursue their prey but knowing their own incapacity to overtake it by swiftness either creep upon it in its retreats or wait in ambush and seize it with a bound the glutton from the make of its legs and the length of its body must be particularly slow and consequently its only resource is in taking its prey by surprise all the rest of the weasel kind from the smallness of their size are better fitted for a life of insidious rapine than this they can pursue their prey into its retreats they can lurk unseen among the branches of trees and hide themselves with ease under the leaves but the glutton is too large to follow small prey into their retreats nor would such even if obtained be sufficient to sustain it for these reasons therefore this animal seems naturally compelled to the life for which it has long been remarkable its only resource is to climb a tree which it does with great ease and there it waits with patience until some large animal passes underneath upon which it darts down with unerring certainty and destroys it  it is chiefly in north america that this voracious creature is seen lurking among the thick branches of trees in order to surprise the deer with which the extensive forests of that part of the world abound endued with a degree of patience equal to its rapacity the glutton singles out such trees as it observes marked by the teeth or the antlers of the deer and is known to remain there watching for several days together if it has fixed upon a wrong tree and finds that the deer have either left that part of the country or cautiously shun the place it reluctantly descends pursues the beaver to its retreat or even ventures into the water in pursuit of fishes but if it happens that by long attention and keeping close at last the elk or the reindeer happens to pass that way it at once darts down upon them sticks its claws between their shoulders and remains there unalterably firm it is in vain that the large frighted animal increases its speed or threatens with its branching horns the glutton having taken possession of its post nothing can drive it off its enormous prey drives rapidly along amongst the thickest woods rubs itself against the largest trees and tears down the branches with its expanded horns but still its insatiable foe sticks behind eating its neck and digging its passage to the great blood vessels that lie in that part travelers who wander through those deserts often see pieces of the gluttons skin sticking to the trees against which it was rubbed by the deer but the animals voracity is greater than its feelings and it never seizes without bringing down its prey when therefore the deer wounded and feeble with the loss of blood falls the glutton is seen to make up for its former abstinence by its present voracity as it is not possessed of a feast of this kind every day it resolves to lay in a store to serve it for a good while to come it is indeed amazing how much one of these animals can eat at a time that which was seen by mr klein although without exercise or air although taken from its native climate and enjoying but an indifferent state of health was yet seen to eat thirteen pounds of flesh every day and yet remained unsatisfied we may therefore easily conceive how much more it must devour at once after a long fast of a food of its own procuring and in the climate most natural to its constitution we are told accordingly that from being a lank thin animal which it naturally is it then gorges in such quantities that its belly is distended and its whole figure seems to alter thus voraciously it continues eating till incapable of any other animal function it lies totally torpid by the animal it has killed and in this situation continues for two or three days in this loathsome and helpless state it finds its chief protection from its horrid smell which few animals care to come near linnaei syst p     so that it continues eating and sleeping till its prey be devoured bones and all and then it mounts a tree in quest of another adventure  the glutton like many others of the weasel kind seems to prefer the most putrid flesh to that newly killed and such is the voraciousness of this hateful creature that if its swiftness and strength were equal to its rapacity it would soon thin the forest of every other living creature but fortunately it is so slow that there is scarce a quadrupede that cannot escape it except the beaver this therefore it very frequently pursues upon land but the beaver generally makes good its retreat by taking to the water where the glutton has no chance to succeed this pursuit only happens in summer for in the winter all that remains is to attack the beavers house as at that time it never stirs from home this attack however seldom succeeds for the beaver has a covert way bored under the ice and the glutton has only the trouble and disappointment of sacking an empty town  a life of necessity generally produces a good fertile invention the glutton continually pressed by the call of appetite and having neither swiftness nor activity to satisfy it is obliged to make up by stratagem the defects of nature it is often seen to examine the traps and the snares laid for other animals in order to anticipate the fowlers it is said to practice a thousand arts to procure its prey to steal upon the retreats of the reindeer the flesh of which animal it loves in preference to all others to lie in wait for such animals as have been maimed by the hunters to pursue the isatis while it is hunting for itself and when that animal has run down its prey to come in and seize upon the whole and sometimes to devour even its poor provider when these pursuits fail even to dig up the graves and fall upon the bodies interred there devouring them bones and all for these reasons the natives of the countries where the glutton inhabits hold it in utter detestation and usually term it the vulture of quadrupedes and yet it is extraordinary enough that being so very obnoxious to man it does not seem to fear him buffon  we are told by gemelin of one of these coming up boldly and calmly where there were several persons at work without testifying the smallest apprehension or attempting to run until it had received several blows that at last totally disabled it in all probability it came among them seeking its prey and having been used to attack animals of inferior strength it had no idea of a force superior to its own the glutton like all the rest of its kind is a solitary animal and is never seen in company except with its female with which it couples in the midst of winter the latter goes with young about four months and brings forth two or three at a time linnaei system p     they burrow in holes as the weasel and the male and female are generally found together both equally resolute in defense of their young upon this occasion the boldest dogs are afraid to approach them they fight obstinately and bite most cruelly however as they are unable to escape by flight the hunters come in to the assistance of the dogs and easily overpower them their flesh it may readily be supposed is not fit to be eaten but the skins amply recompense the hunters for their toil and danger the fur has the most beautiful luster that can be imagined and is preferred before all others except that of the siberian fox or the sable among other peculiarities of this animal linnaeus informs us that it is very difficult to be skinned but from what cause whether its abominable stench or the skins tenacity to the flesh he has not thought fit to inform us  end of the third volume
