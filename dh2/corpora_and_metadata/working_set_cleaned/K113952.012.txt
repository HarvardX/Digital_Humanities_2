last of the months severest of them all woe to the regions where thy terrors fall hail to thy tempests which the deep deform thrice hail thy ruthless hurricane and storm now eolus let forth thy mightiest blast by land to rock the spire by sea the mast let earth and ocean feel thy potent sway and give thy blasts their full impetuous way for lo the fiery horses of the sun through the twelve signs their rapid course have run time like a serpent bites his forked tail and winter on a goat bestrides the gale rough blows the north wind near arcturus star and sweeps unreind across the polar bar on the worlds confines where the seabears prowl and greenland whales like moving islands roll there through the skies on brooms are seen to ride the lapland wizzard and his hellish bride there on a sledge the raindeer drives the swain to meet his mistress on the frostbound plain have mercy winter  for we own thy power thy flooding deluge and thy drenching shower yes  we acknowledge what thy prowess can but oh have pity on the toil of man and though the floods thy adamantine chain submissive wear  yet spare the treasured grain the peasants to thy mercy now resign the infant seed  their hope and future mine not always phoebus bends his vengeful bow often in mid winter placid breezes blow often tinctured with the bluest transmarine the fretted canopy of heaven is seen girded with argent lamps the fullorbd moon in mild december emulates the noon though short the respite if the sapphire blue stains the bright luster with an inky hue then a black wreck of clouds is seen to fly in broken shatters through the frighted sky but if fleet eurus scour the vaulted plain then all the stars propitious shine again like myras face appears the vivid scene and like her mind free open and serene ode to winter by a gentleman of cambridge from mountains of eternal snow and zemblas dreary plains where the bleak winds for ever blow and frost for ever reigns lo winter comes in fogs arrayed with ice and spangled dews to dews and fogs and storms be paid the tribute of the muse each flowery carpet nature spread is vanished from the eye wherever unhappy lovers tread no philomel is nigh for well i ween her plaintive note can soothing ease impart the little warblings of her throat relieve the wounded heart no blushing rose unfolds its bloom no tender lillies blow to scent the air with rich perfume or grace lucindas brow the indulgent father who protects the wretched and the poor with the same gracious care directs the sparrow to our door dark scowling tempests rend the skies and clouds obscure the day his genial warmth the sun denies and sheds a fainter ray yet blame we not the troubled air or seek defects to find for power omnipotent is there and walks upon the wind hail every pair whom love unites in wedlocks pleasing ties that endless source of pure delights that blessing to the wise though yon pale orb no warmth bestows and storms united meet the flame of love and friendship glows with unextinguishd heat to winter by mr woty what though thou come in sable mantle clad yet winter art thou welcome to my eye thee here i hail though terrors round thee wait and winds tempestuous howl along the sky but shall i then so soon forget the days when ceres led me through her wheaten mines when autumn plucked me with his tawny hand empurpled clusters from ambrosial vines so soon forget when up the yielding pole i saw ascend the silverbearded hop when summer waving high her crown of hay poured over the mead her odoriferous crop i must forget them  and thee too o spring though many a chaplet thou have weaved for me for now prepared to quit the enchanting scenes cold weeping winter i come all to thee hail to thy rolling clouds and rapid storms though they deform fair natures lovely face hail to thy winds that sweep along the earth though trees they root up from their solid base how sicklied over is the face of things where is the spicekiss of the southern gale where the wild rose that smiled upon the thorn the mountain flower and lilly of the vale how gloomy it is to cast the eye around and view the trees disrobed of every leaf the velvet path grown rough with clotting showers and every field deprived of every sheaf how far more gloomy over the rainbeat heath alone to travel in the dead of night no twinkling star to gild the arch of heaven no moon to lend her temporary light to see the lightning spread its ample sheet discern the wild waste through its liquid fire to hear the thunder rend the troubled air as time itself and nature would expire and yet o winter has thy poet seen thy face as smooth and placid as the spring has felt with comfort felt the beam of heaven and heard thy valleys and thy woodlands ring what time the sun with burnished locks arose the long lost charms of nature to renew when pearls of ice bedecked the grassy turf and treetops floated in the silver dew father of heaven and earth this change is thine by thee the seasons in gradation roll thou great omniscient ruler of the world thou alpha and omega of the whole here humbly bow we down our heads to thee it is ours the voice of gratitude to raise thine to diffuse thy blessings over the land thine to receive the incense of our praise pure if it rises from the conscious heart with thee for ever does the symbol live though small for all thy love is mans return thou askst no more than he has power to give on the fifth of december being the birthday of a beautiful young lady hail eldest of the monthly train sire of the winter drear december in whose iron reign expires the checkered year hush all the blustering blasts that blow and proudly plumed in silver snow smile gladly on this blessed of days the liveried clouds shall on thee wait and phoebus shine in all his state with more than summer rays though jocund june may justly boast long days and happy hours though august be pomonas host and may be crowned with flowers tell june his fire and crimson dies by harriots blush and harriots eyes eclipsed and vanquished fade away tell august thou can let him see a richer riper fruit than he a sweeter flower than may death a poem by the late charles emily esquire the festive roar of laughter the warm glow of briskeyed joy and friendships genial bowl wits seasoned converse and the liberal flow of unsuspicious youth profuse of soul delight

wheeling glide their feathery sail and those that creep and those that statelier tread that roam over forest hill or browsed dale the victims each of ruthless fate must fall even gods own image man

than tug with sweating toil the slavish oar of unredeemd affliction and sustain the feverous rage of fierce diseases sore unnumberd that in sympathetic chain hang ever through the sick circumfluous air all from the drizzly verge of yonder stargirt sphere thick in the manybeaten road of life a thousand maladies are posted round with wretched man to wage eternal strife unseen like ambushd indians

the shunned hag unsightly that ordained on europes sons to wreak the faithless sword of cortez with the blood of millions stained over dogeyed lust the torturing scourge abhorred shakes threatening since the while she winged her flight from amazons broad wave and andes snowclad height where the wan daughter of the yellow year the chattering ague chill the writhing stone and he of ghastly feature

fraught and smouldering fires he the dread delegate of wrath divine ever while that stood over taios hundred spires vindictive thrice he waved the earthshaking wand powerful as that the son of amron bore and thrice he raised and thrice he checked his hand he struck the rocking ground with thunderous roar yawnd here from street to street hurries and there now runs now stops then shrieks and scours

famine there and drunk with blood stern war and the loathed monster whom of yore the slimy naiad of the memphian flood engendering to the brighthaird phoebus bore foul pestilence that on the wide

ravenous grave thrice happy who the blameless road along of honest praise has reached the vale of death around him like ministrant cherubs throng his better actions to the parting breath singing their blessed requiems he the while gently reposing on some friendly breast breaths out his benizons then with a smile of soft complacence lays him down to rest calm as the slumbering infant from the goal free and unbounded flies the disembodied soul whether some delegated charge below some muchloved friend its hovering care may claim whether it homeward soars again to know that long forgotten country whence it came conjecture ever the misfeaturd child of lettered arrogance delights to run through speculations puzzling mazes wild and all to end at last where it begun fain would we trace with reasons erring clue the darksome paths of destiny aright in vain the task were easier to pursue the trackless wheeling of the swallows flight from mortal ken himself the almighty shrouds paviliond in thick night and circumambient clouds the day of judgment a cambridge prize poem in mdcclvii by r glynn md thy justice heavenly king and that great day when virtue long abandoned and forlorn shall raise her pensive head and vice that erst ranged unreprovd and free shall sink appalled i sing adventurous  but what eye can pierce the vast immeasurable realms of space over which messiah drives his flaming car to that bright region where enthroned he sits firstborn of heaven to judge assembled worlds clothed in celestial radiance can the muse her feeble wing all damp with earthly dew soar to that bright empyreal where around myriads of angels gods perpetual choir hymn hallelujahs and in concert loud chant songs of triumph to their makers praise  yet will i strive to sing albeit unused to tread poetic soil what though the wiles of fancy me enchanted never could lure to rove over fairy lands to swim the streams that through her valleys weave their mazy way or climb her mountain tops yet will i raise my feeble voice to tell what harmony sweet as the music of the rolling spheres attunes the moral world that virtue still may hope her promised crown that vice may dread vengeance though late that reasoning pride may own just though unsearchable the ways of heaven skeptic whoever thou art who say the soul that particle divine which gods own breath inspired into the mortal mass shall rest annihilate till duration has unrolld her neverending line tell if thou know why every nation every clime though all in laws in rites in manners disagree with one content expect another world where wickedness shall weep why paynim bards fabled elysian plains tartarean lakes styx and cocytos tell why halis sons have feigned a paradise of mirth and love banquets and blooming nymphs or rather tell why on the brink of orellanas stream where never science reared her sacred torch the untutored indian dreams of happier worlds behind the cloudtopt hill why in each breast is placed a friendly monitor that prompts informs directs encourages forbids tell why on unknown evil grief attends or joy on secret good why conscience acts with tenfold force when sickness age or pain stands tottering on the precipice of death or why such horror gnaws the guilty soul of dying sinners while the good man sleeps peaceful and calm and with a smile expires look round the world with what a partial hand the scale of bliss and misery is sustained beneath the shade of cold obscurity pale virtue lies no arm supports her head no friendly voice speaks comfort to her soul nor softeyed pity drops a melting tear but in their stead contempt and rude disdain insult the banished wanderer on the goes neglected and forlorn disease and cold and famine worst of ills her steps attend yet patient and to heavens just will resigned she never is seen to weep or heard to sigh now turn your eyes to yon sweet smelling bower where flushed with all the insolence of wealth sits pampered vice for him the arabian gale breathes forth delicious odours gallias hills for him pour nectar from the purple vine nor think for these he pays the tribute due to heaven of heaven he never names the name save when with imprecations dark and dire he points his jest obscene yet buxom health sits on his rosy cheek yet honor gilds his high exploits and downypiniond sleep sheds a soft opiate over his peaceful couch see thou this righteous father see thou this and will thou never repay shall good and ill be carried undistinguished to the land where all things are forgot  ah no the day will come when virtue from the cloud shall burst that long obscured her beams when sin shall fly back to her native hell there sink eclipsed in penal darkness where nor star shall rise nor ever sunshine pierce the impervious gloom on that great day the solemn trump shall sound that trump which once in heaven on mans revolt convokd the astonished seraphs at whose voice the unpeopled graves shall pour forth all their dead then shall the assembled nations of the earth from every quarter at the judgment seat unite egyptians babylonians greeks parthians and they who dwelt on tybers banks names famed of old or who of later age chinese and russian mexican and turk tenant the wide terrene and they who pitch their tents on nigers banks or where the sun pours on golcondas spires his early light drink ganges sacred stream at once shall rise whom distant ages to each others sight had long denied before the throne shall kneel some great progenitor while at his side stands his descendant through a thousand lines whatever their nation and whatever their rank heroes and patriarchs slaves and sceptred kings with equal eye the god of all shall see and judge with equal love what though the great with costly pomp and aromatic sweets embalmed his poor remains or through the dome a thousand tapers shed their gloomy light while solemn organs to his parting soul chanted slow orisons say by what mark do thou discern him from that lowly swain whose mouldering bones beneath the thornbound turf long lay neglected  all at once shall rise but not to equal glory for alas with howlings dire and execrations loud some wail their fatal birth  first among these behold the mighty murderers of mankind they who in sport whole kingdoms slew or they who to the tottering pinnacle of power waded through seas of blood how will they curse the madness of ambition how lament their dearbought laurels when the widowed wife and childless mother at the judgment seat plead trumpettongud against them  here are they who sunk an aged father to the grave or with unkindness hard and cold disdain slighted a brothers sufferings  here are they whom fraud and skilful treachery long secured who from the infant virgin tore her dower and eat the orphans bread  who spent their stores in selfish luxury or over their gold prostrate and pale adored the useless heap  here too who stained the chaste connubial bed  who mixed the poisonous bowl  or broke the ties of hospitable friendship  and the wretch whose listless soul sick with the cares of life unsummond to the presence of his god rushed in with insult rude how would they joy once more to visit earth and though oppressed with all that pain or famine can inflict pant up the hill of life vain wish the judge pronounces doom eternal on their heads perpetual punishment seek not to know what punishment for that the almighty will has hid from mortal eyes and shall vain man with curious search refined presume to pry into thy secrets father no let him with humble patience all thy works adore and walk in all thy paths so shall his meed be great in heaven so happily shall he scape the immortal worm and neverceasing fire but who are they who bound in tenfold chains stand horribly aghast this is that crew who strove to pull jehovah from his throne and in the place of heavens eternal king set up the phantom chance for them in vain alternate seasons cheered the rolling year in vain the sun over herb tree fruit and flower shed genial influence mild and the pale moon repaired her waning orb  next these is placed the vile blasphemer he whose impious wit profaned the sacred mysteries of faith and against the impenetrable walls of heaven planted his feeble battery  by these stands the archapostate he with many a wile exhorts them still to foul revolt alas no hope have they from black despair no ray shines through the gloom to cheer their sinking souls in agonies of grief they curse the hour when first they left religions onward way these on the left are ranged but on the right a chosen band appears who fought beneath the banner of jehovah and defied satans united legions some unmoved at the grim tyrants frown over barbarous climes diffused the gospels light some long immured sad servitude in chains and dungeons pined or racked with all the agonies of pain breathed out their faithful lives thrice happy they whom heaven elected to that glorious strife  here are they placed whose kind munificence made heavenborn science raise her drooping head and on the labors of a future race entailed their just reward  thou amongst these good the gentleman who by will left an annual premium to the author of the best poem on some divine subject who must be ma of cambridge seaton whose welljudgd benevolence fostering fair genius bad the poets hand bring annual offerings to his makers shrine shall find the generous care was not in vain  here is that favorite band whom mercy mild gods best loved attribute adorned whose gate stood ever open to the strangers call who fed the hungry to the thirsty lip reached out the friendly cup whose care benign from the rude blast secured the pilgrims side who heard the widows tender tale and shook the galling shackle from the prisoners feet who each endearing tie each office knew of meekeyed heavendescended charity  o charity thou nymph divinely fair sweeter than those whom ancient poets bound in amitys indissoluble chain the graces how shall i essay to paint thy charms celestial maid and in rude verse blazon those deeds thy self did never reveal for thee nor rankling envy can infect nor rage transport nor high oerweening pride puff up with vain conceit never did thou smile to see the sinner as a verdant tree spread his luxuriant branches over the stream while like some blasted trunk the righteous fall prostrate forlorn  when prophecies shall fail when tongues shall cease when knowledge is no more and this great day is come thou by the throne shall sit triumphant  thither lovely maid bear me oh bear me on thy soaring wing and through the adamantine gates of heaven conduct my steps safe from the fiery gulf and dark abyss where sin and satan reign but can the muse her numbers all too weak tell how that restless element of fire shall wage with seas and earth intestine war and deluge all creation whether so some think the comet as through fields of air lawless he wanders shall rush headlong on thwarting the ecliptic where the unconscious earth rolls in her wonted course whether the sun with force centripetal into his orb attract her long reluctant or the caves those dread volcanos where engendering lie sulphurous minerals from their dark abyss pour streams of liquid fire while from above as erst on sodom heavens avenging hand rains fierce combustion  where are now the works of art the toil of ages where are now the imperial cities sepulchers and domes trophies and pillars  where is egypts boast those lofty pyramids which high in air reared their aspiring heads to distant times of memphian pride a lasting monument  tell me where athens raised her towers  where thebes opened her hundred portals  tell me where stood seagirt albion  where imperial rome propt by seven hills sat like a sceptred queen and awed the tributary world to peace  show me the rampart which over many a hill through many a valley stretched its wide extent raised by that mighty monarch to repel the roving tartar when with insult rude against pekins towers he bent the unerring bow but what is mimic art even natures works seas meadows pastures the meandring streams and everlasting hills shall be no more no more shall teneriff cloudpiercing height oerhang the atlantic surge  nor that famed cliff through which the persian steered with many a sail throw to the lemnian isle its evening shade over half the wide aegaean  where are now the alps that confined with unnumberd realms and from the black sea to the ocean stream stretched their extended arms  where is ararat that hill on which the faithful patriarchs ark which seven long months had voyagd over its top first rested when the earth with all her sons as now by streaming cataracts of fire was whelmed by mighty waters  all at once are vanished and dissolved no trace remains no mark of vain distinction heaven itself that azure vault with all those radiant orbs sinks in the universal ruin lost  no more shall planets round their central sun move in harmonious dance no more the moon hang out her silver lamp and those fixed stars spangling the golden canopy of night which often the tuscan with his optic glass called from their wondrous height to read their names and magnitude some winged minister shall quench and surest sign that all on earth is lost shall rend from heaven the mystic bow such is that awful that tremendous day whose coming who shall tell for as a thief unheard unseen it steals with silent pace through nights dark gloom  perhaps as here i sit and rudely carol these incondite lays soon shall the hand be checked and dumb the mouth that lisps the faultering strain  o may it never intrude unwelcome on an illspent hour but find me wrapped in meditations high hymning my great creator power supreme  o everlasting king to thee i kneel  to thee i lift my voice with fervent heat  melt all ye elements and thou high heaven  shrink like a shrivelled scroll  but think o lord  think on the best the noblest of thy works  think on thine own bright image think on him  who died to save us from thy righteous wrath  and midst the wreck of worlds remember man to fame an ode written in the year

the author were by an unlucky accident omitted in our last number  in yonder grove a druid lies where slowly winds the stealing wave the years best sweets shall duteous rise to deck its poets sylvan grave in yon deep bed of whispering reeds his airy harp the harp of aeolus of which see a description in the castle of indolence shall now be laid that he whose heart in sorrow bleeds may love through life the soothing shade then maids and youths shall linger here and while its sounds at distance swell shall sadly seem in pitys ear to hear the woodland pilgrims knell remembrance often shall haunt the shore when thames in summerwreaths is dressed and often suspend the dashing oar to bid his gentle spirit rest and often as ease and health retire to breezy lawn or forest deep the friend shall view yon whitening richmond church spire and mid the varied landscape weep but thou who ownst that earthy bed ah what will every dirge avail or tears which love and pity shed that mourn beneath the gliding sail yet lives there one whose heedless eye shall scorn thy pale shrine glimmering near with him sweet bard may fancy die and joy desert the blooming year but thou lorn stream whose sullen tide no sedgecrownd sisters now attend now waft me from the green hills side whose cold turf hides the buried friend and see the fairy valleys fade dun night has veiled the solemn view  yet once again dear parted shade meek natures child again adieu the genial meads assigned to bless thy life shall mourn thy early doom their hinds and shepherdgirls shall dress with simple hands thy rural tomb long long thy stone and pointed clay shall melt the musing britons eyes o vales and wild woods shall he say in yonder grave your druid lies the following character of mr thomson in his poem called the castle of indolence is said to be written by lord l   a bard there dwelt more fat than bard beseems who void of envy guile and lust of gain on virtue still and natures pleasing themes poured forth his unpremeditated strain the world forsaking with a calm disdain here laughed he careless in his easy seat here quaffd encircled with the joyous train oftmoralizing sage his ditty sweet he loathed much to write ne cared to repeat some account of the life and writings of mr william collins mr william collins was born at chichester in sussex in the year      in which city his father was a reputable tradesman he was admitted a scholar of winchester college feb         where he spent seven years under the care of the learned dr burton in the year    0 in consideration of his merit he was placed first in the list of those scholars who are elected from winchester college to new college in oxford but no vacancy happening at the latter he was entered the same year a commoner of queens college ox and july         was elected a demi or scholar of magdalen college in the same university at school he began to study poetry and criticism particularly the latter the following epigram made by him while at winchesterschool discovers a genius and turn of expression very rarely to be met with in juvenile compositions  to miss aurelia c  r on her weeping at her sisters wedding cease fair aurelia cease to mourn lament not hannahs happy state you may be happy in your turn and seize the treasure you regret with love united hymen stands and softly whispers to your charms  meet but your lover in my bands  you will find your sister in his arms his latin exercises were never so much admired as his english  at oxford he wrote the epistle to sir thomas hanmer and oriental eclogues which were first published in      under the title of persian eclogues about the year      he left oxford having taken the degree of bachelor of arts weary of the confinement and uniformity of an academical life fondly imagining that a man of parts was sure of making his fortune in london and struck with the name of author and poet without consulting his friends he immediately removed to town and rashly resolved to live by his pen without undertaking the drudgery of any profession here he soon dissipated his small fortune to compensate for which he projected the history of the revival of learning in italy under the pontificates of julius ii and leo x his subscription for this work not answering his expectations he engaged with a bookseller to translate aristotles poetics and to illustrate it with a large and regular comment this scheme also being laid aside he turned his thoughts to dramatic poetry and being intimately acquainted with the manager resolved to write a tragedy which however he never executed in the year      he published his odes and shortly after went abroad to our army in flanders to attend his uncle colonel martin who dying soon after his arrival left him a considerable fortune which however he did not live long to enjoy for he fell into a nervous disorder which continued with but short intervals till his death which happened in      and with which disorder his head and intellects were at times affected  for a man of such an elevated genius mr collins has wrote but little his time was chiefly taken up in laying extensive projects and vast designs which he never even begun to put in execution  we have been favored with the following account of mr collins by a gentleman deservedly eminent in the republic of letters who knew him intimately well  mr collins was a man of extensive literature and of vigorous faculties he was acquainted not only with the learned tongues but with the italian french and spanish languages he had employed his mind chiefly upon works of fiction and subjects of fancy and by indulging some peculiar habits of thought was eminently delighted with those flights of imagination which pass the bounds of nature and to which the mind is reconciled only by a passive acquiescence in popular traditions he loved fairies genii giants and monsters he delighted to rove through the meanders of enchantment to gaze on the magnificence of golden palaces to repose by the waterfals of elysian gardens this was however the character rather of his inclination than his genius the grandeur of wildness and the novelty of extravagance were always desired by him but were not always attained but diligence is never wholly lost if his efforts sometimes caused harshness and obscurity they likewise produced in happier moments sublimity and splendor this idea which he had formed of excellence led him to oriental fictions and allegorical imagery and perhaps while he was intent upon description he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment his poems are the productions of a mind not deficient in fire nor unfurnished with knowledge either of books or life but somewhat obstructed in its progress by deviation in quest of mistaken beauties  his morals were pure and his opinions pious in a long continuance of poverty and long habits of dissipation it cannot be expected that any character should be exactly uniform there is a degree of want by which the freedom of agency is almost destroyed and long association with fortuitous companions will at last relax the strictness of truth and abate the fervor of sincerity that this man wise and virtuous as he was passed always unentangled through the snares of life it would be prejudice and temerity to affirm but it may be said that at least he preserved the source of action unpolluted that his principles were never shaken that his distinctions of right and wrong were never confounded and that his faults had nothing of malignity or design but proceeded from some unexpected pressure or casual temptation  the latter part of his life cannot be remembered but with pity and sadness he languished some years under that depression of mind which enchains the faculties without destroying them and leaves reason the knowledge of right without the power of pursuing it these clouds which he found gathering on his intellects he endeavored to disperse by travel and passed into france but found himself constrained to yield to his malady and returned he was for some time confined in a house of lunatics and afterward retired to the care of his sister in colchester where death at last came to his relief  after his return from france the writer of this character paid him a visit at islington where he was waiting for his sister whom he had directed to meet him there was then nothing of disorder discernable in his mind by any but himself but he had then withdrawn from study and traveled with no other book than an english testament such as children carry to the school when his friend took it into his hand out of curiosity to see what companion a man of letters had chosen i have but one book says collins but that is the best  general index the numerals refer to the volumes
