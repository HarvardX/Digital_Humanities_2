hammond now delia breathes in woods the fragrant air dull are the hearts that still in town remain venus herself attends on delia there and cupid sports amid the sylvan train oh with what joy my delia to behold i would press the spade or wield the weighty prong guide the slow ploughshare through the stubborn mold and patient goad the loitering ox along the scorching heats i will carelessly despise nor heed the blisters on my tender hand the great apollo wore the same disguise like me subdued to loves supreme command no healing herbs could sooth their matters pain the art of physic lost and useless lay to peneus stream and tempes shady plain he drove his herds beneath the noontide ray often with a bleating lamb in either arm his blushing the goddess diana sister saw him pace along often would his voice the silent valley charm till lowing oxen broke the tender song where are his triumphs where his warlike toil where by his darts the crested python slain where are his delphi his delightful isle the god himself is grown a cottage swain o ceres in your golden fields no more with harvests cheerful pomp my fair detain  think what for lost the daughter of ceres taken from her by pluto proserpina you bore and in a mothers anguish feel my pain our wiser fathers left the fields unsown their food was acorns love their sole employ they met they liked they stayed but till alone and in each valley snatched the honest joy no wakeful guard no doors to stop desire thrice happy times  but oh i fondly rave lead me to delia  all her eyes inspire i will do  i will plough or dig as delias slave the mulberry garden when in full pride autumnal fields appear and ripened plenty loads the smiling year with grassy honors clothes the verdant plain and golden harvests wave their bending grain lead me where trees in lengthening ranks displayed please with their fruit and solace with their shade where dewy mulberries their refreshment lend and through the grove with burdened boughs extend the spreading leaves with salutary food sustain the tender silkworms toiling brood whose labored webs the shady verdure crown and dress their surface with a shining down such on acanthus woolly leaves are bred and where their silken groves the seres spread lo on the trees that bend with clustering weight the juicy berries swell in purple state not apples that alcinous gardens bear the melting plumb nor famed crustumian pear nor fruits of golden or transparent rind in relish equal this delicious kind the careful dames a plenteous wine produce and brew with mingling spice the pleasing juice the rhetic grape not purer nectar yields nor the proud growth of rich falernian fields let the cool draught my thirsty veins supply when sultry sirius taints the fervid sky thy gifts o bacchus more intemperate prove and to rash heats the unruly passions move by wine enflamed young ammon basely spilt his friends warm gore an unexampled guilt provoked by wine the centaurs heated train presumed with blood the bridal board to stain wine armed with rage the mad ciconian crew whose hands profane the sacred thracian flew anacreons fate its mischiefs shall enroll and direful circes fascinating bowl with softer draughts this temperate liquor ply nor fear a threatening from its sanguine die a borrowed tincture for with native white the pendant berries first allured the sight till hapless pyramus by love betrayed found the torn mantle of the expected maid mistaken omen and with fatal haste on the drawn steel his blooming body cast the snowy fruit that there untainted grew washed with his gore forsook their silver hue their swelling pores receive a deepening stain and still the lovers memory they retain for as the circling year with fruit returns the pitying tree in graceful sable mourns ye fair who often beneath its verdure placed in sultry hours this cooling berry taste when with warm lips you press the purple dew and on your snowy hands the print you view to let your generous pity more appear dilute the harmless crimson with a tear the month of august this poem was wrote by mrs leapor see her character in the poet call for july p    a pastoral sylvanus a courtier phillis a country maid sylvanus hail phillis brighter than a morning sky joy of my heart and darling of my eye see the kind year her grateful tribute yields and roundfacd plenty triumphs over the fields but to yon gardens let me lead thy charms where the curled vine extends her willing arms whose purple clusters lure the longing eye and the ripe cherries show their scarlet dye  phillis not all the sights your boasted gardens yield are half so lovely as my fathers field where large increase has blessed the fruitful plain and we with joy behold the swelling grain whose ears luxuriant to the earth reclined wave nod and tremble to the whisking wind  sylvanus but see to emulate those cheeks of thine on yon fair tree the blushing nectarines shine beneath their leaves the ruddy peaches glow and the plump figs compose a gallant show with gaudy plums see yonder boughs recline and ruddy pears in yon espalier twine there humble dwarfs in pleasing order stand whose golden product seems to court thy hand  phillis in vain you tempt me while our orchard bears longkeeping russets lovely catherine pears permains and codlins wheaten plums enough and the black damsons load the bending bough no pruningknives our fertile branches teaze while yours must grow but as their masters please the grateful trees our mercy well repay and rain us bushels at the rising day  sylvanus fair are my gardens yet you slight them all then let us haste to yon majestic hall where the glad roofs shall to thy voice resound thy voice more sweet than musics melting sound orions beam infests the sultry sky and scorching fevers through the welkin fly but art shall teach us to evade his ray and the forced fountains near the windows play there choice perfumes shall give a pleasing gale and orangeflowers their odorous breath exhale while on the walls the wellwrought paintings glow and dazzling carpets deck the floors below o tell me thou whose careless beauties charm are not these fairer than a threshers barn  phillis believe me i can find no charms at all in your fine carpets and your painted hall it is true our parlour has an earthen floor the sides of plaster and of elm the door yet the rubbed chest and table sweetly shines and the spread mint along the window climbs an aged laurel keeps away the sun and two cool streams across the garden run  sylvanus can feasts or music win my lovely maid in both those pleasures be her taste obeyed the ransacked earth shall all its dainties send till with its load her plenteous table bend then to the roofs the swelling notes shall rise pierce the glad air and gain upon the skies while ease and rapture spreads itself around and distant hills roll back the charming sound  phillis not this will lure me for i would have you know this night to feast with corydon i go to night his reapers bring the gathered grain home to his barns and leave the naked plain then beef and coleworts beans and bacon too and the plumpudding of delicious hue sweetspiced cake and applepies good store deck the brown board and who can wish for more his flute and tabor too amyntor brings and while he plays soft amaryllis sings then strive no more to win a simple maid from her loved cottage and her silent shade let phillis never ah never let her rove from her first virtue and her humble grove go seek some nymph that equals your degree and leave content and corydon for me  virtue and fame to the countess of egremont by lord l  n virtue and fame the other day happened to cross each others way said virtue hark ye madam fame  your ladyship is much to

lord a thousand thanks to your lordship for your addition to my verses if you can write such extempore it is well for other poets that you choose to be a lord chancellor rather than a laureat they

flight or the orient rays of light bid dan phoebus not to shine bid the planets not incline it is as vain below above to impede the course of love salamanders live in fire eagles to the skies aspire diamonds in their quarries lie rivers do the sea supply thus appears below above a propensity to love metals grow within the mine luscious grapes upon the vine still the needle marks the pole parts are equal to the whole it is a truth as clear that love quickens all below above man is born to live and die snakes to creep and birds to fly fishes in the waters swim doves are mild and lions grim nature thus below above pushes all things on to love does the cedar love the mountain or the thirsty deer the fountain does the shepherd love his crook or the willow court the brook thus by nature all

nature is averse to love as the wencher loves a lass as the toper loves his glass as the friar loves his cowl or the miller loves the toll so do all below above fly precipitate to love when young
