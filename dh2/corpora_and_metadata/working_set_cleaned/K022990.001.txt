letters of mr wycherley and mr pope from the year   0  to    0 the authors age then sixteen mr pope to mr wycherley december      0  it was certainly a great satisfaction to me to see and converse with a man whom in his writings i had so long known with pleasure but it was a high addition to it to hear you at our very first meeting doing justice to your dead friend mr dryden i was not so happy as to know him virgilium tantum vidi  had i been born early enough i must have known and loved him for i have been assured not only by your self but by mr congreve and sir william trumbul that his personal qualities were as amiable as his poetical notwithstanding the many libelous misrepresentations of them against which the former of these gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him he since did so in his dedication to the duke of newcastle prefixed to tonsons duodecimo edition of drydens plays       i suppose those injuries were begun by the violence of party but it is no doubt they were continued by envy at his success and fame and those scriblers who attacked him in his latter times were only like gnats in a summers evening which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glorious season for his fire like the suns shined clearest toward its setting  you must not therefore imagine that when you told me of my own performances that they were above those critics i was so vain as to believe it and yet i may not be so humble as to think my self quite below their notice for critics as they are birds of prey have ever a natural inclination to carrion and though such poor writers as i are but beggars however no beggar is so poor but he can keep a cur and no author is so beggarly but he can keep a critic so i am far from thinking the attacks of such people either any honor or dishonor even to me much less to mr dryden i think with you that whatever lesser wits have risen since his death are but like stars appearing when the sun is set that twinkle only in his absence and with the rays they have borrowed from him our wit as you call it is but reflection or imitation therefore scarce to be called ours true wit i believe may be defined a justness of thought and a facility of expression or in the midwives phrase a perfect conception with an easy delivery however this is far from a complete definition pray help me to a better as i doubt not you can  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope jan      0   i have been so busy of late in correcting and transcribing some of my madrigals for a great man or two who desired to see them that i have with your pardon omitted to return you an answer to your most ingenious letter so scriblers to the public like bankers to the public are profuse in their voluntary loans to it whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular as more just debts to their best and nearest friends however i hope you who have as much good nature as good sense since they generally are companions will have patience with a debtor who you think has an inclination to pay you his obligations if he had wherewithal ready about him and in the mean time should consider when you have obliged me beyond my present power of returning the favor that a debtor may be an honest man if he but intends to be just when he is able though late but i should be less just to you the more i thought i could make a return to so much profuseness of wit and humanity together which though they seldom accompany each other in other men are in you so equally met i know not in which you most abound but so much for my opinion of you which is that your wit and ingenuity is equaled by nothing but your judgment or modesty which though it be to please my self i must no more offend than i can do either right  therefore i will say no more now of them than that your good wit never forfeited your good judgment but in your partility to me and mine so that if it were possible for a hardened scribbler to be vainer than he is what you write of me would make me more conceited than what i scribble my self yet i must confess i ought to be more humbled by your praise than exalted which commends my little sense with so much more of yours that i am disparaged and disheartened by your commendations who give me an example of your wit in the first part of your letter and a definition of it in the last to make writing well that is like you more difficult to me than ever it was before thus the more great and just your example and definition of wit are the less i am capable to follow them then the best way of showing my judgment after having seen how you write is to leave off writing and the best way to show my friendship to you is to put an end to your trouble and to conclude  your etc  mr popes answer march      0  when i write to you i foresee a long letter and ought to beg your patience beforehand for if it proves the longest it will be of course the worst i have troubled you with yet to express my gratitude at large for your obliging letter is not more my duty than my interest as some people will abundantly thank you for one piece of kindness to put you in mind of bestowing another the more favorable you are to me the more distinctly i see my faults spots and blemishes you know are never so plainly discovered as in the brightest sunshine thus i am mortified by those commendations which were designed to encourage me for praise to a young wit is like rain to a tender flower if it be moderately bestowed it chears and revives but if too lavishly overcharges and depresses him most men in years as they are generally discouragers of youth are like old trees that being past bearing themselves will suffer no young plants to flourish beneath them but as if it were not enough to have outdone all your coaevals in wit you will excel them in good nature too as for my his pastorals written at    years of age green essays if you find any pleasure in em it must be such as a man naturally takes in observing the first shoots and buddings of a tree which he has raised himself and it is impossible they should be esteemed any otherwise than as we value fruits for being early which nevertheless are the most insipid and the worst of the year in a word i must blame you for treating me with so much compliment which is at best but the smoke of friendship i neither write nor converse with you to gain your praise but your affection be so much my friend as to appear my enemy and tell me my faults if not as a young man at least as an unexperienced writer  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope march      0  your letter of the twentyfifth of march i have received which was more welcome to me than any thing could be out of the country though it were ones rent due that day and i can find no fault with it but that it charges me with want of sincerity or justice for giving you your due who should not let your modesty be so unjust to your merit as to reject what is due to it and call that compliment which is so short of your desert that it is rather degrading than exalting you but if compliment be the smoke only of friendship as you say however you must allow there is no smoke but there is some fire and as the sacrifice of incense offered to the gods would not have been half so sweet to others if it had not been for its smoke so friendship like love cannot be without some incense to perfume the name it would praise and immortalize but since you say you do not write to me to gain my praise but my affection pray how is it possible to have the one without the other we must admire before we love you affirm you would have me so much your friend as to appear your enemy and find out your faults rather than your perfections but my friend that would be so hard to do that i who love no difficulties cannot be persuaded to it besides the vanity of a scribbler is such that he will never part with his own judgment to gratify anothers especially when he must take pains to do it and though i am proud to be of your opinion when you talk of any thing or man but your self i cannot suffer you to murder your fame with your own hand without opposing you especially when you say your last letter is the worst since the longest you have favored me with which i therefore think the best as the longest life if a good one is the best as it yields the more variety and is more exemplary as a cheerful summers day though longer than a dull one in the winter is less tedious and more entertaining therefore let but your friendship be like your letter as lasting as it is agreeable and it can never be tedious but more acceptable and obliging to  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope april     0  i have received yours of the fifth wherein your modesty refuses the just praise i give you by which you lay claim to more as a bishop gains his bishopric by saying he will not episcopate but i must confess whilst i displease you by commending you i please my self just as incense is sweeter to the offerer than the deity to whom it is offered by his being so much above it for indeed every man partakes of the praise he gives when it is so justly given  as to my enquiry after your intrigues with the muses you may allow me to make it since no old man can give so young so great and able a favorite of theirs jealousy i am in my enquiry like old sir bernard gascoign who used to say that when he was grown too old to have his visits admitted alone by the ladies he always took along with him a young man to ensure his welcome to them who had he come alone had been rejected only because his visits were not scandalous to them so i am like an old rook who is ruined by gaming forced to live on the good fortune of the pushing young men whose fancies are so vigorous that they ensure their success in their adventures with the muses by their strength of imagination   your papers are safe in my custody you may be sure from any ones theft but my own for it is as dangerous to trust a scribbler with your wit as a gamester with the custody of your money  if you happen to come to town you will make it more difficult for me to leave it who am dear mr pope  your etc  mr popes answer april  0   0  i cannot contend with you you must give me leave at once to wave all your compliments and to collect only this in general from em that your design is to encourage me but i separate from all the rest that paragraph or two in which you make me so warm an offer of your friendship were i possessed of that it would put an end to all those speeches with which you now make me blush and change them to wholesome advices and free sentiments which might make me wiser and happier i know it is the general opinion that friendship is best contracted betwixt persons of equal age but i have so much interest to be of another mind that you must pardon me if i cannot forbear telling you a few notions of mine in opposition to that opinion  in the first place it is observable that the love we bear to our friends is generally caused by our finding the same dispositions in them which we feel in our selves this is but selflove at the bottom whereas the affection betwixt people of different ages cannot well be such the inclinations of such being commonly various the friendship of two young men is often occasioned by love of pleasure or voluptuousness each being desirous for his own sake of one to assist or encourage him in the courses he pursues as that of two old men is frequently on the score of some profit lucre or design upon others now as a young man who is less acquainted with the ways of the world has in all probability less of interest and an old man who may be weary of himself less of selflove so the friendship between them is the more likely to be true and unmixed with too much selfregard one may add to this that such a friendship is of greater use and advantage to both for the old man will grow more gay and agreeable to please the young one and the young man more discreet and prudent by the help of the old one so it may prove a cure of those epidemical diseases of age and youth sourness and madness i hope you will not need many arguments to convince you of the possibility of this one alone abundantly satisfies me and convinces to the very heart which is that i am etc mr wycherley was at this time about seventy years old mr pope under seventeen   mr pope to mr wycherley june      0  i should believe my self happy in your good opinion but that you treat me so much in a style of compliment it has been observed of women that they are more subject in their youth to be touched with vanity than men on account of their being generally treated this way but the weakest women are not more so than that weak class of men who are thought to pique themselves upon their wit the world is never wanting when a coxcomb is accomplishing himself to help to give him the finishing stroke  every man is apt to think his neighbor overstockd with vanity yet i cannot but fancy there are certain times when most people are in a disposition of being informed and it is incredible what a vast good a little truth might do spoken in such seasons a very small alms will do a great kindness to people in extreme necessity  i could name an acquaintance of yours who would at this time think himself more obliged to you for the information of his faults than the confirmation of his follies if you would make those the subject of a letter it might be as long as i could wish your letters always were  i do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty as you are pleased to say in writing to me since you have always chosen the task of commending me take but the other way and i dare engage you will find none at all  as for my verses which you praise so much i may truly say they had never been the cause of any vanity in me except what they gave me when they first occasioned my acquaintance with you but i have several times since been in danger of this vice as often i mean as i received any letters from you  it is certain the greatest magnifying glasses in the world are a mans own eyes when they look upon his own person yet even in those i cannot fancy my self so extremely like alexander the great as you would persuade me if i must be like him it is you will make me so by complimenting me into a better opinion of my self than i deserve they made him think he was the son of jupiter and you assure me i am a man of parts but is this all you can say to my honor you said ten times as much before when you called me your friend after having made me believe i possessed a share in your affection to treat me with compliments and sweet sayings is like the proceeding with poor sancho panca they had persuaded him that he enjoyed a great dominion and then gave him nothing to subsist upon but wafers and marmalade in our days the greatest obligation you can lay upon a wit is to make a fool of him for as when madmen are found incurable wise men give them their way and please them as well as they can so when those incorrigible things poets are once irrecoverably bemusd the best way both to quiet them and secure your selves from the effects of their frenzy is to feed their vanity which indeed for the most part is all that is fed in a poet  you may believe me i could be heartily glad that all you say were as true applied to me as it would be to your self for several weighty reasons but for none so much as that i might be to you what you deserve whereas i can now be no more than is consistent with the small though utmost capacity of  dear sir your ever affectionate servant  mr pope to mr wycherley oct      0  i have now changed the scene from the town to the country from wills coffeehouse to windsor forest i find no other difference than this betwixt the common townwits and the downright country fools that the first are pertly in the wrong with a little more flourish and gaiety and the last neither in the right nor the wrong but confirmed in a stupid settled medium betwixt both however methinks these are most in the right who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle reign of dullness which the wits must do at last though after a great deal of noise pother and resistance ours are a sort of modest inoffensive people who neither have sense nor pretend to any but enjoy a jovial sort of dullness they are commonly known in the world by the name of honest civil gentlemen they live much as they ride at random a kind of hunting life pursuing with earnestness and hazard something not worth the catching never in the way nor out of it i cannot but prefer solitude to the company of all these for though a mans self may possibly be the worst fellow to converse with in the world yet one would think the company of a person whom we have the greatest regard to and affection for could not be very unpleasant as a man in love with a mistress desires no conversation but hers so a man in love with himself as most men are may be best pleased with his own besides if the truest and most useful knowledge be the knowledge of our selves solitude conducing most to make us look into our selves should be the most instructive state of life we see nothing more commonly than men who for the sake of the circumstantial part and mere outside of life have been half their days rambling out of their nature and ought to be sent into solitude to study themselves over again people are usually spoiled instead of being taught at their coming into the world whereas by being more conversant with obscurity without any pains they would naturally follow what they were meant for in a word if a man be a coxcomb solitude is his best school and if he be a fool it is his best sanctuary  these are good reasons for my own stay here but i wish i could give you any for your coming hither except that i earnestly invite you and yet i cannot help saying i have suffered a great deal of discontent that you do not though i so little merit that you should  i must complain of the shortness of your last those who have most wit like those who have most money are generally most sparing of either  mr wycherleys answer nov     0  yours of the   th of october i have received as i have always done yours with no little satisfaction and am proud to discover by it that you find fault with the shortness of mine which i think the best excuse for it and though they as you say who have most wit or money are most sparing of either there are some who appear poor to be thought rich and are poor which is my case i cannot but rejoice that you have undergone so much discontent for want of my company but if you have a mind to punish me for my fault which i could not help defer your coming to town and you will do it effectually but i know your charity always exceeds your revenge so that i will not despair of seeing you who in return to your inviting me to your forest invite you to my forest the town where the beasts that inhabit tame or wild of long ears or horns pursue one another either out of love or hatred you may have the pleasure to see one pack of bloodhounds pursue another herd of brutes to bring each other to their fall which is their whole sport or if you affect a less bloody chase you may see a pack of spaniels called lovers in hot pursuit of a twoleggd vixen who only flies the whole lowed pack to be singled out by one dog who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest as they are making a noise to the loss of their game in fine this is the time for all sorts of sport in the town when those of the country cease therefore leave your forest of beasts for ours of brutes called men who now in full cry packed by the court or country run down in the house of commons a deserted horned beast of the court to the satisfaction of their spectators besides more for your diversion you may see not only the two great play houses of the nation those of the lords and commons in dispute with one another but the two other play houses in high contest because the members of one house are removed up to the other as it is often done by the court for reasons of state insomuch that the lower houses i mean the play houses are going to act tragedies on one another without doors and the sovereign is put to it as it often happens in the other two houses to silence one or both to keep peace between them now i have told you all the news of the town  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope feb     0   i have received your kind letter with my paper the same which was printed in the year      in a miscellany of bern lintots and in the present edition of the posthumous works of mr wycherley to mr dryden corrected i own you have made more of it by making it less as the dutch are said to burn half the spices they bring home to inhance the price of the remainder so to be greater gainers by their loss which is indeed my case now well you have pruned my fading laurels of some superfluous sapless and dead branches to make the remainder live the longer thus like your master apollo you are at once a poet and a physician  now sir as to my impudent invitation of you to the town your good nature was the first cause of my confident request but excuse me i must i see say no more upon this subject since i find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with though you have given me some encouragement to hope our friendship though young might be without shyness or criminal modesty for a friend like a mistress though he is not to be mercenary to be true yet ought not to refuse a friends kindness because it is small or trivial i have told you i think that a spanish lady said to her poor poetical gallant that a queen if she lay with a groom would expect a mark of his kindness from him though it were but his currycomb but you and i will dispute this matter when i am so happy as to see you here and perhaps it is the only dispute in which i might hope to have the better of you  now sir to make you another excuse for my boldness in inviting you to town i designed to leave with you some more of my papers since these return so much better out of your hands than they went from mine for i intended as i told you formerly to spend a month or six weeks this summer near you in the country for you may be assured there is nothing i desire so much as an improvement of your friendship   mr wycherley to mr pope march      0   i must lay a penance upon you which is to desire you to look over that damned miscellany of madrigals of mine to pick out if possible some that may be so altered that they may yet appear in print again i hope with better success than they hitherto have done i will give you my reason for this request of mine when i see you which i am resolved shall be when i have done here and at the bath where i design to go and afterward to spend two months god willing with you at binfield or near it   mr popes answer april  0   0   by yours of the last month you desire me to select if possible some things from the printed in folio in the year   0  first volume of your miscellanies which may be altered so as to appear again i doubted your meaning in this whether it was to pick out the best of those verses as that on the idleness of business on ignorance on laziness etc to make the method and numbers exact and avoid repetitions for though upon reading em on this occasion i believe they might receive such an alteration with advantage yet they would not be changed so much but any one would know em for the same at first sight or if you mean to improve the worst pieces which are such as to render them very good would require a great addition and almost the entire new writing of them or lastly if you mean the middle sort as the songs and loveverses for these will need only to be shortened to omit repetition the words remaining very little different from what they were before pray let me know your mind in this for i am utterly at a loss yet i have tried what i could do to some of the songs vid better of nov  0   0  a and the poems on laziness and ignorance but cannot even in my own partial judgment think my alterations much to the purpose so that i must needs desire you would apply your care wholly at present to those which are yet unpublished of which there are more than enough to make a considerable volume of full as good ones nay i verily believe of better than any in vol i which i could wish you would defer at least till you have finished these that are yet unprinted  i send you a sample of some few of these namely the verses to mr waller in his old age your new ones on the duke of marlborough and two others i have done all that i thought could be of advantage to them some i have contracted as we do sunbeams to improve their energy and force some i have taken quite away as we take branches from a tree to add to the fruit others i have entirely new expressed and turned more into poetry done like one of his successors had infinitely more wit than he wanted versification for the great dealers in wit like those in trade take least pains to set off their goods while the haberdashers of small wit spare for no decorations or ornaments you have commissioned me to paint your shop and i have done my best to brush you up like your neighbors but i can no more pretend to the merit of the production than a midwife to the virtues and good qualities of the child she helps into the light  the few things i have entirely added you will excuse you may take them lawfully for your own because they are no more than sparks lighted up by your fire and you may omit them at last if you think them but squibs in your triumphs  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope feb      0   i have received yours of the   th as kind as it is ingenious for which therefore i most heartily thank you it would have been much more welcome to me had it not informed me of your want of health but you who have a mind so vigorous may well be contented with its crazy habitation since you know the old similitude says the keenness of the mind soonest wears out the body as the sharpest sword soonest destroys the scabbard so that as i say you must be satisfied with your apprehension of an uneasy life though i hope not a short one notwithstanding that generally you sound wits though weak bodies are immortal hereafter by that genius which shortens your present life to prolong that of the future but i yet hope your great vigorous and active mind will not be able to destroy your little tender and crazy carcass  now to say something to what you write concerning the present epidemick distemper of the mind and age calumny i know it is no more to be avoided at one time or another of our lives than a fever or an ague and as often those distempers attend or threaten the best constitutions from the worst air so does that malignant air of calumny soonest attack the sound and elevated in mind as storms of wind the tallest and most fruitful trees whilst the low and weak for bowing and moving to and fro are by their weakness secure from the danger and violence of the tempest but so much for stinking rumor which weakest minds are most afraid of as irish men though the nastiest of mankind are most offended at a fart  mr wycherley to mr pope nov      0  i received yours of the  th yesterday which has like the rest of your letters at once pleased and instructed me so that i assure you you can no more write too much to your absent friends than speak too much to the present this is a truth that all men own who have either seen your writings or heard your discourse enough to make others show their judgment in ceasing to write or talk especially to you or in your company however i speak or write to you not to please you but my self since i provoke your answers which whilst they humble me give me vanity though i am lessened by you even when you commend me since you commend my little sense with so much more of yours that you put me out of countenance whilst you would keep me in it so that you have found a way against the custom of great wits to show even a great deal of good nature with a great deal of good sense  i thank you for the book you promised me by which i find you would not only correct my lines but my life  as to the damned verses i entrusted you with i hope you will let them undergo your purgatory to save them from other peoples damning them since the critics who are generally the first damned in this life like the damned below never leave to bring those above them under their own circumstances i beg you to peruse my papers and select what you think best or most tolerable and look over them again for i resolve suddenly to print some of them as a hardened old gamester will in spite of all former ill usage by fortune push on an ill hand in expectation of recovering himself especially since i have such a croupier or second to stand by me as mr pope  mr pope to mr wycherley nov  0   0  mr engiefyld being upon his journey to london tells me i must write to you by him which i do not more to comply with his desire than to gratify my own though i did it so lately by the messenger you sent hither i take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair copy of the poem the original of it in blots and with figures of the references from copy to copy in mr popes hand is in the harleylibrary among other such brouillons of mr wycherleys poems corrected by him vid let ap  0   0   note a on dullness which was not then finished and which i should not care to hazard by the common post mr englefyld is ignorant of the contents and i hope your prudence will let him remain so for my sake no less than your own since if you should reveal any thing of this nature it would be no wonder reports should be raised and there are those i fear who would be ready to improve them to my disadvantage i am sorry you told the great man whom you met in the court of requests that your papers were in my hands no man alive shall ever know any such thing from me and i give you this warning besides that though your self should say i had any way assisted you i am notwithstanding resolved to deny it  the method of the copy i send you is very different from what it was and much more regular for the better help of your memory i desire you to compare it by the figures in the margin answering to the same in this letter the poem is now divided into four parts marked with the literal figures i ii iii iv the first contains the praise of dullness and shows how upon several suppositions it passes for   religion   philosophy   example   wit and   the cause of wit and the end of it the second part contains the advantages of dullness  st in business and  dly at court where the similitudes of the bias of a bowl and the weights of a clock are directly tending to illustrate those advantages of dullness though introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them which was your only objection to my adding them the third contains the happiness of dullness in all stations and shows in a great many particulars that it is so fortunate as to be esteemed some good quality or other in all sorts of people that it is thought quiet sense caution policy prudence majesty valor circumspection honesty etc the fourth part i have wholly added as a climax which sums up all the praise advantage and happiness of dullness in a few words and strengthens them all by the opposition of the disgrace disadvantage and unhappiness of wit with which it concludes this is totally omitted in the present edition some of the lines in the h m are these thus dullness the safe opiate of the mind the last kind refuge weary wit can find fit for all stations and in each content is satisfied secure and innocent no pains it takes and no offense it gives unfeard unhated undisturbed it lives etc    though the whole be as short again as at first there is not one thought omitted but what is a repetition of something in your first volume or in this very paper some thoughts are contracted where they seemed encompassed with too many words and some new expressed or added where i thought there wanted heightning as you will see particulary in the simile of the clockweights it was originally thus expressed as clocks run fastest when most lead is on we find it so in a letter of mr pope to mr wycherley dated april     0  and in a paper of verses of his to the author of a poem called successio which got out in a miscellany in      three years before mr wycherley died and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publishing any poems   and the versification throughout is i believe such as no body can be shocked at the repeated permissions you give me of dealing freely with you will i hope excuse what i have done for if i have not spared you when i thought severity would do you a kindness i have not mangled you where i thought there was no absolute need of amputation as to particulars i can satisfy you better when we meet in the mean time pray write to me when you can you cannot too often  mr wycherleys answer nov      0  you may see by my style i had the happiness and satisfaction to receive yesterday by the hands of that wagg mr englefyld your extreme kind and obliging letter of the  0th of this month which like all the rest of yours did at once mortify me and make me vain since it tells me with so much more wit sense and kindness than mine can express that my letters are always welcome to you so that even whilst your kindness invites me to write to you your wit and judgment forbids me since i may return you a letter but never an answer  now as for my owning your assistance to me in overlooking my unmusical numbers and harsher sense and correcting them both with your genius or judgment i must tell you i always own it in spite of your unpoetick modesty who would do with your friendship as your charity conceal your bounty to magnify the obligation and even whilst you lay on your friend the favor acquit him of the debt but that shall not serve your turn i will always own it is my infallible pope has or would redeem me from a poetical damning the second time and save my rhimes from being condemned to the critics flames to all eternity but by the faith you profess you know your works of supererrogation transferred upon an humble acknowledging sinner may save even him having good works enough of your own besides to ensure yours and their immortality  and now for the pains you have taken to recommend my dullness by making it more methodical i give you a thousand thanks since true and natural dullness is shown more by its pretense to form and method as the sprightliness of wit by its despising both i thank you a thousand times for your repeated invitations to come to binfield  you will find it will be as hard for you to get quit of my mercenary kindness to you as it would for me to deserve or return to yours however it shall be the endeavor of my future life as it will be to demonstrate my self  your etc  mr popes reply nov      0  the compliments you make me in regard of any inconsiderable service i could do you are very unkind and do but tell me in other words that my friend has so mean an opinion of me as to think i expect acknowledgments for trifles which upon my faith i shall equally take amiss whether made to my self or to any others for gods sake my dear friend wycherley think better of me and believe i desire no sort of favor so much as that of serving you more considerably than i have yet been able to do  i shall proceed in this manner with some others of your pieces but since you desire i would not deface your copy for the future and only mark the repetitions i must as soon as i have marked these transcribe what is left on another paper and in that blot alter and add all i can devise for their improvement for you are sensible the omission of repetitions is but one and the easiest part of yours and my design there remaining besides to rectify the method to connect the matter and to mend the expression and versification i will go next upon the some brouillons of these transcribed and very much blotted by mr pope are extant in the harley library poems of solitude on the public and on the mixed life the bill of fare the praises of avarice and some others  i must take some notice of what you say of my pains to make your dullness methodical and of your hint that the sprightliness of wit despises method this is true enough if by wit you mean no more than fancy or conceit but in the better notion of wit considered as propriety surely method is not only necessary for perspicuity and harmony of parts but gives beauty even to the minute and particular thoughts which receive an additional advantage from those which precede or follow in their due place according to a simile mr dryden used in conversation of feathers in the crowns of the wild indians which they not only choose for the beauty of their colors but place them in such a manner as to reflect a luster on each other i will not disguise any of my sentiments from you to methodize in your case is full as necessary as to strike out otherwise you had better destroy the whole frame and reduce them into single thoughts in prose like rochfoucault as i have more than once hinted to you  mr wycherley to mr pope feb      0   i have had yours of the   d of this instant for which i give you many thanks since i find by it that even absence the usual bane of love or friendship cannot lessen yours no more than mine mr pope had this from mr cromwell after his enquiry in these words i returned to town last saturday and inquiring as you desired about mr wycherley was told in two several places that he had been very ill and that he was even gone off our stage but i could not imagine this report to be true or that so great a man could leave the world without its being instructed to lament so considerable a loss as to your hearing of my being ill i am glad and sorry for the report in the first place glad that it was not true and in the next sorry that it should give you any disturbance or concern more than ordinary for me for which as well as your concern for my future wellbeing or life i think my self most eternally obliged to you assuring your concern for either will make me more careful of both yet for your sake i love this life so well that i shall the less think of the other but it is in your power to ensure my happiness in one and the other both by your society and good example so not only contribute to my felicity here but hereafter  now as to your excuse for the plainness of your style or letter i must needs tell you that friendship is much more acceptable to a true friend than wit which is generally false reasoning and a friends reprimand often shows more friendship than his compliment nay love which is more than friendship is often seen by our friends correction of our follies or crimes upon this test of your friendship i intend to put you when i return to london and thence to you at binfield which i hope will be within a month  next to the news of your good health i am pleased with the good news of your going to print some of your poems and proud to be known by them to the public for your friend who intend perhaps the same way to be revenged of you for your kindness by taking your name in vain in some of my future madrigals yet so as to let the world know my love or esteem for you are no more poetic than my talent in scribbling but of all the arts of fiction i desire you to believe i want that of feigning friendship and that i am sincerely  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  i have received yours of the first of may your pastoral muse outshines in her modest and natural dress all apollos courtladies in their more artful labored and costly finery therefore i am glad to find by your letter you design your countrybeauty of a muse shall appear at court and in public to outshine all the farded lewd confident affected towndowdies who aim at being honored only to their shame but her artful innocence on the contrary will gain more honor as she becomes more public and in spite of custom will bring modesty again into fashion or at least make her sisterrivals of this age blush for spite if not for shame as for my stale antiquated poetical puss whom you would keep in countenance by saying she has once been tolerable and would yet pass muster by a little licking over it is true that like most vain antiquated jades which have once been passable she yet affects youthfulness in her age and would still gain a few admirers who the more she seeks or labors for their liking are but more her contemners nevertheless she is resolved henceforth to be so cautious as to appear very little more in the world except it be as an attendant on your muse or as a foil not a rival to her wit or fame so that let your countrygentlewoman appear when she will in the world this and the following extract are a full confutation of the lying spirit of john dennis and others who impudently asserted that mr pope wrote these verses on himself though published by mr wycherley six years before his death we find here it was a voluntary act of his promised beforehand and written while mr pope was absent the first brouillon of those verses and the second copy with corrections are both yet extant in mr wycherleys own hand from which will appear that if they received any alteration from mr pope it was in the omission of some of his own praises  my old wornout jade of a lost reputation shall be her attendant into it to procure her admirers as an old whore who can get no more friends of her own bawds for others to make sport or pleasure yet one way or other for mankind i approve of your making tonson your muses introductor into the world or master of the ceremonies who has been so long a pimp or gentleman usher to the muses  i wish you good fortune since a man with store of wit as store of money without the help of good fortune will never be popular but i wish you a great many admirers which will be some credit to my judgment as well as your wit who always thought you had a great deal and am  your etc  extract from two letters of mr wycherley of may    and of july      0  i have made a damned compliment in verse upon the printing your pastorals which you shall see when you see me  if you suffer my old dowdy of a muse to wait upon your sprightly lass of the plains into the company of the town twill be but like an old citybawds attending a young countrybeauty to town to gain her admirers when past the hopes of pleasing the world herself  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  i must thank you for a book of your miscellanies which tonson sent me i suppose by your order and all i can tell you of it is that nothing has lately been better received by the public than your part of it you have only displeased the critics by pleasing them too well having not left them a word to say for themselves against you and your performances so that now your hand is in you must persevere till my prophecys of you be fulfilled in earnest all the best judges of good sense or poetry are admirers of yours and like your part of the book so well that the rest is liked the worse this is true upon my word without compliment so that your first success will make you for all your life a poet in spite of your wit for a poets success at first like a gamesters fortune at first is like to make him a loser at last and to be undone by his good fortune and merit  but hitherto your miscellanies have safely run the gantlet through all the coffeehouses which are now entertained with a whimsical new newspaper called the tatler which i suppose you have seen this is the newest thing i can tell you of except it be of the peace which now most people say is drawing to such a conclusion as all europe is or must be satisfied with so poverty you see which makes peace in westminster hall makes it likewise in the camp or field throughout the world peace then be to you and to me who am now grown peaceful and will have no contest with any man but him who says he is more your friend or humble servant than  your etc  mr popes answer may  0   0  i am glad you received the jacob tonson s sixth vol of miscellany poems miscellany if it were only to show you that there are as bad poets in this nation as your servant this modern custom of appearing in miscellanies is very useful to the poets who like other thieves escape by getting into a crowd and herd together like banditti safe only in their multitude methinks strada has given a good description of these kind of collections nullus hodie mortalium aut nascitur aut moritur aut proeliatur aut rusticatur aut abit peregre aut redit aut nubit aut est aut non est nam etiam mortuis isti canunt cui non illi ea templo cudant epicoedia genethaliaca protreptica panegyrica epithalamia vaticinia propemptica saterica paroenctica noenias nugas as to the success which you say my part has met with it is to be attributed to what you were pleased to say of me to the world which you do well to call your prophecy since whatever is said in my favor must be a prediction of things that are not yet you like a true godfather engage on my part for much more than ever i can perform my pastoral muse like other country girls is but put out of countenance by what you courtiers say to her yet i hope you would not deceive me too far as knowing that a young scriblers vanity needs no recruits from abroad for nature like an indulgent mother kindly takes care to supply her sons with as much of their own as is necessary for their satisfaction if my verses should meet with a few flying commendations virgil has taught me that a young author has not too much reason to be pleased with them when he considers that the natural consequence of praise is envy and calumny  si ulna placitum laudarit baccare frontem cingite ne vati noceat mala lingua futuro when once a man has appeared as a poet he may give up his pretensions to all the rich and thriving arts those who have once made their court to those mistresses without portions the muses are never like to set up for fortunes but for my part i shall be satisfied if i can lose my time agreeably this way without losing my reputation as for gaining any i am as indifferent in the matter as falstaff was and may say of fame as he did of honor if it comes it comes unlooked for and there is an end on it i can be content with a bare saving game without being thought an eminent hand with which title jacob has graciously dignified his adventurers and volunteers in poetry jacob creates poets as kings sometimes do knights not for their honor but for money certainly he ought to be esteemed a worker of miracles who is grown rich by poetry  what authors lose their booksellers have won so pimps grow rich while gallants are undone i am your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  the last i received from you was dated the   d of may i take your charitable hint to me very kindly wherein you do like a true friend and a true christian and i shall endeavor to follow your advice as well as your example  as for your wishing to see your friend an hermit with you i cannot be said to leave the world since i shall enjoy in your conversation all that i can desire of it nay can learn more from you alone than from my long experience of the great or little vulgar in it  as to the success of your poems in the late miscellany i told you of in my last upon my word i made you no compliment for you may be assured that all sorts of readers like them except they are writers too but for them i must needs say the more they like them they ought to be the less pleased with em so that you do not come off with a bare saving game as you call it but have gained so much credit at first that you must needs support it to the last since you set up with so great a stock of good sense judgment and wit that your judgment ensures all that your wit ventures at the salt of your wit has been enough to give a relish to the whole insipid hotchpotch it is mingled the sixth volume of tonsons miscellanies with and you will make jacobs ladder raise you to immortality by which others are turned off shamefully to their damnation for poetic thieves as they are who think to be saved by others good works how faulty soever their own are but the coffeehouse wits or rather antiwits the critics prove their judgments by approving your wit and even the newsmongers and poets will own you have more invention than they nay the detracters or the envious who never speak well of any body not even of those they think well of in their absence yet will give you even in your absence their good word and the critics only hate you for being forced to speak well of you whether they will or no and all this is true upon the word of  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope aug      0  my letters so much inferior to yours can only make up their scarcity of sense by their number of lines which is like the spaniards paying a debt of gold with a load of brass money but to be a plaindealer i must tell you i will revenge the raillery of your letters upon mine by printing them as dennis did mine without your knowledge too which would be a revenge upon your judgment for the raillery of your wit for some dull rogues that is the most in the world might be such fools as to think what you said of me was in earnest it is not the first time you great wits have gained reputation by their paradoxical or ironical praises your forefathers have done it erasmus and others  for all mankind who know me must confess he must be no ordinary genius or little friend who can find out any thing to commend in me seriously who have given no sign of my judgment but my opinion of yours nor mark of my wit but my leaving off writing to the public now you are beginning to show the world what you can do by yours whose wit is as spiritual as your judgment infallible in whose judgment i have an implicit faith and shall always subscribe to it to save my works in this world from the flames and damnation  pray present my most humble service to sir w trumbull for whom and whose judgment i have so profound a respect that his example had almost made me marry more than my nephews ill carriage to me having once resolved to have revenged my self upon him by my marriage but now am resolved to make my revenge greater upon him by his marriage  mr wycherley to mr pope april      0 i have had yours of the  0th of the last month which is kinder than i desire it should be since it tells me you could be better pleased to be sick again in town in my company than to be well in the country without it and that you are more impatient to be deprived of happiness than of health yet my dear friend set raillery or compliment aside i can bear your absence which procures your health and ease better than i can your company when you are in pain for i cannot see you so without being so too your love to the country i do not doubt nor do you i hope my love to it or you since there i can enjoy your company without seeing you in pain to give me satisfaction and pleasure there i can have you without rivals or disturbers without the cs too civil or the ts too rude without the noise of the loud and the censure of the silent and would rather have you abuse me there with the truth than at this distance with your compliment since now your business of a friend and kindness to a friend is by finding fault with his faults and mending them by your obliging severity i hope in point of your good nature you will have no cruel charity for those papers of mine you were so willing to be troubled with which i take most infinitely kind of you and shall acknowledge with gratitude as long as i live no friend can do more for his friend than preserving his reputation nay not by preserving his life since by preserving his life he can only make him live about threescore or fourscore years but by preserving his reputation he can make him live as long as the world lasts so save him from damning when he is gone to the devil therefore i pray condemn me in private as the thieves do their accomplices in newgate to save them from condemnation by the public be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical faults and do with my papers as you countrygentlemen do with your trees slash cut and lopoff the excrescencies and dead parts of my withered bays that the little remainder may live the longer and increase the value of them by diminishing the number i have troubled you with my papers rather to give you pain than pleasure notwithstanding your compliment which says you take the trouble kindly such is the generosity to your friends that you take it kindly to be desired by them to do them a kindness and you think it done to you when they give you an opportunity to do it to them wherefore you may be sure to be troubled with my letters out of interest if not kindness since mine to you will procure yours to me so that i write to you more for my own sake than yours less to make you think i write well than to learn from you to write better thus you see interest in my kindness which is like the friendship of the world rather to make a friend than be a friend but i am yours as a true plaindealer  mr wycherley to mr pope april       0 if i can but do part of my business at shrewsbury in a fortnights time which i propose to do i will be soon after with you and trouble you with my company for the remainder of the summer in the mean time i beg you to give your self the pains of altering or leaving out what you think superfluous in my papers that i may endeavor to print such a number of them as you and i shall think fit about michaelmas next in order to which my dear friend i beg you to be so kind to me as to be severe to them that the critics may be less so for i had rather be condemned by my friend in private than exposed to my foes in public the critics or common judges who are made such by having been old offenders themselves pray believe i have as much faith in your friendship and sincerity as i have deference to your judgment and as the best mark of a friend is telling his friend his faults in private so the next is concealing them from the public till they are fit to appear in the mean time i am not a little sensible of the great kindness you do me in the trouble you take for me in putting my rhimes in tune since good sounds set off often ill sense as the italian songs whose good airs with the worst words or meaning make the best music so by your tuning my welsh harp my rough sense may be the less offensive to the nicer ears of those critics who deal more in sound than sense pray then take pity at once both of my readers and me in shortning my barren abundance and increasing their patience by it as well as the obligations i have to you and since no madrigaller can entertain the head unless he pleases the ear and since the crowded operas have left the best comedies with the least audiences it is a sign sound can prevail over sense therefore soften my words and strengthen my sense and eris mihi magnus apollo  mr wycherley  mr wycherley to mr pope april         you give me an account in your letter of the trouble you have undergone for me in comparing my papers you took down with you with the old printed volume and with one another of that bundle you have in your hands amongst which you say you find numerous the truth of this may be seen in the whole printed volume of his miscellanies in folio in   0  in almost every page repetitions of the same thoughts and subjects all which i must confess my want of memory has prevented me from imagining as well as made me capable of committing them since of all figures that of tautology is the last i would use or least forgive my self for but seeing is believing wherefore i will take some pains to examine and compare those papers in your hands with one another as well as with the former printed copies or books of my damned miscellanies all which as bad a memory as i have with a little more pains and care i think i can remedy therefore i would not have you give your self more trouble about them which may prevent the pleasure you have and may give the world in writing upon new subjects of your own whereby you will much better entertain your self and others now as to your remarks upon the whole volume of my papers all that i desire of you is to mark in the margin without defacing the copy at all either any repetition of words matter or sense or any thoughts or words too much repeated which if you will be so kind as to do for me you will supply my want of memory with your good one and my deficiences of sense with the infallibility of yours which if you do you will most infinitely oblige me who almost repent the trouble i have given you since so much now as to what you call freedom with me which you desire me to forgive you may be assured i would not forgive you unless you did use it for i am so far from thinking your plainness a fault or an offense to me that i think it a charity and an obligation which i shall always acknowledge with all sort of gratitude to you for it who am therefore  dear mr pope your most obliged humble servant w wycherley all the news i have to send you is that poor mr betterton is going to make his exit from the stage of this world the gout being gotten up into his head and as the physicians say will certainly carry him off suddenly    mr popes answer may      0 i am sorry you persist to take ill my not accepting your invitation and to find if i mistake not your exception not unmixt with some suspicion be certain i shall most carefully observe your request not to cross over or deface the copy of your papers for the future and only to mark in the margin the repetitions but as this can serve no further than to get rid of those repetitions and no way rectify the method nor connect the matter nor improve the poetry in expression or numbers without further blotting adding and altering so it really is my opinion and desire that you should take your papers out of my hands into your own and that no alterations may be made but when both of us are present when you may be satisfied with every blot as well as every addition and nothing be put upon the papers but what you shall give your own sanction and assent to at the same time  do not be so unjust as to imagine from hence that i would decline any part of this task on the contrary you know i have been at the pains of transcribing some pieces at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the copy and yet to lose no time in proceeding upon the correction i will go on the same way if you please though truly it is as i have often told you my sincere opinion that the greater part would make a much better figure as single maxims and reflections in prose after the manner of your favorite rochefoucaut than in verse mr wycherley lived five years after to december      but little progress was made in this design through his old age and the increase of his infirmities however some of the verses which had been touched by mr p with  0  of these maxims in prose were found among his papers which having the misfortune to fall into the hands of a mercenary were published in      in octavo under the title of the posthumous works of william wycherley esquire and this when nothing more is done but marking the repetitions in the margin will be an easy task for your self to proceed upon notwithstanding the bad memory you complain of  i am unfeignedly dear sir your etc  letters of william walsh esquire and mr pope  from   0  to   0   letters of of abberley in worcestershire gentleman of the horse in queen annes reign author of several beautiful pieces in prose and verse and in the opinion of mr dryden in his postscript to virgil the best critic of our nation in his time mr walsh and mr pope from   0  to   0  mr walsh to mr wycherley apr  0   0  i return you the mr popes pastorals papers you favored me with and had sent them to you yesterday morning but that i thought to have brought them to you last night my self i have read them over several times with great satisfaction the preface is very judicious and very learned and the verses very tender and easy the author seems to have a particular genius for that kind of poetry and a judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of he has taken very freely from the ancients but what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them it is no flattery at all to say that virgil had written nothing so good at his age sixteen  i shall take it as a favor if you will bring me acquainted with him and if he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my house i shall be very glad to read the verses over with him and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than i can well do in this letter i am sir  your most faithful and most humble servant w walsh  mr walsh to mr pope june      0  i received the favor of your letter and shall be very glad of the continuance of a correspondence by which i am like to be so great a gainer i hope when i have the happiness of seeing you again in london not only to read over the verses i have now of yours but more that you have written since for i make no doubt but any one who writes so well must write more not that i think the most voluminous poets always the best i believe the contrary is rather true i mentioned somewhat to you in london of a pastoral comedy which i should be glad to hear you had thought upon since i find menage in his observations upon tassos aminta reckons up fourscore pastoral plays in italian and in looking over my old italian books i find a great many pastorals and piscatory plays which i suppose menage reckons together i find also by menage that tasso is not the first that writ in that kind he mentioning another before him which he himself had never seen nor indeed have i but as the aminta pastor fido and filli di sciro of bonarelli are the three best so i think there is no dispute but aminta is the best of the three not but that the discourses in pastor fido are more entertaining and copious in several peoples opinion though not so proper for pastoral and the fable of bonarelli more surprising i do not remember many in other languages that have written in this kind with success racans bergeries are much inferior to his lyrick poems and the spaniards are all too full of conceits rapin will have the design of pastoral plays to be taken from the cyclops of euripides i am sure there is nothing of this kind in english worth mentioning and therefore you have that field open to your self you see i write to you without any sort of constraint or method as things come into my head and therefore pray use the same freedom with me who am etc  mr pope to mr walsh july     0  i cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those papers of mine you have no less right to correct me than the same hand that raised a tree has to prune it i am convinced as well as you that one may correct too much for in poetry as in painting a man may lay colors one upon another till they stiffen and deaden the piece besides to bestow heightning on every part is monstrous some parts ought to be lower than the rest and nothing looks more ridiculous than a work where the thoughts however different in their own nature seem all on a level it is like a meadow newly mown where weeds grass and flowers are all laid even and appear undistinguished i believe too that sometimes our first thoughts are the best as the first squeezing of the grapes makes the finest and richest wine  i have not attempted any thing of pastoral comedy because i think the taste of our age will not relish a poem of that sort people seek for what they call wit on all subjects and in all places not considering that nature loves truth so well that it hardly ever admits of flourishing conceit is to nature what paint is to beauty it is not only needless but impairs what it would improve there is a certain majesty in simplicity which is far above all the quaintness of wit insomuch that the critics have excluded it from the loftiest poetry as well as the lowest and forbid it to the epic no less than the pastoral i should certainly displease all those who are charmed with guarini and bonarelli and imitate tasso not only in the simplicity of his thoughts but in that of the fable too if surprising discoveries should have place in the story of a pastoral comedy i believe it would be more agreeable to probability to make them the effects of chance than of design intrigue not being very consistent with that innocence which ought to constitute a shepherds character there is nothing in all the aminta as i remember but happens by mere accident unless it be the meeting of aminta with sylvia at the fountain which is the contrivance of daphne and even that is the most simple in the world the contrary is observable in pastor fido where corisca is so perfect a mistress of intrigue that the plot could not have been brought to pass without her i am inclined to think the pastoral comedy has another disadvantage as to the manners its general design is to make us in love with the innocence of a rural life so that to introduce shepherds of a vicious character must in some measure debase it and hence it may come to pass that even the virtuous characters will not shine so much for want of being opposed to their contraries  these thoughts are purely my own and therefore i have reason to doubt them but i hope your judgment will set me right  i would beg your opinion too as to another point it is how far the liberty of borrowing may extend i have defended it sometimes by saying that it seems not so much the perfection of sense to say things that have never been said before as to express those best that have been said oftenest and that writers in the case of borrowing from others are like trees which of themselves would produce only one sort of fruit but by being grafted upon others may yield variety a mutual commerce makes poetry flourish but then poets like merchants should repay with something of their own what they take from others not like pirates make prize of all they meet i desire you to tell me sincerely if i have not stretched this license too far in these pastorals i hope to become a critic by your precepts and a poet by your example since i have seen your eclogues i cannot be much pleased with my own however you have not taken away all my vanity so long as you give me leave to profess my self  your etc  mr walsh to mr pope july  0   0  i had sooner returned you thanks for the favor of your letter but that i was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my journey to windsor but i am now forced to put that quite off being engaged to go to my corporation of richmond in yorkshire i think you are perfectly in the right in your notions of pastoral but i am of opinion that the redundancy of wit you mention though it is what pleases the common people is not what ever pleases the best judges pastor fido indeed has had more admirers than aminta but i will venture to say there is a great deal of difference between the admirers of one and the other corisca which is a character generally admired by the ordinary judges is intolerable in a pastoral and bonarellis fancy of making his shepherdess in love with two men equally is not to be defended whatever pains he has taken to do it as for what you ask of the liberty of borrowing it is very evident the best latin poets have extended this very far and none so far as virgil who is the best of them as for the greek poets if we cannot trace them so plainly it is perhaps because we have none before them it is evident that most of them borrowed from homer and homer has been accused of burning those that wrote before him that his thefts might not be discovered the best of the modern poets in all languages are those that have the nearest copied the ancients indeed in all the common subjects of poetry the thoughts are so obvious at least if they are natural that whoever writes last must write things like what have been said before but they may as well applaud the ancients for the arts of eating and drinking and accuse the moderns of having stolen those inventions from them it being evident in all such cases that whoever live first must first find them out it is true indeed when  unus and alter assuitur pannus when there is one or two bright thoughts stolen and all the rest is quite different from it a poem makes a very foolish figure but when it is all melted down together and the gold of the ancients so mixed with that of the moderns that none can distinguish the one from the other i can never find fault with it i cannot however but own to you that there are others of a different opinion and that i have shown your verses to some who have made that objection to them i have so much company round me while i write this and such a noise in my ears that it is impossible i should write any thing but nonsense so must break off abruptly  i am sir your most afsectionate and most humble servant  mr walsh to mr pope sept     0  at my return from the north i received the favor of your letter which had lain there till then having been absent about six weeks i read over your pastorals again with a great deal of pleasure and to judge the better read virgils eclogues and spensers calendar at the same time and i assure you i continue the same opinion i had always of them by the little hints you take upon all occasions to improve them it is probable you will make them yet better against winter though there is a mean to be kept even in that too and a man may correct his verses till he takes away the true spirit of them especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great critics by mechanical rules and never enter into the true design and genius of an author i have seen some of these that would hardly allow any one good ode in horace who cry virgil wants fancy and that homer is very incorrect while they talk at this rate one would think them above the common rate of mortals but generally they are great admirers of ovid and lucan and when they write themselves we find out all the mystery they scan their verses upon their fingers run after conceits and glaring thoughts their poems are all made up of couplets of which the first may be last or the last first without any sort of prejudice to their works in which there is no design or method or any thing natural or just for you are certainly in the right that in all writings whatsoever not poetry only nature is to be followed and we should be jealous of our selves for being fond of similies conceits and what they call saying fine things when we were in the north my lord wharton showed me a letter he had received from a certain great the earl of p general in spain i told him i would by all means have that general recalled and set to writing here at home for it was impossible that a man with so much wit as he showed could be fit to command an army or do any other business as for what you say of expression it is indeed the same thing to wit as dress is to beauty i have seen many women overdrest and several look better in a careless nightgown with their hair about their ears than mademoiselle spanheim dressed for a ball i do not design to be in london till toward the parliament then i shall certainly be there and hope by that time you will have finished your pastorals as you would have them appear in the world and particularly the third of autumn which i have not yet seen your last eclogue being upon the same subject as that of mine on mrs tempests death i should take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn as if it were to the memory of the same lady if they were not written for some particular woman whom you would make immortal you may take occasion to show the difference between poets mistresses and other mens i only hint this which you may either do or let alone just as you think fit i shall be very much pleased to see you again in town and to hear from you in the mean time i am with very much esteem  your etc  mr pope to mr walsh oct      0  after the thoughts i have already sent you on the subject of english versification you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars there are indeed certain niceties which though not much observed even by correct versifiers i cannot but think deserve to be better regarded    it is not enough that nothing offends the ear but a good poet will adapt the very sounds as well as words to the things he treats of so that there is if one may express it so a style of sound as in describing a gliding stream the numbers should run easy and flowing in describing a rough torrent or deluge sonorous and swelling and so of the rest this is evident every where in homer and virgil and no where else that i know of to any observable degree the following examples will make this plain which i have taken from vida  molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit incedit tardo molimine subsidendo luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras immenso cum praecipitans ruit oceano nox telum imbelle sine ictu conjecit toll moras cape saxa manu cape robora pastor ferte citi flammas data tela repellite pestem this i think is what very few observe in practice and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting the image on the reader we have one excellent example of it in our language mr drydens ode on st caecilias day entitled alexanders feast    every nice ear must i believe have observed that in any smooth english verse of ten syllables there is naturally a pause at the fourth fifth or sixth syllable it is upon these the ear rests and upon the judicious change and management of which depends the variety of versification for example  at the fifth wherever thy navy spreads her canvass wings at the fourth homage to thee and peace to all she brings at the sixth like tracts of leverets in morning snow now i fancy that to preserve an exact harmony and variety the pauses of the  th or  th should not be continued above three lines together without the interposition of another else it will be apt to weary the ear with one continued tone at least it does mine that at the  th runs quicker and carries not quite so dead a weight so tires not so much though it be continued longer    another nicety is in relation to expletives whether words or syllables which are made use of purely to supply a vacancy do before verbs plural is absolutely such and it is not improbable but future refiners may explode did and does in the same manner which are almost always used for the sake of rhyme the same cause has occasioned the promiscuous use of you and thou to the same person which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other    i would also object to the irruption of alexandrine verses of twelve syllables which i think should never be allowed but when some remarkable beauty or propriety in them attones for the liberty mr dryden has been too free of these especially in his latter works i am of the same opinion as to triple rhimes    i could equally object to the repetition of the same rhimes within four or six lines of each other as tiresome to the ear through their monotony    monosyllablelines unless very artfully managed are stiff or languishing but may be beautiful to express melancholy slowness or labor    to come to the hiatus or gap between two words which is caused by two vowels opening on each other upon which you desire me to be particular i think the rule in this case is either to use the caesura or admit the hiatus just as the ear is least shocked by either for the caesura sometimes offends the ear more than the hiatus itself and our language is naturally overcharged with consonants as for example if in this verse the old have interest ever in their eye we should say to avoid the hiatus but the old have interest    the hiatus which has the worst effect is when one word ends with the same vowel that begins the following and next to this those vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other are most to be avoided o a or u will bear a more full and graceful sound than e i or y i know some people will think these observations trivial and therefore i am glad to corroborate them by some great authorities which i have met with in tully and quintilian in the fourth book of rhetoric to herennius are these words fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem reddunt orationem ut hoc est baccae aeneae amaenissimae impendebant and quintilian l   cap   vocalium concursus cum accidit hiat and intersistit at quasi laborat oration pessimi long quae easdem inter se literas committunt sonabunt praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efferuntur e plenior litera est i angustior but he goes on to reprove the excess on the other hand of being too sollicitous in this matter and says admirably nescio an negligentia in hoc aut solicitudo sit pejor so likewise tully orator ad brut theopompum reprehendunt quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit etsi idem magister ejus isocrates which last author as turnebus on quintilian observe has hardly one hiatus in all his works quintilian tells us that tully and demosthenes did not much observe this nicety though tully himself says in his orator crebra ista vocum concursio quam magna ex part vitiosam fugit demosthenes if i am not mistaken malherbe of all the moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point and i think menage in his observations upon him says he has not one in his poems to conclude i believe the hitus should be avoided with more care in poetry than in oratory and i would constantly try to prevent it unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the sound than the hiatus itself i am etc mr walsh died at    years old in the year   0  the year after mr pope writ the essay on criticism in which he gives

there yet i guess you will expect i should recant this expression when i tell you that sapho by which heathenish name you have christened a very orthodox lady did not accompany me into the country

is ten to one but a young fellow may find his strayed heart again with some wildstreet or drury lane damsel but here where i could have met with no redress from an unmerciful virtuous dame i must for ever have lost my little traveller in a hole where i could never rummage to find him again  well sir you have your lady in the town still and i have my heart in the country still which being wholly unemployd as yet has the more room in it for my friends and does not want a corner at your service  to be serious you have extremely obliged me by your frankness and kindness to me and if i have abused it by too much freedom on my part i hope you will attribute it to the natural openness of my temper which hardly knows how to show respect where i feel affection i would love my friend as my

present i am satisfied to trifle away my time any way rather than let it stick by me as shopkeepers are glad to be rid of those goods at any rate which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands

should not i content my self with so many great examples of deep divines profound casuists grave philosophers who have written not letters only but whole tomes and voluminous treatises about nothing why should a fellow like me who all his life does nothing be ashamed to write nothing and that to one who has nothing to do but to read it but perhaps you will say the whole world has something to do something to talk of something to wish for something to be employed about but pray sir cast up the account put all these somethings together and what is the sum total but just nothing i have no more

inquired of any one in it besides mr wycherley and your self and from him i understand of your journey this summer into leicestershire from whence i guess you are returned by this time to your old apartment in the widows corner to your old business of comparing critics and reconciling commentators and to the old diversions of a losing game at picquet with the ladies and half a play or a quarter of a play at the theater where you are none of the malicious audience but the chief of amorous spectators and for the infirmity of one his hearing sense which there for the most part could only serve to disgust you enjoy the vigor of another which ravishes you you know when one sense is suppressed it but retires into the rest   according to the poetical not the learned dodwell who has done one thing worthy of eternal memory wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense so you have the advantage of being entertained with all the beauty of the boxes without being troubled with any of the dullness of the stage you are so good a critic that it is the greatest happiness of the modern poets that you do not hear their works and next that you are not so arrant a critic as to damn them like the rest without hearing but now i talk of those critics i have good news to tell you concerning my self for which i expect you should congratulate with me it is that beyond all my expectations and far above my demerits i have been most mercifully reprieved by the fovereign power of jacob tonson from being brought forth to public punishment and respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous executioners of the muses whom i was just now speaking of it often happens that guilty poets like other guilty criminals when once they are known and proclaimed deliver themselves into the hands of justice only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage and not out of any ambition to spread their fame by being executed in the face of the world which is a same but of short continuance that poet were a happy man who could but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninetynine years for those names very rarely last so many days which are planted either in jacob tonsons or the ordinary of newgates miscellanies  i have an hundred things to say to you which shall be deferred till i have the happiness of seeing you in town for the season now draws on that invites every body thither some of them i had communicated to you by letters before this if i had not been uncertain where you passed your time the last season so much fine weather i doubt not has given you all the pleasure you could desire from the country and your own thoughts the best company in it but nothing could allure mr wycherley to our forest he continued as you told me long since he would an obstinate lover of the town in spite of friendship and fair weather therefore henceforward to all those considerable qualities i know you possessed of i shall add that of prophecy but i still believe mr wycherleys intentions were good and am satisfied that he promises nothing but with a real design to perform it how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imitation his sincerity i hope is not and it is with the utmost that i am  sir etc jan      0   i had sent you the enclosed this was a translation of the first book of statius done when the author was but    years old as appears by an advertisement before the first edition of it in a miscellany published by b lintot  0      papers before this time but that i intended to have brought them my self and afterward could find no opportunity of sending them without suspicion of their miscarrying not that they are of the least value but for fear some body might be foolish enough to imagine them so and inquisitive enough to discover those faults which i by your help would correct i therefore beg the favor of you to let them go no farther than your chamber and to be very free of your remarks in the margins not only in regard to the accuracy but to the fidelity of the translation which i have not had time of late to compare with its original and i desire you to be the more severe as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense than to do it in my own proper person for your better help in comparing it may be fit to tell you that this is not an entire version of the first book there is an omission from the    th line  jam murmura serpunt plebis agenoreae  to the    th  interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris  between these these he since translated and they are extant in the printed version two statius has a description of the council of the gods and a speech of jupiter which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty and were left out for no other reason but because the consequence of this machine appears not till the second book the translation goes on from thence to the words hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam where there is an odd account of a battle at fiftycuffs between the two princes on a very slight occasion and at a time when one would think the fatigue of their journey in so tempestuous a night might have rendered them very unfit for such a scuffle this i had actually translated but was very ill satisfied with it even in my own words to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience it was therefore omitted in this copy which goes on above eighty lines farther at the words  hic primum lustrare oculis etc  to the end of the book  you will find i doubt not that statius was none of the discreetest poets though he was the best versifier next virgil in the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of poetry which horace had already taught the romans when he asks his muse where to begin his thebaid and seems to doubt whether it should not be ab ovo ledaeo when he comes to the scene of his poem and the prize in dispute between the brothers he gives us a very mean opinion of it  pugna est de paupere regno  very different from the conduct of his master virgil who at the entrance of his poem informs his reader of the greatness of its subject  tantoe molis erat romanam condere gentem bossu on epic poetry there are innumerable little faults in him among which i cannot but take notice of one in this book where speaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers he says the whole world would be too small a prize to repay so much impiety quid si peteretur crimine tanto limes uterque poli quem sol emissus eoo cardine aut portu vergens prospectat ibero   this was pretty well one would think already but he goes on  quasque procul terras oblique sydere tangit avius aut boreoe gelidas madidive tepentes igne noti after all this what could a poet think of but heaven itself for the prize but what follows is astonishing  quid si tyrioe phrygioeve sub unum convectentur opes   i do not remember to have met with so great a fall in any ancient author whatsoever i should not have insisted so much on the faults of this poet if i did not hope you would take the same freedom with and revenge it upon his translator i shall be extremely glad if the reading this can be any amusement to you the rather because i had the dissatisfaction to hear you have been confined to your chamber by an illness which i fear was as troublesome a companion as i have sometimes been to you in the same place where if ever you found any pleasure in my company it must surely have been that which most men take in observing the faults and follies of another a pleasure which you see i take care to give you even in my absence  if you will oblige me at your leisure with the confirmation of your recovery under your own hand it will be extreme grateful to me for next to the pleasure of seeing my friends is that i take in hearing from them and in this particular i am beyond all acknowledgments obliged to our friend mr wycherley who as if it were not enough to have excelled all men in wit is resolved to excel them in goodnature too i know i need no apology to you for speaking of mr wycherley whose example as i am proud of following in all things so in nothing more than in professing my self like him  your etc  may     0  you had long before this time been troubled with a letter from me but that i deferred it till i could send you either the jacob tonsons sixth volume of poetical miscellanies in which mr popes pastorals and some versions of homer and chaucer were first printed miscellany or my continuation of the version of statius the first i imagined you might have had before now but since the contrary has happened you may draw this moral from it that authors in general are more ready to write nonsense than booksellers are to publish it i had i know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together in which time all the verses you see added have been written which i tell you that you may more freely be severe upon them it is a mercy i do not assault you with a number of original sonnets and epigrams which our modern bards put forth in the springtime in as great abundance as trees do blossoms a very few whereof ever come to be fruit and please no longer than just in their birth so that they make no less haste to bring their flowers of wit to the press than gardiners to bring their other flowers to the market which if they cannot get off their hands in the morning are sure to die before night thus the same reason that furnishes covent garden with those nosegays you so delight in supplies the muses mercury and british apollo not to say jacobs miscellanies with verses and it is the happiness of this age that the modern invention of printing poems for pence apiece has brought the nosegays of parnassus to bear the same price whereby the publickspirited mr henry hills of blackfryars has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the learned who never overabounding in transitory coin should not be discontented methinks even though poems were distributed gratis about the streets like bunyans sermons and other pious treatises usually published in a like volume and character  the time now drawing nigh when you use with sapho to cross the water in an evening to springgarden i hope you will have a fair opportunity of ravishing her  i mean only as oldfox in the plaindealer says through the ear with your wellpennd verses i have been told of a very lucky compliment of an officer to his mistress in the very same place which i cannot but set down and desire you at present to take it in good part instead of a latin quotation that it may some time or other be improved by your pronunciation while you walk solus cum sola in those amorous shades when at springgarden sapho deigns tappear the flowers march in her van musk in her rear   i wish you all the pleasures which the season and the nymph can afford the best company the best coffee and the best news you can desire and what more to wish you than this i do not know unless it be a great deal of patience to read and examine the verses i send you and i promise you in return a great deal of deference to your judgment and an extraordinary obedience to your sentiments for the future to which you know i have been sometimes a little refractory if you will please to begin where you left off last and mark the margins as you have done in the pages immediately before which you will find corrected to your sense since your last perusal you will extremely oblige me and improve my translation besides those places which may deviate from the sense of the author it would be very kind in you to observe any deficiencies in the diction or numbers the hiatus in particular i would avoid as much as possible to which you are certainly in the right to be a professed enemy though i confess i could not think it possible at all times to be avoided by any writer till i found by reading malherbe lately that there is scarce any throughout his poems i thought your observation true enough to be passed into a rule but not a rule without exceptions nor that ever it had been reduced to practice but this example of one of the most correct and best of their poets has undeceived me and confirms your opinion very strongly and much more than mr drydens authority who though he made it a rule seldom observed it  your etc  june  0   0  i have received part of the version of statius and return you my thanks for your remarks which i think to be just except where you cry out like one in horaces art of poetry pulchre been recte there i have some fears you are often if not always in the wrong  one of your objections namely on that passage the rest revolving years shall ripen into fate may be well grounded in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words  see the first book of statius verse  0  caetera reliquo ordine ducam but the duration of the action of statiuss poem may as well be excepted against as many things besides in him which i wonder bossu has not observed for instead of confining his narration to one year it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books the narration begins with oedipuss prayer to the fury to promote discord betwixt his sons afterward the poet expressly describes their entering into the agreement of reigning a year by turns and polynices takes his flight for thebes on his brothers refusal to resign the throne all this is in the first book in next tydeus is sent ambassador to etheocles and demands his resignation in these terms  astriferum velox jam circulus orbem torsit and amissae redierunt montibus umbrae ex quo srater inops ignota per oppida tristes exul agit casus    but bossu himself is mistaken in one particular relating to the commencement of the action saying in book   cap   that statius opens it with europas rape whereas the poet at most only deliberates whether he should or not  unde jubetis ire deae gentisne canam primor dia dirae sidonios raptus etc but then expressly passes all this with a longa retro series  and says  limes mihi carminis esto oedipodae confusa domus  indeed there are numberless particulars blameworthy in our author which i have tried to soften in the version  dubiamque jugo fragor impulit oeten in latus and geminis vix fluctibus obstitit isthmus is most extravagantly hyperbolical nor did i ever read a greater piece of tautology than  vacua cum solus in aula respiceres jus omne tuum cunctosque minores et nusquam par stare caput   in the journey of polynices is some geographical error  in mediis audit duo litora campis could hardly be for the isthmus of corinth is full five miles over and caligantes abrupto sole mycaenas is not consistent with what he tells us in lib   lin  0  that those of mycaenae came not to the war at this time because they were then in confusion by the divisions of the brothers atreus and thyestes now from the raising the greek army against thebes back to the time of this journey of polynices is according to statiuss own account three years  yours etc  july      0  the morning after i parted from you i found my felf as i had prophesied all alone in an uneasy stagecoach a doleful change from that agreeable company i enjoyed the night before without the least hope of entertainment but from my last recourse in such cases a book i then began to enter into acquaintance with the moralists and had just received from them some cold consolation for the inconveniences of this life and the incertainty of human affairs when i perceived my vehicle to stop and heard from the side of it the dreadful news of a sick woman preparing to enter it it is not easy to guess at my mortification but being so well fortified with philosophy i stood resigned with a stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils a sick woman i was indeed a little comforted to find by her voice and dress that she was young and a gentlewoman but no sooner was her hood removed but i saw one of the finest faces i ever beheld and to increase my surprise heard her salure me by my name i never had more reason to accuse nature for making me shortsighted than now when i could not recollect i had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well and was utterly at a loss how to address my self till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know even before i discovered my ignorance that she was the daughter of one in our neighborhood lately married who having been consulting her physicians in town was returning into the country to try what good air and a new husband could do to recover her my father you must know has sometimes recommended the study of physic to me but i never had any ambition to be a doctor till this instant i ventured to prescribe some fruit which i happened to have in the coach which being forbidden her by her doctors she had the more inclination to in short i tempted and she eat nor was i more like the devil than she like eve having the good success of the foresaid gentleman before my eyes i put on the gallantry of the old serpent and in spite of my evil form accosted her with all the gaiety i was master of which had so good effect that in less than an hour she grew pleasant her color returned and she was pleased to say my prescription had wrought an immediate cure in a word i had the pleasantest journey imaginable  thus far methinks my letter has something of the air of a romance though it be true but i hope you will look on what follows as the greatest of truths that i think my self extremely obliged by you in all points especially for your kind and honorable information and advice in a matter of the utmost concern to me which i shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship justice and sincerity at the same time be assured that gentleman we spoke of shall never by any alteration in me discover my knowledge of his mistake the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of return i can possibly make him for so many favors and i may derive this pleasure at least from it that whereas i must otherwise have been a little uneasy to know my incapacity of returning to his obligations i may now by bearing his frailty exercise my gratitude and friendship more than himself either is or perhaps ever will be sensible of ille meos primus qui me sibi junxit amores abstulit ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro   but in one thing i must confess you have your self obliged me more than any man which is that you have showed me many of my faults to which as you are the more an implacable enemy by so much the more you are a kind friend to me i could be proud in revenge to find a few slips in your verses which i read in london and since in the country with more application and pleasure the thoughts are very just and you are sure not to let them suffer by the versification if you would oblige me with the trust of any thing of yours i should be glad to execute any commissions you would give me concerning them i am here so perfectly at leisure that nothing would be so agreeable an entertainment to me but if you will not afford me that do not deny me at least the satisfaction of your letters as long as we are absent if you would not have him very unhappy who is very sincerely  your etc  having a vacant space here i will fill it with a short ode on solitude which i found yesterday by great accident and which i find by the date was written when i was not twelve years old that you may perceive how long i have continued in my passion for a rural life and in the same employments of it  happy the man whose wish and care a few paternal acres bound content to breathe his native air in his own ground whose herds with milk whose fields with bread whose flocks supply him with attire whose trees in summer yield him shade in winter fire blessed who can unconcerndly find hours days and years slide soft away in health of body peace of mind quiet by day sound sleep by night study and ease together mixed sweet recreation and innocence which most does please with meditation thus let me live unseen unknown thus unlamented let me die steal from the world and not a stone tell where i lie august      0  if i were to write to you as often as i think of you my letters would be as bad as a rentcharge but though the one be but too little for your goodnature the other would be too much for your quiet which is one blessing goodnature should indispensably receive from mankind in return for those many it gives i have been informed of late how much i am indebted to that quality of yours in speaking well of me in my absence the only thing by which you prove your self no wit or critic though indeed i have often thought that a friend will show just as much indulgence and no more to my faults when i am absent as he does severity to em when i am present to be very frank with you sir i must own that where i received so much civility at first i could hardly have expected so much sincerity afterward but now i have only to wish that the last were but equal to the first and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me so you would omit nothing to improve me  i caused an acquaintance of mine to enquire twice of your welfare by whom i have been informed that you have left your speculative angle in the widows coffeehouse and bidding adieu for some time to all the rehearsals reviews gazettes etc have marched off into lincolnshire thus i find you vary your life in the scene at least though not in the action for though life for the most part like an old play be still the same yet now and then a new scene may make it more entertaining as for my self i would not have my life a very regular play let it be a good merry farce a gds name and a fig for the critical unities yet on the other side i would as soon write like durfey as live like the whose beastly yet merry life is if you will excuse such a similitude not unlike a ft at once nasty and laughable for the generality of men a true modern life is like a true modern play neither tragedy comedy nor farce nor one nor all of these every actor is much better known by his having the same face than by keeping the same character for we change our minds as often as they can their parts and he who was yesterday caesar is to day sir john daw so that one might ask the same question of a modern life that rich did of a modern play pray do me the favor sir to inform me is this your tragedy or your comedy  i have dwelt the longer upon this because i persuade my self it might be useful at a time when we have no other theater to divert our selves at this great one here is a glorious standing comedy of fools at which every man is heartily merry and thinks himself an unconcerned spectator this to our singular comfort neither my lord chamberlain nor the queen her self can ever shut up or silence while that of drury alas lies desolate in the profoundest peace and the melancholy prospect of the nymphs yet lingering about its beloved avenues appears no less moving than that of the trojan dames lamenting over their ruined ilium what now can they hope dispossessed of their ancient seats but to serve as captives to the insulting victors of the haymarket the afflicted subjects of france do not in our postman so grievously deplore the obstinacy of their arbitrary monarch as these perishing people of drury the obdurate heart of that pharaoh rich who like him disdains all proposals of peace and accommodation several libels have been secretly affixed to the great gates of his imperial palace in bridgesstreet and a memorial representing the distresses of these persons has been accidentally dropped as we are credibly informed by a person of quality out of his first minister the chief boxkeepers pocket at a late conference of the said person of quality and others on the part of the confederates and his theatrical majesty on his own part of this you may expect a copy as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand as for the late congress it is here reported that it has not been wholly ineffectual but this wants confirmation yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of so many wretched ladies may induce this haughty prince to reason  i am etc  october      0  i may truly say i am more obliged to you this summer than to any of my acquaintance for had it not been for the two kind letters you sent me i had been perfectly oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis the only companions i had were those muses of whom tully says adolescentiam alunt senectutem oblectant secundas res ornant adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent delectant domi non impediunt foris pernoctant nobiscum peregrinantur rusticantur which indeed is as much as ever i expected from them for the muses if you take them as companions are very pleasant and agreeable but whoever should be forced to live or depend upon em would find himself in a very bad condition that quiet which cowley calls the companion of obscurity was not wanting to me unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess i had for our friends welfare it is extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him and you have delivered me from more anxiety than he imagines me capable of on his account as i am convinced by his long silence however the love of some things rewards itself as of virtue and of mr wycherley i am surpised at the danger you tell me he has been in and must agree with you that our nation would have lost in him alone more wit and probity than would have remained for ought i know in all the rest of it my concern for his friendship will excuse me since i know you honor him so much and since you know i love him above all men if i vent a part of my uneasiness to you and tell you that there has not been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths of me to mr wycherley which i fear may have had some effect upon him if so he will have a greater punishment for his credulity than i could wish him in that fellows acquaintance the loss of a faithful creature is something though of ever so contemptible an one and if i were to change my dog for such a man as the aforesaid i should think my dog undervalud who follows me about as constantly here in the country as i was used to do mr wycherley in the town  now i talk of my dog that i may not treat of a worse subject which my spleen tempts me to i will give you some account of him a thing not wholly unprecedented since montaigne to whom i am but a dog in comparison has done the very same thing of his cat dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam you are to know then that as it is likeness begets affection so my favorite dog is a little one a lean one and none of the finest shaped he is not much a spaniel in his fawning but has what might be worth any mans while to imitate from him a dumb surly sort of kindness that rather shows itself when he thinks me illusd by others than when we walk quietly and peaceably by our selves if it be the chief point of friendship to comply with a friends motions and inclinations he possesses this in an eminent degree he lies down when i sit and walks when i walk which is more than many good friends can pretend to witness our walk a year ago in st jamess park  histories are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends but i will not insist upon many of em because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of pylades and orestes etc i will only say for the honor of dogs that the two most ancient and esteemable books sacred and profane extant  viz the scripture and homer have shown a particular regard to these animals that of toby is the more remarkable because there was no manner of reason to take notice of the dog besides the great humanity of the author homers account of ulyssess dog argus is the most pathetick imaginable all the circumstances considered and an excellent proof of the old bards goodnature ulysses had left him at ithaca when he embarked for troy and found him at his return after twenty years which by the way is not unnatural as some critics have said since i remember the dam of my dog was twentytwo years old when she died may the omen of longaevity prove fortunate to her successor you shall have it in verse  argus when wise ulysses from his native coast long kept by wars and long by tempests tossed arrived at lost poor old disguised alone to all his friends and even his queen unknown changed as he was with age and toils and cares furrowed his reverend face and white his hairs in his own palace forced to ask his bread scorned by those slaves his former bounty fed forgot of all his own domestic crew the faithful dog alone his rightful master knew unfed unhousd neglected on the clay like an old servant now cashiered he lay touched with resentment of ungrateful man and longing to behold his ancient lord again him when he saw  he rose and crawled to meet it was all he could and fawned and kissed his feet seized with dumb joy  then falling by his side owned his returning lord looked up and died plutarch relating how the athenians were obliged to abandon athens in the time of themistocles steps back again out of the way of his history purely to describe the lamentable cries and howlings of the poor dogs they left behind he makes mention of one that followed his master across the sea to salamis where he died and was honored with a tomb by the athenians who gave the name of the dogs grave to that part of the island where he was buried this respect to a dog in the most polite people of the world is very observable a modern instance of gratitude to a dog though we have but few such is that the chief order of denmark now injuriously called the order of the elephant was instituted in memory of the fidelity of a dog named wildbrat to one of their kings who had been deserted by his subjects he gave his order this motto or to this effect which still remains wildbrat was faithful sir william trumbull has told me a story which he heard from one that was present king charles i being with some of his court during his troubles a discourse arose what sort of dogs deserved preeminence and it being on all hands agreed to belong either to the spaniel or greyhound the king gave his opinion on the part of the greyhound because said he it has all the goodnature of the other without the fawning a good piece of satire upon his courtiers with which i will conclude my discourse of dogs call me a cynick or what you please in revenge for all this impertinence i will be contented provided you will but believe me when i say a bold word for a christian that of all dogs you will find none more faithful than  your etc  april  0    0 i had written to you sooner but that i made some scruple of sending profane things to you in holy week besides our family would have been scandalized to see me write who take it for granted i write nothing but ungodly verses i assure you i am looked upon in the neighborhood for a very welldisposd person no great hunter indeed but a great admirer of the noble sport and only unhappy in my want of constitution for that and drinking they all say it is pity i am so sickly and i think it is pity they are so healthy but i say nothing that may destroy their good opinion of me i have not quoted one latin author since i came down but have learned without book a song of mr thomas durfeys who is your only poet of tolerable reputation in this country he makes all the merriment in our entertainments and but for him there would be so miserable a dearth of catches that i fear they would put either the parson or me upon making some for em any man of any quality is heartily welcome to the best topeingtable of our gentry who can roar out some rhapsodies of his works so that in the same manner as it was said of homer to his detractors what dares any man speak against him who has given so many men to eat meaning the rhapsodists who lived by repeating his verses thus may it be said of mr durfey to his detractors dares any one despise him who has made so many men drink alas sir this is a glory which neither you nor i must ever pretend to neither you with your ovid nor i with my statius can amuse a whole board of justices and extraordinary squires or gain one hum of approbation or laugh of admiration these things they would say are too studious they may do well enough with such as love reading but give us your ancient poet mr durfey it is mortifying enough it must be confessed but however let us proceed in the way that nature has directed us  multi multa sciunt sed nemo omnia as it is said in the almanac let us communicate our works for our mutual comfort send me elegies and you shall not want heroicks at present i have only these arguments in prose to the thebaid which you claim by promise as i do your translation of pars me sulmo tenet  and the ring the rest i hope for as soon as you can conveniently transcribe em and whatsoever orders you are pleased to give me shall be punctually obeyed by  your etc  may  0    0 i had not so long omitted to express my acknowledgments to you for so much goodnature and friendship as you lately showed me but that i am but just returned to my own hermitage from mr caryls who has done me so many favors that i am almost inclined to think my friends infect one another and that your conversation with him has made him as obliging to me as your self i can assure you he has a sincere respect for you and this i believe he has partly contracted from me who am too full of you not to overflow upon those i converse with but i must now be contented to converse only with the dead of this world that is to say the dull and obscure every way obscure in their intellects as well as their persons or else have recourse to the living dead the old authors with whom you are so well acquainted even from virgil down to aulus gellius whom i do not think a critic by any means to be compared to mr dennis and i must declare positively to you that i will persist in this opinion till you become a little more civil to atticus who could have imagined that he who had escaped all the misfortunes of his time unhurt even by the proscriptions of antony and augustus should in these days find an enemy more severe and barbarous than those tyrants and that enemy the gentlest too the bestnaturd of mortals mr c whom i must in this compare once more to augustus who seemed not more unlike himself in the severity of one part of his life and the clemency of the other than you i leave you to reflect on this and hope that time which mollifies rocks and of stiff things makes limber will turn a resolute critic to a gentle reader and instead of this positive tremendous newfashiond mr c restore unto us our old acquaintance the soft beneficent and courteous mr c  i expect much toward the civilizing of you in your critical capacity from the innocent air and tranquillity of our forest when you do me the favor to visit it in the mean time it would do well by way of preparative if you would duly and constantly every morning read over a pastoral of theocritus or virgil and let the lady isabella put your macrobius and aulus gellius somewhere out of your way for a month or so who knows but traveling and long airing in an open field may contribute more successfully to the cooling a critics severity than it did to the asswaging of mr cheeks anger of old in these fields you will be secure of finding no enemy but the most faithful and affectionate of your friends etc  may       0 after i had recovered from a dangerous illness which was first contracted in town about a fortnight after my coming hither i troubled you with a letter and a paper enclosed which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last i saw you promising me in return some translations of yours from ovid since when i have not had a syllable from your hands so that it is to be feared that though i have escaped death i have not oblivion i should at least have expected you to have finished that elegy upon me which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when i was sick in london if you will but do so much for me first i will give you leave to forget me afterward and for my own part will die at discretion and at my leisure but i fear i must be forced like many learned authors to write my own epitaph if i would be remembered at all monsieur de la fontaines would fit me to a hair but it is a kind of sacrilege do you think it is not to steal epitaphs in my present living dead condition nothing would be properer than oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis but that unluckily i cannot forget my friends and the civilities i received from your self and some others they say indeed it is one quality of generous minds to forget the obligations they have conferred and perhaps too it may be so to forget those on whom they conferred em then indeed i must be forgotten to all intents and purposes i am it must be owned dead in a natural capacity according to mr bicker staff dead in a poetical capacity as a damned author and dead in a civil capacity as a useless member of the commonwealth but reflect drar sir what melancholy effects may ensue if dead men are not civil to one another if he who has nothing to do himself will not comfort and support another in his idleness if those who are to die themselves will not now and then pay the charity of visiting a tomb and a dead friend and strowing a few flowers over him in the shades where i am the inhabitants have a mutual compassion for each other being all alike inanes and umbratiles we saunter to one anothers habitations and daily assist each other in doing nothing at all this i mention for your edification and example that tout plein du vie as you are yet you may not sometimes disdain  desipere in loco though you are no papist and have not so much regard to the dead as to address your self to them which i plainly perceive by your silence yet i hope you are not one of those heterodox who hold them to be totally insensible of the good offices and kind wishes of their living friends and to be in a dull state of sleep without one dream of those they left behind them if you are let this letter convince you to the contrary which assures you i am still though in a state of separation  your etc p s this letter of deaths puts me in mind of poor mr bettertons over whom i would have this sentence of tully for an epitaph vitae been actae jucundissima est recordatio     so much as to cause a total subversion of my countenance some days after to be revenged on her i presented her among other company the following rondeau on that occasion which i desire you to show sapho  you know where you did despise the other day my little eyes little legs and little thighs and some things of little size you know where you it is true have fine black eyes taper legs and tempting thighs yet what more than all we prize is a thing of little size you know where this sort of writing called the rondeau is what i never knew practiced in our nation and i verily believe it was not in use with the greeks or romans neither macrobius nor hyginus taking the least notice of it it is to be observed that the vulgar spelling and pronouncing it round o is a manifest corruption and by no means to be allowed of by critics some may mistakenly imagine that it was a sort of rondeau which the gallick soldiers sung in caesars triumph over gaul  gallias caesar subegit etc as it is recorded by suetonius in julio and so derive its original from the ancient gauls to the modern french but this is erroneous the words there not being ranged according to the laws of the rondeau as laid down by clement marot if you will say that the song of the soldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of poem and so consequently imperfect neither heinsius nor i can be of that opinion and so i conclude that we know nothing of the matter  but sir i ask your pardon for all this buffoonry which i could not address to any one so well as to you since i have found by experience you most easily forgive my impertinencies it is only to show you that i am mindful of you at all times that i write at all times and as nothing i can say can be worth your reading so i may as well throw out what comes uppermost as study to be dull  i am etc  mr c to mr pope july       0 at last i have prevailed over a lazy humor to transcribe this elegy i have changed the situation of some of the latin verses and made some interpolations but i hope they are not absurd and foreign to my authors sense and manner but they are referred to your censure as a debt whom i esteem no less a critic than a poet i expect to be treated with the same rigor as i have practiced to mr dryden and you  hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicessim   i desire the favor of your opinion why priam in his speech to pyrrhus in the second aeneid says this to him at non ille satum quo te mentiris achilles   he would intimate i fancy by pyrrbuss answer only his degeneracy but then these following lines of the version i suppose from homers history seem absurd in the mouth of priam viz he cheered my sorrows and for sums of gold the bloodless carcass of my hector sold   i am your etc  mr popes answer july  0    0 i give you thanks for the version you sent me of ovids elegy it is very much an image of that authors writing who has an agreeableness that charms us without correctness like a mistress whose faults we see but love her with them all you have very judiciously altered his method in some places and i can find nothing which i dare insist upon as an error what i have written in the margins being merely guesses at a little improvement rather than criticisms i assure you i do not expect you should subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge em agreeable to reason and good sense what i have done is not as a critic but as a friend i know too well how many qualities are requisite to make up the one and that i want almost all i can reckon up but i am sure i do not want inclination nor i hope capacity to be the other nor shall i take it at all amiss that another dissents from my opinion it is no more than i have often done from my own and indeed the more a man advances in understanding he becomes the more every day a critic upon himself and finds something or other still to blame in his former notions and opinions i could be glad to know if you have translated the   th elegy of lib   ad amicam navigantem the  th of book   or the   th of book   which are above all others my particular favorites especially the last of these  as to the passage of which you ask my opinion in the second aeneid it is either so plain as to require no solution or else which is very probable you see farther into it than i can priam would say that  achilles whom surely you only feign to be your father since your actions are so different from his did not use me thus inhumanly he blushed at his murder of hector when he saw my sorrows for him and restored his dead body to me to be buried to this the answer of pyrrhus seems to be agreeable enough go then to the shades and tell achilles how i degenerate from him granting the truth of what priam had said of the difference between them indeed mr drydens mentioning here what virgil more judiciously passes in silence the circumstance of achilless selling for money the body of hector seems not so proper it in some measure lessening the character of achilless generosity and piety which is the very point of which priam endeavors in this place to convince his son and to reproach him with the want of but the truth of this circumstance is no way to be questioned being expressly taken from homer who represents achilles weeping for priam yet receiving the gold iliad    for when he gives the body he uses these words o my friend patroclus forgive me that i quit the corpse of him who killed thee i have great gifts in ransom for it which i will bestow upon thy funeral  i am etc  mr c to mr pope aag      0 looking among some french rhymes i was agreeably surpised to find in the rondeau of in voitures poems pour le moins  your apoticaire and lavement which i took for your own so much is your muse of intelligence with the wits of all languages you have refined upon voiture whose ou vous scavez is much inferior to your you know where  you do not only pay your club with your author as our friend says but the whole reckoning who can form such pretty lines from so trivial a hint  for my ovid s amorum l   el    pars me sulmo etc elegy it is confessed that the topography of sulmo in the latin makes but an awkward figure in the version your couplet of the dog star is very fine but may be too sublime in this place i laughed heartily at your note upon paradise for to make ovid talk of the garden of eden is certainly most absurd but xenophon in his oeconomicks speaking of a garden finely planted and watered as is here described calls it paradisos it is an interpolation indeed and serves for a gradation to the caelestial orb which expresses in some sort the sidus castoris in part coeli  how trees can enjoy let the naturalists determine but the poets make em sensitive lovers bachelors and married virgil in his georgicks lib   horace ode    lib   platanus coelebs evincet ulmos epod   ergo aut adulta vitium propagine altas maritat populos your critique is a very dolcepiccante for after the many faults you justly find you smooth your rigor but an obliging thing is owing you think to one who so much esteems and admires you and who shall ever be  your etc  august       0 your letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement utterly forgotten of all his friends but you for since mr wycherley left london i have not heard a word from him though just before and once since i writ to him and though i know my self guilty of no offense but of doing sincerely just what he correcting his verses see the letters in   0  and the following years of mr wycherley and mr pope bid me  hoc mihi libertas hoc pia lingua dedit but the greatest injury he does me is the keeping me in ignorance of his welfare which i am always very sollicitous for and very uneasy in the fear of any indisposition that may befall him in what i sent you some time ago you have not verse enough to be severe upon in revenge for my last criticism in one point i must persist that is to say my dislike of your paradise in which i take no pleasure i know very well that in greek it is not only used by xenophon but is a common word for any garden but in english it bears the signification and conveys the idea of eden which alone is i think a reason against making ovid use it who will be thought to talk too like a christian in your version at least whatever it might have been in latin or greek as for all the rest of my remarks since you do not laugh at them as at this i can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon em as i think i told you before and in particular in the point of trees enjoying you have i must own fully satisfied me that the expression is not only defensible but beautiful i shall be very glad to see your translation of the elegy ad amicam navigantem as soon as you can for without a complement to you every thing you write either in verse or prose is welcome to me and you may be confident if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing that i will never be unsincere though i may be often mistaken to use sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin from whom i have experienced so much of it and i need not tell you how much i really esteem you when i esteem nothing in the world so much as that quality i know you sometimes say civil things to me in your epistolary style but those i am to make allowance for as particularly when you talk of admiring it is a word you are so used to in conversation of ladies that it will creep into your discourse in spite of you even to your friends but as women when they think themselves secure of admiration commit a thousand negligences which show them so much at disadvantage and off their guard as to lose the little real love they had before so when men imagine others entertain some esteem for their abilities they often expose all their imperfections and foolish works to the disparagement of the little wit they were thought masters of i am going to exemplify this to you in putting into your hands being encouraged by so much indulgence some verses of my youth or rather childhood which as i was a great admirer of waller were intended in imitation of his manner and are perhaps such imitations as those you see in awkward country dames of the fine and wellbred ladies of the court if you will take em with you into lincolnshire they may save you one hour from the conversation of the country gentlemen and their tenants who differ but in dress and name which if it be there as bad as here is even worse than my poetry i hope your stay there will be no longer than as mr wycherley calls it to rob the country and run away to london with your money in the mean time i beg the favor of a line from you and am as i will never cease to be  your etc  october       0 i deferred answering your last upon the advice i received that you were leaving the town for some time and expected your return with impatience having then a design of seeing my friends there among the first of which i have reason to account your self but my almost continual illnesses prevent that as well as most other satisfactions of my life however i may say one good thing of sickness that it is the best cure in nature for ambition and designs upon the world or fortune it makes a man pretty indifferent for the future provided he can but be easy by intervals for the present he will be content to compound for his quiet only and leave all the circumstantial part and pomp of life to those who have a health vigorous enough to enjoy all the mistresses of their desires i thank god there is nothing out of my self which i would be at the trouble of seeking except a friend a happiness i once hoped to have possessed in mr wycherley but  quantum mutatus ab illo  i have for some years been employed much like children that build houses with cards endeavoring very busily and eagerly to raise a friendship which the first breath of any illnatured bystander could puff away  but i will trouble you no farther with writing nor my self with thinking of this subject  i was mightily pleased to perceive by your quotation from voiture that you had trackd me so far as france you see it is with weak heads as with weak stomachs they immediately throw out what they received last and what they read floats upon the surface of their mind like oil upon water without incorporating this i think however cannot be said of the loveverses i last troubled you with where all i am afraid is so puerile and so like the author that no body will suspect any thing to be borrowed yet you as a friend entertaining a better opinion of em it seems searched in waller but searched in vain your judgment of em is i think very right  for it was my own opinion before if you think em not worth the trouble of correcting pray tell me so freely and it will save me a labor if you think the contrary you would particularly oblige me by your remarks on the several thoughts as they occur i long to be nibling at your verses and have not forgot who promised me ovids elegy ad amicam navigantem had ovid been as long composing it as you in sending it the lady might have sailed to gades and received it at her return i have really a great itch of criticism upon me but want matter here in the country which i desire you to furnish me with as i do you in the town sic servat studii faedera quisque sui   i am obliged to mr caryl whom you tell me you met at epsom for telling you truth as a man is in these days to any one that will tell truth to his advantage and i think none is more to mine than what he told you and i should be glad to tell all the world that i have an extreme affection and esteem for you tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes unum opus and requiem pariter disponimus ambo atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa   by these epulae as i take it persius meant the portugal snuff and burned claret which he took with his master cornutus and the verecunda mensa was without dispute some coffeehouse table of the ancients  i will only observe that these four lines are as elegant and musical as any in persius not excepting those six or seven which mr dryden quotes as the only such in all that author  i could be heartily glad to repeat the satisfaction described in them being truly  your etc  october       0 i am glad to find by your last letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend setting down your thoughts as they occur and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own trifles which i assure you i never valued half so much as i do that sincerity in you which they were the occasion of discovering to me and which while i am happy in i may be trusted with that dangerous weapon poetry since i shall do nothing with it but after asking and following your advice i value sincerity the more as i find by sad experience the practice of it is more dangerous writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their verses even though themselves pronounce sentence upon them  as to mr philipss pastorals i take the first to be infinitely the best and the second the worst the third is for the greatest part a translation from virgils daphnis i will not forestal your judgment of the rest only observe in that of the nightingale these lines speaking of the musicians playing on the harp now lightly skimming over the strings they pass like winds that gently brush the plying grass and melting airs arise at their command and now laborious with a weighty hand he sinks into the cords with solemn pace and gives the swelling tones a manly grace   to which nothing can be objected but that they are too lofty for pastoral especially being put into the mouth of a shepherd as they are here in the poets own person they had heen i believe more proper these are more after virgils manner than that of theocritus whom yet in the character of pastoral he rather seems to imitate in the whole i agree with the tatler that we have no better eclogues in our language there is a small copy of the same author published in the tatler no    on the danish winter it is poetical painting and i recommend it to your perusal  dr garths poem i have not seen but believe i shall be of that critics opinion you mention at wills who swore it was good for though i am very cautious of swearing after critics yet i think one may do it more safely when they commend than when they blame  i agree with you in your censure of the use of seaterms in mr drydens virgil not only because helenus was no great prophet in those matters but because no terms of art or cantwords suit with the majesty and dignity of style which epic poetry requires  cui mens divinior atque os magna soniturum  the tarpawlin phrase can please none but such qui aurem habent batavam they must not expect auribus atticis probari i find by you i think i have brought in two phrases of martial here very dexterously  though you say you did not rightly take my meaning in the verse i quoted from juvenal yet i will not explain it because though it seems you are resolved to take me for a critic i would by no means be thought a commentator  and for another reason too because i have quite forgot both the verse and the application  i hope it will be no offense to give my most hearty service to mr wycherly though i perceive by his last to me i am not to trouble him with my letters since he there told me he was going instantly out of town and till his return was my servant etc i guess by yours he is yet with you and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honor that is assure him i have ever borne all the respect and kindness imaginable to him i do not know to this hour what it is that has estranged him from me but this i know that he may for the future be more safely my friend since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him i could not have thought any man had been so very cautious and suspicious as not to credit his own experience of a friend indeed to believe no body may be a maxim of safety but not so much of honesty there is but one way i know of conversing safely with all men that is not by concealing what we say or do but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be concealed and i can truly boast this comfort in my affairs with mr wycherly but i pardon his jealousy which is become his nature and shall never be his enemy whatsoever he says of me  your etc  mr c to mr pope nov      0 i find i am obliged to the sight of your loveverses for your opinion of my sincerity which had never been called in question if you had not forced me upon so many other occasions to express my esteem  i have just read and compared pieces printed in the  th vol of tonsons miscellanies mr rows version of the  th of lucan with very great pleasure where i find none of those absurdities so frequent in that of virgil except in two places for the sake of lashing the priests one where cato says  sortilegis egeant dubii  and one in the simile of the haemorhois  fatidici sabaei  he is so errant a whig that he strains even beyond his author in passion for liberty and aversion to tyranny and errs only in amplification lucan in initio   ni describing the feat of the semidei manes says quodque patet terras inter lunaeque meatus semidei manes habitant  mr row has this line then looking down on the suns feeble ray pray your opinion if there be an errorsphaericus in this or no  yours etc  nov       0 you mistake me very much in thinking the freedom you kindly used with my loveverses gave me the first opinion of your sincerity i assure you it only did what every goodnatured action of yours has done since confirmed me more in that opinion the fable of the nightingale in philipss pastoral is taken from famianus stradas latin poem on the same subject in his prolusiones academicae only the tomb he erects at the end is added from virgils conclusion of the culex i cannot forbear giving you a passage out of the latin poem i mention by which you will find the english poet is indebted to it alternat mira art fides dum torquet acutas inciditque graves operoso verbere pulsat  jamque manu per fila volat simul hos simul illos explorat numeros chordaque laborat in omni  mox silet illa modis totidem respondit and artem art refert nunc ceu rudis aut incerta canendi praebet iter liquidum labenti e pectore voci nunc caesim variat modulisque canora minutis delibrat vocem tremuloque reciprocat ore   this poem was many years since imitated by crashaw out of whose verses the following are very remarkable from this to that from that to this he flies feels musicks pulse in all its arteries caught in a net which there apollo spreads his fingers struggle with the vocal threads   i have as i think i formerly told you a very good opinion of mr rows  th book of lucan indeed he amplifies too much as well as brebaeuf the famous french imitator if i remember right he sometimes takes the whole comment into the text of the version as particularly in lin  0  utque solet pariter totis se effundere signis corycii pressura croci  and in the place you quote he makes of those two lines in the latin vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret nostra dies risitque sui ludibria trunci no less than eight in english  what you observe sure cannot be an error sphaericus strictly speaking either according to their ptolomaick or our copernican system tycho brahe himself will be on the translators side for mr row here says no more than that he looked down on the rays of the sun which pompey might do even though the body of the sun were above him  you cannot but have remarked what a journey lucan here makes cato take for the sake of his fine descriptions from cyrene he travels by land for no better reason than this haec eadem sua debat hyems quae clauserat aequor the winters effects on the sea it seems were more to be dreaded than all the serpents whirlwinds sands etc by land which immediately after he paints out in his speech to the soldiers then he fetches a compass a vast way round about to the nasamones and jupiter ammons temple purely to ridicule the oracles and labienus must pardon me if i do not believe him when he says  sors obtulit and fortuna viae  either labienus or the map is very much mistaken here thence he returns back to the syrtes which he might have taken first in his way to utica and so to leptis minor where our author leaves him who seems to have made cato speak his own mind when he tells his army  ire sat est  no matter whither i am  your etc  mr c to mr pope nov  0    0 the system of tycho brahe were it true as it is novel could have no room here lucan with the rest of the latin poets seems to follow plato whose order of the spheres is clear in cicero de natura deorum de somnio scipionis and in macrobius the seat of the semidei manes is platonic too for apuleius de deo socratis assigns the same to the genii viz the region of the air for their intercourse with gods and men so that i fancy row mistook the situation and i cannot be reconciled to look down on the suns rays i am glad you agree with me about the latitude he takes and wish you had told me if the sortilegi and fatidici could license his invectives against priests but i suppose you think them with helena undeserving of your protection i agree with you in lucans errors and the cause of em his poetic descriptions for the romans then knew the coast of africa from cyrene to the southeast of which lies ammon toward egypt to leptis and utica but pray remember how your homer nodded while ulysses slept and waking knew not where he was in the short passage from corcyra to ithaca i like trapps versions for their justness his psalm is excellent the prodigies in the first georgick judicious whence i conclude that it is easier to turn virgil justly in blank verse than rhyme the eclogue of gailus and fable of phaeton pretty well but he is very faulty in his numbers the fate of phaeton might run thus  the blasted phaeton with blazing hair shot gliding through the vast abyss of air and tumbled headlong like a falling star   i am your etc  mr popes answer nov       0 to make use of that freedom and familiarity of style which we have taken up in our correspondence and which is more properly talking upon paper than writing i will tell you without any preface that i never took tycho brahe for one of the ancients or in the least an acquaintance of lucans nay it is a mercy on this occasion that i do not give you an account of his life and conversation as how he lived some years like an enchanted knight in a certain island with a tale of a king of denmarks mistress that shall be nameless  but i have compassion on you and would not for the world you should stay any longer among the genii and semidei manes you know where for if once you get so near the moon sapho will want your presence in the clouds and inferior regions not to mention the great loss drury lane will sustain when mr c is in the milky way these celestial thoughts put me in mind of the priests you mention who are a sort of sortilegi in one sense because in their lottery there are more blanks than prizes the adventurers being at best in an uncertainty whereas the settersup are sure of something priests indeed in their character as they represent god are sacred and so are constables as they represent the king but you will own a great many of em are very odd fellows and the devil a bit of likeness in em yet i can assure you i honor the good as much as i detest the bad and i think that in condemning these we praise those i am so far from esteeming even the worst unworthy of my protection that i have defended their character in congreves and vanbrughs plays even against their own brethren and so much for priests in general now for trapp in particular whose translations from ovid i have not so good an opinion of as you not i will assure you from any sort of prejudice to him as a priest but because i think he has little of the main characteristick of his author a graceful easiness for let the sense be ever so exactly rendered unless an author looks like himself in his air habit manner it is a disguise and not a translation but as to the psalm i think david is much more beholding to him than ovid and as he treated the roman like a jew so he has made the jew speak like a roman  your etc  mr c to mr pope december      0 the same judgment we made on rows  th of lucan will serve for his part of the  th where i find this memorable line parque novum fortuna videt concurrere bellum atque virum for this he employs six verses among which is this as if on knightly terms in lists they ran pray can you trace chivalry up higher than pharamond will you allow it an anachronism  tickell in his version of the phaenix from claudian when nature ceases thou shall still remain nor second chaos bound thy endless reign claudian thus et clades te nulla rapit solusque superstes edomita tellure manes  which plainly refers to the deluge of deucalion and the conflagration of phaeton not to the final dissolution your thought of the priests lottery is very fine you play the wit and not the critic upon the errors of your brother  your observations are all very just virgil is eminent for adjusting his diction to his sentiments and among the moderns i find your practice the prosodia of your rules your to a lady with the works of voiture poem shows you to be what you say of voiture with books wellbred the state of the fair though satirical is touched with that delicacy and gallantry that not the court of augustus nor  but hold i shall lose what i lately recovered your opinion of my sincerity yet i must say it is as faultless as the fair to whom it is addressed be she never so perfect the m g who it seems had no right notion of you as you of him transcribed it by lucubration from some discourse of yours he thought your inclination led you to what the men of fashion call learning pedantry but now he says he has no less i assure you than a veneration for you  your etc  mr pope to mr c december       0 it seems that my late mention of crashaw and my quotation from him has moved your curiosity i therefore send you the whole author who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years in which time having read him twice or thrice i find him one of those whose works may just deserve reading i take this poet to have writ like a gentleman that is at leisure hours and more to keep out of idleness than to establish a reputation so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him all that regards design form fable which is the soul of poetry all that concerns exactness or consent of parts which is the body will probably be wanting only pretty conceptions fine metaphors glittering expressions and something of a neat cast of verse which are properly the dress gems or loose ornaments of poetry may be found in these verses this is indeed the case of most other poetical writers of miscellanies nor can it well be otherwise since no man can be a true poet who writes for diversion only these authors should be considered as versifiers and witty men rather than as poets and under this head will only fall the thoughts the expression and the numbers these are only the pleasing parts of poetry which may be judged of at a view and comprehended all at once and to express my self like a painter their coloring entertains the sight but the lines and life of the picture are not to be inspected too narrowly  this author formed himself upon petrarch or rather upon marino his thoughts one may observe in the main are pretty but oftentimes far fetched and too often strained and stiffned to make them appear the greater for men are never so apt to think a thing great as when it is odd or wonderful and inconsiderate authors would rather be admired than understood this ambition of surprising a reader is the true natural cause of all fustian or bombast in poetry to confirm what i have said you need but look into his first poem of the weeper where the  d  th  th   th   st stanzas are as sublimely dull as the  th  th  th   th   th  0th and   d stanzas of the same copy are soft and pleasing and if these last want any thing it is an easier and more unaffected expression the remaining thoughts in that poem might have been spared being either but repetitions or very trivial and mean and by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest to be like this a mixture of tender gentile thoughts and suitable expressions of forced and inextricable conceits and of needless fillersup to the rest from all which it is plain this author writ fast and set down what came uppermost a reader may skim off the froth and use the clear underneath but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs either the top or bottom of him are good for little but what he did in his own natural middleway is best  to speak of his numbers is a little difficult they are so various and irregular and mostly pindarick it is evident his heroic verse the best example of which is his musicks duel is carelessly made up but one may imagine from what it now is that had he taken more care it had been musical and pleasing enough not extremely majestic but sweet and the time considered of his writing he was even as uncorrect as he is none of the worst versificators  i will just observe that the best pieces of this author are a paraphrase on psalm    on lessius epitaph on mr ashton wishes to his supposed mistress and the dies irae  i am etc  mr pope to mr c december  0    0 i resume my old liberty of throwing out my self upon paper to you and making what thoughts float uppermost in my head the subject of a letter they are at present upon laughter which for ought i know may be the cause you might sometimes think me too remiss a friend when i was most entirely so for i am never so inclined to mirth as when i am most pleased and most easy which is in the company of a friend like your self  as the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness not disrespect so is raillery with a friend i know there are prudes in friendship who expect distance awe and adoration but i know you are not of them and i for my part am no idolworshipper though a papist if i were to address jupiter himself in a heathen way i fancy i should be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner if not of his beard like dionysius i was just going to say of his buttons but i think jupiter wore none however i will not be positive to so nice a critic as you but his robe might be subnected with a fibula i know some philosophers define laughter a recommending our selves to our own favor by comparison with the weakness of another but i am sure i very rarely laugh with that view nor do i believe children have any such consideration in their heads when they express their pleasure this way i laugh full as innocently as they for the most part and as sillily there is a difference too betwixt laughing about a thing and laughing at a thing one may find the inferior man to make a kind of casuistical distinction provoked to folly at the sight or observation of some circumstance of a thing when the thing itself appears solemn and august to the superior man that is out judgment and reason let an ambassador speak the best sense in the world and deport himself in the most graceful manner before a prince yet if the tail of his shirt happen as i have known it happen to a very wise man to hang out behind more people shall laugh at that than attend to the other till they recollect themselves and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the minister i must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you several muscles of my face sometimes take an impertinent liberty with my judgment but then my judgment soon rises and sets all right again about my mouth and i find i value no man so much as he in whose sight i have been playing the fool i cannot be subpersona before a man i love and not to laugh with honesty when nature prompts or folly which is more a second nature than any thing i know is but a knavish hypocritical way of making a mask of ones own face  to conclude those that are my friends i laugh with and those that are not i laugh at so am merry in company and if ever i am wise it is all by my self you take just another course and to those that are not your friends are very civil and to those that are very endearing and complaisant thus when you and i meet there will be the risus and blanditiae united together in conversation as they commonly are in a verse but without laughter on the one side or compliment on the other i assure you i am with real esteem  yours etc  mr c to mr pope october         mr wycherley visited me at the bath in my sickness and expressed much affection to me hearing from me how welcome his letters would be he presently writ to you in which i inserted my scrall and after a second he went to gloucester in his way to salop but was disappointed of a boat and so returned to the bath then he showed me your answer to his letters in which you speak of my good nature but i fear you found me very froward at reading yet you allow for my illness i could not possibly be in the same house with mr wycherley though i sought it earnestly nor come up to town with him he being engaged with others but whenever we met we talked of you he praises your essay on criticism poem and even outvies me in kind expressions of you as if he had not wrote two letters to you he was for writing every post i put him in mind he had already forgive me this wrong i know not whither my talking so much of your great humanity and tenderness to me and love to him or whether the return of his natural disposition to you was the cause but certainly you are now highly in his favor now he will come this winter to your house and i must go with him but first he will invite you speedily to town  i arrived on saturday last much wearied yet had wrote sooner but was told by mr gay who has writ a pretty poem to lintot and who gives you his service that you was gone from home lewis showed me your letter which set me right and your next letter is impatiently expected by me mr wycherley came to town on sunday last and kindly surpised me with a visit on monday morning we dined and drank together and i saying to our loves he replied it is mr pope s health he said he would go to mr thorolds and leave a letter for you though i cannot answer for the event of all this in respect to him yet i can assure you that when you please to come you will be most desirable to me as always by inclination so now by duty who shall ever be  your etc  mr pope to mr c nov         i received the entertainment of your letter the day after i had sent you one of mine and i am but this morning returned hither the news you tell me of the many difficulties you found in your return from bath gives me such a kind of pleasure as we usually take in accompanying our friends in their mixed adventures for methinks i see you laboring through all your inconveniences of the rough roads the hard saddle the trotting horse and what not what an agreeable surprise would it have been to me to have met you by pure accident which i was within an ace of doing and to have carried you off triumphantly set you on an easier pad and relieved the wandering knight with a nights lodging and rural repast at our castle in the forest but these are only the pleasing imaginations of a disappointed lover who must suffer in a melancholy absence yet these two months in the mean time i take up with the muses for want of your better company the muses quae nobiscum pernoctant peregrinantur rusticantur those aerial ladies just discover enough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit and draw me on in a wandering maze of thought still in hopes and only in hopes of attaining those favors from em which they confer on their more happy admirers we grasp some more beautiful idea in our own brain than our endeavors to express it can set to the view of others and still do but labor to fall short of our first imagination the gay coloring which fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it goes off in the execution like those various figures in the gilded clouds which while we gaze long upon to separate the parts of each imaginary image the whole faints before the eye and decays into confusion  i am highly pleased with the knowledge you give me of mr wycherleys present temper which seems so favorable to me i shall ever have such a fund of affection for him as to be agreeable to my self when i am so to him and cannot but be gay when he is in good humor as the surface of the earth if you will pardon a poetical similitude is clearer or gloomier just as the sun is brighter or more overcast  i should be glad to see the verses to lintot which you mention for methinks something oddly agreeable may be produced from that subject  for what remains i am so well that nothing but the assurance of your being so can make me better and if you would have me live with any satisfaction these dark days in which i cannot see you it must be by your writing sometimes to  your etc  mr c to mr pope dec        mr wycherley has i believe sent you two or three letters of invitation but you like the fair will be long solicited before you yield to make the favor the more acceptable to the lover he is much yours by his talk for that unbounded genius which has ranged at large like a libertine now seems confined to you and i should take him for your mistress too by your simile of the sun and earth it is very fine but inverted by the application for the gaiety of your fancy and the drooping of his by the withdrawing of your luster persuades me it would be juster by the reverse oh happy favorite of the muses how pernoctare all night long with them but alas you do but toy but skirmish with them and decline a close engagement leave elegy and translation to the inferior class on wbom the muses only glance now and then like our wintersun and then leave em in the dark think on the dignity of tragedy which is of the greater poetry as dennis says and foil him at his other weapon as you have done in criticism every one wonders that a genius like yours will not support the sinking drama and mr wilks though i think his talent is comedy has expressed a furious ambition to swell in your buskins we have had a poor comedy of johnsons not ben which held seven nights and has got him three hundred pounds for the town is sharpset on new plays in vain would i fire you by interest or ambition when your mind is not susceptible of either though your authority arising from the general esteem like that of pompey must infallibly assure you of success for which in all your wishes you will be attended with those of  your etc  mr pope to mr c december         if i have not writ to you so soon as i ought let my writing now atone for the delay as it will infallibly do when you know what a sacrifice i make you at this time and that every moment my eyes are employed upon this paper they are taken off from two of the finest faces in the universe but indeed it is some consolation to me to reflect that while i but write this period i escape some hundred fatal darts from those unerring eyes and about a thousand deaths or better now you that delight in dying would not once have dreamt of an absent friend in these circumstances you that are so nice an admirer of beauty or as a critic would say after terence so elegant a spectator of forms you must have a sober dish of coffee and a solitary candle at your side to write an epistle lucubratory to your friend whereas i can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights that outshine the golden god of day and silver goddess of night with all the refulgent eyes of the firmament  you fancy now that saphos eyes are two of these my tapers but it is no such matter sir these are eyes that have more persuasion in one glance than all saphos oratory and gesture together let her put her body into what moving postures she pleases indeed indeed my friend you could never have found so improper a time to tempt me with interest or ambition let me but have the reputation of these in my keeping and as for my own let the devil or let dennis take it for ever how gladly would i give all i am worth that is to say my pastorals for one of them and my essay for the other i would lay out all my poetry in love an original for a lady and a translation for a waiting maid alas what have i to do with jane gray as long as miss molly miss betty or miss patty are in this world shall i write of beauties murdered long ago when there are those at this instant that murder me i will even compose my own tragedy and the poet shall appear in his own person to move compassion twill be far more effectual than bayss entering with a rope about his neck and the world will own there never was a more miserable object brought upon the stage  now you that are a critic pray inform me in what manner i may connect the foregoing part of this letter with that which is to follow according to the rules i would willingly return mr gay my thanks for the favor of his poem and in particular for his kind mention of me i hoped when i heard a new comedy had met with success upon the stage that it had been his to which i really wish no less and had it been any way in my power should have been very glad to have contributed to its introduction into the world his verses to lintot these verses are printed in dr swifts and our authors miscellanies in   vols  vo have put a whim into my head which you are like to be troubled with in the opposite page take it as you find it the production of half an hour the other morning i design very soon to put a task of a more serious nature upon you in reviewing a piece of mine that may better deserve criticism and by that time you have done with it i hope to tell you in person with how much fidelity i am  your etc  letters to several ladies letter i madam i send you the book of rudiments of drawing which you were pleased to command and think my self obliged to inform you at the same time of one of the many excellencies you possess without knowing of em you are but too good a painter already and no picture of raphaels was ever so beautiful as that which you have formed in a certain heart of my acquaintance indeed it was but just that the finest lines in nature should be drawn upon the most durable ground and none could ever be met with that would so readily receive or so faithfully retain them as this heart i may boldly say of it that you will not find its fellow in all the parts of the body in this book but i must complain to you of my hand which is an arrant traitor to my heart for having been copying your picture from thence and from kneller these three days it has done all possible injury to the finest face that ever was made and to the liveliest image that ever was drawn i have imagination enough in your absence to trace some resemblance of you but i have been so long used to lose my judgment at the sight of you that it is past my power to correct it by the life your picture seems least like when placed before your eyes and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifest disadvantage by being set in the fairest light in the world the painters are a very vain generation and have a long time pretended to rival nature but to own the truth to you she made such a finished piece about three and twenty years ago i beg your pardon madam i protest i meant but two and twenty that it is in vain for them any longer to contend with her i know you indeed made one something like it betwixt five and six years past twas a little girl done with abundance of spirit and life and wants nothing but time to be an admirable piece but not to flatter your work i dont think twill ever come up to what your father made however i would not discourage you it is certain you have a strange happiness in making fine things of a sudden and at a stroke with incredible ease and pleasure  madam i am etc  letter ii it is too much a rule in this town that when a lady has once done a man a favor he is to be rude to her ever after it becomes our sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allows us by this method i may write to you most impudently because you once answered me modestly and if you should never do me that honor for the future i am to think like a true coxcomb that your silence gives consent perhaps you wonder why this is addressed to you rather than to mrs m with whom i have the right of an old acquaintance whereas you are a fine lady have bright eyes etc first madam i make choice of you rather than of your mother because you are younger than your mother secondly because i fancy you spell better as having been at school later thirdly because you have nothing to do but to write if you please and possibly it may keep you from employing your self worse it may save some honest neighboring gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances cast your eyes upon paper madam there you may look innocently men are seducing books are dangerous the amorous ones soften you and the godly ones give you the spleen if you look upon trees they clasp in embraces birds and beasts make love the sun is too warm for your blood the moon melts you into yiedling and melancholy therefore i say once more cast your eyes upon paper and read only such letters as i write which convey no darts no flames but proceed from innocence of soul and simplicity of heart however i can allow you a bonnet lined with green for your eyes but take care you dont tarnish it with ogling too fiercely i am told that hand you shade your self with this shining weather is tanned pretty much only with being carried over those eyes  thank god i am an hundred miles off from them  upon the whole i would sooner trust your hand than your eyes for doing me mischief and though i doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepared since i may have time while i break open your letter to cross my self and say a paternoster i hope providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance mr b tells me you are at this hour as handsome as an angel for my part i have forgot your face since two winters i dont know whether you are tall or short nor can tell in any respect what sort of creature you are only that you are a very mischievous one whom i shall ever pray to be defended from but when mr b sends me word you have the small pox a good many freckles or are very pale i will desire him to give thanks for it in your parish church which as soon as he shall inform me he has done i will make you a visit at  without armor i will eat any thing you give me without suspicion of poison take you by the hand without gloves nay venture to follow you into an arbor without calling the company this madam is the top of my wishes but how differently are our desires inclined you sigh out in the ardour of your heart oh play houses parks operas assemblies london i cry with rapture oh woods gardens rookeries fishponds arbours mrs betty m  letter iii to a lady written on the opposite pages of a letter to her husband from lady m the wits would say that this must needs be a dull letter because it is a married one i am afraid indeed you will find what spirit there is must be on the side of the wife and the husbands part as usual will prove the dullest what an unequal pair are put together in this sheet in which though we sin it is you must do penance when you look on both sides of this paper you may fancy that our words according to a scripture expression are as a twoedged sword whereof lady m is the shining blade and i only the handle but i cannot proceed without so far mortifying sir robert as to tell him that she writes this purely in obedience to me and that it is but one of those honors a husband receives for the sake of his wife  it is making court ill to one fine woman to show her the regard we have for another and yet i must own there is not a period of this epistle but squints toward another overagainst it it will be in vain to dissemble your penetrating eyes cannot but discover how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after lady ms letters which seem to bend as much from mine and fly from them as fast as they are able ungrateful letters that they are which give themselves to another man in the very presence of him who will yield to no mortal in knowing how to value them  you will think i forget my self and am not writing to you but let me tell you it is you forget your self in that thought for you are almost the only woman to whom one can safely address the praises of another besides can you imagine a man of my importance so stupid as to say fine things to you before your husband let us see how far lady m her self dares do any thing like it with all the wit and address she is mistress of if sir robert can be so ignorant now he is left to himself in the country to imagine any such matter let him know from me that here in town every thing that lady says is taken for satire for my part every body knows it is my constant practice to speak truth and i never do it more than when i call my self  your etc  letter iv to a lady in the name of her brother if you have not a chaste ear and a pure heart do not peruse this letter for as jeremy tailor says in his holy living and dying the first thing a virgin ought to endeavor is to be ignorant of the distinction of sexes  it is in the confidence i have that you are thus innocent that i endeavor to gratify your curiosity in a point in which i am sensible none but a brother could do it with decency  i shall entertain you with the most reigning curiosity in the town i mean a person who is equally the toast of gentlemen and ladies and is at present more universally admired than any of either sex you know few proficients have a greater genius for monsters than my self but i never tasted a monster to that degree i have done this creature it was not like other monsters produced in the deserts of arabia nor came from the country of the great mogul but is the production of the jointendeavours of a kentish parson and his spouse who intended in the singleness of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex and providence has sent them one of two  there are various opinions concerning this creature about town mr cromwell observes that the age is very licentious and the present reign very lewd and corrupt in permitting a lady by authority as appears by the printed bills to expose her personal curiosities for a shilling  mr p looks upon it as a prodigy portending some great revolution in the state to strengthen which opinion he produces the following prophecy of nostradamus which he explains politically when as two sexes joined in one shall in the realm of brute be shown then factions shall unite if i know to choose a prince jure divino this prodigy of common gender is neither sex but a pretender so the lord shield the faiths defender   mrs n admires what people wonder at so much and says she is just so her self the duchess of s is of the same opinion  among these various conjectures that i might be informed of the truth i took along with me a physician and a divine the one to inspect the state of its body the other to examine that of its mind the persons i made choice of were the ingenious dr p and the reverend mr  we were no sooner in the room but the party came to us dressed in that habit in which the ladies affect an hermophroditical imitation of men  your sharp wit my dear sister will immediately conclude that i mean a ridinghabit  i think it not material to inform you whether the doctor the divine or my self looked first the priest you will maliciously fancy was in his nature most an infidel and doubted most of this miracle we therefore proposed to him to take the surest method of believing seeing and feeling he complied with both admonitions and having taken a large pinch of snuff upon it advised us with a nod that we should by no means regard it as a female but as a male for by so doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness  the doctor upon inspection differed from this opinion he would by no means allow it a miracle or at most a natural one he said upon the whole it was a woman that whatever might give a handle to think otherwise was a trifle nothing being more common than for a child to be marked with that thing which the mother longed for  as for this partys temper of mind it appears to be a most even disposition partaking of the good qualities of both sexes for she is neither so inaccessible as other ladies nor is he so impudent as other gentlemen of how obliging and complaisant a turn appears by this that he tells the ladies he has the inclinations of a gentleman and that she tells the gentlemen she has the tender of a lady as a further proof of this affable disposition he formerly received visits of the fair sex in their masks till an impertinent fellow in a female disguise mingled with a party of ladies and impudently overheard their improving speculations  notwithstanding this she civilly promised at my request that my two sisters should be admitted privately whenever you would do her the honor of your consideration  how agreeable soever this sight has been to me i assure you it cannot be so pleasing as the sight of you in town and whatever you may see in the country i dare affirm no man or woman can show you the like  i therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this place for though indeed like most other brothers i should be sorry you were married at my expense yet i would by no means like them detain you in the country from your admirers for you may believe me no brother in the world ever loved a sister as i do you  i am etc  letter v bath      you are to understand madam that my passion for your fair self and your sister has been divided with the most wonderful regularity in the world even from my infancy i have been in love with one after the other of you week by week and my journey to bath fell out in the three hundred seventy sixth week of the reign of my sovereign lady sylvia at the present writing hereof it is the three hundred eighty ninth week of the reign of your most serene majesty in whose service i was listed some weeks before i beheld your sister this information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter as either shall happen to be queenregent at that time  pray tell your sister all the good qualities and virtuous inclinations she has never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation as that one vice of her obstinacy will give me mortification this month ratcliffe commands her to the bath and she refuses indeed if i were in berkshire i should honor her for this obstinacy and magnify her no less for disobedience than we do the barcelonians but people change with the change of places as we see of late and virtues become vices when they cease to be for ones interest with me as with others  yet let me tell her she will never look so finely while she is upon earth as she would here in the water it is not here as in most other instances for those ladies that would please extremely must go out of their own element she does not make half so good a figure on horseback as christina queen of sweden but were she once seen in the bath no man would part with her for the best mermaid in christendom you know i have seen you often i perfectly know how you look in black and in white i have experienced the utmost you can do in colors but all your movements all your graceful steps deserve not half the glory you might here attain of a moving and easy behavior in buckram something between swimming and walking free enough and more modestlyhalfnaked than you can appear any where else you have conquered enough already by land show your ambition and vanquish also by water we have no pretty admirals on these seas but must strike sails to your white flags were they once hoisted up the buckram i mention is a dress particularly useful at this time when we are told the princess is bringing over the fashion of german ruffs you ought to use your selves to some degrees of stiffness beforehand and when our ladies chins have been tickled awhile with starched muslin and wire they may possibly bear the brush of a german beard and whisker  i could tell you a delightful story of dr p but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances he had heard it was an excellent cure for love to kiss the aunt of the person beloved who is generally of years and experience enough to damp the fiercest flame he tried this course in his passion and kissed mrs e at mr ds but he says it will not do and that he loves you as much as ever  yours etc  letter vi to the same if you ask how the waters agree with me i must tell you so very well that i question how you and i should agree if we were in a room by our selves mrs t has honestly assured me that but for some whims which she cannot entirely conquer she would go and see the world with me in mans clothes even you madam i fancy if you would not partake in our adventures would wait our coming in at the evening with some impatience and be well enough pleased to hear em by the fireside that would be better than reading romances unless lady m would be our historian for as she is married she has probably leisure hours in the nightime to write or do what she will in what raises these desires in me is an acquaintance i am beginning with my lady sandwich who has all the spirit of the last age and all the gay experience of a pleasurable life it were as scandalous an omission to come to the bath and not to see my lady sandwich as it had formerly been to have traveled to rome without visiting the queen of sweden she is in a word the best thing this country has to boast of and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be  i must tell you a truth which is not however much to my credit i never thought so much of your self and your sister as since i have been fourscore miles distance from you in the forest i looked upon you as good neighbors at london as pretty kind of women but here as divinities angels goddesses or what you will in the same manner i never knew at what a rate i valued your life till you were upon the point of dying if mrs t and you will but fall very sick every season i shall certainly die for you seriously i value you both so much that i esteem others much the less for your sakes you have robbed me of the pleasure of esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in them by showing me so many finer in your selves there are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me which i believe you are not capable of i mean ill nature and malice i have seen enough of you not to overlook any frailty you could have and nothing less than a vice can make me like you less i expect you should discover by my conduct toward you both that this is true and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one disposition expect nothing from me but truths and freedom and i shall always be thought by you what i always am  your etc  letter vii to the same i returned home as slow and as contemplative after i had parted from you as my lord  retired from the court and glory to his country seat and wife a week ago i found here a dismal desponding letter from the son of another great courtier who expects the same fate and who tells me the great ones of the earth will now take it very kindly of the mean ones if they will favor them with a visit by daylight with what joy would they lay down all their schemes of glory did they but know you have the generosity to drink their healths once a day as soon as they are fallen thus the unhappy by the sole merit of their misfortunes become the care of heaven and you i intended to have put this last into verse but in this age of ingratitude my best friends forsake me i mean my rhymes  i desire mrs p to stay her stomach with these half hundred plays till i can procure her a romance big enough to satissy her great soul with adventures as for novels i fear she can depend upon none from me but that of my life which i am still as i have been contriving all possible methods to shorten for the greater ease both of my historian and the reader may she believe all the passion and tenderness expressed in these romances to be but a faint image of what i bear her and may you who read nothing take the same truth upon hearing it from me you will both injure me very much if you dont think me a truer friend than ever any romantic lover or any imitator of their style could be  the days of beauty are as the days of greatness and as long as your eyes make their sunshine all the world are your adorers i am one of those unambitious people who will love you forty years hence when your eyes begin to twinkle in a retirement for your own sakes and without the vanity which every one now will take to be thought  your etc  letter viii you have asked me news a hundred times at the first word you spoke to me which some would interpret as if you expected nothing better from my lips and truly it is not a sign two lovers are together when they can be so impertinent as to enquire what the world does all i mean by this is that either you or i are not in love with the other i leave you to guess which of the two is that stupid and insensible creature so blind to the others excellencies and charms  this then shall be a letter of news and sure if you did not think me the humblest creature in the world you could never imagine a poet could dwindle to a brother of dawks and dyer from a rival of tate and brady  the earl of oxford has behaved so bravely that in this act at least he might seem above man if he had not just now voided a stone to prove him subject to human infirmities the utmost weight of affliction from princely power and popular hatred were almost worth bearing for the glory of such a dauntless conduct as he has shown under it  you may soon have your wish to enjoy the gallant sights of armies incampments standards waving over your brothers cornfields and the pretty windings of the thames about m stained with the blood of men your barbarity which i have heard so long exclaimed against in town and country may have its fill of destruction i would not add one circumstance usual in all descriptions of calamity that of the many rapes committed or to be committed upon those unfortunate women that delight in war but god forgive me  in this martial age if i could i would buy a regiment for your sake and mrs ps and some others whom i have cause to fear no fair means will prevail upon  those eyes that care not how much mischief is done or how great slaughter committed so they have but a fine show those veryfemale eyes will be infinitely delighted with the camp which is speedily to be formed in hydepark the tents are carried thither this morning new regiments with new cloths and furniture far exceeding the late cloth and linen designed by his grace for the soldiery the sight of so many gallant fellows with all the pomp and glare of war yet undeformd by battle those scenes which england has for many years only beheld on stages may possibly invite your curiosity to this place  mrs  expects the pretender at her lodgings by saturday sennight she has bought a picture of madam maintenon to set her features by against that time three priests of your acquaintance are very positive by her interest to be his father confessor  by our latest accounts from dukestreet westminster the conversion of t g esquire is reported in a manner somewhat more particular that upon the seizure of his flandersmares he seemed more than ordinarily disturbed for some hours sent for his ghostly father and resolved to bear his loss like a christian till about the hours of seven or eight the coaches and horses of several of the nobility passing by his window toward hydepark he could no longer endure the disappointment but instantly went out took the oath of abjuration and recovered his dear horses which carried him in triumph to the ring the poor distressed roman catholics now unhorsd and uncharioted cry out with the psalmist some in chariots and some in horses but we will invocate the name of the lord  i am etc  letter ix i will not describe bl in particular not to forestall your expectations before you see it only take a short account which i will hazard my little credit is no unjust one i never saw so great a thing with so much littleness in it i think the architect built it entirely in compliance to the taste of its owners for it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable and the most selfish it has like their own hearts no room for strangers and no reception for any person of superior quality to themselves there are but just two apartments for the master and mistress below and but two apartments above very much inferior to them in the whole house when you look upon the outside you would think it large enough for a prince when you see the inside it is too little for a subject and has not convenience to lodge a common family it is a house of entries and passages among which there are three vistas through the whole very uselessly handsome there is what might have been a fine gallery but spoiled by two arches toward the end of it which take away the sight of several of the windows there are two ordinary staircases instead of one great one the best things within the house are the hall which is indeed noble and wellproportiond and the cellars and offices underground which are the most commodious and the best contrived of the whole at the top of the building are several cupolas and little turrets that have but an ill effect and make the building look at once finical and heavy what seems of the best taste is that front toward the gardens which is not yet loaded with these turrets the two sides of the building are entirely spoiled by two monstrous bowwindows which stand just in the middle instead of doors and as if it were fatal that some trifling littleness should every where destroy the grandeur there are in the chief front two semicircles of a lower structure than the rest that cut off the angles and look as if they were purposely designed to hide a loftier and nobler piece of building the top of which appears above them in a word the whole is a most expensive absurdity and the duke of shrewsbury gave a true character of it when he said it was a great quarry of stones above ground  we paid a visit to the spring where rosamond bathed her self on a hill where remains only a piece of a wall of the old palace of henry the second we toasted her shade in the cold water not without a thought or two scarce so cold as the liquor we drank it in i dare not tell you what they were and so hasten to conclude  your etc  letter x you cannot be surprised to find him a dull correspondent whom you have known so long for a dull companion and though i am pretty sensible that if i have any wit i may as well write to show it as not because any lady that has once seen me will naturally ask what i can show that is better yet i will content my self with giving you as plain a history of my pilgrimage as purchase himself or as john bunyan could do of his walking through the wilderness of this world etc  first then i went by water to hampton court unattended by all but my own virtues which were not of so modest a nature as to keep themselves or me concealed for i met the prince with all his ladies on horseback coming from hunting mrs b and mrs l took me into protection contrary to the laws against harboring papists and gave me a dinner with something i liked better an opportunity of conversation with mrs h we all agreed that the life of a maid of honor was of all things the most miserable and wished that every woman who envied it had a specimen of it to eat westphaliaham in a morning ride over hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks come home in the heat of the day with a fever and what is worse a hundred times with a red mark in the forehead from an uneasy hat all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for foxhunters and bear abundance of ruddycomplexiond children as soon as they can wipe off the sweat of the day they must simper an hour and catch cold in the princesss apartment from thence as shakespeare has it to dinner with what appetite they may  and after that till midnight walk work or think which they please i can easily believe no lonehouse in wales with a mountain and a rookery is more contemplative than this court and as a proof of it i need only tell you mrs l walked all alone with me three or four hours by moonlight and we met no creature of any quality but the king who gave audience to the vicechamberlain all alone under the gardenwall  in short i heard of no ball assembly bassettable or any place where two or three were gathered together except madam kilmanseggs to which i had the honor to be invited and the grace to stay away  i was heartily tired and posted to b park there we had an excellent discourse of quackery dr shadwell was mentioned with honor lady a walked a whole hour abroad without dying after it at least in the time i stayed though she seemed to be fainting and had convulsive motions several times in her head  this day i received a letter with certain advices where women were to be met with at oxford i defy them and all their works i love no meat but ortolans and no woman but you though indeed that is no proper comparison but for fat dutchesss for to love you is as if one should wish to eat angels or to drink cherubimbroth  i arrived in the forest by tuesday noon having fled from the face i wish i could say the horned face of moses b who dined in the midway thither i past the rest of the day in those woods where i have so often enjoyed a book and a friend i made a hymn as i passed through which ended with a sigh that i will not tell you the meaning of  your doctor is gone the way of all his patients and was hard put to it how to dispose of an estate miserably unweildy and splendidly unuseful to him sir samuel garth says that for ratcliffe to leave a library was as if a eunuch should found a seraglio dr she lately told a lady he wondered she could be alive after him she made answer she wondered at it for two reasons because dr ratcliffe was dead and because dr she was living i am  your etc  letter xi to the same nothing could have more of that melancholy which once used to please me than my last days journey for after having passed through my favorite woods in the forest with a thousand reveries of past pleasures i rid over hanging hills whose tops were edged with groves and whose feet watered with winding rivers listening to the falls of cataracts below and the murmuring of the winds above the gloomy verdure of stonor succeeded to these and then the shades of the evening overtook me the moon rose in the clearest sky i ever saw by whose solemn light i paced on slowly without company or any interruption to the range of my thoughts about a mile before i reached oxford all the bells tolled in different notes the clocks of every college answered one another and sounded forth some in a deeper some a softer tone that it was eleven at night all this was no ill preparation to the life i have led since among those old walls venerable galleries stone porticos studious walks and solitary scenes of the university i wanted nothing but a black gown and a salary to be as mere a bookworm as any there i conformed my self to the college hours was rolled up in books lay in one of the most ancient dusky parts of the university and was as dead to the world as any hermit of the desert if any thing was alive or awake in me it was a little vanity such as even those good men used to entertain when the monks of their own order extolled their piety and abstraction for i found my self received with a sort of respect which this idle part of mankind the learned pay to their own species who are as considerable here as the busy the gay and the ambitious are in your world  indeed i was treated in such a manner that i could not but sometimes ask my self in my mind what college i was founder of or what library i had built methinks i do very ill to return to the world again to leave the only place where i make a figure and from seeing my self seated with dignity in the most conspicuous shelves of a library put my self into the abject posture of lying at a ladys feet in st jamess square  i will not deny but that like alexander in the midst of my glory i am wounded and find my self a mere man to tell you from whence the dart comes is to no purpose since neither of you will take the tender care to draw it out of my heart and suck the poison with your lips  here at my lord hs i see a creature nearer an angel than a woman though a woman be very near as good as an angel i think you have formerly heard me mention mrs t as a credit to the maker of angels she is a relation of his lordships and he gravely proposed her to me for a wife being tender of her interests and knowing what is a shame to providence that she is less indebted to fortune than i i told him twas what he could never have thought of if it had not been his misfortune to be blind and what i never could think of while i had eyes to see both her and my self  i must not conclude without telling you that i will do the utmost in the affair you desire it would be an inexpressible joy to me if i could serve you and i will always do all i can to give my self pleasure i wish as well for you as for my self i am in love with you both much as i am with my self for i find my self most so with all three when i least suspect it  i am etc  letter xii to mrs arabella fermor on her marriage you are by this time satisfied how much the tenderness of one man of merit is to be preferred to the addresses of a thousand and by this time the gentleman you have made choice of is sensible how great is the joy of having all those charms and good qualities which have pleased so many now applied to please one only it was but just that the same virtues which gave you reputation should give you happiness and i can wish you no greater than that you may receive it in as high a degree your self as so much good humor must infallibly give it to your husband  it may be expected perhaps that one who has the title of poet should say something more polite on this occasion but i am really more a wellwisher to your felicity than a celebrater of your beauty besides you are now a married woman and in a way to be a great many better things than a fine lady such as an excellent wife a faithful friend a tender parent and at last as the consequence of them all a saint in heaven you ought now to hear nothing but that which was all you ever desired to hear whatever others may have spoken to you i mean truth and it is with the utmost that i assure you no friend you have can more rejoice in any good that befalls you is more sincerely delighted with the prospect of your future happiness or more unfeignedly desires a long continuance of it i beg you will think it but just that a man who will certainly be spoken of as your admirer after he is dead may have the happiness to be esteemed while he is living  your etc  letter xiii the chief cause i have to repent my leaving the town is the uncertainty i am in every day of your sisters state of health i really expected by every post to have heard of her recovery but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehensions and i have ever since suffered alarms upon alarms on her account no one can be more sensibly touched at this than i nor any danger of any i love could affect me with more uneasiness though as i never had a sister i cannot be quite so good a judge as you how far humanity would carry me i have felt some weaknesses of a tender kind which i would not be free from and i am glad to find my value for people so rightly placed as to perceive them on this occasion  i cannot be so good a christian as to be willing though no less than god should order it to resign my own happiness here for hers in another life i do more than wish for her safety for every wish i make i find immediately changed into a prayer and a more fervent one than i had learned to make till now  may her life be longer and happier than perhaps her self may desire that is as long and as happy as your self can wish may her beauty be as great as possible that is as it always was or as yours is but whatever ravages a merciless distemper may commit i dare promise her boldly what few if any of her makers of visits and complements dare to do she shall have one man as much her admirer as ever as for your part madam you have me so more than ever since i have been a witness to the generous tenderness you have shown upon this occasion  your etc  letter xiv it is with infinite satisfaction i am made acquainted that your brother will at last prove your relation and has entertained such sentiments as become him in your concern i have been prepared for this by degrees having several times received from mrs  that which is one of the greatest pleasures the knowledge that others entered into my own sentiments concerning you i ever was of opinion that you wanted no more to be vindicated than to be known and like truth could appear no where but you must conquer as i have often condold with you in your adversities so i have a right which but few can pretend to of congratulating on the prospect of your better fortunes and i hope for the future to have the concern i have felt for you overpaid in your felicities though you modestly say the world has left you yet i verily believe it is coming to you again as fast as it can for to give the world its due it is always very fond of merit when it is past its power to oppose it therefore if you should take it into favor again upon its repentance and continue in it you would be so far from leading what is commonly called an unsettled life and what you with too much unjust severity call a vagabond life that the wise could only look upon you as a prince in a progress who travels to gain the affections he has not or to fix those he already has which he effectually does wherever he shows himself but if you are resolved in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it i believe your design will be vain for even in a monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far toward the next world as to make this lose the sight of you but you will be like a star that while it is fixed to heaven shines over all the earth  wheresoever providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing i know i shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you when you never hear of me or them your own guardian angels cannot be more constant nor more silent i beg you will never cease to think me your friend that you may not be guilty of that which you never yet knew to commit an injustice as i have hitherto been so in spite of the world so hereafter if it be possible you should ever be more opposed and more deserted i should only be so much the more  your faithful etc  letter xv i can say little to recommend the letters i shall write to you but that they will be the most impartial representations of a free heart and the truest copies you ever saw though of a very mean original not a feature will be softened or any advantageous light employed to make the ugly thing a little less hideous but you shall find it in all respects most horribly like you will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing i shall say from this instant as a compliment either to you or to my self whatever i write will be the real thought of that hour and i know you will no more expect it of me to persevere till death in every sentiment or notion i now set down than you would imagine a mans face should never change when once his picture was drawn  the freedom i shall use in this manner of thinking aloud may indeed prove me a fool but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools the honest ones and since what folly we have will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in spite of all our art to keep it down methinks it is almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at all and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends if momuss project had taken of having windows in our breasts i should be for carrying it further and making those windows casements that while a man showed his heart to all the world he might do something more for his friends even give it them and trust it to their handling i think i love you as well as king herod did herodias though i never had so much as one dance with you and would as freely give you my heart in a dish as he did anothers head but since jupiter will not have it so i must be content to show my taste in life as i do my taste in painting by loving to have as little drapery as possible not that i think every body naked altogether so fine a sight as your self and a few more would be but because it is good to use people to what they must be acquainted with and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other to uncover every soul of us we shall then see that the prudes of this world owed all their fine figure only to their being straiterlacd than the rest and that they are naturally as arrant squabs as those that went more loose nay as those that never girded their lions at all  but a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me is that i am confident no one knows you better for i find when others express their thoughts of you they fall very short of mine and i know at the same time theirs are such as you would think sufficiently in your favor  you may easily imagine how desirous i must be of a correspondence with a person who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight as to love and who has since ruined me for all the conversation of one sex and almost all the friendship of the other i am but too sensible through your means that the company of men wants a certain softness to recommend it and that of women wants every thing else how often have i been quietly going to take possession of that tranquillity and indolence i had so long found in the country when one evening of your conversation has spoiled me for a solitaire books have lost their effect upon me and i was convinced since i saw you that there is one alive wiser than all the sages a plague of female wisdom it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own what is very strange virtue her self when you have the dressing her is too amiable for ones repose you might have done a world of good in your time if you had allowed half the fine gentlemen who have seen you to have conversed with you they would have been strangely bitt while they thought only to fall in love with a fair lady and you had bewitched them with reason and virtue two beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with  the unhappy distance at which we correspond removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth to save good breeding i may now hear of my faults and you of your good qualities without a blush we converse upon such unfortunate generous terms as exclude the regards of fear shame or design in either of us and methinks it would be as paltry a part to impose even in a single thought upon each other in this state of separation as for spirits of a different sphere who have so little intercourse with us to employ that little as some would make us think they do in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals  let me begin then madam by asking you a question that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most instances of my life in what manner did i behave the last hour i saw you what degree of concern did i discover when i felt a misfortune which i hope you will never feel that of parting from what one most esteems for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance i am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever decency made  i never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon seeing the tomb of a friend which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost i reflect upon the circumstances of your departure which i was there a witness of your behavior in what i may call your last moments and i indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were given to me i would fain imagine this was not accidental but proceeded from a penetration which i know you have in finding out the truth of peoples sentiments and that you were willing the last man that would have parted from you should be that last that did i really looked upon you just as the friends of curtius might have done upon that hero at the instant when he was devoting himself to glory and running to be lost out of generosity i was obliged to admire your resolution in as great a degree as i deplored it and had only to wish that heaven would reward so much virtue as was to be taken from us with all the felicities it could enjoy elsewhere  i am etc  letter xvi you will find me more troublesome than ever brutus did his evil genius i shall meet you in more places than one and often refresh your memory before you arrive at your philippi these shadows of me my letters will be haunting you from time to time and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffered very much from you and whom you have robbed of the most valuable of his enjoyments your conversation the advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine was what i always thought a great one and even worth the risque i generally run of manifesting my own indiscretion you then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given for you pleased or informed me the minute you answered i must now be contented with more slow returns however it is some pleasure that your thoughts upon paper will be a more lasting possession to me and that i shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss i have so often regretted that of any thing you said which i happened to forget in earnest madam if i were to write to you as often as i think of you it must be every day of my life i attend you in spirit through all your ways i follow you through every stage in books of travels and fear for you through whole folios you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead travelers and if i read of a delightful prospect or agreeable place i hope it yet subsists to please you i enquire the roads the amusements the company of every town and country through which you pass with as much diligence as if i were to set out next week to overtake you in a word no one can have you more constantly in mind not even your guardian angel if you have one and i am willing to indulge so much popery as to fancy some being takes care of you who knows your value better than you do your self i am willing to think that heaven never gave so much selfneglect and resolution to a woman to occasion her calamity but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory  your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive it puts me in mind of the first dove that returned to noah and just made him know it had found no rest abroad  there is nothing in it that pleases me but when you tell me you had no seasickness i beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can that is tell me any that you receive you can make no discoveries that will be half so valuable to me as those of your own mind nothing that regards the states or kingdoms you pass through will engage so much of my curiosity or concern as what relates to your self your welfare to say truth is more at my heart than that of christendom  i am sure i may defend the truth though perhaps not the virtue of this declaration one is ignorant or doubtful at best of the merits of differing religions and governments but private virtues one can be sure of i therefore know what particular person has desert enough to merit being happier than others but not what nation deserves to conquer or oppress another you will say i am not publickspirited let it be so i may have too many tendernesses particular regards or narrow views but at the same time i am certain that whoever wants these can never have a publickspirit for as a friend of mine says how is it possible for that man to love twenty thousand people who never loved one  i communicated your letter to mr c he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought i mean as i do and one always thinks that to be just as it ought his health and mine are now so good that we wish with all our souls you were a witness of it we never meet but we lament over you we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory where we strew flowers of rhetoric and offer such libations to your name as it would be profane to call toasting the duke of bm is sometimes the high priest of your praises and upon the whole i believe there are as few men that are not sorry at your departure as women that are for you know most of your sex want good sense and therefore must want generosity you have so much of both that i am sure you pardon them for one cannot but forgive whatever one despises for my part i hate a great many women for your sake and undervalue all the rest it is you are to blame and may god revenge it upon you with all those blessings and earthly prosperities which the divines tell us are the cause of our perdition for if he makes you happy in this world i dare trust your own virtue to do it in the other i am  your etc
