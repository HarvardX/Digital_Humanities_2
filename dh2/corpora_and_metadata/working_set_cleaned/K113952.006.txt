this isle where natures fairest beauties smile and breathe in every plain it is thine to bid each flower display and open to the eye of day the glories of its reign while yon few sheep enjoy the breeze that softly dies upon the trees and rest beneath the shade this pipe which damon gave shall raise its rural notes to sing thy praise and ask the muses aid dianas ear shall catch the sound and all the nymphs that sport around the vale or upland lawn the nymphs that over the mountains brow pursue the lightlybounding roe or chase the flying fawn even now perchance some cool retreat defends the lovely train from heat and phoebus noontide beam perchance they twine the flowery crown on beds of roses soft as down beside the winding stream delightful season every mead with thy fair robe of plenty spread to thee that plenty owes the laughing fields with joy declare and whisper all in reasons ear from whence that plenty flows happy the man whose vessel glides safe and unhurt by passions tides nor courts the gusts of praise he sails with even steady pace while virtues fullblown beauties grace the summer of his days summer a rural song by mr brerewood where the light cannot pierce in a grove of tall trees with my fair one as blooming as may undisturbed by all sound but the sighs of the breeze let me pass the hot noon of the day when the sun less intense to the westward inclines for the meadows the groves well forsake and see the rays dance as inverted he shines on the face of some river or lake where my fairest and i on its verge as we pass for it is she that must still be my theme our two shadows may view on the watery glass while the fish are at play in the stream may the herds cease to low and the lambkins to bleat when she sings me some amorous strain all be silent and hushed unless echo repeat the kind words and sweet sounds back again and when we return to our cottage at night hand in hand as we sauntering stray let the moons silver beams through the leaves give us light just direct us and chequer our way let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk as thus gently and slowly we move and let no single thought be expressed in our talk but of friendship improved into love thus enchanted each day with these rural delights and secure from ambitions alarms soft love and repose shall divide all our nights and each morning shall rise with new charms sent to a young lady with a fine carnation to thee my fair this beauteous flower i send admit it as a moralizing friend  in charms and sweetness you may me excel  yet deign to listen while this truth i tell  i am your emblem drive vain pride away  both you and i soon blossom soon decay contemplation an ode tecum vivere amem tecum obeaim libens hor contemplation lovely fair far from scenes of noise and care evermore delights to dwell in the still sequestered cell lead me then propitious power to thy lonely rural bower to the silent shady wood to the rivulets dimpling flood and on summer mornings lead to the russet heath or mead to the cots plain simple door the ploughmans peaceful happy floor where phyllis brings her loaded pail and young affection lisps its tale lead to dusky lanes or shades where tall oaks lift high their heads to the seat of happiness to the gardens loved recess beds with pinks and roses gay the pride and boast of june and may contemplation nymph serene guide to lawns or uplands green or near the promontorys side  let me hear the roaring tide hear old oceans wild waves roll  on the sad knell slowly toll or at gloomy hour of day with me to the churchyard stray and meditate among the dead while the sexton plies his spade there peruse the timeworn stones or as he turns up human bones think on what i soon must be think on vast eternity till torches dissipate the gloom and the sable mourners come till the venerable priest in his snowy surplice dressed loudly begins the solemn lines and dust to dust at length consigns hail matron lovely though demure ever chaste and ever pure diffuse thy balm into my breast bring with thee happiness and rest sooth each melancholy sigh teach me to live and teach to die verses written in an alcove at  stranger here prolong thy stay and the rural scene survey blossoms beautify the trees soft and pleasing is the breeze though the polyanthus dies fairer flowers begin to rise roses rear their crimson heads tulips decorate yon beds linnets chaunt sweet minstrelsy see how active is the be lo she flies from flower to flower and exerts her chymic power view yon grotto in the dell and admire each polished shell then with rapture turn thine eye to the rill that murmurs by mark the distant mountains steep and the snowy flocks of sheep and the cattle grazing there  stranger god is every where in each favorite scene i see omnipresent deity even the rill and antique rock lowing herd and harmless flock even the anchorites abode evince a wise and powerful god ode on health she comes  and on each blooming cheek she wears the blush which bright auroras pencil drew her eye looks life she breathes etherial sweets and decks her hair with glittering gems of dew she comes and with her hebe goddess of youth  ever young the sweetest loveliest children of the skies health most goodnatured makes a longer stay but hebe charming cruel hebe flies oh while i feel thy sisters genial ray do thou dear health thy benison bestow with bounding spirits fill my thirsty soul and tinge my cheek with thy celestial glow ah leave me not unpitied and forlorn but listen to thy sisters tender cry for me she pleads  for me she lifts her hand oh hear her goddess  hear her else i die grant me thy smile and i will shape my course to whatsoever spot thy footsteps lead through bleating valleys and through sighing groves or over the mountains tall majestic head or when the sun imprints his virgin kiss soft on the surface of the trembling wave at thy command i will plunge into the flood and wake each drowsy naiad as i lave list to my prayer  but if thou art resolved that all thy benefits to me shall cease grant me some little notice to prepare my long long journey to the land of peace song sweet are the banks when spring perfumes the verdant plants and laughing flowers fragrant the violet as it blooms and sweet the blossoms after showers sweet is the soft the sunny breeze that fans the golden orangegrove but oh how sweeter far than these the kisses are of her i love ye roses blushing in your beds that with your odours scent the air ye lillies chaste with silver heads as my cleoras bosom fair no more i court your balmy sweets for i and i alone can prove how sweeter when each other meets the kisses are of her i love her tempting eyes my gaze inclined their pleasing lesson first i caught her sense her friendship next confined the willing pupil she had taught should fortune stooping from her sky conduct me to her bright alcove yet like the turtle i should die denied the kiss of her i love ode to evening thou tranquil daughter of the day on whose fair face autumnal zephyrs play over whose serene unclouded eye sol sheds the mildest luster of the sky thee undisturbed oh let me hail and tread the carpet of thy verdant vale near which with bonnet wheatenbound sits ceres listening to the sheepbells sound or let me woo thee by the stream obliquely gilded by the western beam while flies and gnats unnumberd throng and faintly murmur no unpleasing song now to enjoy the silent hour the lark descends from his aerial tower apollo is reclined to rest upon the down of amphitrites breast the bird who loves the coming night hoots querulous and flaps his wing for flight with wheeling plume the bat flies by and mocks the imperfect motion of the eye the buzzing chafer here and there spreads his gauze wing and spins along the air but darkeyed night so heaven ordains comes nodding on and blackens all the plains the pleasing scenes which nature drew are clouded over and vanished from the view the splendid morn the noon of day and all the shades of evening are away but soon the splendid morn again shall radiate all the firmamental plain and soon the suns meridian ray zenithd on high shall give us back the day and evening thou with aspect bland shall pour thy lengthening shadow over the land such is thy pictured life oh man which daily dies and fades as it began thy infant morn shall sink away thy noon of youth and evening age decay then death shall wrap thee in his urn for dust thou were and shall to dust return the lady and the linnet a tale addressed to a friend sumit myrrha novos veteres ut ponit amictus mutat amatores miseros sic mutat amicos fragm incert aut to lift the low the proud depress and succor weakness in distress a foe forgive and yet contend with generous ardour for a friend are virtues though but thinly sown not circumscribed to you alone since hourly observation finds they spring in some inferior minds which though we justly pass our praise on are not the sound effects of reason but often flow from whim or fashion from pride or some impurer passion but you whom heaven at first designed the boast and envy of your kind above your sexs censure placed in beauty breeding temper taste who only show regard to merit unconscious what yourself inherit while other ladies fume and rail in indignation at my tale with each reflection pick a quarrel and find a satire in each moral may safely every page peruse nor be offended with the muse where not a single line appears which honor dreads or virtue fears a hungry hawk in quest of prey wide over the forest winged his way whence every bird that haunts the glade or warbles in the rural shade dispersed in wild disorder flies before the tyrant of the skies a linnet feebler than the rest with weary wings and panting breast sought sylvias window in despair and fluttering craved protection there compassion touched the fair ones mind for female hearts are always kind upward the gliding sash she threw and in the little stranger flew there in her fragrant bosom pressed the nymph revives her drooping guest then danger over and all serene restores him to his fields again what wondrous joy what grateful love inspired the wanderer of the grove in unexpected life elate when now he recollects his fate and sets the friendly fair in view who gave him life and freedom too for gratitude to courts unknown and unreturnd by man alone wide through the winged creation reigns and dwells amidst the humble plains in every verdant field and shade the just the generous debt is paid back from the sylvan bower he hies to thank his dear deliverer flies and at her window chaunting stood her praise with all the zeal he could there lin his morning visits pays and there he tunes his evening lays there often the noonday hour prolongs and pours his little soul in songs his heavenly airs attention drew and sylvia soon the warbler knew then uses every charm to win and draw the wild musician in he enters fearless of a snare for how should fraud inhabit there and now by frequent visits free at first he perches on her knee then grown by long acquaintance bolder familiarly ascends her shoulder and wholly now devoid of fear plays with the pendant in her ear over all her neck and bosom strays and like a lover learns to teaze pecks on her hand and fondly sips delicious nectar from her lips thrice happy bird how were thou blessed of such superior love possessed could thou but make the tenure sure and those unrivaled hours endure but love a light fantastic thing like thee is always on the wing and sacred friendship often a jest when centered in a female breast thus lin the circling moments past in raptures too refined to last when as his constant court he paid some envious songsters of the shade observed his motions to and fro for merits never without a foe they marked the transports of his eye his sprightly air and glossy dye and all agreed to know ere night what gave the vagrant such delight strait to the beauteous bower they throng nor for admittance waited long the nymph whom every charm attends receives her new aerial friends with crumbled cake and fruitage feeds and feasts them on her choicest seeds did all that kindness could inspire to bring her coy acquaintance nigh her and linny now returns to pay the due devotions of the day when to his wondering eyes arose a numerous circle of his foes grief touched his soul to see them there but with a seeming easy air he took his place among the rest and sat an undistinguished guest alas how soon can time destroy the surest pledge of earthly joy a favourites flattering hopes defeat and tumble tyrants from their state for time indulgent but to few deposes kings  and linnets too he who was once the nymphs delight sits now neglected in her sight in vain to charm her ear he tries new forms engaged her ears and eyes the goldfinch spreads his gaudy coat and all were ravished with his note while none attends to linnys strain for ah poor linnys plumes were plain and now the mournful warbler flown the nymph and friendly bower their own over all reserve their spleen prevails and every tongue in concert rails all wondered what her eyes could see in such a worthless thing as he who still pursues his private ends ungrateful to his kindest friends one instance sure might serve to show him alas how little did they know him some then recounted all the arts he used to vanquish little hearts affirmed he still was making love and kept a miss in every grove could trifle with the meanest fowl nay offer courtship to an owl scandal though pointed in the dark is seldom known to miss its mark while few will interrupt its aim regardless of anothers fame even they by whom we once were loved through life for several years approved when spleen and envy rail aloud are often carried with the crowd preferring rather than contend to sacrifice their nearest friend thus sylvia yielded to the birds too complaisant to doubt their words nor thought that creatures so polite could deal in calumny and spite the injured linnet with their leaves for decency she still receives who though he sees his foes carest like some fond lover hopes the best and doubts his own discerning eyes but ah how obvious is disguise at length of hope itself bereft when now no friendly look was left and every mark of fondness fled he hung his wings and drooped his head and am i then resigned he says to such ungenerous foes as these by these defrauded of my bliss is all her kindness come to this yet ah my tongue forbear to blame that loved that everhonourd name this heart however misused at last must own unnumberd favors past and shall though never to meet again the dear remembrance still retain he spoke  and to the window flew there sat and sung his last adieu four odes intended for choruses to a tragedy altered from shakespeare on the death of julius caesar by the rev mr hudson ode i after the first act to liberty the sable queen of shades retires encircled with her fading fires yoked to her iron car the dragons fly with slow wing blackening many a league of sky go melancholy goddess go nurse of despondency and woe it is time the cocks shrill clarion calls the dawn and strikes the prowling wolf with fear and bids the phantoms disappear that glimmer midst yon mouldring walls they startle at the sound and gliding over the trackless ground loath to their marble mansions haste away no more their livid lightnings play the terrors of aerial tumults cease hushed to serenity and smiling peace for lo in heavens ambrosial bowers waked by the stationary hours parent of day the morn unveils her eyes and vermeil blushes streak the orient skies how nature triumphs at the sight renewed in all her beauty bright her fragrant groves their incense yield the zephyrs from her humid stores diffuse the sweetness of mellifluous dews and pleasure paints the lillied field here gilt with splendid rays the spires and lofty turrets blaze there the canals reflect a pleasing gleam while dancing down the pebbly stream the silver radiance cheers the feathered throng woods hills and dales reecho with their song thus like the morn will fairest freedom come in majesty divine with dawning glory to disperse the gloom of dire oppression and illume the mind to darkness and despondency confined arise o liberty it is thine the charms of nature to refine with blooming hope and harmony to please to crown with plenty and to bless with ease to light up awful virtues living ray and pour the flood of intellectual day place me in africs desert lands where thirst sits gasping on the sands if there auspicious freedom fix her seat midst burning blasts i will hail the rude retreat soon shall the wild more polished grown admire new beauties not her own sage industry shall dig the well capacious yawning many a fathom deep while lowing herds and bleating sheep stand frequent in the cooling cell soon shall the mantling vine be taught around the palm to twine and social arts the stranger naiads wake that sleep beneath the distant lake curious to view young commerce gaily roam and bring full harvests to his barren home place me beneath the gelid zone near winters adamantine throne where farthest ocean foams with icy roar along the bleak inhospitable shore if freedom to the smoky dome with furcloathd mortals deign to roam through snowy wastes the dome i will seek what hinders to enjoy the freezing year for property will there appear and cheerful health with rosy cheek pursue the panting prey or mindful of the lengthened day sit chaunting on the mountains crystal brow where hanging torrents shine below nor will cimmerian sleep forget to bring safe slumbers waving at his downy wing come then celestial let thy wished return this happier clime serene this happier clime if rome thy absence mourn no more with smiles of pleasure entertains nor baias groves nor rich campanias plains heartless we view the splendid scene of turrets and the painted green heartless the music of the groves we hear as when new harnessed out by wrath and fear nights chariot moves in storms and thunders hurled roll their broad terrors round the groaning world ode ii after the second act to fancy where art thou fancy visionary maid whose lenient artifice and easy aid can quell the fierce disorders of the breast and soothe the pensive soul to rest whether along the daisy bank reclined with foliage veiled you court the fanning wind or by the brooks loquacious channel stray where the deep dimpled eddies play haste thee from the blended glow of beauties in yon lucid bow with finespun light and golden beams softly weave thy waking dreams bid the ranged ideas fly opening to the ravished eye a glimpse of bliss where gay desire is found sporting with youth while music wakes around behold the variegated prospect rise what gallant harmony what glad surprise the sweet mygdonian pipe with rural strains collects the nymyhs and shepherd swains secure in yonder vale their fleecy breed and heifers midst the neighboring pastures feed meanwhile with flowrets decked each blithesome pair have bid adieu to pine and care see them hand in hand advance circling in the smoothpacd dance now to numbers quaint they stray bounding on the mazy way the goldfinch and the linnet nigh join the simple minstrelsy the simple notes and merry gambols fire placed by the hawthornhedge each ancient fire but see where solitude of sober mien with health and modesty her charming maids leaving the strawroofd neighborhood is seen to rove beneath the venerable shades o harmless cottages o happy glades where no misfortunes factious rage deplore no discontent the quiet breast invades how pleasant it is from this farseasond shore to hear the tumbling oceans wavy roar now whither with the sunbeams darting speed thy rapt enthusiast fancy will thou lead what other scenes of more sincere delight the goddess and her guest invite she like the sybil with the golden bough descends to search the sacred realms below in amaranthine bowers the blessed appear by pearly grot or fountain clear to heroes ghosts or sceptered kings the laurelld bard divinely sings hark the animating strains warble through the elysian plains when the pause admits delay thus the immortals seem to say closing the accents of each tuneful voice  for ever thus for ever we rejoice what sad transition means this rising show to drive out real pain with fancied woe i see the mourners in the darkened room the rustic hearse the lettered tomb still still the wayward wild ideas take the solemn livery of death and wake tendereyed pity as the villagetrain the shrouded husbandman sustain what semblances of wretched plight mid the procession strike the sight ah it is grief herself appears her flowing tresses steeped in tears her garments torn her bosom bare reckless of the inclement air three orphan children mark their mothers moan hang down their heads and answer groan for groan hence hence ye hapless images away delusive fancy with thy subtle heat no more thy vain machinery display now the dank grave and now the green retreat contentments truth surpasses thy deceit sister of wisdom she of aspect mild who makes the golden mean her certain seat and looks on casualty as natures child to heavens behests still nobly reconciled ode iii after the third act on true greatness let who will climb the towery steep of sovereignty with slippery strides where on the bosom of the deep below the pitchy pinnace rides a deaths head flag unfurled to view waves ghastly and a sable crew gaze from the deck and seem to wait dashed down the pointed rocks the rash unfortunate mine be the low and level way amid the quiet vale to stray safe in some sylvan lodge to dwell and lulled by the clear stream that speeds by shallow fords to rustling reeds and small lakes fringed with homely asphodel there sits the calm the rural sage with natures volume fair in view and meditates the shining page replete with wonders ever new while wisdom points on either hand where plants and herbs and flowrets stand in emerald groves and shadowy glades in furzy moors or muskysmelling meads truth in her liquid glass serene to him explains each moral scene often in the downward skies a train of tinsel insects he surveys or glowworm with fallacious blaze just emblem of court greatness frail and vain often in his woodland walk he stops to mark the spirited and youthful lark warned by the dawning in the dappled east lift his melodious flight through upper air late the low tenant of the rushy nest now sings unrivaled in his radiant sphere the pondering hermit then sees merit roam above the nurslings of the courtly dome on glorys sparkling wheels raised from its humble home first of the families of fame that romes imperial city grace from rural huts and hamlets came the fabian and fabrician race with that firm judge that could contemn and banish the proud diadem to sabine fields she owes the vine whose tendrils yet round virtues column twine which braves oppressions wintry breath and stands the icy touch of death the leafless stock that fortune dooms to wither with returning spring while the glad flocks of freedom sing profuse of promised sweets with double vigor blooms hark hark it is brutus name i hear joined with his fair heroic bride to honors hallowed fane they steer along the favorable tide to her and safety there to place the tablet vowed to human race blow every kind and gentle gale of gratitude and fan the swelling sail high on a fleecy couch reclined of white and amber clouds combined romes genius lifts his august head now slow descending nearer draws hailed with the popular applause and bids the solemn pageantry proceed go the triumphal ornaments display ye sacred salii lead the way next led the order of patrician blood in awful march a numerous train compose and followed by the jubilating crowd as cybele through phrygian cities goes majestic and with golden turrets crowned a hundred gods her gorgeous car surround a thousand tongues acclaim the clanging cymbals sound ode iv after the fourth act to concord soul of the world first mover say from thee what glorious being came powerful to raise this universal frame who taught the ponderous wheels to play gave beauty to look forth with radiant eyes and clothed with ambient day the crystal skies twas concord who enthroned above with sevenfold adamantine chains the path of wandering orbs restrains kindles the genial fire of love and walks the courts of genuine light while all heaven hails the wonders of her sight where bliss has banished chance and sore annoy and goodness fills the cup of general joy nor is she to the heavens confined forth on the mornings wings she rides she skims the glowing evenings purple tides and leaves the setting sun behind where doves sit cooing at the noontide hour and linnets warble in the woodbine bower where the pale moon her luster spreads the lovelorn bird divides her song the soft flute soothes the rural throng and dewdrops load the flowrets heads where the ingenuous chorus sings the delicate touch flies over the trembling strings from the gilt roof the symphony rebounds thine goddess are the charms and thine the silv sounds the buxom air the sapphire main all height and depth confess thy gracious reign but chief is thy delight to dwell lodged in the human breast thy dearest cell favor and friendship meet thee there and tender transport with the gushing tear there wedlock at thy altar bends there halcyon peace securely broods and meek tranquillity attends to quell unruly rage and sooth the swelling floods now by the magic of thy tongue that called up first the rolling spheres through the gay circle of revolving years with rapturous sounds of mystic song attund in heavenly harmony to run and by the virtue of the enchanting zone which when the fair idalian queen accepts with universal sway the smiles and winning passions play in her resistless look and mien the loves thy heavenly gift admire and tip their little darts with lambent fire fresh wreaths the graces bring and form the round where rising daisies mark the measured ground now by the rosy mildness sweet of which when youthful spring awakes from thy abundance amply she partakes what time the silkplumd zephyrs meet in sabas groves to kiss the bending blooms with balmy lips and wanton in perfumes and by the ripened redolent grace when summer in the persian fields to soberseeming autumn yields her treasures on the loaded sprays the skyrobd plum the purple vine the velvet peach and damask nectarine while plenty waving her hesperian bough gladdens pomona with the golden show great goddess with the words of peace bid this wild uproar of contention cease bid amity with gentle ray the woes that lowr on factions brow display shall rome to thee a rebel prove for hellish hate abandon heavenly love here gentle concord on each breast let thy springsweetness bland distill here thy ambrosial fragrance rest and all mankind obey thy sovereign will melpomene an ode queen of the human heart at whose command the swelling tides of mighty passion rise melpomene support my venturous hand and aid thy suppliant in his bold emprise from the gay scenes of pride do thou his footsteps guide to natures aweful courts where nursed of yore young shakespeare fancys child was taught his various lore so may his favored eye explore the source to few revealed whence human sorrows charm so may his numbers with pathetic force bid terror shake us or compassion warm as different strains control the movements of the soul adjust its passions harmonize its tone to feel for others woe or nobly bear its own deep in the covert of a shadowy grove mid broken rocks where dashing currents play dear to the pensive pleasures dear to love and damons muse that breathes her melting lay this ardent prayer was made when lo the secret shade as conscious of some heavenly presence shook  strength firmness reason all  my astonished soul forsook ah whither goddess whither am i borne to what wild regions necromantic shore these panics whence and why my bosom torn with sudden terrors never felt before darkness inwraps me round while from the vast profound emerging specter dreadful shapes assume and gleaming on my sight add horror to the gloom ha what is he whose fierce indignant eye denouncing vengeance kindles into flame whose boisterous fury blows a storm so high as with its thunder shakes his laboring frame what can such rage provoke his words their passage choke his eager steps nor time nor truce allow and dreadful dangers wait the menace of his brow protect me goddess whence that fearful shriek of consternation as grim death had laid his icy fingers on some guilty cheek and all the powers of manhood shrunk dismayed ah see besmeared with gore revenge stands threatening over a pale delinquent whose retorted eyes in vain for pity call  the wretched victim dies not long the space  abandoned to despair with eyes aghast or hopeless fixed on earth this slave of passion rends his scattered hair beats his sad breast and execrates his birth while torn within he feels the pangs of whips and wheels and sees or fancies all the fiends below beckoning his frighted soul to realms of endless woe before my wondering sense new phantoms dance and stamp their horrid shapes upon my brain  a wretch with jealous brow and eyes askance feeds all in secret on his bosom pain fond love fierce hate assail alternate they prevail while conscious pride and shame with rage conspire and urge the latent spark to flames of torturing fire the storm proceeds  his changeful visage trace from rage to madness every feature breaks a growing phrenzy grins upon his face and in his frightful stare distraction speaks his strawinvested head proclaims all reason fled and not a tear bedews those vacant eyes  but songs and shouts succeed and laughtermingled sighs yet yet again  a murderers hand appears grasping a pointed dagger stained with blood his look malignant chills with boding fears that check the current of lifes ebbing flood in midnights darkest clouds the dreary miscreant shrouds his felon step  as twere to darkness given to dim the watchful eye of allpervading heaven and hark ah mercy whence that hollow sound why with strange horror starts my bristling hair earth opens wide and from unhallowed ground a pallid ghost slowrising steals on air to where a mangled corse exposed without remorse lies shroudless unentombd he points the way  points to the prowling wolf exultant over his prey  was it for this he cries with kindly shower  of daily gifts the traitor i caressed  for this arrayed him in the robe of power  and lodged my royal secrets in his breast  o kindness ill repaid  to bare the murdering blade  against my life  may heaven his guilt explore  and to my suffering race their splendid rights restore he said and stalked away  ah goddess cease thus with terrific forms to rack my brain these horrid phantoms shake the throne of peace and reason calls her boasted powers in vain then change thy magic wand thy dreadful troops disband and gentler shapes and softer scenes disclose to melt the feeling heart yet sooth its tenderest woes the fervent prayer was heard  with hideous sound her ebon gates of darkness open flew a dawning twilight cheers the dread profound the train of terror vanishes from view more mild enchantments rise new scenes salute my eyes groves fountains bowers and temples grace the plain and turtles coo around and nightingales complain and every myrtle bower and cypress grove and every solemn temple teems with life here glows the scene with fond but hapless love there with the deeper woes of human strife in groups around the lawn by fresh disasters drawn the sad spectators seem transfixed in woe and pitying sighs are heard and heartfelt sorrows flow behold that beauteous maid her languid head bends like a drooping lilly charged with rain with floods of tears she bathes a lover dead in brave assertion of her honor slain her bosom heaves with sighs to heaven she lifts her eyes with grief beyond the power of words oppressed sinks on the lifeless corse and dies upon his breast how strong the bands of friendship yet alas behind yon mouldering tower with ivy crowned of two the foremost in her sacred class one from his friend receives the fatal wound what could such fury move what but illfated love the same fair object each fond heart enthralls and he the favored youth her hapless victim falls can aught so deeply sway the generous mind to mutual truth as female trust in love then what relief shall yon fair mourner find scorned by the man who should her plaints remove by fair but false pretense she lost her innocence and that sweet babe the fruit of treacherous art claspt in her arms expires and breaks the parents heart ah who to pomp or grandeur would aspire kings are not raised above misfortunes frown that form so graceful even in mean attire swayed once a scepter once sustained a crown from filial rage and strife to screen his closing life he quits his throne a fathers sorrow feels and in the lap of want his patient head conceals more yet remained  but lo the pensive queen appears confessed before my dazzled sight grace in her steps and softness in her mien the face of sorrow mingled with delight not such her nobler frame when kindling into flame and bold in virtues cause her zeal aspires to waken guilty pangs or breathe heroic fires awed into silence my rapt soul attends  the power with eyes complacent saw my fear and as with grace ineffable she bends these accents vibrate on my listening ear  aspiring son of art  know though thy feeling heart  glow with these wonders to thy fancy shown  still may the delian god thy powerless toils disown  a thousand tender scenes of soft distress  may swell thy breast with sympathetic woes  a thousand such dread forms on fancy press  as from my dreary realms of darkness rose  whence shakespeares chilling fears  and otways melting tears   that aweful gloom this melancholy plain  the types of every theme that suits the tragic strain  but do thou worship nature night and morn  and all due honor to her precepts pay  can thou the lure of affectation scorn  pleased in the simpler path of truth to stray  have thou the graces fair  invoked with ardent prayer  they must attire as nature must impart  the sentiment sublime the language of the heart  then if assenting genius pour his ray  warm with inspiring influence on thy breast  taste judgment fancy if thou can display  and the deep source of passion stand confessed  then may the listening train  affected feel thy strain  feel grief or terror rage or pity move  change with thy varying scenes and every scene approve humbled before her sight and bending low i kissed the borders of her crimson vest eager to speak i felt my bosom glow but fear upon my lips her seal impressed while awestruck thus i stood the bowers the lawn the wood the form celestial fading on my view dissolved in liquid air

passions are likend best to floods and streams the shallow murmur but the deep are dumb so when affections yield discourse it seems the bottom is but shallow whence they come they who are rich in words must needs discover they are but poor in that which makes a lover wrong not sweet mistress of my heart the merit of true passion with thinking that he feels no smart who sues for no compassion since if my plaints were not to approve the conquest of thy beauty it comes not from defect of love but fear to exceed my duty for knowing that i sue to serve a saint of such perfection as all desire though none deserve a place in her affection i rather enuse to want relief than venture the revealing when glory recommends the grief despair disdains the healing thus strong desires which boil so high in any mortal lover when reason cannot bid them die discretion then should cover yet when discretion does bereave the plaints which i should utter your wise discretion should perceive my silence is a suitor silence in love bewrays more woe than words though never so witty a beggar who is dumb you know may challenge double pity then wrong not dearest of my heart my love for secret passion he

once to her and joy farewell adieu thou peaceful sunshine of the breast that deigned while delia near with me to dwell ah me what woes in absence lovers prove some happier youth may boldly speak his care may strive to win my delias soul to love and she perchance may lend a listening ear fool that i was still silent to abide yet eloquence itself were vain i fear since i have no other charms defects to hide nor aught to boast of but that i am sincere oh had sincerity sufficed alone alone over lovely delia to prevail boldly ere now my passion i had shown and she with tenderness had heard my tale with her perchance where wyes clear waters roll along the flowery mead i might have strayed from her perchance some pleasing grace have stole and learned perfection from my lovely maid did she in absence know how i am distressed in absence know what pangs for her i prove for her how frequent sighs my bleeding breast at least she would pity if she cannot love while round the board the sparkling bumpers pass and cheerful friends demand a toast from me i to some other nymph fill up the glass but while i drink it delia think on thee come daphnis give a social song they cry to speed with mirth the evening hours away in vain i with their wishes would comply to plaintive notes i sing some lovesick lay yet often i shun those friends whom most i prize my taste for mirth and conversation gone even the quaint joke and wit i now despise and love to wander pensively alone when the chaste moon her silver beams displays to hear the distant waters roll along i stray to hear the

she milder scenes of soft delight my delias form before me stands confessed bland look her glossy eyes with luster bright her dark hair flowing on her snowy breast with delias sweetness makes she delia speak  daphnis what anxious care thy bosom moves to her my passion i all fearful break she hears attends me and with smiles approves now from the east breaks forth the greyeyd morn on nights

heart such gifts remove that sighs for peace and ease nor ease nor peace that heart can know that like the needle true turns at the touch of joy or woe but turning trembles too far as distress the

is over whom glittering baubles can delight no more reclines its head with painful toil oppressed till borne by friendly arms to welcome rest the picture by the same how rare the piece where heaven and nature join to frame a creature more than half divine though wit and beautys mingled graces meet virtue and breeding must the work complete mild unaffected softness let her wear gay without noife nor stray beyond her sphere tho rich in science and in arts refined yet truly feminate in form and mind but since for safety and defense we own some male endowments should her virtues crown let dauntless fortitude and strength of soul preserve enoble and adorn the whole an epitaph on herself by the same destined while living to sustain an equal share of grief and pain all various ills of human race within this breast had once a place without complaint she learnt to bear a living death a long despair till hard oppressed by adverse fate oerchargd she sunk beneath its weight and to this peaceful tomb retired so much esteemed so long desired the painful mortal conflict over a broken heart can bleed no more the hours of love in four elegies night the first elegy now cynthia shone serene with silver light and silence reigned sole monarch of the night now scarce a zephyr fanned the placid sky but all was hushed  save philomel and i sweet tuneful bird who shunst the noise of day darkling to chant thy melancholy lay if it be love that makes thee loath repose then let me mingle sympathetic woes but if thy mate regardless of thy pain still hears thee sing and hears thee sing in vain how shall my ruder voice ever hope to move or charm my gentle delia into love here let me nightly wander in the grove to court the idea of my absent love with fancys eye to gaze upon her charms and press the lovely phantom to my arms bring bring my delias image to my mind and for a moment let me think her kind oh it is in vain  imagination dies the fancied delia like the real flies oh i am sick oppressed with tender grief bring gentle love oh bring me soft relief quick on the wings of expectation fly oh help thy votary help me or i die the nights far spent and soon the morn will rise come gentle sleep and seal these weeping eyes thou balm of nature sink into my breast shut every sense  o lull my soul to rest in soft repose the gentle delias laid sweet be the slumbers of the sleeping maid let no rude thought the peaceful charm destroy but let her dream of love and dream of joy let some bright vision then my form assume with charms delusive and etherial bloom then let the phantom kneel before the fair and tell her how i love and how despair for oh i think could gentle delia know but half my passion or but half my woe she would surely pity though she would not approve and tender pity is akin to love morning the second elegy wished morn is come  a cheerful ray of light peeps through the sable curtains of the night and now i hear the towering lark on high chant his glad mattins through the vocal sky sleepless i have tossed the tedious night away and wished impatient for the tardy day what now avails the cheerful dawn of light wrapped in despair with me it is endless night all nature seems refreshed must only love no kind repose no intermission prove even painful care is sometimes lulled to sleep must love alone eternal vigils keep at delias window i will my station take and sing of love till gentle delia wake in softest strain her slumbers i will remove and she shall wake to music and to love o for tibullus voice for hammonds lyre to kindle rapture and excite desire then should she melt at every tender strain and her heart sigh with sympathetic pain this is her window  sweetest delia rise o lovely maid unveil thy radiant eyes with one soft smile chase dark despair away arise my delia smile and make it day she hears me not  regardless of my pain or if she hears she hears with cold disdain on this bare earth for ever let me lie here let me languish here despair and die but hark a noise  and now the window opes it is delias self  it is she by all my hopes soft gracious smiles over every feature play bright as the radiance of the rising day hail beauteous nymph in native charms arrayed thou needst from gaudy dress no borrowed aid how sweet that loose attire that careless air in artless negligence divinely fair come come my fair together let us stray and taste the fragrance of the early day so shall young health the rosy child of morn with all his mothers bloom thy cheek adorn look look abroad behold it is break of day see on yon lawn the tender lambkins play now every linnet sings in every grove and laughing nature charms the soul to love she smiles assent  descend celestial maid come to my arms my love be not afraid thus let me press my kind consenting fair  starting i woke  she vanished into air oh twas a flattering dream too soon i found stretched at her door i slept upon the ground where delias form my busy fancy drew decked her in smiles then thought the vision true thus let me sleep oh thus for ever dream such heartfelt ecstasies must more than seem then like endymion blessed enraptured boy i will lie entranced in everlasting joy noon the third elegy now phoebus vertically shoots his rays with all the fervor of his noontide blaze now let me seek some solitary grove and give a loose to fancy and to love in what soft scene is gentle delia laid which is at noon my delias favorite shade often in fair richmonds interwoven bowers lonely she loiters out the sultry hours does she to merlins merlins cave in richmond gardens where there is a collection of english classics to which mr pope alludes in this line even merlins cave is half unfurnished yet  awful cave retire to feast her fancy with poetic fire or to the hermitage the hermitage is a grotto in the same gardens in which are placed the busts of several learned men romantic vault where learned busts adorn the classic grot oh let me find the beauteous maid alone and at her feet pour out my artless moan no longer will i pine in dumb despair perhaps my delia is as kind as fair let the soft influence of the enchanting scene the mazy thickets walks for ever green the flowery lawn the lightexcluding grove incline her to the melting voice of love but hark there is music  it is my delias voice my delia sings let all the grove rejoice hush every breeze let not an aspin move let all be silent delia sings of love sweet maid let me not interrupt thy song let the soft notes still warble on thy tongue and yet it is too much at once to wound our eyes with beauty and our ears with sound start not my delia here is no danger near thy beauty guards thee  banish every fear even love himself the tyrant of my heart awes with respect and takes fair beautys part long have thy charms deprived my soul of rest long has the infection rankled in my breast to speak my tender sorrow often i have tried as often my tongue the tender task denied oh hear me gentle delia hear me now incline propitious to my lovesick vow so may thy charms no fading changes prove but bloom for ever constant as my love though unadorned with titles or with power though fortune smiled not on my natal hour yet i have a heart that is rich in fond desire and my soul glows with more than vulgar fire but if it is wealth alone thy love can draw i will dig for treasure in the mines of the author is designed for the profession of the bar law pierce the dull gloom of cokes pedantic lore and from his dross extract the purest ore wondering shall delia hear my praises rung what flowing periods trickle from my tongue inspired by thee and loves superior aid like coke i will counsel and like tully plead unpleasing thus i will drudge away my youth far from the paths of science and of truth wage endless battles at the noisy bar to deck thee with the spoils of civil war for me  if twere not to enrich my fair i would wish to shun the bustling noise of care far in the center of some peaceful grove retired to dwell with delia and with love then should we feast on pure extatic bliss exchanging souls at every melting kiss wrapped in delight my delia then should prove how poor all grandeur is compared to love ah do not go  my gentle delia stay you will scorch your beauties in the blaze of day the sun now rages in his highest noon  and it is a pity sure to part so soon but if we must  let us take one tender leave shall we my fair meet here again at eve oh there is celestial music in that yes thus let me seal the promise of my bliss evening the fourth elegy how mild the evening how serene the sky with streaky purple tinged etherial dye calm stillness rules no zephyr seems to move and the soft hour invites the soul to love the tedious minute now approaches near when delia promised she would meet me here and now to feast my delia in this bower i have gathered every fruit and every flower the velvet peach the plums unsullied blue emblem of untouched beautys virgin hue the pines rich fruit less natures child than arts and cherries  that resemble bleeding hearts to form a couch these roses here i will strew with these i will weave a garland for her brow with floras gifts fantastic dress her hair then gaze with wonder on the smiling fair then will i press her little hand in mine while she with blushing innocence divine and soft reluctance shall my hand control i will pour out all the rapture of my soul grown bold in love transported with my bliss on her ripe lips i will print a living kiss whose warm impression fondly shall impart and send the soft infection to her heart loves fire shall flash around her as i gaze and delias eye shall kindle in the blaze through every vein shall flame the young desire like subtle magic of electric fire from soul to soul the mutual blaze thus caught wish meeting wish and thought preventing thought together well expire in flames of love so semele was once consumed by jove but hark she comes  the punctual maid is near the silky rustling of her veil i hear i will run to meet her  soft  twas but a breeze that gently breathing fanned the quivering trees and yet the times elapsed  why this delay and now the setting sun has closed the day i will climb the lofty summit of this tree happily from thence my delia i may see oh it is a dreary desert all around i strain my eye balls yet no delias found now were it well to ease at once my pains and leaping hence beat out my desperate brains i knew she would not come  deceitful maid how soon her smiles my easy faith betrayed whod think that delia falsely thus could do yet as a woman who could think her true who knows but now most lavish of her charms loosely she wantons in some rivals arms while drunk with luscious love the intemperate boy riots in bliss and surfeits with the joy distracting thought it is phrenzy it is despair i will fly this instant to the abandoned fair her and her paramour i will drag to light and feast censorious matrons with the sight yet stay my heart whence this tumultuous speed my delias wronged  she is innocence indeed she is chaste she is virtuous as the vestal flame it is i am wretchd
