naples chap x of the two calabrias from tarento southward run the provinces of the calabrias which comprise that whole peninsula called the foot of italy from its resembling the foot as the terra di otranto does the heel and is so called on that account the country extends from latitude  0 to below    and is that part of naples which suffered so much by an earthquake  at the mouth of the river basiento near terre di mare a town in ruins built by the angevino kings as a safeguard to the coast are two rows of coarse marble columns that mark the situation of metapontum ten in one row and five in the other their diameter five feet their height sixteen feet the interstices ten feet they are of the ancient doric order these are all the vestiges of metapontum a city which two thousand years ago stood in the skirts of a plain twentyfive miles in length and was in the zenith of its glory pythagoras spent the last years of his life here the metapontines were warm partisans of hannibal he made this city his head quarters and in the retreat of the carthaginians it was punished by the romans for its attachment to hannibal with its loss of liberty this whole district was a colony of industrious and wealthy farmers and there cannot be a sight more mortifying to the pride of man than this wide stretched tract of land almost without an inhabitant full of briars and marshes and stagnant pools and instead of navigable rivers in whose deep and capacious bosom whole fleets might moor with safety the basianto road has the appearance of a straggling torrent impeded by sandbanks that shift at every shower and drive the waters back over half the plain keeping them there to putrify  at the wood near the banks of the agri eleven miles more to the south and about three miles from the sea are some heaps of rubbish that fix the situation of heraclea and near the mouth of the linno stood the city of tyris founded by the trojans and renowned for its college of priests skilled in cabalistic lore heraclea was the place of rendezvous agreed on by the whole greek confederacy where their general interests and disputes were to be settled  upper calabria says swinburne seems decreasing in its number of people owing as it is supposed to the custom of the calabrians never marrying beyond the limits of their own township farms are here let for two years only indeed the baians consider little but their own pleasure and keep the lands waste for the sake of extending their chase so that the peasants their vassals have neither room nor opportunity to raise sufficient food for their support they fly therefore to the convents and take the religious habit and the father of a family when pressed for payment of taxes and sinking beneath the load of hunger and distress va alla montagna that is retires to the woods where he meets with fellow sufferers turns smuggler and becomes by degrees an outlaw robber and an assassin  the women here breed fast and bring forth their offspring almost without a pain it is a common thing for a woman pregnant with child to go up to the forest for fuel to be there surprised with the pains of childbirth to deliver herself without dismay and fold up her infant in her apron and after a little rest return to her cottage che una serva calabrese piu ama far un figlio che un bucato is a proverb much in use in the neighboring provinces that is a calabrian maidservant prefers the labor of a childbirth to that of a wash  the territory of rosetta produces olives capers corn safforn and cotton the mountains abound with fine oak timber fit for shipping and the woods are well stocked with game calabria is too hilly to admit of hunting all game is brought down by the gun or taken in the net they have an exceeding good spaniel so good that the king has taken pains to increase the breed the lower parts of the mountains abound with the ormus or smallleaved flowering mannaash which grows spontaneously about the end of july the mannagatherers make a horizontal gash in the bole of a tree inclining upwards as the liquor never oozes out the first day another cut is given on the second and then the woodman fixes the the stalk of a maple leaf in the upper wound and the end of the leaf in the lower one so as to form a cup to receive the gum as it oozes from each cut all manna belongs to the king who farms it to a set of contractors  all live animals in calabria are taxed another check on husbandry three shillings a year are paid for an ox arable land is here ploughed four times the first in may but the work is badly done they never lay down their lands with artificial grasses but a calabrian farmer thinks he does his farm ample justice if he lets it lie barren three or four years and cover itself with natural grass  the roads through calabria are very bad there is but here and there an inn and at these the accommodations are very poor those who travel this country must proceed on horseback and get recommended from city to city at rossaro swinburne says there was an encampment of zingari or gypsies who are great thieves the gypsies of calabria do not mix with the other people they marry among themselves they have no fixed place of abode but carry their tents with them and pitch them where they please they support themselves by little handicrafts and by swopping or trucking asses and horses their chief work is in making trivets knitting needles bodkins and the like in iron their dress is poor they shave their faces but let their hair grow very long at their weddings they carry torches and have paranymphs to give the bride away they are accounted to be great pilferers cheats and to be faithless shameless and abandoned to all manner of dissoluteness the following anecdote will show how little they are under the control of modesty or fear of shame  a gang of gypsies assembled at a fair with an intention of robbing the shops for which purpose a proper number of them were dispersed in the throng to draw off the attention of the people from their property some of these men and women went into the adjacent fields and proceeded to such indecent liberties as soon brought most of the people of the fair about them and left their shops a prey to the confident thieves they tell fortunes and play juggling tricks as they do in all other countries where they are tolerated a gypsey being brought to nice for larceny declared that his law allowed him to take from others as much every day as sufficed for his maintenance they speak here an oriental jargon of their own and one of the most intelligent among them being asked why their nation was a wandering one replied they could not remain long in one place without being overrun with lice their propensity to breed vermin proceeds from their excessive filthiness they sleep like dogs in a kennel men women and children and take up no more room when asleep than if in their graves  in calabria all the oxen are white large and long horned except those of the red breed lately introduced into sicily their buffaloes are black so are most of the goats sheep and hogs their hogs have no hair but are as sleek in their hides as the elephant dormice are here accounted delicate game as they were in ancient rome where they were kept in warrens and fatted for the tables of the epicures the calabrian horses are pretty spirited and brilliant in their motions but are low and seldom free from vice but will travel two hundred and fifty miles in five days in hot weather  croton the greek city whose walls enclosed a circumference of twelve miles and alone furnished succor to the mother country when invaded by the persians is now but a small place and bears the name of crotone and no vestiges of the ancient city remain near crotone is an island considered as the habitation of calypso but is a rock scarcely able to feed a sheep  there are some customs in calabria that explain some allusions in horace when he says death treads with impartial foot the doors of palaces and of cottages  pallida morsaeque pulsat peda paupeum tabernas regumque turres  he alludes to a custom now existing that of the bailiff kicking furiously at the door of a debtor or tenant that refuses to pay and shuts himself up in his house for safety which implies that he means to give no quarter so horace means that death is inexorably bent in exacting the debt of nature his account of the hardy education and filial obedience of the roman youth  rusticorum mascula militum proles etc is still exact with respect to the young calabrian peasant after hoeing the ground all day with no better fare than bread and water and an onion he does not presume to present himself before his mother without bringing her a faggot or some other wood his animated description of a mother longing for the return of her son ut matter juvenem quem natus invide flatu carpathii etc may still be applied to the calabrian matrons if the feluccas do not appear at the usual term of their annual voyage the mothers and wives of the sailors offer up incessant prayers call on the beloved person by name and remain at their windows with eyes fixed on the cape which the bark is to double the instant a boat is seen coming round the point the whole town resounds with joyful cries of barca barca the boys ring the bells and as soon as they can distinguish what felucca it is run to the relations to claim something to drink for the good news  castelvetere in a lofty situation three miles from the sea occupies the site of caulon of which some vestiges are said to exist caulon was one of the earliest greek settlements but demolished by dionysius four hundred years before christ swinburne tells us that when he was in this neighborhood he joined a crowd one evening that was dragging a woman to church in order to have the devil driven out of her by exorcism she was a middleaged person and seemed to be in strong convulsions which every one supposed to proceed from a demoniacal possession the priest refusing to attend some of the assistants grew impatient and pulled the woman about so roughly that beelzebub thought proper to decamp the patient recovered her senses got up and ran away full speed so that it appeared there was more roguery in her case than real disorder all convulsions of this kind are however attributed to assaults of malignant spirits near fifteen hundred women pretending to be thus tormented go up annually to soriano to be cured by looking at a portrait of st dominick sent down as they suppose from heaven under these pretexts they obtain leave of their tyrannical spouses to make this pleasant pilgrimage and a pair of holiday shoes for the purpose without which they dare not appear before the picture a priest of that convent says swinburne told me a story of a female demoniac who after going through the usual course of cure was sent to him to confess her sins being perfectly well acquainted with the common tricks he ordered her to give him the true reason of her acting that farce threatening her in case of obstinacy with a visit from a real devil who would torment her in good earnest the poor woman terrified at the menace freely confessed that having been married against her inclinations to a goatherd who stank intolerably of his goats and cheeses she shunned his approach and feigned demoniac possession to avoid cohabiting with him having thus got the secret from her the priest in hopes of alleviating her misfortune sent for her husband and knowing it would be in vain to urge him out of a belief of the devils being in his wife planned a different mode of attack and informed the simple fellow that he had discovered what particular kind of spirit it was that this demon was remarkable for an outrageous antipathy to goatherds and that no exorcisms could prevent him from plaguing him the poor man whose first profession had been gardening and whose success in the other line of business had not been very great readily consented to his old way of labor in order to keep satan from his house the friar procured a garden for him and a chapman for his herd of goats and soon had the happiness of seeing the married couple well settled and perfectly satisfied with each other  it is remarkable that the albanian dialect in calabria has many english words bearing the same meaning as with us as for example aunt boor breeches breast car chimney chide cough crab door dream feather grumble hunger and many others these people are settled in calabria and emigrated from albanie only a few centuries ago they amount to at least  00000 and are dispersed in two hundred villages or towns but many of these settlements are wretchedly poor and much decayed those in the neighborhood of bova remarkably so they are a quiet industrious people and their women remarkable for regularity of conduct in their dress they preserve the costume of illyricum from whence their forefathers came the most beautiful women are generally given in marriage to clergymen and are exceedingly proud of their husbands for among them priesthood is the highest nobility when an ecclesiastic dies his widow never enters into a second engagement because none but a virgin can aspire to the hand of a priest and any other is beneath her acceptance  reggio is the capital of lower calabria an archbishopric and is situated on the seacoast at the southern extremity of italy and adjoins the faro or streights of messina the approach to this place is charming every cottage of the suburb being shaded with a beautiful arbor of vines and loaded with clusters of grapes that produce a very good sort of wine oranges and their kindred fruits reach great perfection in these plains which are said to be the first spot in italy where their culture was attempted they are found to be much hardier than was at first suspected many large plantations thriving at the foot of the appenines twenty miles from the sea where in winter there is frost enough to congeal water the reggians trade with the genoese in essence of citron orange and bergamot this spirit is extracted by paring off the rind of the fruit with a broad knife squeezing the peel with wooden pincers against a sponge and when the sponge is full it is squeezed out into a phial and sold at five shillings and sixpence english per ounce  the country round reggio is a rich delicious garden shaded by groves and avenues of poplars and mulberrytrees divided by hedges of pomegranates enclosing vineyards and orchards of orange citron and various other kinds of aromatic fruits copious streams meander through these agreeable plains and distribute life and vigor to every plant  the exportation of oil brings into lower calabria half a million of ducats yearly on each side of the wood are houses erected for silkworms on a particular construction the windows are long and not more than six inches wide to prevent too much air being admitted at a time when the eggs are about to hatch these windows are shut and a moderate fire kept up in the rooms the worms as soon as out are placed on beds of reeds and there fed with the leaves of the red mulberrytree these houses are built by the people of reggio who furnish every thing and take twothirds of the profits  figs here have a fine flavor and the first ever seen in italy was brought from sicily by dionysius the tyrant and planted in his garden at reggio the hills that skirt the great chain of mountains abound with chesnuttrees producing a very large sweet fruit which the people dry grind knead into a paste and use instead of bread  between reggio and scylla a silvermine was opened by the present king of spain but the vein dipping toward the sea and in a rock the expenses would be more than the profits of course it was abandoned  reggio can neither boast of beautiful buildings nor strong fortifications of all edifices the gothic cathedral is the only striking one there is plenty of fresh water here wherever a hole is made in the sands though within a foot of the sea fresh water bubbles up the views all around are enchanting messina rises out of the waves like a grand amphitheatre and the faro or straight lined with villages and towns seems a noble view winding between two bold shores sometimes though very rarely swinburne says it exhibits a very curious phenomenon called la fata morgana as if produced by a fairy or magician the populace are delighted whenever the vision appears and are seen about the streets shouting for joy the philosophic reader will find its causes and operations accounted for in kircher minais and other authors father angelucci was the first person who described the appearance with any accuracy  on the   th of august      as i stood at my window says he i was surprised with a most wonderful delectable vision the sea that washes the sicilian shore swelled up and became for ten miles in length like a chain of dark mountains whilst the waters near our calabrian coast grew quite smooth and in an instant appeared as one clear polished mirror reclining against the aforesaid ridge on this glass was depicted in chiaro obscuro a string of several thousands of pilasters all equal in altitude distance and degree of light and shade in a moment they lost half their height and bent into arcades like roman aqueducts a long cornice was next formed on the top and above it rose castles innumerable all perfectly alike these soon split into towers which were shortly after lost in colonades then windows and at last ended in pines cypresses and other trees even and similar this is the fata morgana which for twentysix years i considered as a fable  to produce this pleasing deception says swinburne many circumstances must concur which are not known to exist in any other situation the spectator too must be particularly situated the winds must be hushed the surface of the faro quite smooth the tide at its height and the waters pressed by currents to great elevation in the middle of the channel all these events coinciding as soon as the sun rises to a certain height every object existing or moving at reggio will be repeated a thousandfold on this marine lookingglass and as the day advances each image will pass rapidly off in succession  tropea is the next city of note traveling northward on the coast of calabria from reggio to naples it is a bishops see containing about four thousand people it derives its name says swinburne from the trophies erected by scipio in his triumphant return from carthage or from those of sextus pompeius after his naval victory off the neighboring cape it is situated on the point of a lofty rock hanging over the sea and joined to the main land by an isthmus almost cut through at the gates leaving only a narrow passage to the town a little to the north is a large island kept as a pasture for sheep and a small one with a hermitage on its summit most romantically situated they have a pleasing effect from tropea  the streets of the town are narrow the houses high and built of stone with great solidity it has two gates one toward the nile that rises from the bay and the other along the isthmus leading to a high plain in which there is a pleasant walk near two miles in length and half a mile broad between the sea and chain of mountains so steep and rugged as seems to cut off all communication by land with the rest of calabria the whole flat and the sides of the hills yield grapes mulberries olives pulse and vegetables and garden fruit in great plenty copious streams rush from the mountain and after watering the orchards are collected into one body and turn a number of mills the water is conveyed in a channel to the edge of a high precipice over the mill there received into a stone well from whence it falls a considerable height upon an overshot wheel and having turned this is again collected for a second mill in a similar way and thus turns many before it reaches the sands some of these cascades as they fall through arbours of vines and groves of orange trees are exceedingly beautiful the wealthy inhabitants of tropea reside within the walls husbandmen and laborers dwell on the outskirts on the land they cultivate  two miles east of this town is paralia a village inhabited by manufacturers and mariners who make cotton blankets and carry them in their own barks to marseilles and genoa  strombolo a volcano on an island sixteen leagues west of this coast on our way to naples is continually throwing up flames and yet the place is inhabited by fishermen who watch their opportunities for a quiet moment to pass along the strand or they would otherwise be buried under a shower of redhot stones  strombolo is one of the lipari islands and a mountain about ten miles round rising suddenly from the sea and is more lofty than vesuvius only not so conical in clear weather it is discoverable at twentyfive leagues distance at sea and at night its flames are to be seen much farther so that the visible horizon seen from the top cannot be less than five hundred miles of course it is of great elevation it is wonderful that this volcano has been continually burning for more than a thousand years it is the lighthouse of the whole coast whose fires are never extinguished this is the island supposed by virgil to be the habitation of aeolus indeed all the lipari islands were called aeolian being full of vast caverns says bridone roaring with internal fires the poets feigned that aeolus here kept the winds prisoners and let them out at his pleasure  the forge of vulcan too has been supposed by the poets to be placed in hiera one of these islands virgil sends him here to make the celestial armor for aeneas and gives a noble description of this gloomy habitation where he found the cyclops busy forging a thunderbolt for jupiter the account of which is very singular  beneath their hands tremendous to survey half rough half formed the dreadful engine lay three points of rain three forks of hail conspire three armed with wind and three were barbd with fire the mass they tempered thick with livid rays fear wrath and terror and the lightnings blaze pit this island is now called volcano all the lipari islands bring no inconsiderable revenue to the king of naples they produce great quantities of alum sulphur nitre cinnabar and most sorts of fruits particularly raisins currants and figs in great perfection some of their wines are also much esteemed particularly the malvasia well known all over europe the isle of lipari from which the rest take their name is by much the largest and most fertile  it is bad traveling in the province of calabria the posthouses not being obliged to keep more than three horses travelers find it difficult to get on the country round tropea resembles a park being quite open but shaded with irregular avenues and straggling clumps of olive trees large enough to cut for timber monteleone is a considerable town on the brow of a hill situated in this open country the barons castle occupies the highest part embowered in evergreens the town covers the rest of the slope in a very happy manner the prospects are enchanting the vales covered with wood and a fine river winds its way through them the distant mountains darkened with extensive forests and lesser hills at their feet swelling into view and intersected by numberless glens from the bosom of which rises the smoke of many sequestered villages monteleone contains three parishes twelve religious houses and thirteen thousand people the scenes and environs of this place equal in beauty the most delightful spots in sicily and on the whole has greatly the advantage over that island in its general aspect  this country seems to be stocked with swine swinburne says he saw many very large herds attended by one or two herdsmen who led them on by the sound of a great bagpipe he is persuaded that the present calabrian swineherds are the exact copies of the ancient ones and that their mode of managing these stubborn animals has been transmitted down by a regular tradition the hogs are well acquainted with their herdsmans note and if by accident two or three herds should meet together the sound of each herds bagpipe will immediately separate them  the calabrian accent is very different from the sicilian being more guttural and fuller of aspirations  paula is a town on the western coast of south calabria not a great way from the city of cosenza renowned for being the birthplace of st francis the founder of the order of minims he was a peasants son and became the favorite saint and patron of his native country the calabrians have still a great confidence in his mediation with our savior but their mode of applying to him is extraordinary they approach his statue with reverential awe holding in both hands an asss halter this they suddenly throw over the head of the statue and after fixing the slipknot with a smart pull repeat their petition and leave the rope swinburne says there was two hundred pounds weight of rope on his shoulders when he saw it st francis kept a small stock of pigeons for the use of the infirmary which he founded and as they are seldom killed for that purpose and held as sacred by all the neighborhood these birds have in the course of near three centuries increased incredibly and are great nuisances some farmers go so far as to sow plots of ground for them and this from a selfish view being persuaded that these pigeons have too much honor to meddle with any seed but what is allotted them unless such provision be not made for them  cosenza is an archbishopric the residence of the governor of the province was the capital of the brutian state and of some consequence during the second punic war the saracens reduced it to ashes in the tenth century but it soon recovered from the calamity louis the third of anjou died here in      and was buried in the cathedral  it is pleasantly situated at the southern extremity of a spacious plain twenty miles along the river crati very broad and about twelve miles from the mediterranean sea the city stands upon seven hills from an ancient castle on the highest of the seven hills the prospect is very grand over the mountains on three sides and down the plain on the other  there is a great difference in the dress and manners of the two calabrias the people of south calabria resemble the sicilians and like them the men wear bonnets north of regliagno the boundary of the two provinces hats are universally worn it has been remarked that the sicilians even now betray strong marks in their character of their ancient connections with the africans and the north calabrese of german solidity arising from colonies transplanted there by the swabian princes and in the south calabrese the neapolitans are evident traces of grecian manners and turn of mind but more so in the latter  though calabria is stigmatized with dishonesty and supposed to be overrun with banditti they are certainly honest to each other for their doors have neither bars nor bolts and during the absence of the master the house is left to the mercy of every passenger  chap xi of their amusements and mode of traveling we have given some of the amusements of this country when speaking of naples but there still remain some few to be treated of particularly the carnival  the carnival is a festival that precedes lent or the time of fasting and is pretty general throughout italy it begins on st charless day and continues till lent all this time the city of naples is very gay with the customary amusements of operas balls masquerades etc terminating with horseraces in the strada toledo and sometimes with a royal masquerade procession of the grand signior to mecca which is a most magnificent spectacle the barbarous cocagna in which a prodigious number of calves sheep hogs lambs and poultry were assembled every sunday in carnivaltime to be torn in pieces by the populace is now discontinued and of course ought not to be related  there are three conservatories in naples for the education of boys in the profession of music these furnish a band for the church of franciscans morning and evening during eight days in october the octaves indeed or eight days following the festival of the patronsaint of every church are a continual solemnity at which the finest voices and best performers attend both morning and evening and the churches at naples are so numerous that the octaves make one continued entertainment throughout the year at the festival of corpus christi the richest churches engross the whole opera voices instruments machines and decorations  to give me an idea of this spectacle says grosley i was told that the santissimo being carried up on clouds almost to the roof of the church of the jesuits descends of itself for the benediction making its way through the clouds which separate and receiving in its passage the veneration of angels and other beings part of whom leave their stations to attend on it what can the greeks think at the fight of spectacles like these they who have no better way of keeping the eucharist than in a leather purse hung up against the wall in the sacristy of their churches  the common people of naples are very devout or rather superstitious next to st gennaro their patron saint the madonnas which are frequent in the streets seem most to attract their attention on christmaseve they play off fireworks the whole night indeed at christmastime all quarters of naples resound with pastorali or siciliane a kind of simple rural music performed by abruzzese or calabrian shepherds on a species of bagpipes the tunes vary according to the provinces in the south they have three different airs the northern shepherds know only two to which they add such variations as their own genius inspires the boys learn of their fathers to play on this instrument as the means of subsistence at other seasons it is rare says swinburne to hear any agreeable sounds in the streets of naples though it is the nursery of musical professors there is no such thing as a national music unless we give that name to a monotanous dralling seguidilla used by the nurses to lull children to sleep and seems borrowed from the spaniards who learnt it of the moors  they do not even dance to music but perform the tarantella which is a low dance consisting of turns on the heel much footing and snapping of the fingers indeed persons of all ranks here dance very low but mark the time as perfectly with their steps as other nations do by springing from the ground the tarantella dance is the delight of their soul and a constant holiday diversion of the young women  bullbaiting is a common diversion there is a large square at naples walled in for the purpose hunting is laid aside but gentlemen throughout the country hunt hares foxes and sometimes wild boars with hounds or lurchers and sometimes with both in autumn fowlers use nets springes or birdlime to take birds and in winter guns all the country is free to those who buy the kings license except some few enclosures where the barons endeavor to preserve the game a license for fowling in the plains of naples with birdcalls costs ten carlines a year in the plains and woods twentyfour and sixty with nets at a distance from the capital it is only four carlines calabria is too hilly for hunting all game is brought down by the gun or taken in nets  the road from rome to naples is bad enough says sharp and the inns worse he traveled in      nothing but vermin and nastiness in their beds on the appian to brindisi the road that horace traveled has nothing in it desirable the swampy soil and marshes on the right and the string of barren mountains on the left for scores of miles together may amuse but cannot delight a traveller  in traveling through the kingdom of naples and the ecclesiastical state an englishman is struck at the scarcity of villages and cottages indeed one may almost assert says sharp that there is no such thing as a village or even a cluster of houses resembling one what single separate houses there are you see at a small distance from the town and as the country is so thinly inhabited the towns swarm with inhabitants if any of these labor in the fields they must travel far for that purpose but there are multitudes of idle people who wrap themselves up in their cloaks and stand pensively and stupid in the streets from morning to night on holidays every soul is in this sauntering attitude  the towns stand on the summit of hills and at some distance afford a pleasant prospect being built with stone and having flat roofs but when you enter within the walls and see the houses so offensively nasty and the windows not only without glass but without shutters the marks of dirty poverty are so strong as almost to turn the stomach some of the inns on this road exceed in filth and bad accommodations every thing that can be conceived i do sincerely believe says sharp they no more think of wiping down a cobweb in a bedchamber than our farmers do of sweeping them away in an old barn and can declare upon my honor that was a spider to fall from his mansion every guest would be liable to receive it in his face as he lies in bed for the whole cieling is covered with them  between the mediterranean sea and the adriatic are many forests where robbers are said to be continually lurking and as an escort government has stationed certain detachments of troopers at proper distances to take travelers and merchants under their protection  in the months of february and march says keysler who traveled it in    0 a person must be very expeditious to travel seven stages in a postchaise from sunrising to sunset but in summer the seventeen stages and a half between rome and naples are easily performed in two days for the two chaisehorses at every stage within the kingdom of naples we pay eleven carlines three shillings and eightpence english and half as much for the chaise if wanted the goodness of the roads this contradicts sharp the fertility of the country and the vigor and strength of the horses make traveling extremely pleasant in the neapolitan territories however we cannot be too careful that the louis dors or spanish pistoles which a traveller brings into this country be of right weight for both at naples and on the road all gold coins are weighed with more cunning than equity and needless cavils raised to make them appear to be under weight  chap xii of their births education marriages physic funerals etc the neapolitan people says bisani are known by their disposition to rebel the peasants are vigorous robust strong muscular full of fire active and very laborious they resemble the italians only in sobriety this race of men glory in their descent from the greeks whom they resemble the other class of people are voluptuous to an excess  though the neapolitan gentry are at a very small expense for their tables keeping little or no company yet upon weddings lyingsinn and funerals they are very pompous lyingin ladies receive company in great crowds the day after their delivery who as soon as their compliments are paid retire to adjacent chambers forming themselves into cardparties or converzationi and are regaled with every dainty the confectioner can furnish these compliments are continued nine days  the establishment of a neapolitan grandees house as has been observed is upon a very expensive plan the number of servants carriages horses and running footmen would suffice for a sovereign prince and the wardrobes of their wives is formed on the same magnificent scale yet it is a fixed rule says swinburne that all ladies whatever be the circumstances of their husbands affluent or circumscribed have an hundred ducats a month and no more allowed them for pinmoney about seventeen guineas english at the birth of every child the husband makes the wife a present of an hundred ounces and some valuable trinkets according to his fortune in the plains it is customary for a peasant on the birth of a daughter to plant a row of poplartrees which are cut down and sold at the end of seventeen years to make up a fortune for her the proverbial benediction of figlij maschi i e male children which a neapolitan gives a woman when she sneezes is founded on the great facility with which the common people provide for their sons as soon as they can run about they are able to earn their bread while their sisters remain idle at home or beg till they are old enough to attract the notice of the men  swinburne says that the neapolitans have tears at command and are very easily moved to show them that neither blows nor caresses can stop their children when once they begin to cry that they must roar till they are tired that all nurses have a notion of singing a monotanous drawling sequidilla by which they lull children to sleep but that they provided against its wakeful influence by such doses of venice treacle as to render it a material article of importation  now i am speaking of nurses it may not be amiss to tell my readers from mrs piozzi that it is a common thing for the wives of the lower class of men to suckle the lapdogs of ladies of quality nay many a woman of fashion has fuckled her own dog herself  education says martyn has been little attended to few people of rank will suffer their children to frequent academies or public schools but keep them at home where in this soft climate they acquire indolence and effeminacy all literary distinctions have been beneath their rank and it was not thought expedient to cloud the playful innocence of childhood or the amiable gaiety of youth with severe study the nobility of this country very seldom travel and the only dramatic pieces here represented are operas in which music not sentiment is the principal thing attended to but the pains and expense government has been at in establishing public seminaries the patriotic effects of the new academy of sciences and belles lettres and the fashion which begins to prevail among the nobility of visiting foreign countries will probably bring on a gradual improvement  marriageportions are not very great in general it does not cost a nobleman more to marry a daughter than it does to make her a nun five thousand pounds will not defray the expense of the ceremonies and profession she must have a pension settled on her and reserves besides a power over her inheritance in case she arrives at any dignity in the convent and wishes to enrich it with buildings plate or vestments  servants and artificers of the city of naples give from fifty to an hundred ducats with their daughters peasants and country workmen go as far as three hundred females at or near naples are esteemed helpless and indolent and therefore have always twice or thrice as much fortune as their brothers who have greater resources in their strength and activity a girl would scarce get a husband if her lover did not expect to be reimbursed by her portion for the sum he paid away with his own sisters  in funeral ceremonies it is usual to hire clergymen who having no patrimony earn as much by their fees on these occasions as pays for their ordination but it is very common says swinburne for them to dress up the vagabonds of the streets in their clothes and send them to sing and pray in their stead these fellows are always attended by a friend who holds a paper bag with a taper in it in which they make the taper sweal and waste as much as possible at the burial of an archbishop of naples four hundred friars attended with wax lights but some thieves let loose a mad ox among them and in the confusion ran away with the candles at another great funeral a gang of rogues disguised themselves like clerks and sacristans and demanded from each assistant his taper which they extinguished and carried off with the utmost hypocritical composure  the manner of burying their dead here is very shocking to an englishman their custom is to carry the corpse dressed in his usual wearing apparel with his face exposed on an open bier through the streets to the church where the service is read after which it is stripped and at a convenient hour buried but there is a pride and rivalry among the middling rank of people in dressing out their children for this exhibition which is truly laughable the other day says sharp there passed under my window the body of a boy about eight years old whose figure and face were as hideous as death and the smallpox could make him the parents had dressed him in a fine laced hat bagwig blue and silver clothes etc and above all things they dont forget to stick a sword by his side the origin of this custom i could not learn but apprehend continues this author it was at first designed to prevent foul play the reality of every mans death is even evident to the whole parish and no young spendthrift can spirit away a father or rich uncle and fill a coffin with stones send it to the grave and take possession of the estate  dr moore tells us he met with a similar funeral procession the deceased was a tradesman whose widow had bestowed not only the utmost attention but more than she could afford in dressing him to the greatest advantage on this solemn occasion he had on quite a new suit of clothes a laced hat on his head ruffles his hair finely powdered and a large blooming nosegay in his left hand while the right was very gracefully stuck in his side  it is the fashion to visit the widow or nearest relation of the deceased the day after his or her death and this compliment of condolence is also paid by every acquaintance before the expiration of nine days  in all the countries i have seen says grosley there is not a town langres in france excepted where the walls of churches are so crowded with epitaphs and funeral inscriptions as at naples and they generally savor very strongly of the country grief expresses itself in epigrams antitheses and puns a diction quite opposite to the style used by the ancients on these solemn occasions misson has inserted a great many of these epitaphs taken as they come the following is one he omitted it is in a stone sarcophagus surmounted with a little bacchus in a chapel of the mount of olives church and was composed by king alphonso the magnanimous in honor of a favorite called mussimo  qui fuit alfonsi quondam pars maxima regis maximus hac tenui nunc tumulatur humo the burial ground set apart for english who die at naples says mrs piozzi is a dirty garden near the city contemptuously called buco protestante where not less than an hundred englishmen are annually interred leaving on a moderate computation fifty or sixty thousand pounds each it is literally a kitchen garden on which cabbages cauliflowers etc are carried to market and sold in the city the catacombs of naples we have mentioned  chap xiii of their commerce trade and manufactories naples by its situation and harbor has always been the center of a commerce which it lies in its own breast to enlarge and that very considerably but notwithstanding its situation and that no kingdom produces the necessaries and luxuries of life in greater profusion yet trade is but in a languishing condition the best silks come from lions the best woollen goods from england  the following merchandise says swinburne is imported in naples  from england  woollen goods of all sorts silk and worsted stockings hats tanned hides lead tin pepper hardware linens fans canes guns dyingwoods drugs watches clocks mathematical instruments household furniture saltcod pilchards herrings

cloth etc  the duties on imports in general are twentyfive per cent on the customhouse valuation sugars and rum pay forty or fifty per cent on the market price the duty on sugar produces annually about  0000 ducats  the exports are hemp flax goats hair silk dried fruits manna horses excellent ship timber and different sorts of grain in the city of naples there are several manufactories of silk velvets velverets handkerchiefs and stockings their soap is much esteemed they also make liqueurs essences artificial flowers and abundance of macaroni the best musical strings are made here from lambsgut there is a manufactory of tortoiseshell which they inlay occasionally with gold for snuffboxes and other articles and they carry on a considerable commerce in polished marbles and lavas they are thought to embroider here better than in france their macaroni is preferred to any modern italy and they have one kind of confection called diabolonis a drug of a very hot and stimulating nature sold at a very high price four or five guineas for a handful  the wines of naples are the best in italy and the clergy are the greatest winemerchants the winecellar belonging to the jesuits if we may credit dr burnet is a vast vault that contains above a thousand hogsheads the people here from the highest to the lowest will drink no wine or other liquors not even water if it has not been some time in snow which they use instead of ice affirming that snow cools liquor sooner and according to mr addison a scarcity of snow would raise a mutiny at naples as soon as a dearth of corn or provisions in another country there are persons who contract under government to serve the city at so much a pound there is a high mountain about eighteen miles from naples in which several pits are dug and here laborers are employed at certain seasons to roll in vast balls of snow which they ram close together and cover from the sun and out of these reservoirs of snow they cut great lumps as they have occasion and send them on asses to the seaside whence they are carried in boats to naples and sold to the several shops at a fixed price  chap xiv of their army and navy constitution revenue laws the standing forces horse and foot in time of peace throughout the kingdom do not exceed   000 men of which   00 are foreigners swiss italians and spaniards a number very insufficient for keeping the inhabitants in awe on the approach of an enemy the officers in the neapolitan service says grosley are distinguished from the ensign to the colonel by the heads of their canes their pay is small a captain having but three hundred dollars a year no officer can marry without the kings consent in order to prevent their marrying below their rank and they say his majesty is very strict in his enquiries before he grants the lady the request for it is she that must ask the permission  the soldiers seem dissatisfied with their situation and are always complaining of their hardships but this is of little moment the frontiers being too well secured for any of them to escape one act of humanity however in their government deserves notice that on deserters being brought back to their corpse they are only imprisoned and fed on bread and water for a few days for the second offense the punishment is heavier but never death  among their regiments there is a corpse of light infantry armed and dressed after the fashion of the catalonian miquelets their uniform is yellow their accoutrements light and fit for desultory attacks their persons well chosen and proper for the duty this regiment is called fucilieii di compagna country fuzileers and their office is to patrole the roads and escort travelers from place to place  the king has a fleet as has been observed of armed galleys and a few men of war but unworthy the name of a fleet so that the state is not secure from the bombardment of a naval force the whole navy of the kingdom says sharp may be seen in the port of naples for as magnificent as it may appear to an englishman it is much larger than they have any use for the only purpose for which they employ their ships of war and frigates is a cruise against the barbary rovers and this happens but rarely they seem at last to have discovered that galleys are but a poor defense against frigates and such as english privateers for which reason they never fit them out for sea but reserve them merely as prisons the following was a true list of their fleet in      two men of war one of    guns and the other of    two frigates of    guns each four galleys four galliots and six xebecks a formidable army against lilliput or their neighboring potentate the pope  as the nobility hold their lands by feudal tenure and were obliged to furnish a certain number of soldiers it was formerly calculated that they could bring into the field  00000 horse and   0000 foot but most of these military services are now turned into rents and the sovereign chooses to rely rather upon foreign troops than his own people  the title of king of both sicilies was first used in the twelfth century when roger ii earl of sicily was also king of naples the title of investiture which the pope claims for the kingdom commenced in the eleventh century when pope leo ix invested count humphrey the norman and his heirs with apulia calabria and whatever he should conquer in sicily though this investiture meant no more than that the pope wished success to the norman arms and pronounced their future conquests lawful yet in  0   it was made more absolute and the province of the kingdom of naples was considered as fiefs to the popedom the pope now accepts the city of benevento from the king of naples for the investiture and sends to naples annually a present of a white palfrey and a purse of six thousand ducats the kings eldest son is styled prince of calabria the arms of the kingdom is a blue field interspersed with lilies or with a tournament collar of five lappets gules  here is one order that of st januarius instituted in      its badge is an image of that saint appendant to a watered carnation ribband hanging from the right shoulder to the left side and on the left breast a silver cross  the nobility are numerous too much so for the extent of the kingdom there are     princes     dukes     marquisses    counts and     barons all vassals of the crown many a spot of land not worth fifty dollars a year gives the title of marquis to the owners so that in general they are very poor  the kingdom of naples is still governed by laws which the normans introduced in the eleventh century viz the annual feudal law in all its origin a proof of its former conquest by the normans the peasants of course are poor and it depends entirely on the personal character of the masters whether their poverty is not the least of their grievances the court of naples has not yet ventured says moore by one open act of authority to abolish the immediate power of the lords over their tenants but it is believed the minister wishes secretly for its destruction  though the neapolitan nobility still retain as i said the ancient feudal authority over the peasants yet their personal importance depends in a great measure on the favor of the king who under pretext of any offense can confine them to their own estates or imprison them at pleasure or which is worse to them can forbid them the court unless the king was to affront all the nobility at once he has little to fear from their resentment even in case of such a union as the nobles have lost the affection and attachment of their peasants what could they do in opposition to a standing army of  0000 men some of whom are swiss entirely devoted to the crown  there are a number of state officers in the service of the crown but men of high birth are seldom here called to the management of public affairs of course they live a great deal upon their estates and these save money to make a figure occasionally at naples the country seats of the nobility are castles with a single wall or ditch about them like the gentlemens chateaus or seats in flanders sufficient to secure them against a troop of banditti but by no means capable of resisting an army  dr burnet says the clergy are possessed of onethird of the lands of the whole kingdom the crown nobility and gentry possess almost all the rest tradesmen and peasants have scarce any they can call their own being no better than tenants at will they manure the lords lands plant and prune his vines and olives and are allowed no more than a bare subsisttance for their poor families they come for justice to the courts of their respective lords in all cases that are not capital or highly criminal and are in all respects subject to these petty sovereigns as the crown lands pay no taxes and those of the clergy none but what they think proper the charges of government are born chiefly by the nobility and gentry  the revenues of the crown amount to about one million sterling per year and arise from the monopoly of salt gunpowder and from excise and different taxes portsroyal and an annual free gift of the nobility clergy and feudal states but there is not above eight or nine millions of ducats current coin in the kingdom including gold silver and brass which is not sufficient for the circulation of a very extensive commerce for although the notes of seven public banks established in naples circulate even down to the value of the smallest sums yet the cash for these notes is paid into these banks as into bankers hands in london and without interest of course this paper money does not increase the quantity of specie circulated it only saves trouble these banks take in pawns to an immense value at stated interests and lend money on other securities  all manufactures sent from the capital into the provinces and exported out of the kingdom are liable to a duty of sixteen to twenty per cent and these duties arise annually to    0  ducats  a ducat is  s  d sterling  there is a great scarcity of gold but much silver and vast quantities of copper coin in circulation gold is so scarce says sharp that i have seen five or six gentlemen not choosing to carry a load of silver sit down to cards and be under the necessity of marking their losings on the contrary there is such a profusion of copper and retail taaders are overloaded with it to such a degree as to oblige them to make a certain allowance for the exchange in consequence of this necessity we see in the marketplaces and streets great numbers of money changers who have a little stall heaped up with copper money which they deliver out for silver to those who want change and they receive of the shopkeepers about a halfpenny for every four shillings worth  the feudal system is here in its full force it begins with the person of the king and extends itself through all classes the kingdom of naples is a fief to the holy see of rome but since the year      the king has not paid his homage many of the fiefs in the two sicilies are in the hands of the venetians and the genoese  the sovereign authority is not unlimited it is in some measure curbed by the states of the kingdom who assemble annually there are six thousand noble families in the kingdom of naples only the great dignities are as numerous as in spain and in every town there are inferior jurisdictions justice is administered by upper tribunals in every province with an appeal to the great court in naples even from sicily itself  the forms of criminal jurisprudence are here so ill ordained says swinburne so multiplied and so complex that if the king was to insist upon a villains taken in the fact being tried and if found guilty hanged before the end of three days the dispatch would almost kill the judges with fatigue for the trial and procedures would employ them full eighteen hours out of every twentyfour first the accusation must be laid according to rule and witnesses examined next the counsel for the prisoner pleads a couple of hours the counsel for the crown one hour then the counsel for the prisoner if he pleases two hours more this done every one of the judges harangues then all the notifications are made examinations canvassed proofs debated and a thousand trifling formalities observed which occasion such shameful unsurmountable delays as eternise a criminal process it happened lately continues swinburne that on the final determination of the trial and condemnation of a malefactor a messenger was sent to the jailer to bring the culprit into court in order to receive sentence when behold the turnkey appeared and made an affidavit that the prisoner had died of a long fit of sickness the christmas twelvemonth before  as the salary of a judge in naples is only fifty ducats a month  l  s  d english he cannot afford to be honest or expeditious but the case is still worse in the provinces where the judges have but half the sum and with that must keep a coach and proper household establishment those who serve warrants writs etc are allowed no pay though they must keep thirty bailiffs each under them of course they are naturally very active in taking up an offender where there is a possibility of extorting any money out of him when once in durance the prisoner ceases to be an object of consideration to them and therefore they take no pains to forward his trial there were above twelve thousand criminals rotting in the different prisons of the kingdom when mr swinburne was there whose maintenance cost the state above two hundred thousand ducats a year    00l  the plaintiff and defendant are not brought face to face before a judge but the cause is brought on by an attorney on the part of each one states the accusation the other the defense after this the judges by a plurality of voices determine according to the evidence of course the delays of criminal causes become as tedious as those of civil ones  the prisoners condemned to the galleys of which there are generally about two thousand are chained two and two and may be thought to suffer by lying on the decks but their condition is far preferable to that of many of the poor who lie in the streets besides they have a certain allowance of bread from the king and wear some clothing the galley slaves lead an idle life whatever work they do aboard is chiefly for their own benefit for few of them are employed in cruising if a tailor or a shoemaker earns a few pence he puts a part of it into his pocket and purchases some rarity with it a man says sharp who has visited them as often as i have done will never when he means to picture extreme misery represent it in the shape of a galleyslave i have seen a musician on board entertaining them with vocal and instrumental music whom they paid for his performance and i have no doubt but this poor man styled those we call wretches his good masters  chap xv of their religion the roman catholic religion here is on a very bad footing and the best that can be said of the ecclesiastical constitution is that the neapolitans have always resolutely opposed the introducing of the inquisition the number of monasteries and convents is astonishing and the clergy may be said to be all wealthy but the laity poor we have said that the clergy possess a third of the kingdom but giannone who wrote with such veracity and freedom on the ambition of avarice of the neapolitan clergy and thereby involved himself in misfortunes mentions as a general received opinion that were the country divided into five parts four would be found in the hands of the church as being in actual possession of half the land and having upon an average procured by legacies and donations a fifth and a halffifth more scarce a person dying without leaving something to a church or a convent indeed such is the power and opulence of the clergy of this country says keysler and the veneration paid them that more than once they have been ready to seize the civil power the laity have often in the strongest manner petitioned their sovereign that the clergy should be no longer allowed to purchase lands but all endeavors were fruitless till      when measures were invented for the popes consent for lessening the number of convents  as to external ceremonies the devotion of the roman catholics here is not so outrageous as in several provinces of germany at the elevation of the host in churches protestants are not compelled to kneel and travelers are allowed to eat flesh in lent in this kingdom are twentyone archbishopricks and one hundred and twentythree bishoprics in      the kingdom of naples alone contained       priests       monks and  0    nuns the abbeys priories commendaries in the two kingdoms are very rich and amount to one hundred and twenty  the most common procession which is exhibited almost every day is not so much intended to create devotion as to raise a fund for penitent prostitutes who have quitted their abandoned way of living and retired to a convent in order the more effectually to move the spectator to charity the youngest and most beautiful of these penitents are selected who are ordered to walk barefooted through the city two abreast at some particular places they kneel down acknowledge their past wickedness and sing penitential hymns the ecclesiastic and a lay assistant who attend them in the mean time receiving the contributions of the public in a purse fastened to the end of a stick their habit on these occasions is a violet colored gown tied round the waist with a cord of the same color their heads are shaved but they wear a blue veil which however is thin enough to give a sight of the charms of youth and beauty as powerful incentives to a liberal contribution  the neapolitans have a tendency to atheism says keysler molines had a strong party in this city and many in their heart are jansenists naples is the place of all italy where booksellers are under the least restraint books written by protestants are openly sold  at naples they have a practice unknown at rome and which is meant as a piece of devotional compliment to the savior of the world from the friday to the sunday inclusive which three days our lord remained interred in the earth persons of quality visit in chairs and those of inferior rank walk no carriages are allowed at that time to pass the streets left by their clatter they should disturb our savior in his grave i speak not this ludicrously says sharp there are thousands who believe him at this time in the bowels of the earth  among other ridiculous practices which are meant as sacred ones in the holy week they fasten a man on a cross and carry him in procession through the streets of naples on each side of the cross are two vulgar women who with their hair dishevelled and some gestures of lamentation represent mary and mary magdalen in tears the man who represents our savior is some poor fellow who is paid a shilling or two for his trouble the extension of his arms for a length of time being very uneasy and painful to him  they have even admitted into their devotion the noise and explosion of gunpowder i was roused one day from my seat continues sharp by a universal discharge of the whole artillery of naples and on enquiry was informed the guns were fired for the immaculate conception of the virgin mary in truth the neapolitans are the greatest gunpowder nation in the world no merchant sends a few casks of wine into the city but they are preceded by squibs crackers and the firing of muskets and during the christmas week all the young men boys and little children spend every farthing they can scrape together in gunpowder and pop and shoot all day and all night to the great annoyance of the healthy and the disturbance of the sick  one of the greatest singularities of naples at christmas is the presepe which is a representation of the birth of our savior with all its concomitant circumstances in small figures it is exposed either in a suite of apartments or on the flat top of a house and by means of masses popes cork and branches of trees form an historical landscape some of these presepes are pretty enough they contrive to make the sky and distant country a part of it and optical illusions are wonderful  the presepe or presepio properly signifies a manger and this is a dedication of the presepio to the virgin and her infant not only in churches but in houses among the puppets exhibited we often see the wise men of the east with the star over their heads on one spot the shepherds attending their flocks with the angel descending toward them on another the virgin the infant joseph and the ass on another in short the composer introduces such figures and historical facts into the group as the new testament and sometimes his own fancy suggests but what renders this madepicture really an object for a man of taste is the artful disposition of the figures amidst a scenery of perspective astonishingly deceitful to the eye these are often made at a very great expense from five hundred to as many thousand pounds and are always kept up the poor if they are not already provided with a presepio purchase a cheap trumpery one at christmas which they lock up with care the whole year or perhaps for their lives  in time of lent fine preachers from every monkery travel to distant provinces to hold forth to the public and naples is generally visited by some of the best mr sharp tells us he was induced to go and hear one or two of them that were in the highest estimation for their eloquence some of the pulpits are a kind of gallery which admit of great scope for action running from one end to the other and injudicious preachers do not fail to take advantage of it it is the habit of this country to employ much action and gestures in the most trifling conversations this habit infests the bar and the pulpit and from an indiscriminate application of it on slight occasions its force and effect are lost in great ones  but what gives more offense is a familiarity of style which they have introduced into their compositions when even god almighty and our savior are the subjects in question i went the other day says sharp when the most celebrated preacher was in naples this was in      who among other inelegancies gave us a familiar dialogue and in a very familiar manner betwixt god and jesus christ in which our savior begged and prayed that he would not damn mankind but god being inexorable and deaf to all entreaty our savior said why then if your justice must exceed your mercy be so good to damn me and spare them this the preacher told us god was so good as to comply with i believe continues sharp i have not mistaken him a jot because another gentleman who was present agreed with me in every particular word for word and i was so fearful of misrepresenting the truth that i immediately committed it to paper  there has crept also into fashion an idle custom of telling a story in their sermons with which they sometimes finish their discourse as our clergy do with a practical inference they mean that the moral of their stories should be a religious one but their attempts to tell in the character of a man of the world often miscarries a certain catholic lady continues this author informed me that last year she was at church when a celebrated jesuit told the following story that queen elizabeth so famous throughout the world for her heresy made a compact with the devil that if he would indulge her in all she desired and suffer her to reign so many years she would surrender her soul at the conclusion of that term accordingly the day she died there was a great black cloud ascended from the thames which drew the attention of an infinite number of spectators who at last heard a voice from the cloud pronounce these words i am the soul of queen elizabeth now going to the devil for the sins i have committed there is one week in lent that most of the ladies of distinction go every day to hear a sermon at the jesuits church and it was on one of those days that the preacher told this story to the politest congregation at naples  the preachers here have a moveable crucifix in the pulpit about two feet high standing close to their elbow the christ on it has generally a crown of thorns and the stream of blood down his face and breast are painted with a lively red at the conclusion of the sermon or on any other apposite occasion when the preacher is to set forth the sufferings and agonies of our savior dying for the salvation of the world he takes the crucifix in his hands displays the bleeding wounds of the image and if he has any pathetic powers never fails to extort such marks of contrition and horror from the congregation such knockings on the breast such an effusion of tears and sometimes amongst the women such involuntary hysterical screams as protestants have no idea of  but powerful as the crucifix usually is particularly in the hands of an eloquent preacher i am tempted says sharp to tell a ludicrious story bordering upon profaneness where its efficacy failed it is one of those instances where a burning zeal through a deplorable ignorance furnishes matters of raillery to scoffers and compassion to such as are truly religious at naples there is a place called largo del castello not unlike our tower hill the resort of the idle here every afternoon monks mountebanks pickpockets and conjurors follow their several occupations the monk for i never saw more than one at a time holds forth like our itinerant fieldpreachers to what congregation he can collect the mountebank by means of punch and his fellow comedians endeavors to gather as great an audience as he can it happened one day that punch succeeded wonderfully and the poor monk preached to the air for not a living creature was near him mortified and provoked that a puppetshew within thirty yards of him should draw the attention of the people from the gospel to such idle trash with a mixture of rage and religion he held up his crucifix and called aloud ecco il vero pulcinella here is the true pulchinello come here  come here this story is so well known in naples to be true that the most devout people tell it and were it not for such a sanction i should not have repeated it  to be more serious mrs piozzi tells us that she saw a very odd scene one morning at church which though new to her perhaps from its frequent repetition seemed to strike no one but herself  a lady with a long white dress and veiled came in her carriage which waited for her at the door with her own arms on it and three servants better dressed than is here common followed and put a lighted taper in her hand en cet etat she moved slowly up the church looking like jane shore in the last act but not so feeble and having reached the steps of the high altar threw herself quite upon her face before it remaining there prostrate at least five minutes in the face of the whole congregation who neither stared sneered smiled nor lamented but minded their own private devotions no mass was saying the lady rose kissed the steps and bathed them with her tears mingled with sobs of an affected penitence this done she retired to her seat where she waited with others the commencement of the sacred office  let not this story however continues our fair authoress lead any one to think that more general decorum or true devotion can be found in churches of the romish persuasion than in ours  quite the reverse this burst of penitential piety was in itself an indecorous thing but it is the nature and genius of the people not to mind pretenders dogs are suffered to run about and dirty the churches during the whole time of service whilst the crying of children and the most indecent methods taken by the women to pacify them give one still juster offense in all the churches of italy there is no treading for spittle and nastiness but more so at naples  i will conclude these anecdotes of their religion with the customary miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of st januarius their patron saint which is kept in two different phials one holding near an ounce and the other a few drops in one of the chapels of the church dedicated to that saint both the phials resemble the ladies smelling bottles for salts the larger being a depressed spheroid like a flat watchcase of three inches diameter with glasses before and behind the smaller a narrow cylindrical one they are contained in a gold case between two circular glasses of about three inches diameter supported on a thin pedestal by which means when it is held up against light or a candle placed behind the spectator sees clearly the bottles and their contents which seems to be a congealed substance not unlike a lump of spanish snuff keysler says it is of a brownish red and looks like balsam of peru which may be very easily liquified the pretended liquefaction of the coagulated blood in the phials when placed near the head is known to all the world this farce is acted the first sunday in may and on the success or failure of this miracle the prosperity or calamity of the succeeding year is supposed to depend as its success that is its liquefaction occasions great rejoicings so if the blood remains coagulated recourse is had to processions and public flagellations etc to avert the impending danger  on the day when this miracle is to be exhibited the phials containing the blood stand surrounded with a great number of lights they are applied to the mouths and foreheads of an innumerable multitude of people who throng to partake of such a blessing the priest all the while burning it every way so that by the continual agitation the warmth of his hands the heat from the lights the effluvia from the crowd the sultriness of the weather etc it is not unreasonable to suppose a condensed fluid may be gradually restored to its liquid state this operation sharp says is generally executed in eight ten fifteen or twenty minutes but when he was present it was near an hour and half it being a very cold morning some heretics finding how slowly the miracle operated thought proper to retire to save their bones from being broke for the neapolitans entertain an opinion that the saint refuses to act when heretics are present and as the refusal is esteemed ominous they have sometimes drove them very rudely from the altar i heard continues he a woman declare that it must be owing to the presence of some protestants in the churches that the miracle went on so slowly the liquefaction in the larger phial was evident in the smaller the matter after the miracle appeared of a more vivid red i cannot say it resembled blood very much in either of them as soon as the liquefaction takes place the priests cry out il miraculo e fatto the miracle is done which is immediately answered by a te deum amid the acclamations of the people and a discharge of cannon in      mr neuman a celebrated chemist at berlin invented a method to liquefy coagulated blood easily at any time so that admitting the contents of the phial to be blood which most likely is not the case there is nothing wonderful in the business  chap xvi of their learning arts sciences etc the neapolitans are far from being deficient in understanding but notwithstanding all their schools universities and academies their religion must be a perpetual bar to the improvement and increase of solid literature though the booksellers in naples enjoy more liberty than in other italian states yet they are under very mortifying restrictions says busching with regard to the publication and vending of books  dr burnet who would not allow the clergy of naples any great share of learning observes however that there were societies of men in this city of finer thoughts than could be found in any other part of italy  at naples there is a university several public libraries and professors read lectures here on theology medicine politics law mathematics physics history humanity and languages in the two kingdoms there are four universities and many academies of science music sculpture and architecture  with respect to the arts naples has been infinitely more happy in painting than in architects lanfranc diminichini guido and of the bologna school lucca giordano and massimo  the architecture of both sacred and civil public and private edifices is no longer the architecture of rome the outside of most of the churches even the most stately and splendid is all over italy only a bare wall standing as it were in expectation of a portal their churches are ill built in the form of a cup with a cupola over the junction all their gates and doors are loaded with heavy balconies supported by brackets heavier than what they bear or suspended by a miracle the insides are rather rich and glaring than fine and the decorations and distributions every where uniform  the fountains says grosley in the several parts of the city bear the marks of the same bad taste but no where does neapolitan taste shine with so much luster as in the pyramids or obelisks erected in squares fronting the principal churches in the monstrous expense of them in the uncouth assemblage of the various marbles they exceed all the enormities of gothic rudeness  it is universally known that naples is the center of the best music in italy and the non plus ultra in execution it is to all italy in music what athens was to greece in eloquence and philosophy but its music like other arts savours a little of the national fondness for the capriccioso and the stravagante  naples has for a long time been the school and seminary of the best violins yet they question their skill till they have been tried by the renowned tartini of padua where they flock to covet his approbation tartini cooly hears them and after very attentively listening to what they propose to execute that is fine says he or that is very difficult that is brilliantly executed but adds he putting his finger to his breast it did not reach hither  the study of music is so much neglected says sharp at naples that i found it as impossible here as at venice to have a harpsichord to play on nor do they ever print their operas or favorite airs  the italians count their hours to twentyfour oclock beginning the day from the time it is almost dark so that time varies with them in conformity to the setting of the sun for example if they begin to count from our sixin the evening when it is seven with us it will be one with them and the next day when it is seven in the evening it will be a little past one with them as many minutes as the day is lengthened to obviate therefore this error in time they alter their clocks and watches as often as the error amounts to fifteen minutes advancing or putting them back as the days shorten or lengthen if a man forgets to alter his watch he loses or gains a quarter of an hour and of course cannot be very punctual to his engagements there is no man sufficiently learned in this place to know the origin of this method of reckoning  of the island of sicily from busching brydone swinburne non keysler etc chap i of the country climate productions etc sicily is in the shape of a triangle situated between    and    degrees  0 min north latitude and between the   th and   th degrees of east longitude being about two hundred and ten miles long from east to west and one hundred and thirtythree broad from north to south three hundred round and the largest of all the mediterranean islands it was anciently called sicania but the siculi conquering great part of it gave it the name of sicilia it has been held that sicily was originally joined to the continent of italy but gradually separated from it by the encroachment of the sea and the devastations of earthquakes the streights between sicily and calabria were by the latins called fretum siculum but its common name is il faro de messina from pharus the lighthouse at the bottom of cape di faro opposite this cape in calabria stands the rocky promontory of scylla at the distance of about five miles across the ebb and flood in these streights are very irregular and strong where it is narrowest between faro and sciglio extremely impetuous the flux of the sea is much more violent in its descent toward greece than in its return upwards during this descent there is no stemming the tide even in a strong southerly wind so that it is usual to have the vessels hauled up along the coast of calabria by men and it is also impracticable for any vessels to cross the current from calabria to sicily mr popowitsch conceives that this rapidity proceeds from the course of the waters issuing out of the atlantic ocean into the mediterranean which directly bear upon this part of calabria it is therefore natural to think that it is this direct impulse of the sea on the coast of calabria which among the ancients raised such terrifying ideas of cape scylla or sciglio for till experience had shown how to avoid the danger ships were often driven against this promontory and dashed to pieces this rock is near two hundred feet high has a large castle on its summit and from it a line of houses extends on both sides in a slope to the beach semicircular planted with trees and sheltered with very high clifts containing three or four hundred inhabitants and gives the tide of prince to a calabrese family there are many small rocks that show their heads at the base of the large one and are probably the dogs that are described as howling round the monster scylla  the whirlpool charybdis which was once supposed to be an abyss into which the waters precipitated themselves is a kind of vortex arising from the currents of the sea at particular winds opposing each other in a calm and when the south wind does not blow this place is so smooth that a boat may cross it with safety it lies close on the outside of the harbor of messina vessels in this passage are obliged to go as near as possible to the coast of calabria to avoid the suction occasioned by the whirling of charybdis that when they come to the narrowest and most rapid part of the streights they are in danger of being carried on the rock of scylla from whence the proverb still applied to those who in attempting to avoid one evil fall into another  incidit in scyllam cupiens evitare caribdem there is a fine fountain of white marble on the key of messina representing neptune holding scylla and charybdis chained under the emblematical figures of two sea monsters as represented by the poets  sicily is so hot a country that even in the beginning of january the shade is refreshing and it is only for a few months in march etc that any chilling winds are felt and even then a little fire suffices to banish the cold the only appearance of winter is toward the summit of mount aetna where snow falls and where it is preserved for use in the following manner pits are dug in the open air and in these they lay the snow with straw or stubble and salt stratum super stratum layer upon layer and then cover the place with earth in summer when wanted one of these pits are opened on one side and the snow being taken out the hole is again closed  the hot sirroc winds are as powerful here as at naples though the island appears to be one entire rock the soil is exceedingly fertile anciently it was styled the granary of rome and now it exports great quantities to naples which would otherwise be distressed it is however far from being well cultivated several tracts on the western side lying waste its wine is excellent as are also all fruits together with honey oil salt saffron and sugar which last is produced in the neighborhood of mount aetna all the coasts afford good fisheries particularly for unny the cattle are fine and all sorts of game in plenty great profits are made here of silk where it was introduced in    0 from the holy land and hence soon spread to naples spain and the french provinces bordering on italy in this island are also found gems or marble stones metals and minerals as gold silver copper tin lead iron alum and a variety of hot baths and medicinal springs  many of their springs are boiling hot others still more singular are colder than ice and yet never freeze  in several places they have fountains that throw up a kind of oil on their surface which the peasants burn in lamps and use for many other purposes there is still one more remarkable at nicosia called il fonia canaletto this is covered with a thick scum like pitch which the country people esteem a sovereign remedy in rheumatic and other complaints  the water of a small lake near naso is celebrated for dying every thing put into it black though the water is remarkably pure and transparent they have a variety of sulphurous baths where the patient is thrown into a profuse sweat only from the heat of the vapor about a mile and a half from palermo at a small beach where the people go to swim there are many springs of warm water that rise even with the sea at the depth of five or six feet  brydone is of opinion that not only mount aetna but the greatest part of sicily and almost the whole of the circumjacent islands have been originally formed by subterraneous fire from the distant hot springs and from throwing lava pumice and tuffa at a great distance from aetna  at trapany is a considerable coralfishery in short whatever seems requisite in point of necessity delight or ornament this country affords in such a liberal manner that the inhabitants notwithstanding how much it is burdened by their viceroys live at their ease and grow rich  the great standing commodity as i have observed is wheat they preserve their grain not by exposing it to the air as we do but by shutting it up in pits or where the soil is dry or in caverns in the rock these open by a small hole at top and widen below here they pour down their wheat after it has been made exceedingly dry and ramming it hard they cover up the hole to protect it from rain and assure us it will preserve in this manner for many years  the soda is a plant much cultivated here and turns out to good account this is the vegetable that by the action of the fire is afterward converted into mirrors and chrystals great quantities are sent annually to venice to supply the glasshouses their honey is delicious even superior to that of minorca it is found by the peasants in the hollows of trees and rocks the sugarcane thrives well here and they make sugar enough for homeconsumption liquorice juice is preferred both here and in calabria the juice is squeezed out of the roots after which it is boiled to a consistency and formed into cakes which are packed up with bay leaves and exported in the same order as we receive them  in some of the northern parts of the island they find shellfish that produces a kind of flax of which gloves and stockings are made this is the muscle found in great quantities at tarentum  the pistachio nut is much cultivated here and with great success these trees like many others are male and female the male is always barren but unless a quantity of these are mixed in every plantation the pistachiotree never bears a nut but of all the variety cultivated in sicily the mannatree is esteemed the most profitable it is a kind of ash and resembles it much about the beginning of august during the greatest heat an incision is made in the bark near the root and a thick whitish liquor is immediately discharged from the wound which soon hardens in the sun when it is carefully taken off and and gathered into boxes they renew these incisions every day during the season wounding the tree on one side only reserving the other side for the next year  the cantharides fly is a sicilian commodity found on several trees of aetna  the marbles of sicily would be a great source of opulence if the quarries were encouraged at centorbi they have a kind of soft stone that dissolves in water and is used to wash linen instead of soap from which property it is called pietra saponaro soapy stone they likewise find here as well as in calabria the celebrated stone which on being watered and exposed to a pretty violent degree of heat produces a plentiful crop of mushrooms but it would be endless to give an account of all the various commodities and curious productions of this island it is also well watered for it has five principal rivers  chap ii of their history sicily has had many masters and being classic ground it may not be unentertaining to our readers to have a short sketch of its history this island was invaded by the greeks six or seven centuries before the birth of christ and they became blended with the natives aristocracy prevailed first tyranny succeeded under phalaris os agrigentum six hundred years before christ and democracy followed syracuse went to pieces by dissension and their arts and sciences fell before it soon after the settlement of the grecians the carthaginians from africa invaded it with large bodies of forces and about five hundred before christ made themselves masters of all the western parts the old inhabitants the siculi kept the midland county and the greeks the eastern coasts  dionysius the elder had the supreme command at syracuse avarice despotism and cruelty marked his reign and his son dionysius the younger succeeded him who was the greater tyrant of the two agathocles a tyrant however seized the throne and deluged the country with blood this man at war with the carthaginians drove them off his coast followed them to africa routed them in a pitched battle burnt their fleet and laid their territory waste but the sicilian forces were men of no principle murder and riot ensued upon the victory they murdered the friends and children of their king he escaped to sicily and there met a death which his crimes deserved  pyrrhus king of epirus now took the lead reduced all parties to obedience but making sicily feel the weight of his hand the sicilians soon drove him out at this time a crew of miscreant romans took messina slaughtered the inhabitants eslablished a republic there and became troublesome to hiero ii whom the greeks raised to the chies command at syracuse he leagued with carthage to turn out the romans but being assisted from italy defeated the carthaginians and hiero became an ally of the republic this began the first punic war for the several dates see truslers chronology hamilcar barcas long supported the african cause but not succceding to his wishes led the carthaginians to purchase peace of the prince of sicily this did for some time but the vanquished party gaining strength hannibal hamilcars son persuaded them to renew the combat and for sixteen years carried war into the heart of the roman territories this was the second punic war hiero of syracuse kept terms with both parties but being succeeded by his grandson hieronymus who contracted an alliance with carthage he soon fell a victim to his own folly syracuse was now independent but marcellus soon after besieged it under the advice of archimedes and took it  from this time sicily relinquished all martial ideas for many generations the people turned their thoughts to peace and agriculture till in     the saracens subdued the country and chose palermo for their capital and the standard of mahomet triumphed for about two hundred years  in  0   george maniaces was sent with great force by the greek empire to attack sicily he did this in conjunction with some norman troops whom he took into pay and succeeded robert and roger normans of hauteville afterward conquered sicily on their own account after a ten years struggle the saracens yielded it up in  0   and robert ceded it to his brother roger who assumed the title of great john of procida earl of sicily he was succeeded by simon his eldest son and simon by roger in      who called himself king hence the kingdom descended from son to son till the reign of william iii who was vanquished by henry of swabia thus it continued with the germans till after the battle of benevento when it submitted to charles of anjou and for several years obeyed him notwithstanding the wanton cruelty with which they were treated but a day of retribution came at last sicily had been revenged for twelve years by as many tyrants as it contained frenchmen no redress could be obtained nor hope left of future indulgence their best appeal therefore was a dagger john of procida with the connivance of the greek emperor and the king of arragon soninlaw to manfred who had been king of sicily encouraged the growing ferment and on eastermonday      at the vesperbell the people of palermo rose and slew every frenchman they could find man woman and child their example was followed by the whole island not a french person was left living no pardon could be expected from charles the insurgents therefore offered the crown to peter i king of arragon who defended and kept it in his family it continued till      when the line of arragon becoming extinct it fell to ferdinand i of castile with this family it continued till the death of john king of navarre and at the peace of utrecht it was ceded to victor duke of savoy  not many years afterward the emperor charles vi forced him to relinquish sicily and take that of sardinia in lieu of it but as the spaniards had no concern in these bargains they made a sudden attempt to recover sicily in this they failed owing to the vigilance of the english admiral byng who destroyed their fleet in       in      the spaniards resumed their design with success the infant don carlos drove the germans out and was crowned king of the two sicilies at palermo this kingdom being ceded to him on condition it was never united to spain when he took the crown of spain in      he transferred that of sicily to his second son ferdinand the third of sicily and fourth of naples his eldest son being an idiot and established the succession to the heirs male of ferdinand and his younger brother and in default of male issue to the females  chap iii of mount aetna the principal mountain is aetna a volcano that appears at sea when first discovered as a prodigious chimney or a very large rugged pillar the perpendicular height to the the top is between two and three miles some have imagined it more and some rather less  the whole mountain is divided into three distinct regions the fertile the woody and the barren these three are as different both in climate and productions as the three zones of the earth the fertile region surrounds the foot of the mountain and is rich in the extreme to the extent of about fourteen or fifteen miles where the woody region begins being composed almost entirely of lava which after a number of ages is at last converted into the most fertile of soils from catania to nicolesi twelve miles up the mountain though its perpendicular elevation is not probably more than three thousand feet the climate says brydone who ascended it in    0 was totally changed it was at the latter end of the month of may and at catania the harvest was entirely over and the heats insupportable here they were more moderate and in many places the corn is as yet green the road up was very bad over old lavas and mouths of extintinguished volcanoes now converted into cornfieldsd vineyards and orchards the fruit of this region is reckoned the finest in sicily particularly the figs  the lavas forming this region of the mountain have thrown up an infinite number of beautiful little mountains every where scattered on the immense declivity of aetna all of a regular figure and almost covered with beautiful trees and the richest verdure each of these mountains has been transformed by one irruption and perhaps in the course of a few days in the irruption of      the stones and ashes thrown out for months formed a mountain of a great size seven or eight miles round and a thousand feet in perpendicular height other mountains are not above three or four miles round and three or four hundred feet high  the progress of an irruption is as follows the mountain after shaking for vent bursts open somewhere in its side at first it only sends forth thick smoke and showers of ashes that lays waste the adjacent country these are soon followed by redhot stones and rocks of a great size thrown to an immense height in the air the fall of these stones with the ashes form the mountains mentioned after the new mountain is formed the lava generally bursts out from its lower side and braving every thing before it is generally terminated by the sea it sometimes happens though rarely that the lava bursts out at once from the side of the mountain without all these attendant circumstances as is the case with vesuvius where the elevation being so much smaller the melted matter is generally carried up into the crater of the mountain discharging showers of stones and ashes from the mouth without forming any new mountain only adding considerably to the old one at last the lava rising near the summit bursts the sides of the crater and runs down in an ocean of liquid fire aetna being on a much larger scale one crater is not enough to give its lava vent  brydone was well assured by a person of credit that he saw in an irruption of aetna large rocks of fire discharged to the height of some thousand feet with a noise more terrible than that of thunder this person took notice that from their greatest height of these rocks of fire till they reached the ground it was twentyone seconds of time which according to philosophic measurement must have been upwards of seven thousand feet  we cannot pretend to follow mr brydone through all his description of this mountain those who wish for more information must have recourse to his tour through sicily and malta but we will mention some of the most curious particularities the country of hybla celebrated for its honey was overwhelmed by an irruption it was called mel passi but when overwhelmed became barren and was called mal passi in a second irruption by a shower of ashes on it it was again rendered fertile and its name was then changed to bell passi but in the great volcanic irruption of      it was laid under an ocean of fire and reduced to the utmost state of barrenness and has since been called mal passi the lava however in its course over this beautiful country has left several little islands or hillocks uncovered just enough to show what it formerly was these make a singular appearance in all the bloom of luxuriant vegetation surrounded and rendered almost inaccessible by large fields of black and rugged lava that issued from a mountain not more than three hundred feet high first formed itself by an irruption of aetna  massa says that in some irruptions of aetna the lava has poured down with such a sudden impetuosity that in the course of a few hours churches palaces and villages have been melted down and the whole run off in fusion without leaving the least mark of their former existence for these churches and villages having been built with lava it is the property of such matter to melt down instantly on being overrun with other melted lava and thus mingle in the general fusion  the great irruption of      after shaking the whole country round for four months and forming a very large mountain of stones and ashes burst out about a mile above the mountain montpeliere then below it and descending like a torrent bore directly against the middle of that mountain and as they pretend perforated it from side to side however it is certain it pierced it very deep it then divided into two branches and surrounding this mountain joined again on its south side laying waste the whole country between that and catania scaled the walls of that city and poured its flaming torrent into the ocean in its way it is said to have destroyed the possessions of thirty thousand people and reduced them to beggary it formed several hills where valleys were before and filled up a large lake among other singular circumstances says brydone the following is well ascertained  a vineyard belonging to a convent of jesuits lay directly in its way this vineyard was formed on an ancient lava probably a thin one with a number of caverns and crevices under it the liquid lava entering into these caverns soon filled them up and by degrees tore up the vineyard and the jesuits who every moment expected to see it buried beheld with amasement the whole field begin to move off it was carried on the surface of the lava to a considerable distance though the greatest part was destroyed yet some of it remains to this day  there is a great wildness ferocity and credulity in the inhabitants of this mountain they conceive the crater of aetna to be the mouth of hell they thinking says brydone that we were come to look for hidden treasures flocked round me and watched every bit of stone i took up seemed to entertain a bad opinion of the english considering them as heretics deserving of damnation and gave me to understand that the english had a queen anne boleyn who was wife to a christian king that she made a heretic of him and was in consequence condemned to burn for ever in mount aetna i asked them if her husband was there too for he deserved it much better than she sicuro said they are safe enough and all his heretic subjects and if you are of that number you need not be in such a hurry to get there you will be sure of it at last  on leaving nicolesi and in an hour and a half traveling over barren ashes and lava we arrived on the confines of the woody region or temperate zone as soon as we entered these delightful forests we seemed got into another world the air which was before sultry and hot was now cool and refreshing and every breeze was loaded with a thousand perfumes the whole ground being covered with the richest aromatic plants many parts of this region are surely the most heavenly spots upon earth and if aetna resembles hell it may with equal justice be said to resemble paradise without  it is indeed a curious consideration that this mountain should reunite every beauty and every horror but our astonishment increases in casting our eyes on its higher regions there we behold in perpetual union the two elements that are at continual war an immense gulf of fire for ever existing in the midst of snows which it has not power to melt and immense fields of snow and ice for ever surrounding this gulf of fire which they have not power to extinguish  the woody region ascends for about eight or nine miles forming a girdle of the brightest green all round the mountain brydone and his company in the course of one night got about half through and reached before sunset a large cave where they lodged it was surrounded with stately and majestic oaks they kindled a fire and made comfortable beds of the dried leaves the thermometer which was at    at nicolesi now fell below  0 the barometer stood at       not a great way from this cavern are two of the most beautiful mountains that spring from aetna i mounted a mule and rode to the top of one of them a little before sunset the prospect of sicily with the surrounding sea and its islands was wonderfully noble  the next day we scrambled on foot seven miles over the barren regions or frigid zone till we reached a little before break of day the ruins of an ancient structure called the philosophers tower supposed to have been built by the philosopher empedocles who took up his habitation here the better to study the nature of the mountain the mercury here fell to  0   we had now time says brydone to pay our adorations in silent contemplation of the sublime objects of nature the sky was clear and the immense vault of the heavens appeared in awful majesty and splendour we found ourselves more struck with veneration than below the number of stars seeming to be infinitely increased and the light of each appeared brighter than usual the whiteness of the milky way was like a pure flame that shot across the heavens and with the naked eye we could discern clusters of stars invisible in the regions below we were amazed at the distinctness of vision not recollecting that we had now passed through ten or twelve thousand feet of gross vapor that blunts and confuses every ray before it reaches the surface of the earth we took notice of several of these meteors called falling stars which seemed as much above as they do when standing on the earth below  in about an hours climbing we reached a place where there was no snow and where a warm and comfortable vapor issued from the mountain which induced us to halt the mercury here was at      the thermometer three degrees below the freezing point and before we left the summit of aetna it fell two degrees more to    from that spot it was only about three hundred yards to the highest summit where we arrived in full time to see the most wonderful and most sublime sight in nature  description must ever fall short for no imagination has dared to form an idea of so glorious and so magnificent a scene nor is there on the surface of the globe any one point that unites so many awful and sublime objects  the immense elevation from the surface of the earth drawn as it were to a single point without any neighboring mountain for the senses and imagination to rest on and recover from their astonishment in their way down to the world this point or pinnacle raised on the point of a bottomless gulf as old as the world often discharging rivers of fire and throwing out burning rocks with a noise that shakes the whole island add to this the unbounded extent of the prospect comprehending the greatest diversity and most beautiful scenery in nature with the rising sun advancing in the east to illumine the wondrous scene  the whole atmosphere by degrees kindle up and show dimly and faintly the boundless prospect round both sea and land look dark and confused as if only emerging from their original chaos and light and darkness seem still undivided till the morning advancing by degrees completes the separation the stars are extinguished and the shades disappear the forests which till now seemed black and bottomless gulphs from whence no ray was reflected to show their form or colors appear a new creation rising to the sight catching life and beauty from every increasing beam the scene still enlarges and the horizon widens and expands around till the sun like the creator appears in the east and with his plastic ray completes the mighty scene  all appears enchantment and it is with difficulty we can believe that we are still on earth the senses unaccustomed to the sublimity of such a scene are bewildered and confounded and it is not till after some time they are capable of separating and judging of the objects that compose it the body of the sun is seen rising from the ocean immense tracks both of sea and land intervening the islands of lipari panari alicudi strombolo and volcano with their smoking summits appear under your feet and you look down on the whole of sicily as on a map and can trace every river through all its windings from its source to its mouth the view is absolutely boundless on every side nor is there one object within the circle of vision to interrupt it so that the sight is every where best in the immensity and i am persuaded continues brydone it is only from the imperfection of our organs that the coasts of africa are not discovered as they are certainly above the horizon could the eye see so far the distance of two thousand miles would be discoverable from the top of aetna at malta which is near two hundred miles they perceived the irruptions from the second region of aetna and that island is often discovered when we are halfway up the mountain massa a sicilian writer says that the african coast as well as that of naples with many of its islands have been seen from the top of aetna  the circumference of the great circle of aetna that is of the woody part that surrounds it is not less than seventy or eighty miles and the circumference of the mountain at bottom according to recupero is an hundred and eightythree miles  the present crater at the top of this immense volcano is a circle of about three miles and a half it goes shelving down on each side and forms a regular hollow like a vast amphitheatre from many places of this space issue volumes of sulphurous smoke and immediately on clearing the crater rolls down the mountain side like a torrent till reaching that part of the atmosphere of equal gravity with itself it shoots off horizontally and forms a large track in the air according to the direction of the wind we did not attempt to go down into the crater in the center of which is the great mouth of the volcano we looked down and beheld it with awe and horror and were not surprised it had been considered as the place of the damned when we reflect on the immensity of its depth the vast cells and caverns whence so many lava have issued the force of its internal fire to carry up these lavas so high into the air with all the dreadful accompaniments the boiling of the matter the shaking of the mountain the explosions of the flaming rocks etc we must allow that the most enthusiastic imagination in the midst of all its terrors hardly ever formed an idea of a hell more dreadful  empedocles was a native of agrigentum and is supposed to have died four hundred years before the christian era perhaps his vanity more than his philosophy led him to have erected the philosophers tower nay it is said to have carried him still farther that he might be considered as a god and that the people might suppose he was taken up to heaven he is recorded to have thrown himself headlong into the great gulf of mount aetna never supposing his death could be discovered to mankind but the treacherous mountain threw out his slippers which were of brass and announced to the world the fate of this philosopher  we left the summit of the mountain at six in the morning and it was eight at night before we reached catania on first entering the forests the trees were still as bare as in december but after we had descended a few miles we found ourselves in the mildest and sofest of climates the trees in full verdure and the fields covered with all the flowers of summer but as soon as we got out of the woods and entered the torrid zone below them we found the heat insupportable and suffered dreadfully before we reached the city  the productions of the island are numberless some of which i shall mention by and by but aetna alone affords a greater variety than many of the most extensive kingdoms and is not less an epitome of the whole earth in its soil and climate than in the variety of its productions besides the corn the wine the oil the silk the spice the delicious fruits of its lower region the beautiful forests the flocks the game the tar the cork the honey of its second the snow and ice of its third it affords from its caverns a variety of minerals as cinnabar mercury sulphur alum nitre and vitriol so that this wonderful mountain produces every necessary and every luxury of life  we are not then to be surprised at the obstinate attachment of the people to this mountain and that all its terrors have not been able to drive them away from him for though he sometimes chastises he mixes such blessings with his chastisements that their affections can never be estranged for at the same time that he threatens with a rod of iron he pours down upon them all the blessings of the ape of gold  swinburne describes the remarkable large chesnuttree in the first region of aetna called from its astonishing size castagno di cento cavalli as supposing it capable of sheltering a hundred horse under the canopy of its boughs it stands single on a gentle rising the ground round it an open pasture its height has been diminished by cutting the tops of its branches to increase its bearing it appears to be a group of trees but is in fact an old trunk split down to the surface of the earth but united in one body at a very small depth below its circumference one inch from the ground is one hundred and ninetysix english feet from this trunk rise five divisions each of which sends forth enormous branches the outer surface of these divisions or stems are covered with bark the inner surface has no bark and they all turn toward a common center a proof that all these stems were once united between two of the stems two coaches may drive abreast and in the center of the five is built a hut where the fruit of the tree is deposited it is a wonderful production of the vegetable kingdom  chap iv of the cities and their inhabitants particularly of messina sicily consists of three provinces which are called valleys and has two principal cities palermo and messina syracuse was anciently the capital and a very flourishing republic but is at present extremely reduced by a series of calamities especially by the earthquake in      it is an archbishopric has a harbor and some fortifications it was taken by the spaniards in      palermo is now the capital though messina claims to be the capital also  messina being the first city we approach in our way from calabria we will speak of messina first this city is reckoned about twelve miles from reggio on the coast of calabria the harbor is one of the most beautiful ever formed by nature on the northside runs westward a semicircular tongue or slip of land on which stands the lighthouse and some salt ponds on the opposite side of the harbor stands the city upon rising ground on a semicircular shore forming together a circular harbor and something like a horseshoe open to the sea at the west but commanded by four forts and at the upper end of the harbor in the center stands the governors house and a pentagon fortress called the citadel behind the city rise immediately a number of lofty mountains well secured and aetna as a pinnacle above the whole  from the palace now the governors house at the foot of these mountains ran one of the broadest cleanest and finest quays in europe ornamented with statues and fountains more than a mile in length with a beautiful range of regular lofty houses with nineteen gates answering to as many streets it followed the semicircular bend of the port quite to the sea hiding the lower houses of the city and showing only the more beautiful that stand on the rise of the hill above it i say ran for this beautiful pile of buildings was thrown down in the earthquake of      but is to be rebuilt the anchorage is beyond the reach of a cannonshot from the sea and there is two hundred fathom water the harbor in short is so deep close to the quay that vessels of the greatest tonnage can unload upon it and the harbor is large enough to contain all the ships of europe messina has been declared a free port since       the inner part of messina is dirty says swinburne though it contains a great number of churches and large substantial dwellings de non says there are handsome streets beautiful squares elegant marble fountains equestrian and pedestrian statues of bronze large and handsome churches vast convents and well built hotels he was there in      swinburne about the same time the population says de non formerly corresponded with the appearance of the city but the plague of      or      reduced it from one hundred thousand souls to thirty thousand messina could never recover this loss and of course the remote parts of the city are deserted the cathedral is gothic and enriched with saracenic mosaics on the altars and shrines in the treasury of the church is preserved the palladium of messina this is a letter from the virgin mary to its citizens in latin the purport of which is an acknowledgment from her that her son is the son of god in his nature both god and man and that after his resurrection he ascended into heaven and that paul was an apostle chosen to preach the way of truth dated in the year of christ fortytwo the story is as follows after st paul had made some stay at messina the messinese prevailed on him to return to jerusalem with an embassy of four persons sent by the city to the virgin mary their excellencies says swinburne were graciously received by her and brought back a letter written by her own hand in the hebrew tongue which st paul translated into greek by the irruption of the saracens this invaluable treasure was lost and utterly forgotten till the year      when constantine lascaris a refugee greek found a copy of it and turning it into latin made it known to the citizens and then to all the catholic world and its authenticity is so well established at messina that whoever confesses a doubt on the subject is considered as an infidel  in the dates to this curious letter says swinburne for there are more than one there are some astronomical blunders and lascaris having annexed the date anno christi    was not aware that denis the little a syrian monk in the sixth century was the first that made use of the era that commences at our saviors birth  this favored letter is that on which the messinese built their pretensions to preeminence over the whole world to its virtues and patronage they attribute every piece of good fortune and to their own unworthiness all sinister events that have befallen them  brydone says the number of galleys and galliots in this harbor adds greatly to its beauty they are commissioned to cruize round the island in order to protect it from the sudden invasions of the barbarians who are often very troublesome on the south coast these vessels when sailing out of the harbor make a very picturesque appearance their oars rowing all together and with the greatest regularity there are nine or ten men to each oar rowing seems the hardest work imaginable for they all rise at every stroke of the oar and when they pull they almost throw themselves on their backs and seem to exert their utmost force these galleyslaves are chained to their oars and sleep every night on the bare benches without any thing to throw over them  on the  0th of may is celebrated a great festival here in honor of st francis the saint is carried in procession with vast ceremony to the top of a hill without the city and receives there the homage of the people with becoming dignity after this he is lodged again in his chapel and the people dance and make merry till sunset the assemblyroom was one fine green plain on the top of this hill and a range of two thousand small cannon were fired so quick after each other by a train of running fire that the ear could not separate the reports their echo among the mountains prolonged the sound and had a fine effect  the view from the top of this is beautiful beyond description the streights between sicily and italy appear like a vast majestic river flowing slowly betwixt two ridges of mountains its banks adorned with rich cornfieldsd vineyards orchards towns villages and churches and the prospect terminated on each side by the tops of high mountains covered with wood  the larkspur venus lookglass hawksweed and very fine lupins grow wild over all the mountains round messina also a variety of flowering shrubs all the fields are covered with the richest white clover intermixed with a variety of aromatic plants which perfume the air and render their walks delightful there are many fine shady walks on all sides of messina the houses are large and most of the articles of life cheap and in plenty particularly fish which is reckoned better here than any where else in the mediterranean hire of lodging is next to nothing almost half that noble range of buildings on the quay was absolutely uninhabited even before the last earthquake so that the owners are glad to get tenants on any terms of course all things considered brydone is of opinion it is a place admirably calculated for valetudinarians who search a warm climate even their winterseason is preferable to that of naples and it has many advantages over naples they have indeed heavy rains sometimes for two or three weeks but they never last longer for even in these there are some fair hours every day and the soil being a light gravel the rain is no sooner over than the walks are dry  chap v of palermo and its environs palermo is the capital of sicily and the residence of the viceroy well fortified with a harbor the entrance to which is defended by two strong citidels it carries on a brisk trade and is said to contain upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants it is an archbishopric united with monte reale has a university fiftytwo convents twentytwo nunneries and is the usual abode of many princes and others of the chief nobility the city is divided into four divisions in the first is the royal palace where the viceroy resides and the parliament holds its meetings and a large hospital in the second the cathedral called in italy la matrice in the third the town house a handsome edifice and in the fourth a dominican church and several other fine buildings this city suffered much in the earthquakes of      and       the more we see of palermo says de non and the more minutely it is examined the more we shall be sensible of its beauty handsome streets large and beautiful squares public fountains and private ones even on the fourth story of every house superb churches and delightful walks a good air a vast population with a cleanliness not to be found in any other city of the kingdom a tolerable extensive commerce though not a twelfth part of what it might be a great number of houses at once rich noble and triumphant a warm climate lively passions pleasing women and the luxury of the sybaerites are all found there  palermo the capital of sicily washed by the tyrrhenian sea says bisani is situated at the foot of a chain of mountains which forms a kind of amphitheatre and supplies it with plenty of clear pure and healthy water though apparently a small city viewed from without it is a large fine place six miles in circumference two large streets more than a mile long cross each other in right angles and divide it into four parts corresponding to four principal gates these streets are well paved and have a broad pavement for foot passengers fine buildings and well lighted at night the central place where the great streets cross each other forming a fine octagon is called piazza villena each side of which exhibits a reunion of the three orders of architecture doric ionic and corinthian three statues and a fountain there is not such a coup doeil in any other city in europe the lesser streets run parallel to these great ones  the places the statues the obelisks the fountains are not the most remarkable objects here besides the fountain de preteur which for the beauty of its marble its design the great number of animals monsters and statues of which it is composed its circumference of five hundred and fifteen feet and the disposition of its balustrades is allowed by connoisseurs as a chef doeuvre of art the churches are enriched with fine marbles and alabaster peculiar to this island porphyry precious stones and a profusion of gold and silver vessels some of them boast of excellent architecture and in many are pictures of the best italian masters as the climate inspires indolence and devotion here are no less than eighty convents of monks and nuns which are very humane and charitable here are about seven hospitals and a general asylum for the poor  one of the city gates opens to the marino a delightful walk which constitutes one of the great pleasures of the nobility of palermo it is bounded on one side by the citywall and on the other by the sea from whence there is always an agreeable breeze in the center of the marino they have erected a kind of temple as an orchestra for music and in the summer seasons they are obliged to convert the night into day the concert does not begin till midnight at that time the walk is crowded with carriages and people on foot and the better to favor pleasure and intrigue there is an order that no person shall carry a light with him the flambeaux are put out at the citygate where the servants wait for the return of the carriages and the company generally continue an hour or two in utter darkness except when the intruding moon says brydone with her horns and her chastity comes to disturb them the concert ends about two in the morning when for the most part every husband goes home to his own wife this is an admirable institution and never produces any scandal no husband is such a brute as to deny his wife the marino and the ladies are so cautious and circumspect on their side that the more to avoid giving offense they very often put on masks  in this hallowed walk says de non the most mysterious obscurity and most rigorously respected reigns the whole company is intermingled without distinction they seek for and find each other supper parties are formed and carried snugly into execution and upon the spot at taverns built along the walls of the rampart  thus do the inhabitants of palermo vary the order of nature and preserve themselves from feeling and almost from recollecting the heat of their climate they rise says de non at noon when the seabreeze which springs up at ten has tempered the heat they then repair either for business or pleasure to the cassaro a large and superb street which crosses the whole city from north to south the prodigious population of palermo which is about   0000 persons is as great in proportion as that of naples and is here particularly discovered the number of carriages is truly astonishing for these are so much in fashion at palermo that a coach is become a matter of absolute necessity there are no hackneycoaches those let out for hire as well as those of the nobility are antique inconvenient vehicles drawn by mules in summer their carriages are more elegant  the nobility parade in the cassaro till three in the afternoon they then dine thence they go to the marino where a band of music awaits them two hours before night from hence they pass to the conversaziones or the opera which is the only public entertainment beginning an hour before night and ending as do the conversaziones at midnight or one in the morning when they return to the marino the constantly recurring amusement of the palermian day this diurnal round of pleasure is interrupted only by the carnival which changes the order of enjoyments only to render them more lively by the two seasons for the country which are may and october and by the festival of saint rosalia which exhibits the most splendid and most agreeable enthusiasm of devotion and which i shall speak of in its course  there are a variety of conversaziones every night there is one general one supported by the subscription of the nobility open every evening at sun set and continuing till midnight when the marino begins at these meetings the company merely converse few play at cards and these not long at this assembly there are a number of apartments lighted with waxlights and kept exceeding cool and agreeable the private conversaziones are always held says brydone in the apartments of lyingin ladies from this happy climate childbearing is divested of all its terror and is only considered as a party of pleasure brydone went to one of these that of princess palerno the evening she was brought to bed the princess sat up in her bed in an elegant undress with a number of her friends about her she talked as usual and seemed perfectly well the conversation is repeated every night during her convalescence which generally lastseleven or twelve days this custom is universal and as the ladies here are very prolific three or four of these meetings occur every night possibly the marino may not a little contribute toward them  mr brydone spoke so free of the ladies of fashion at palermo and his tour to sicily being translated into french and spreading to palermo the nobility have determined never to pay any attention to letters of recommendation in favor of the english nor receive them on their travels in consequence of this swinburne who followed brydone says he could not obtain access into any family  the sicilian ladies says brydone marry at thirteen or fourteen and are sometimes grandmothers before thirty i was presented by count stetela to the princess partana who had twelze children the eldest of whom was a fine girl of fifteen i talked to the princess continues he for half an hour and concluded i was speaking to her daughter and when the young lady entered it was not easy to say which was youngest or which was handsomest the princess assured me she never enjoyed more perfect health than when in childbed that during her pregnancy she was often indisposed but that immediately on delivery she was cured of all complaints and was capable of enjoying the company of her friends even more than at any other time when i told her that the english ladies often died in childbed and that the most easy deliveries were attended with violent pain and anguish she lamented their fate and thanked heaven she was born a sicilian  their ease in childbirth is owing to the climate which relaxes the frame among the cold alps half their women die in labor and those who can afford it often go dawn to the low countries some weeks before they liein and find their deliveries much easier  swinburne went out to sea purposely to view palermo from it and says its extensive bay is confined by a circle of mountains of various elevations and forms and the steeples cupolas and towers of the city rise on the plain that extends from their foot and line the shore  palermo is walled round almost in a circular form and the principal streets are so decorated with statues fountains and buildings as to present the idea of a royal city most of the other streets are narrow and crooked and being wretchedly paved are buried in dirt during the winter the city is well lighted with reverberating lamps and in wet weather moveable wooden bridges are provided for crossing the kennels which then become rapid torrents  the cathedral was built in      and is in a very ruinous condition it is a gothic edifice but heavy and void of all the chaste proportions of the grecian art it contains several tombs of sovereigns and at the foot of the altar rests the heroic earl roger conqueror of sicily and terror of infidels  most of the churches are rich in silver gems and marble but their architecture and embellishments horrid in several the walls within are lined with red or yellow marble upon which from the cieling to the floor are glued basso relievo figures of angels busts and flowers in white marble  the palace which stands near the small gate is an immense mass of discordant parts built at different periods the halls are of noble size the courts of justice are held on a ground floor and batteries of cannon defend the approach  the assemblies at the viceroys palaces says swinburne gave me an opportunity of seeing the whole corpse of nobility collected together the men are rather a comely race but the ladies are little favored by nature two girls under eight years of age heiresses of great families and already betrothed made their appearance in the ballroom decked out in the very excess of the mode their showy dresses their diminutive size and affected gravity in dancing a minuet joined to the fatherly care their future husbands anxiously took of them reminded me of dolls made to move round a table by clockwork  in the streets women hide their heads in black veils a very ancient mode of dress in this island and very lately introduced at naples and there become fashionable  the viceroy like the viceroy of ireland affects in every thing the pageantry of royalty his train of coaches are as splendid a strong welldressed body of guards attends his person and on parade days his coachmen postillions and liveryservants are dressed in flowing wigs without hats when he goes to church he receives the tribute of a cloud of incense and he alone with great solemnity puts on his hat on the   st of december he makes an annual visit to the jails where he pardons as many prisoners as he pleases all law is that day dormant and although the magistrates have a right to remonstrate he is under no obligation to follow their advice but the viceroys are very cautious not to abuse this privilege if they pardon it is on a report from the judges  the sicilians says brydone appear frank and sincere and their politeness does not consist in show and grimace like some of the polite nations of the continent the viceroy sets the pattern of hospitality and he is followed by the rest of the nobles notwithstanding his great authority he is affable and familiar and makes his house agreeable to every body his table is served with elegance and magnificence much superior to that of his sicilian majesty who eats off a service of plate at least three hundred years old very black and rusty as if it had been dug out of herculaneum  sicilian cookery is a mixture of french and spanish the olio still preserves its rank and dignity in the center of the table surrounded by a numerous train of fricasees fricandeaus ragouts and pet de loups like a grave spanish don amid a number of little smart marquisses all the nobility are magnificent in their entertainments particularly in their deserts and ices of which there is a greater variety than in most countries they are very temperate in their wines but having learnt from the english the method of hobanobbing and toasting ladies they are more free in drinking than they used to be and say the english have made them drunkards in their ordinary living they are very frugal and temperate  brydone dined with the bishop of agrigentum the richest bishop in the kingdom thirty were at table and there were not less than a hundred dishes dressed with the richest and most delicate sauces by a modern refinement in luxury they contrive to make the livers of their fowls grow to a large size and acquire a rich and high flavor it is a cruel mode which occasions lingering death to the poor animal and it is therefore best not to mention it in their deserts besides a variety of fruit they introduce a profusion of ices in the shape of peaches figs oranges nuts etc the company were chiefly priests but were very fond of punch which they persuaded mr brydone and his friend to make called it pontio and spoke loudly in its praise declaring pontio alluding to pontius pilate was a much better fellow than they had ever taken him for one of the canons growing sick with drinking too much of it and vomiting exclaimed shaking his head and groaning ah signior capitano sapeva sempre che pontio era un grande traditore i always knew that pontius was a great traitor their conversation ran on the pleasures of the world they said they were a happy fraternity had long exploded every thing that is dismal and melancholy and were convinced a cheerful life on earth was the best preparation for happiness hereafter that abstinence from lawful pleasures was a sin  for god is paid when man receives to enjoy is to obey the sicilians continues brydone have always had the character of being very amorous and surely not without reason the whole nation are poets even the peasants and a man stands a poor chance of a mistress that cannot celebrate her muses gallantry here is much on the same footing as in italy the establishment of cicisbeos is also pretty general though not quite so universal as on the continent a breach however of the married vow is not looked upon as a deadly sin husbands are content and like able generals make up for the loss of one fortress by taking another female licentiousness however has by no means come to such a height as in italy we saw a great deal of domestic happiness husbands and wives that truly love one another sights that are very rare on the continent indeed the style that young ladies are brought up in here seems to lay a more solid foundation for matrimonial happiness than either in france or italy the young ladies are not shut up in convents till the day of their marriage but live with their parents and visit with them being allowed as much liberty as with us in their great assemblies we often see a number of young people of both sexes get together in a corner and amuse themselves for hours at crosspurposes or such like games without the mother being at all uneasy in general they are quick and lively and have a number of those jeux desprit which is a proof in all countries of a familiar intercourse of the sexes for all these games are insipid if they are not seasoned by something of that invisible and subtle agency which renders every thing more interesting in these mixed societies than in the lifeless one composed of only one sex  in the gardens about palermo there are a profusion of fine flowers swinburne was here in december and says the borders were full of roses and other flowers in bloom and very highly scented and violets and carnations had been in flower since october many fruit trees here bear two crops they produce a fruit at the usual season then bud again and bear fruit a second time near the middle of september though the second fruit is not so large and fine flavoured as the first the mannatree yields annually about a pound of manna worth four hundred tari and a half the tari equal to the carline of naples these trees never arrive at a great size owing to their annual bleedings but will yield manna for a hundred years the sugarcane on the eastern coast of valdinote grows to a fine size and is very juicy thrives almost without care has heat and mixture enough and neither hurricanes nor insects to destroy them but hands are scarce and labor dear and of course not much is done in it  there are two small countries one to the east the other to the west of palermo where the principal nobility have their county palaces i shall only speak of one which for all its singularity is certainly not to be parallelled on the face of the earth it belongs to the prince of patagonia a man of immense fortune who has devoted his whole life to the study of monsters and chimaeras greater and more ridiculous than ever entered into the imagination of the wildest writers of romance or knighterrantry  the amazing crowd of statues that surround his house appear at a distance like a little army drawn up for its defense but when you get among them says brydone you imagine you have got into the regions of delusion and enchantment for of all that immense group there is not one made to represent any object in nature nor is the absurdity of the wretched imagination that created them less astonishing than its wonderful fertility he has put the heads of men to the bodies of every sort of animal and the heads of every other animal to the bodies of men sometimes he makes a compound of five or six animals that have no resemblance in nature he puts the head of a lion to the neck of a goose the body of a lizard the legs of a goat and the tail of a fox on the back of this monster he puts another if possible still more hideous with five or six heads and a bush of horns that beat the beast in the revelations all to nothing there is not a horn in the world that he has not collected and his pleasure is to see them flourishing on the same head this is a strange piece of madness and is truly unaccountable that he has not been shut up many years ago but he is perfectly innocent and troubles no one by the indulgence of his phrenzy i have conversed with him continues brydone and heard him talk speciously enough on all occasions and he gives bread to a number of statuaries and workmen whom he rewards in proportion as they can bring their imaginations to coincide with his own  to this extraordinary place says swinburne the traveller is admitted through a large gate on the plinth of which are fixed six colossal whitewashed statues of hussars or halberdiers to dispute the entrance of an avenue three hundred yards long not of cypresses elms or orange trees but of monsters to the number of six hundred on each side of this avenue is a parapetwall loaded with more horrible figures than were ever raised by armida and all the enchantment of ariosto busts of punchinellos and harlequins with snakes twisted round them heads of dwarfs with huge perriwigs of asses and horses with laced cravats and ruffs compose the lower range of this gallery and at intervals of an hundred yards are clustered pillars supporting curious groups of figures some are musicians others pigmies operaheroes old women grinning lions and other beasts seated at tables with napkins under their chins eating oysters princesses with feathers and furbelows ostriches in hoops and cats in boots  the old ornaments in the court that surrounds the palace that were put up by his father who was a man of taste and sense have been all knocked to pieces to make room for this new creation these monsters and animals line the battlements of the mansion and stand so thick and in such menacing attitudes as it would not be safe to approach in a windy day they are all carved out of very soft stone that crumbles away and will not last long the walls are cased with bassorelievos masks medallions scriptural subjects heathen gods emperors and posturemasters some in a good style copied from the antique but the greatest part consists of such figures as we meet with in dutch fairs representing the seasons and elements  the inside of this enchanted castle says brydone corresponds exactly with the out it is in every respect as whimsical and fantastical and you cannot turn yourself to any side where you are not stared in the face by some hideous figure or other some of the apartments are spacious and magnificent with high arched roofs which instead of plaster or stucco are composed entirely of large mirrors nicely joined together the effect that these produce as each of them make a small angle with the other is exactly a multiplyingglass so that when three or four people are walking below there is always the appearance of three or four hundred walking above the whole of the doors are likewise covered over with small pieces of lookingglass cut into the most ridiculous shapes and intermixed with a great variety of crystal and glass of different colors all the chimneypieces windows and sideboards are crowded with pyramids and pillars of teapots candle cups bowls cups saucers etc strongly cemented together some of these columns are not without their beauty one of them has a large china chamberpot for its base and a circle of pretty little flowerpots for its capital the shaft of the column upwards of four feet long is composed entirely of teapots of different sizes diminishing gradually from the base to the capital the profusion of choice that has been employed in forming these columns is incredible there are not less than forty of them  most of the rooms are paved with fine marble tiles of different colors that look like so many tombstones some of these very richly wrought with lapis lazuli porphyry and other valuable stones the windows are composed of a variety of glass of every color mixed without order or regularity the houseclock is cased in the body a statue the eyes of the figure moves with the pendulum turning up their white and black alternately and make a hideous appearance  his bedchamber and dressing room are like two apartments of noahs ark there is scarce a beast however vile that he has not placed there birds pigs serpents lizards scorpions all cut in marble in their respective colors there are a good many busts too not less singularly imagined some of these make a very handsome profile on one side turn to the other and you have a skeleton here you see a nurse with a child in her arms its back is exactly that of an infant its face that of a wrinkled old woman of ninety  for some minutes we can laugh at these follies says brydone but indignation and contempt soon get the better of your mirth and the laugh is turned into a sneer  the familystatues are charming they have been done from some old pictures and make a most venerable appearance but this man has dressed them out from head to foot in new and elegant suits of marble and the effect it produces is more ridiculous than any thing that can be conceived their shoes are made of black marble their stockings are chiefly of red their clothes of different colors blue green and variegated with a rich lace of giallantique the wigs of men and headdresses of the ladies are of white marble so are their shirts with long flowing ruffles of alabaster  these fooleries says de non must create in us a contempt for the owner who is otherwise a very amiable man fortunately the confusion of the objects effaces them from the mind as soon as they are seen and leaves only an indistinct idea of this collection apparently formed without motive and as difficult to describe as disagreeable to behold  the prince of p author of this collection is a poor miserable lean figure shivering at a breeze and seems to be afraid of every body he speaks to he is one of the richest subjects in the island and it is thought has not laid out less than twenty thousand pounds  swinburne says forty thousand pounds in the creation of this world of monsters and chimaeras however as we have observed it gives bread to a number of poor people to whom he is an excellent master his house at palermo is a good deal in the same style his carriages are covered with plates of brass and some of them musketproof  government have had serious thoughts of demolishing the regiment of monsters he has placed round his house but as he is humane and inoffensive and as this would certainly break his heart they have yet forborne seeing of them it is said by women with child has been already attended with very unfortunate circumstances several living monsters have been brought forth in the neighborhood the ladies says brydone complain that they dare not take an airing that way that some hideous form always haunts their imagination for some time after their husbands too are as little satisfied with the great variety of horns  in the midst of this extravagance of the prince says swinburne his family has often wanted clothes and victuals having run himself out his relations have taken upon them the administration of his estate and he has left the place since he has been debarred the pleasure of raising devils he has attached himself to saints and spends his time in following processions and visiting churches on being asked what part of the globe the originals of the figures upon his walls are to be met with he replied in egypt where diodorus siculus says the rays of the sun act so powerfully on the fat slime left by the nile that it engenders all sorts of uncouth and otherwise unknown animals  chap vi of the festival of rosolia at palermo one of the most magnificent and brilliant spectacles in the world is the festival held annually at palermo on the twelfth of july and the four following days in memory and honor of saint rosolia the patroness of the city  rosolia or rosolia for she is thus differently called as report goes was the daughter of a count sinibaldus and in the twelfth century to save her virginity from the brutality of the saracens she retired to a cave in mount quisquina and afterward came to live in mount pellegrino a mountain quite detached from others about a mile from the gates of palermo it is a tall rock without a tree or a shrub except near the top here was her grotto and here she died and remained unknown till in the year      during the time of a dreadful plague a holy man had a vision that the saints bones were lying in a cave near the top of this mountain that if they were taken up with due reverence and carried in procession thrice round the walls of the city the plague would cease he was listened to by the vulgar they rose and supported his cause and the magistrates to appease them sent to monte pellegrino when io the mighty discovery was made the sacred bones were found the city was freed from the plague rosalia became the greatest saint in the calendar churches were reared altars were dedicated and monasteries appointed to this new divinity whose dignity and consequence have ever since been supported at an incredible expense  there is a zigzag road up the side of this mountain in length about an hours walk made at the expense of the state the senate levying a tax upon meat for the purpose a convent and portico close up the entrance of a spacious avern a rich altar covers the marble effigy of the saint represented lying at full length it is covered with a silver vest the gift of the king of spain  people of education are very grave here and despise the wild superstition of the vulgar yet they go to mass regularly and attend the ordinances with great respect and decency and are pleased with us for conforming to their customs and for not appearing openly to despise their rites and ceremonies this attention of theirs not to offend weak minds shows a good heart and understanding they boast not of their infidelity neither do they pester you with it as in france and where although they pretend to be lawless they do in fact believe more than any nation on the continent  a man can have no good principles who makes a parade of his contempt for things held sacred it is an open insult to the judgment of the public an englishman says brydone a few years ago offended egregiously in this respect and the people of palermo still speak of him with contempt and detestation it happened one day in the great church during the elevation of the host when every one else were on their knees that this man was standing without any appearance of respect to the ceremony a young nobleman near him expressed his surprise at it it is strange sir said he that you who have had the education of a gentleman and ought to have the sentiments of one should choose thus to give so very public offense why it is said the englishman i dont believe in transubstantiation  neither do i sir replied the other and yet you see i kneel  mr brydone was present at the festival of st rosalio and gives us the following full and entertaining account of it  the corso is one of the great streets that crosses the city it is a mile long and extends to the maund or public walk which continues its length another mile along the seaside the surface of the street is concave and of course we can see easily from end to end some time before the festival great preparations are made for illuminating this street the marino and the other great street that crosses the corso this is done by the erection of pyramids and arches they are erected on each side the streets betwixt the front path and the pavement and run in two right lines exactly parallel from one end to the other the four gates at the end of these cross streets are also illuminated so that from the square in the center of the city the whole of this illumination can be seen at once the number of pyramids and arches exceed two thousand two great theaters are also erected for fireworks one fronting the viceroys palace and almost equal to it in size and the other on piles driven into the sea exactly opposite to the great orchestra in the center of the marino  the cathedral too is illuminated both roof and walls and within they are entirely covered over on this occasion with lookingglass intermixed with gold and silver paper and an infinite variety of artificial flowers all arranged with great taste and judgment every altar chapel and column is decorated in the same manner the roof is hung with innumerable lustres filled with candles the saints are dressed out in all their glory and the fairy queen herself was never finer than st rosalio  on the evening of the twelfth of july at five oclock the festival begins a triumphal car is drawn from the middle of the marino through the center of the city to its furthest gate preceded by a troop of horse with trumpets and kettledrums and all the cityofficers in their gala uniforms the car is an enormous machine on wheels seventy feet long thirty wide and more than eighty high and as it passed along overtopped the loftiest houses of palermo the form of its under part is like that of the roman galleys but smaller as it advances in height the front assumes an oval shape like an amphitheatre with seats placed in the style of a theater this is the great orchestra filled with a numerous band of musicians in rows one above another over this orchestra and a little behind it there is a large dome supported by six large corinthian columns and adorned with a number of figures of saints and angels and on the summit of the dome a gigantic silver statue of festival of rosalia st rosalio the whole machine is dressed out with orange trees flowerpots and trees of artificial coral the car stopped every fifty or sixty yards when the orchestra performed a piece of music with songs in honor of the saint it appeared a moving castle and completely filled the great street from side to side this vast fabric was drawn by fiftysix huge mules two abreast curiously caparisoned and mounted by twentyeight postilions dressed in gold and silver stuffs with great plumes of ostrich feathers in their hats every window and balcony both sides of the street were full of well dressed people and the car was followed by many thousands of the lower sort the triumph was finished in about three hours and was succeeded by the beautiful illumination of the marino  see the plate  from end to end of the marino pyramids and arches were erected as in the great street and so entirely were they covered with lamps that at a little distance they seemed pyramids and arches of flame the whole chain of this illumination was about a mile in length and nothing can be conceived more splendid no break or imperfection any where nor a single lamp extinguished so still was the night  opposite to the center of this great line of light was a magnificent pavilion erected for the viceroy and his company which consisted of the whole nobility of palermo and at the entrance of this at some little distance in the sea stood the great fireworks representing the front of a palace adorned with columns arches trophies and every ornament of architecture all the xebecs galleys galliots and other shipping were ranged round this palace and formed a kind of amphitheatre in the sea enclosing it in the center these began the show by a discharge of their artillery the sound of which reechoed from the mountains and in a still night produced a very noble effect a variety of waterrockets and bombs of a curious construction were next played off that often burst below water this continued for half an hour when in an instant the whole of the palace was beautifully illuminated this was the signal for the shipping to cease and appeared indeed like a piece of enchantment being done instantaneously altogether and without the appearance of any agent at the same time the fountains that were represented in the court before the palace began to spout out fire resembling the great jet deaus of versailles and marly as soon as these were extinguished the court of this palace took on the form of a great parterre embellished with a variety of palm trees of fire interspersed with orange trees flowerpots vases and other ornaments and the front of it broke out into a variety of suns stars and wheels of fire which in a short time reduced the whole erection to a perfect ruin all now seemed over when unexpectedly there burst from the center of the pile a vast explosion of two thousand rockets bombs serpents squibs and devils which seemed to fill the whole atmosphere during this exhibition coffee ices sweetmeats and a variety of excellent wines were handed round in the pavilion in the center of the marino this was at the expense of the duke of castellano the praetor or mayor of the city the principal nobility give these entertainments by turns every night during the festival and vie with each other in magnificence  the firework being finished the viceroy went out to sea in a galley richly illuminated brydone continued on shore to see the effect it was rowed by seventytwo oars and he says made one of the most beautiful objects imaginable flying with vast velocity over the waters then as smooth and as clear as glass which shone round it like a flame and reflected its splendour on all sides the oars beat time to the frenchhorns clarinets and trumpets of which there was a numerous band in the prow  the days entertainment was concluded by the corso which began exactly at midnight and lasted two hours this great street was illuminated in the same manner as the marino the arches and pyramids were erected at little distances from each other on both sides betwixt the footpath and the space for carriages and when seen from either of the city gates at the end of the street appeared to be two continued lines of the brightest flame indeed says brydone these illuminations are so very different and so much superior to any i ever saw that i find it difficult to give an idea of them two lines of coaches occupied the space between these two lines of illumination they in their greatest gala and as these coaches open in the middle and let down on each side the beauty of the ladies the richness of their dress and brilliance of their jewels were displayed in the most advantageous manner  the beautiful train moved slowly round and round for two hours they seemed all joy and exultation scarce two coaches past without some mutual acknowledgment of affection or respect and the pleasure that sparkled from every eye seemed to be reflected and communicated by sympathy through the whole  in such an assembly continues brydone it was impossible for the heart not to dilate and expand itself i own mine was so full that i could hardly find utterance and i have seen a tragedy with less emotion than this scene of festivity the universal joy seemed here to spring from the heart it brightened every countenance and spoke affection and friendship from every face  no stately air  no supercilious look  all appeared friends and equals  and sure i am that the beauty of the ladies was not half so much heightened either by their dress or their jewels as by that air of complacency and good humor with which it was animated  the next day i thought there would be a falling off the entertainments of the thirteenth began by horseraces of these there were three six horses started each time mounted by boys about twelve years old without either saddle or bridle only a small piece of cord by way of bit in the horses mouth which it seems is sufficient to stop them the great street was the course and for this purpose it was covered with earth five or six inches deep the firing of a gun was the signal for starting the horses understood this for they all sat off at once full speed from one gate and continued at their utmost stretch to the other exactly a mile and ran it in a minute and thirtyfive seconds the horses scarce fourteen hands high barbs or a mixed breed between a sicilian and a barb the boys were gaudily dressed and made a pretty appearance they kept their seat by leaning forward and laying fast hold of the mane  the moment before starting the street appeared full of people nor did we conceive how the race could be run and we were alarmed at seeing the horses run full speed at the very thickest of the crowd which did not begin to open till they were almost close upon it the people then opened and fell back on each side by a regular uniform motion from one end of the street to the other this singular maneuver seemed to be performed without any bustle or confusion and the moment the horses were past the people closed again behind them the victor was conducted along the street in triumph with his prize before him viz a piece of white silk embroidered and worked with gold  the great street was illuminated in the same manner as before and the grand assembly of the nobles was held at the archbishops palace which was richly fitted up on the occasion the gardens were finely illuminated like our vauxhall on an extra day an orchestra was erected at each end and two very good bands of music played the entertainment was splendid  about ten at night the great triumphal car was drawn back again in procession to the marino richly illuminated with wax tapers and made a most formidable figure don qaixole would have been excusable in taking it for an enchanted castle moving through the air the corso was illuminated as the night before and the same parading of carriages took place  on the fourteenth at night the two great streets and the city gates that terminate them were illuminated in the most splendid manner the square in the center where the streets cross each other was richly ornamented with tapestry statues and artificial flowers and as the buildings which form its four sides are uniform and of fine architecture and at the same time highly illuminated it had a wonderful effect there were four orchestras erected in it and the fine bands of music were greater than it could be supposed palermo could furnish from the center of this square we have a view of the whole city thus dressed out in its glory and the effect it produces surpasses belief  the nobles assembled in the viceroys palace and the entertainment was still more magnificent than either of the former evenings the great fireworks opposite the front of the palace began at ten oclock and ended at midnight after this the parading in the corso as before till two the fireworks were more superb than those on the sea though it had not so good an effect  on the fifteenth three races six horses each as before the great assembly of the nobility was at the justice monarchias an officer of high rank and dignity here also was a sumptuous entertainment and a concert at eleven at night the viceroy and the whole company walked to visit the square and the great church a prodigious train for though the city was all a lamp of light the servants of the viceroy and nobles preceded with flambeaus as soon as the viceroy entered the square the five orchestras played and continued playing till he left it  the crowd round the church was very great but the attendants soon cleared the way and entering at the great gate we beheld the most splendid scene in the world the whole church appeared a flame of light which reflected from ten thousand bright and shining surfaces of different colors and different angles produced an effect which no description of enchantment can equal the whole church walls roof pillars etc were entirely covered over with lookingglass as i have observed interspersed with gold and silver paper and artificial flowers so that not one inch of stone or plaster could be seen form an idea of one of our great cathedrals dressed out in this manner and illuminated with twenty thousand waxtapers and it will give some faint notion of this splendid scene i never could have supposed says brydone that human art could have devised any thing so splendid the scene was too glaring to bear any considerable time and the heat occasioned by the lights soon became intolerable in this cathedral there were twentyeight altars fourteen on each side these were dressed out with the utmost magnificence and the great altar was still more splendid than all from the church the company went to the corso which concluded as usual the entertainments of the day  on the sixteenth the streets were fully illuminated the assembly was held at the praeters with an elegant entertainment and a concert pacherotti and gabrielli sung for they were here for the opera the great procession that closed the festival began at ten oclock it differed only from the other procession in this that besides all the priests friars and religious orders of the city there were placed at equal distances from each other ten lofty machines of wood and pasteboard representing temples tabernacles and a variety of beautiful pieces of architecture these are furnished by the different convents and religious fraternities who vie with each other in the richness and elegance of the work some of them are not less than sixty feet high they were filled with figures of saints and angels made of wax so natural and so admirably well painted that many of them seemed alive all these figures are prepared by the nuns and dressed out in rich robes of gold and silver tissue a great silver box containing the bones of st rosalia closed the procession it was carried by thirtysix of the most respectable burgesses of the city who look upon this as the greatest honor the archbishop walked behind it giving his benediction to the people as they passed  no sooner had the procession finished the tour of the great square before the praeters palace than the fountain in the center one of the largest and finest in europe was converted into a fountain of fire throwing it up on all sides and making a very beautiful appearance it only lasted a few minutes and was extinguished by a vast explosion that concluded the whole and we may say with truth that the entertainments of the feast of st rosalio are much beyond those of the holy week at rome of the ascension at venice or indeed any other romish festival  on these occasions we cannot but remark says de non the gravity of the sicilians who enjoy all this without the smallest external symptom of joy or pleasure they would perhaps revolt if the senate was to put a stop to this festival yet they look on it with composure without a smile or any token of satisfaction observing the most perfect good order without requiring the interposition of the justice no tumult ever happens and though there are upwards of one hundred thousand persons collected on the same spot there never is any crouding the inhabitants of themselves divide the street between them one side for those coming up and the other for the passengers going down they are very different from our populace who want to see every thing before it begins keep looking when it has begun and still push forward to stare about them when all is over who never remain quiet so long as a lamp is burning and can hardly prevail on themselves to retire even when the lights are out here the labourer or mechanic as soon as midnight comes leads off his wife or mistress whose arm he has never quitted and resigns his place without clamor to the nobility who enter with the same order and display with true italian pomp their magnificent equipages and gala liveries  another curiosity near palermo is the sepultures of the dead of the convent of capuchins about a mile from it this is a vast subterraneous apartment divided into large commodious galleries the walls on each side of which are hollowed into a variety of niches as if intended for a great collection of statues these niches are filled with dead bodies of men for they will not permit women to be placed there set upright upon their legs and fixed by the back to the inside of the niche their number is about three hundred all dressed in the clothes they usually wore the skin and muscles by a certain preparation become as dry and hard as a piece of stock fish and although many of them have been there upwards of two hundred and fifty years yet none are reduced to skeletons the muscles are indeed more shrunk in some than in others possibly because they might have been more wasted at the time of their death the sight of objects like these must raise in the spectator such emotions as are not easily stifled it is equally disagreeable to find that they mortify our vanity by destroying those fanciful chimaeras of happiness and those great projects which the imagination is pleased to form i experienced this says bisani among others but no sooner were those ideas passed than i could look on these spestres with calmness some inspired me with terror some made me laugh and seemed to laugh in their turn all however afforded this lesson that since we are born only to look round us and to fall and confound our ashes with those of our ancestors we should enjoy life that life whose days are so fugitive and yet in such enjoyment not forget that virtue is the first of duties and the parent of pleasure  here says brydone the people of palermo pay daily visits to their deceased friends and regret the scenes of their past life here they familiarise themselves with their future state and choose the company they would keep in the other world it is a common thing to make choice of their niches and try if their body fits it that no alterations may be necessary after their death and sometimes by way of penance they accustom themselves to stand for hours in these niches  the bodies of the princes and first nobility are deposited in handsome chests or trunks some of them richly adorned the keys are kept by the nearest relations of the family who sometimes come and drop a tear over their departed friends  these preserved bodies are by no means great objects of horror they retain a strong likeness to what they were when alive so that as soon as the first feeling excited by these venerable figures is conquered it may be considered as a vast gallery of original portraits drawn by the pencil of truth  description is of all things the most insipid for words and writing convey ideas only by a slow and regular kind of progress and whilst we gain one we generally lose another so that the fancy seldom embraces the whole to relieve my readers i have often therefore introduced anecdotes and stories perhaps not very pertinent to the subject but merely to enliven the work that might otherwise become dull and tiresome it is on this principle i shall give the following laughable story from brydone he dined with a nobleman at palermo and an abbe present gave him this anecdote of a friend of his who was formerly a brother of the capuchin convent known by the name of fra pasqual and who had passed through many singular scenes of life he was one of the banditti of this kingdom in which he had been enrolled some time of this banditti we shall speak hereafter but tired of the danger to which he was continually exposed he changed the character of hero for that of saint and became a capuchin friar he took the vows of poverty and chastity and entered into all the rigours of a monastic life determining to atone for his sins by spending the remainder of it in mortification and penance he went barefooted wore a large rosary and a thicker cord of discipline than any monk in the convent and his whole deportment gave testimony of the most unfeigned repentance this lasted only a few weeks the devil was still at work in the heart of pasqual and all these external mortifications only made him work the harder in short pasqual finding it impossible to drive him out and afraid left the enemy should at last get the better of him he thought it advisable to leave at palermo the character of sanctity he had acquired and began a new life at a new place he embarked for naples and was soon there admitted into a capuchin convent  pasqual knowing from experience that the dull uniformity of a monastic life required some renovation and amusement to render it supportable set about it the first thing he did was to find himself a mistress in a snug corner where he might sleep at night occasionally from his convent and indulge in that enjoyment which his austere order forbids he soon fixed his eye on a celebrated courtezan who like our london ladies of easy virtue though they admit for pay no visits from strangers but those that are wealthy will take up with lovers at times more suited to their own cast and inclinations this lady admitted to her bed at certain times when she was otherwise engaged a lifeguardman six feet two inches high a fellow with a spada or toledo of uncommon length and wore a pair of curled whiskers that would frighten any man whose nerves were not uncommonly strong this man was kept by her as her champion and paid by those favors she had occasionally to spare but having an art of winning her affections more than by fighting her battles he had got the ascendancy over her and never suffered her to receive any visits but from those he was made acquainted with which were generally old fools who had more money than wit and would often sacrifice the former at the shrine of their idolatry this lady however had a penchant of her own and having no idea of being confined to one youthful admirer was determined to receive any other she pleased at this time the capuchin one night fell in her way when she knew her lifeguardman would be on duty she invited him to her bed and to make her favors more valuable told him she had a lover who was exceedingly jealous of her that if he knew of her intriguing or admitting the visits of any other person he would be the death of them both for that he was a soldier and a man in disposition as furious as a lion but that as he was then on duty there would be no danger and she should be glad to see him  the capuchin who had been originally bred to arms having no fear and liking difficulties was more eager than ever to accept this ladys invitation he accordingly stepped out of his convent and hied to the apartments of his mistress but it so happened that about one in the morning when he was asleep with his fair enchantress the lifeguardman unexpectedly returned the noise he made at the door soon awaked and alarmed them the lady was frightened out of her wits told the capuchin it was her lover and that she expected nothing less than that both would be put to death the capuchin being unarmed was also not a little frightened not finding a ready admittance the soldier stormed and made a louder noise and the capuchin having no time to reflect gathered up his rags and crept under the bed which being rather corpulent he found a difficulty in doing he was no sooner there than she opened the door which was a groundfloorroom and the giant stalked in angry that he was kept at the door so long however as he returned in an amorous mood her winning ways soon put him into good humor there was no light in the room and of course the monk did not fear a discovery strike a light said the soldier that i may see to undress the monk trembled and the bed shook what makes the bed shake so says he it is i returned the lady that ran against it in searching for the tinderbox it was found and the monk quaked within him but she having designedly from the chamberpot thrown some water into it the tinder would not take fire till the capuchin knew this every stroke of the flint was to him a double knell but when both had tried and his rival swore at the tinders not kindling saying it was wet his spirits recovered she advised him to go to the guardhouse for a light being only at the end of the street here the monk had fresh hopes which sunk again on hearing the soldier say that he left his duty without leave and dared not go and would rather undress in the dark he then began to grope about under the bed for a bottle of liquors that he knew was there and had very nearly laid hold of the capuchins head but madam finding what he was at sprung to the bed and reached it for him he was now undressed and they got into bed the weight of this giant gave the poor monk less room for he lay just over him he was squeezed quite flat and was nearly suffocated he had now a little time to think and it first struck him that he would rush out into the street but then he was stark naked for the capuchins wear no shirts this would alarm the police next he thought of seizing the toledo and then threatening the lifeguardman demand honorable terms of capitulation for both himself and the lady a thousand ideas rolled in his mind he could neither attend to any thing that was passing nor be sensible of the pressure that was over him at last the man of war fell asleep and the capuchin heard him snore this was music to his heart till he heard this he was determined to keep his place till the morning but now he ventured if possible to escape he accordingly worked his way out from under the bed and laying hold of the sword relinquished the cowardly idea of escaping and felt himself bold his thoughts now were to be revenged of his rival and make him suffer in his turn he accordingly dressed himself in the soldiers uniform and placed his greasy clothes cowl etc in a chair before the bed where the soldier had placed his and sallied forth into the street here he had time to think shall i go back says he to himself in the character of another lifeguard man and pretend i am sent by the officer on guard in search of him and take him to the guardhouse as a deserter no this would be treacherous and not a sufficient retaliation i will go and acquaint the guard who hate the capuchin friars for the ill opinion they entertain of the licentiousness of the army that i have traced one of that order to a house of ill fame and induce them to accompany me and unkennel the fox this he did he told the officer then on duty that as the capuchins were very apt to censure the army he had now an opportunity of being revenged that he had noticed a franciscan friar in his habit skulking in the streets had watched him and traced him to the house of a common woman that he had listened at the window and heard them go to bed and that if the officer would accompany him he would enjoy not only great diversion but would when he heard the capuchins inveigh against the army be able in future to turn the laugh against them the officer pleased with the idea took the guard with him and followed the capuchin to the house they rapped loud at the door and demanded admittance for the nightguard the noise waked the sleepy couple and the soldier fearing it was the guard come to apprehend him for quitting his duty was in his turn much more afraid than the monk when his rival announced his return in his panic he got out of bed took up in the dark the capuchins clothes that laid in the chair supposing them to be his own and hid himself where the priest had done before the capuchin not readily gaining admittance put his foot to the door and forced it open the guard entered and demanded of the lady the body of a capuchin friar that lodged with her that night she hearing the monk when he quitted her chamber and not supposing he would inform against himself protested she had no capuchin with her and called upon all the saints in support of her assertion but the monk suspecting the retreat of his rival stooped and pulled from under the bed the cowl the cloak the sandals the rosary and the cord of discipline one after the other crying out no capuchin no capuchin these are damning proofs proofs not to be controverted and then stooping to the ground cried out soho  i nose him he stinks like a fox the only way to find a capuchin is to nose him  we may wind them a mile off the lanthorn was now held down and the man of ardour was found squeezed beneath the bed almost stifled ecco lo cries the capuchin here he is  here he is  the reverend father is come you see to do penance let us assist him in his discipline with this they drew him out and belabored him well with the cord crying out andiamo signior padre andiamo the poor soldier being without his clothes felt the weight of st francis heavier than what he liked and bawled out that he was no capuchin and that they were all mistaken this occasioned a repetion of the scourging the monk laid it on now the heavier saying he deserved this for denying his master and his order the guards lay all round the bed in convulsions of laughter at the scene  the lady was frightened and alarmed she ran about the room exclaiming oime siamo perduti  siamo incantati  siamo insorcelati that is ah me i am ruined  i am under an enchantment  i am bewitched  the monk delighted at the success of his scheme thought it was best that he should get off before he was discovered therefore made an excuse to the officer for leaving him saying his hour of duty was come and he was obliged to join his corpse but recommended to to him with a sneer to treat the holy father with all all that respect and reverence due to so sacred a person  the lifeguardman no sooner got from under the bed than he looked for his clothes and not seeing any but the greasy robes of a capuchin friar was persuaded that god had given him over to the devil as a punishment for his offenses for of all men the neapolitan soldiers are most superstitious and he recollected it was friday a fast day and that in passing the statue of st januarius he had not offered up a prayer to it this is the consequence says he moaning of offending heaven i acknowledge my sin i knew it was friday and yet o flesh flesh  had it been any other day i should not have been thus metamorphosed now must i no longer carry a sword but a crucifix oh st januarius thy allsearching eye has found me out  do gentlemen what you please with me i am not what i seem to be true enough said the officer we are sensible of that come signior padre put on your filthy garments and march for we have no time to lose here corporal giving him the cord tie his hands and let st francis bind him the poor son of mars was perfectly passive they arrayed him in the sandals the cloak and cowl of the capuchin and put the great rosary round his neck he hung his head and a woeful figure he made  look in the glass said the officer turning him about and see if you know yourself are you a capuchin now he was shocked at his own appearance but bore all with resignation thus equipped they conducted him to the guardhouse scourging him all the way with the cord and asking him at every stroke if he knew his master now  the capuchin during this time had sneaked unperceived into his convent and having a second dress put it on taking the clothes of the lifeguardman and laying them in a heap before it was light near the gate of another capuchin convent at some distance from his own not forgetting to pocket the trifle of money he found in the soldiers breeches to atone for the loss of his garments capuchins are forbidden by their order to carry money and this man says he should not have thought of doing it but to prevent any other from making an unlawful prize of it  the poor soldiers comrades soon heard of his transformation and came in troops to see him and jeer him in his metamorphosis but as he thought himself under the finger of heaven and does to this day he bore all with meekness they kept him a prisoner for a day or two but his clothes being found he was set at liberty it has been of some use to him for he never passes st januarius without muttering a prayer nor ever visits his mistress on a friday  about five miles from palermo is the city of monreale a small place on the brow of a very high hill but the sea of an archbishop remarkable for its grand approach or paved road made by the diocesan winding up the mountain supported by strong buttresses and breastworks and adorned with borders of floweringshrubs urns fountains and inscriptions about the midway close to the road rises a huge barren rock out of the bowels of which a fine stream gushes with great force an artist has been employed to improve this natural fountain which he has done by adding to the original cliff large masses of rugged stone which pen up the water into one full but irregular body it then dashes headlong into a capacious basin overgrown with the broad leaves of the lotus flag and waterlily on the summit of this artificial rock is the statue of a boy armed with a hatchet watching a serpent that seems creeping toward the water another boy as if roused by alarm is represented climbing up with a stone in his hand whilst a little girl with dismay strongly marked in every feature is hiding herself behind the stump of a tree  a gate terminates this fine approach to monreale the other end of the road joins an avenue of aged trees some of which are plantanes leading through the plain to the gates of palermo which plain for many miles is a continued orangegarden and fine scenery the air perfumed monreale is hemmed in on every side but the northern by lofty mountains but on the north a view opens over hanging woods of olive and of orange trees to palermo and the sea a noble and most extensive scene  the city is clean and neatly built and contains above eight thousand inhabitants but the cathedral the second in the island exhibits a very disagreeable specimen of gothic taste and to mend it they have whitewashed the outside let me notice in the way back to palermo the torre zizza and i have done this is a country house of very ancient foundation and remarkable architecture it was built by the saracens during their abode in sicily in the ninth or tenth century and is almost coeval with the mosque at cordova in spain but differs widely from it in the character of its architecture the windows of la zizza are long and almost round at top instead of being pointed or arched like a horseshoe it is a square stone tower three stories high of regular courses of masonry not at all decayed by age with a battlement on the top on each stone of which is a letter of some alphabet used by the saracens which mr swinburne supposes to be the cufick now only to be found in the oldest mahomedan manuscripts the inside is decorated with thin arches and frosted cielings hanging down in drops a fountain plays in the hall and fragrant gardens with rich decorations adjoin it the tale of this town handed down by tradition is that a sultan erected it for the purpose of consining his beautiful daughter zizza but as this word is said to imply gay flowery deckedout this tower might have been called so from its ornaments even now when the sicilians speak of a welldrest lady they say she is a zizzata  chap vii of catania catania is a city standing on the western coast of sicily it lies at the foot of mount aetna and has been several times destroyed by it it evidently appears says brydone that the irruptions of the mountain have formed the whole coast and in many places have driven back the sea for several miles from its ancient boundaries the account given by sicilian authors of the conflict between these two adverse elements fire and water is truly tremendous and in relating it they seem to have been shaken with horror conceive the front of a torrent of fire ten miles in breadth and heaped up to an enormous height rolling down the mountain and pouring its flames into the ocean the noise more dreadful than the loudest thunder and heard through the whole country to an immense distance the water seeming to retire and hide its head before its antagonist and to confess its superiority yielding up its possessions and contracting its banks salt vapors darkening the face of the sun covering up this scene under a veil of horror and of night and laying waste every field and vineyard in these regions of the island this city was in great want of a port till by an irruption in the sixteenth century a stream of lava running into the sea formed a mole which no expense could have furnished this lasted for some time a safe and commodious harbor till at last by a subsequent irruption it was entirely filled up and demolished at this time the torrent burst over the walls and laying waste great part of this beautiful city poured into the sea but the superstition of the people is so great and so great is their reliance on st agatha their saint that they cannot be made to believe but that when such irruptions injure them it is because they have offended agatha whose influence and power can prevent such accidents if she pleases nor would they be persuaded to remove their situation if the lava were at their walls from an opinion that agatha can keep it fromentering the city neither is it the veil of the saint alone that in their opinion can do this which they have long preserved as a relick but they conceive says brydone every thing that has touched that piece of sacred attire possessing the same miraculous property thus there is a number of little bits of cotton and linen fixed to the veil which after being blessed by the bishop are supposed to acquire power enough to save any persons house or garden and wherever this expedient has failed it is always attributed to want of faith of the person not want of faith in the veil  catania was founded by the chalcidians soon after the settlement of syracuse it fell into the hands of the romans among their earliest acquisitions in sicily and became the residence of the praeter it was adorned with sumptuous buildings and every convenience was procured to supply the natural and artificial wants of life it was destroyed by pompeys son but restored with superior magnificence by augustus in the reign of decius st agatha its patroness was martyred on every emergency her intercession is implored she is piously believed to have preserved catania from being overwhelmed by torrents of lava or shaken to pieces by earthquakes yet its ancient edifices are covered by repeated streams of volcanic matter and almost every house even her own church has been thrown to the ground once by an irruption of aetna twenty thousand catanians with their pastor at their head were destroyed before the sacred veil could be properly placed to check the flames and in the last century the irruptions and earthquakes raged with redoubled violence and catania was quite demolished  the prince of biscari has been at infinite pains and spent a large sum of money in working down to the ancient town we descended into baths says swinburne into sepulchers an amphitheatre and a theater all very much injured they were erected on old beds of lava and even built with square pieces of the same substance which does not appear to have been fused by the contact of new lava  this city has been frequently defended from the burning streams by the solid mass of its own ramparts and by the air compressed between them and the lava this appears by the torrent having stopped within a small distance of the walls and taken another direction but when the walls were broken or low the lava collected itself till it rose to a great height and then poured over in a curve there is a wall at the foot of the old walls where the lava after running along the parapet and then falling forwards has produced a very complete lofty arch over the spring  since its destruction by an irruption in      and its overthrow by an earthquake in      catania is reviving with great splendour and when all the houses now building are finished will be a very handsome city it has much more the features of a metropolis and royal residence than palermo the principal streets are wide straight and well paved with lava an obelisk of red granite placed on the back of an antique elephant of touchstone or lava a fine monument of antiquity stands in the center of the great square which is formed by the town hall seminary and cathedral one would naturally suppose that men would be backward in erecting new habitations especially with any degree of grandeur on a ground so often shaken to its center and so often buried under the ashes of a volcano but such is the attachment of an italian to his native soil and such his contempt to dangers to which they are habituated that like the martin which builds its nests under the eves of houses pull it down as often as you please it will immediately proceed to rebuilding it so will the italians rebuild their houses on the warm cinders of vesuvius the quaking plains of calabria and the black mountains of sciarra at catania there is a great deal of activity in the disposition of this people they know by tradition that their ancestors carried on a flourishing commerce and that before the fiery river filled it up they had a spacious convenient harbor where they now have scarcely a creek for a felucca they therefore wish to restore these advantages to catania and have often applied to government for assistance toward forming a mole and a port  the number of inhabitants in catania amounts to about thirty thousand men the catanians say sixty thousand great part of this number belongs to the university the only one in the island and the nursery of all the lawyers  the prince of biscari has enclosed a large tract of the lava of      near the seaside surrounded the old fortress where the kings of arragon used to reside and in this black impenetrable surface has made a garden built houses carried on a good coach road round it planted trees in earth brought from other places and what seems almost incomprehensible has formed two large ponds of fresh water supplied by springs that ooze through the lava stocked them them with fish and watersowl and preserved them from the fury of the sea by a strong pier the only barrier between the salt and fresh water the spot where his villa stands on the lava was formerly fifty feet deep in water and the height of the lava above the present level of the sea is not less than fifty feet more  this prince has a museum of the antiquities he has dug out of the ruins of catania his collection is very rich and extensive especially in etruscan vases lamps and antiquities of terra cotta one of the most remarkable lamps is molded into the form of a camel with an amphora on each side fixed in a cradle the watercarriers at palermo use a similar contrivance to this day for conveying water upon asses among his busts and statues some are conspicuous for the perfection of their sculpture others for the persons they represent it would require a volume to describe them let it suffice to say that his collection consists of whatever catania and sicily produce that is curious in antiquity  among other curiosities is the organ at the benedictine convent built by a neapolitan priest the tunes of all sorts of wind and strung instruments are imitated with the most perfect illusion one of the pipes gives an echo in so aerial a manner that you follow the sound to its distant reverberations till it loses itself in space  catania says brydone is looked upon as one of the most ancient cities in the world their legends aver that it was founded by the cyclops or giants of aetna supposed to be the first inhabitants of sicily after the deluge and some sicilian writers pretend it was built by deucalion and pyrrha as soon as the waters subsided and had got down again to the foot of the mountain its ancient name was cataetna or the city of aetna it is now reckoned the third city in the kingdom though since messina has been destroyed it may well be considered as the second it has a bishop and the bishops revenues which are considerable arise principally from the sale of the snow on mount aetna one small portion of which lying in the north of the mountain is said to bring him in upwards of a thousand pounds a year for aetna furnishes snow and ice not only to the whole island of sicily but likewise to malta and a great part of italy and makes a very considerable branch of commerce for even the peasants in these hot countries regalo themselves with ices during the summer heats and there is no entertainment given by the nobility of which these do not always make a principal part a famine of snow they say would be more grievous than a famine of either corn or wine it is a common observation among them that without the snows of aetna their island could not be inhabited but aetna not only cools them in summer but warms them in winter the fuel for the greater part of the island being carried from the immense and inexhaustible forests of this volcano  near to the walls of the ancient city many of which are standing near sixty feet high and of great strength and yet the lava of      overflowed them near to these walls and the benedictine convent they have discovered the fragments of a famous temple of ceres a nymphaeum the gymnasium and a naumachia that was near the castle the vestiges of which were to be seen before the lava of      had covered them and two arches of the aqueducts leading to which are still visible in the lava  so many public edifices crowded together in so small a space must have left but little room for the houses of individuals which may lead us to conclude that this city has been embellished at different periods or that the private houses were extremely small in comparison to the public buildings or that ancient catania was still more ornamented than extensive and consequently more rich than popular the modern town is of the same nature for though the catanians estimate their number at sixty thousand we see nothing in the streets but convents churches and palaces separated by a few private houses  it is difficult to assign the epoch of this splendour of catania the great quantity of latin inscriptions discovered in the different edifices the baths the naumachia etc known only to the romans lead us to determine its splendour to have been in their time which continued to the incursions of the barbarians who broke the statues pillaged the bronzes and melted down the metals to carry them off next came the normans who barbarously catholic piously despoiled the beautiful temples of their marbles to construct their miserable churches  catania now a handsome city but without an inn is most likely to be again destroyed by commotion of the mountain catania is now purged and purified from all the infection contracted from heathen rites and the rotundo like the pantheon at rome which seems to have outlived other buildings owing to its singular form is become a christian church it is not a little curious to consider says brydone how small the deviation is in the present rites from those of the ancients in almost every article it is a just observation that during the long reign of heathenism superstition had exhausted her talent for invention so that when a superstitious spirit seized christians they were under a necessity of borrowing from their predecessors and imitating some part of their idolatry in some places the very images still remain they have only christened them and the statue that bore the name of venus or proserpine is now called mary magdalene or the virgin the same ceremonies are daily performed before these images in the same language and nearly in the same manner the saints are perpetually coming down in person and working miracles as did the heathen gods of old the walls of the temples are covered with the vows of pilgrims as they were formerly the holy water which was held in such detestation by the first christians is again revered and sprinkled about with the same devotion as in the time of paganism the same incest is burnt by priests arrayed in the same manner with the same grimaces genuflexions before the same images and in the same temples too in short so nearly do the rites coincide that were the pagan high priest to return and reassume his functions he would only have to learn a few new names to get the mass the paters and the eves by heart brydone says he took notice of this to a roman catholic nobleman who is not the most zealous sectary in the world and he frankly owned the truth of the observation  not far from catania between that and messina is the city of iaci near which homer has placed the landing of ulysses and which still bears the name of porto dulysse homer must have made a very bad choice for a place to land his hero or else the lava has greatly changed its form the shoals or rocks between this and catania which are a hundred feet above the level of the sea and probably as many below it are entire masses of lava it is impossible to conceive how these masses have become insulated with gulphs between them of such profundity as to make the water black as ink unless some dreadful convulsions of the north have removed the sandy bottom on which these masses had run when liquid and have thus separated them from the shore and formed them into rocks  chap viii of syracuse and the chief antiquities of the island the great and mighty syracuse whose spacious harbor once received innumerable fleets whose battles were fought by the athenians within its circumference and where the triumphant carthaginians found their tombs is now a desolate and a filthy wretched place but the isle of ortyra which is the modern town and was anciently the fortress and castle of dionysius has been fortified by the king of spain though without artillery those who come here by sea are obliged to perform quarantine at the instance of those who farm out the lazarettos of sicily and oblige all vessels to quarantine though there is not a shed nor even ground enough for the prows of the little craft that come here to rest upon this difficulty they oblige mariners to put up with for twentyeight days in order to fill the pockets of those who guard the vessel by little indulgencies they show them  the fountain of arethusa is one of the chief curiosities and pieces of antiquity here it is an angular basin of sulphurous water close to the sea formed by two wells but not antique wells and where now the dirtiest linen is washed by a number of still dirtier women who almost naked and with their petticoats tucked up present the most disgusting scene immodesty can display notwithstanding the wretched condition of this fountain it appears miraculous that from the center of a rock almost surrounded by the sea a spring should break out in streams which when united must rather have resembled the mouth of a river than a fountain near this fountain was the palace of verres and that delicious walk which cicero accuses the proconsul of converting into a scene of debauchery it is still the public walk but has now no delights being nothing but a narrow sauntering place between a great wall and the parapet of the harbor planted with a few sorry birches at the bottom of the wall are two fragments of a norman building which might have been part of the palace of verres  of the temples of diana and minerva the palace of dyonisius his garden his tomb and those famous baths of the celebrated daphnis the son of mercury and a nymph the inventor of pastoral poetry who charmed diana by his songs and verses and was punished with blindness for his infidelity nothing remains but the temple of minerva converted into a cathedral and part of the temple of diana now in the chamber of a private individual being two pieces of columns fixed up to support a roof and enlarge bis apartment  in acradina originally part of syracuse stands the church of st john in some low grounds covering the entrance of immense catacombs where the ancient sicilians buried their dead the primitive saithful are supposed to have assembled here in times of persecution and to have interred their brethren in these vaults these vaults are formed in streets cut through one continued stratum of soft stone a sediment of marine bodies crossing each other in many directions and are hewn with more care and regularity than the catacombs of st januarius at naples at stated distances there are large circular rooms lined with stucco and pierced at the top so as to admit light and air on each side of the walls are recesses cut into the rock and in the floor of these cavities coffins of all sizes have been hollowed out in some places there have been twenty troughs one behind another and skeletons have been found in them with a piece of money in their mouths  near the port they show the spot where stood archimedess house and also the tower from whence he is said to have set fire to the roman galleys with his burning glasses mr brydone thinks if there is any degree of truth in this story it must have been with a number of lookingglasses not unequal glasses or concave speculums as it would have been difficult with such glasses to have caused a focus of such a great length but mr buffon has made the experiment with lookingglasses he fixed four hundred small mirrors in a kind of frame and disposed them in such a manner that the rays reflected from each of them fell exactly on the same point by which means he melted lead at the distance of a hundred and twenty feet and set fire to a haystack at a much greater distance  the end of this philosopher was remarkable when marcellus the roman general was before the archimedes summoned before the roman general walls of this city the same of archimedes reached him and he dispatched a roman soldier to bring him on his arrival at his house he told the philosopher his message but he being too taken up with studies paid little attention to the summons which so exasperated the soldier that to revenge his disobedience to the general he immediately ran him through the body and killed him  the chief remains of antiquity besides those i have mentioned are a theater and amphitheatre many sepulchers the latomic and the ear of dionysius the latomie now makes a noble subterraneous garden and is indeed a romantic and beautiful spot most of it is about a hundred feet below the level of the earth and of an incredible extent the whole is hewn out of a rock composed of a concretion of shells gravel and other marine bodies the bottom of this immense quarry from whence probably the greatest part of syracuse was built is now covered with an exceeding rich soil and as no wind from any part of the compass can touch it it is filled with a great variety of the finest shrubs and fruit trees which bear with vast luxuriance and are never blasted the oranges citrons bergamots pomegranates figs etc are all of a remarkable size and fine quality some of these trees but more particularly the olives grow out of the hard rock where there is no visible soil and exhibit a very uncommon and pleasing appearance this is the same spot so celebrated by cicero about eighteen hundred years ago opus est ingens says he magnificum regum ac tyrannorum totum ex saxo in mirandam altitudinem depresso etc  the ear of dionysius is no less a monument of ingenuity and magnificence than of the cruelty of that tyrant it is a huge cavern cut out of the hard rock in form of a human ear the perpendicular height about eighty feet and its length no less than two hundred and fifty this cavern was said to be so contrived that every sound made in it was collected and united into one focus which was called the tympanum and exactly opposite to it the tyrant had made a small hole which communicated with a little apartment where he used to conceal himself he applied his own ear at this hole and is said to have heard distinctly every word that was spoken in the cavern below this apartment was no sooner finished than he put to death all the workmen that had been employed in it he then confined all that he suspected were his enemies and by overhearing their conversation judged of their guilt and condemned or acquitted them accordingly  the amphitheatre is in the form of a very eccentric ellipse and much fallen to decay but the theater is so entire that most of the seats still remain there are near twenty remains of temples but none that are distinguishable a few fine columns of jupiter olympus still remain and the temple of minerva now converted as i have observed into the cathedral is almost entire  syracuse was composed of four cities ortygia is the only one remaining by much the smallest situated in the island of that name is about two miles round and contains about fourteen thousand people the ruins of the other three tycha acradina and neapoli are computed at twentytwo miles in circumference almost the whole space of which is now converted into rich vineyards orchards and cornfields the walls of these are indeed built with broken marbles full of engravings and inscriptions but most of them defaced and spoiled  on a hill near ortygia is a convent of capuchin friars when a stranger walks up to this monastery he sees neither verdure nor tree all appears one dreary rock and little does he suspect he is within reach of extensive orchards which by their produce yield a handsome income to the friars no sight can be more singular than the gardens of this convent which are in some measure subterraneous being contained in the areas of immense excavations made by cutting stone for the ancient city these areas are covered with a thick grove of trees loaded with rich scented blossoms and beautiful fruit the vaults of this convent have the property of drying the bodies of the dead in a very short space of time after which they are dressed in religious habits and placed as statues in niches on each side of the subterranean alleys  the diocese of syracuse produces above forty different sorts of wine the honey of the hills is as clear as amber and of delicious flavor and vegetables are admirable in their kind particularly brocoli which grows to a very great size syracuse is the mildest climate that can be for a winters residence two or three days of sharp easterly winds excepted the remainder of the winter months is a continual spring on the   th of january the vines which are kept low and closed pruned had shot out new leaves the gardens were shaded with flowers and fresh almonds were gathered from the trees the river at ortygia throws up great quantities of fine amber sugarcanes ready jointed for chewing are sold in the market and salt may be had gratis  agrigentum now girgenti was the second ancient city in size to syracuse it is situated on the east coast of sicily on the top of a mountain eleven hundred feet above the level of the sea and about four miles distant from the port of agrigentum from which place the road on each side is bordered by a row of exceeding large american aloes when brydone was there upwards of onethird of them were in full bloom and making the most beautiful appearance the flower stems of this noble plant are in general between twenty and thirty feet high some more and are covered with flowers from top to bottom which taper regularly and form a beautiful kind of pyramid the base or pedestal of which is the fine spreading leaves of that plant with us they are reckoned only to flower once in a hundred years but in sicily they blow always at the latest the sixth year and often the fifth the whole substance of the plant being carried into the stem and the flowers the leaves begin to decay as soon as the bloom is completed and a numerous offspring of young plants are produced round the root of the old one these are slipped off and formed into new plantations either for hedges or for avenues to their country houses  the city of girgenti is irregular and ugly but it looks grand at a distance lying on the slope of the mountain the houses are mean the streets dirty crooked and narrow yet it contains near twenty thousand people a sad reduction from its ancient grandeur when it was said to consist of no less than eight hundred thousand  the antiquities of this place are perhaps more considerable than any in sicily the ruins of the ancient city lie about eight miles from the modern one these like those of the syracuse are mostly converted into cornfieldsd vineyards and orchards but the remains of the temples here are more conspicuous four of these temples stood pretty much in a right line half of the first remains the second has every column standing consisting of thirteen fluted doric pillars with all their bases capitals entablatures etc complete the third temple is that of hercules and contained that famous statue so much celebrated by cicero near to this lie ruins of the temple of jupiter olympus supposed to have been the largest in the heathen world it is now called the giants temple but is a perfect ruin it was exactly we are told of the same dimensions with the church of st peter at rome but this we apprehend not to be true the temple of esculapius the ruins of which are still to be seen are not less celebrated for a statue of apollo which was taken from this temple by the carthaginians and continued the greatest ornament of carthage for many years and was at last restored by scipio at the final destruction of that city some sicilians allege that it was afterward carried to rome and is the apollo of belvidere  the ancient walls are mostly cut out of the rock the catacombs and sepulchers are all very great and the monument of tero king of agrigentum one of the first of the sicilian tyrants whose name is mentioned by herodotus and pindar must be more than two thousand years old  all these mighty ruins and the whole mountain on which it stands are composed of a concretion of seashells and cemented by a kind of sand or gravel and now become as hard and perhaps more durable than marble a proof that this globe must have undergone many convulsions not recorded in any history  the magnificence the pomp the hospitality of the ancient inhabitants of agrigentum may be read in diodorus siculus pliny solinus virgil timeus and others in the great church at agrigentum there is a remarkable echo something in the manner of our whispering gallery at st pauls though more difficult to be accounted for if one person stands at the west gate and another places himself on the cornice at the most distant point of the church exactly behind the great altar they can hold a conversation in very low whispers for many years this singularity was not known and several of the confessing chairs being placed near the great altar the wags who were in the secret used to take their station at the door of the cathedral and thus heard distinctly every word that passed between the confessor and his penitent of which they did not fail to make their own use when occasion offered the most secret intrigues were discovered and such ladies as were disposed to intrigue were very well known this lead every woman in agrigentum to change either her gallant or her confessor yet still it was the same  at last however the cause was found out the chairs were removed and other precautions taken to prevent the future discovery of such sacred mysteries  chap ix of the manners of the sicilians their amusements and traveling the sicilians says brydone are much more animated in conversation than either the french or neapolitans and their action is generally so just and so expressive of their sentiments that without hearing what is said one may comprehend the subject of their discourse the origin of this custom they carry so far back as the time of the earliest tyrants of syracuse who to prevent conspiracies had forbidden their subjects under heavy penalties to be seen talking together in parties this induced them to invent a method of communicating their ideas by action which they pretend has been transmitted to posterity ever since  the people of sicily till lately retained a great many ridiculous and superstitious customs particularly in their marriage and funeral ceremonies some of them are still retained in the wild and mountainous part of the island as soon as the marriage ceremony is performed two of the attendants are ready to cram a spoonful of honey into the mouths of the bride and bridegroom as emblematical of their love and union which they hope will continue as sweet to their souls as is honey to their palates they then begin to throw handfuls of wheat upon them which is continued all the way to the house of the bridegroom probably some remains of an ancient rite to ceres they fancy it procures them a numerous progeny but without this they are abundantly prolific women frequently says brydone having upwards of forty children carrera mentions one who had fortyseven the young couple are not allowed to partake of the marriage feast and this to teach them temperance and patience but when dinner is finished a great bone is presented to the bridegroom by the brides father or one of her nearest relations who pronounces these words  rodi tu quest osso etc pick you this bone for you have now taken in hand to pick one which you will find much harder and of more difficult digestion hence probably the old saying i will give him a bone to pick  like most other nations in europe they carefully avoid marrying in the month of may as inauspicious a piece of superstition perhaps older than the time of the romans but the marriages of the sicilian nobility are celebrated with great magnificence the ladies marry very young and often live to see the fifth or sixth generation they are generally sprightly and agreeable says brydone but what the english would call ordinary they have remarkable fine hair know how to adorn it to the greatest advantage and pride themselves on their female ancestors in a dearth of bowstrings when palermo was besieged cutting off their hair and twisting it into strings for destruction to their enemies which heroism saved the town till assistance was procured their hair now discharges no other shafts than those of cupid and the only cords it forms are the cords of love  the sicilians are much fonder of study than their neighbors on the continent and their education much more attended to so opposite are they to the italian nobility in general who have nothing but smalltalk the sicilian nobility talk on subjects of literature history and politics but chiefly of poetry this is a universal topic every one in some period of his life is sure to be inspired and a lover is never believed whilst he speaks in prose but is reckoned true in proportion as he is poetical  many of the young nobility speak english and are well acquainted with our poets and philosophers our language is a part of their polite education and they pride themselves in associating with the wellbred english but do not seem pleased with their neighbors of the continent  the native language of sicily is now a mixture of norman roman german italian spanish and some remnants of the old tongue the island having been overrun at times by these nations i searched among their literature says swinburne and met with no good prosecomposition and scarcely a poet of moderate genius is to be discovered among versifiers that have rhymed their native dialect  the luxury of the people here says brydone like that of the neapolitans consists chiefly in their equipages and horses but by a wise law of the king of sardinia still in force the viceroy alone is allowed to drive in palermo with six horses the praeter the archbishop the president of the parliament with four all the rest of the nobility are restricted to two but drive four out of the city every family of distinction has at least two or three carriages in daily use the wife of a man of fashion has always one at her command and the upper servants of the first families have one also for them  prince is a common title here the eldest sons take the title of marquis or count and the younger sons are called dons the daughters donnas before their christian names as we call the daughters and younger sons of dukes lady and lord  they make very splendid entertainments and it is a custom says swinburne at such entertainments at girgenti he is not sure it was the same at palermo that none of the family will taste a morsel till the strangers have helped themselves they are then to help the persons of the family they dine with this custom he apprehends was founded on an idea of having given every thing to the guest and then receiving at his hands what he could spare  some of their amusements we have described they have a very good opera at palermo and brydone says he was present at a ballet which consisted of a representation of vauxhall gardens in london in which all the outre characters of the english in dress and manner caricatured from the upper to the lower class of people are exhibited and with no small degree of humor three quakers were introduced as duped by three ladies of the town in concert with three jacktars their lovers  the sicilians are passionately fond of loud wind and instrumental music and upon great holidays will collect before a churchdoor forty or fifty drums all beating together for the greater the noise the more honor for the saint  the account of traveling in sicily where there are no postroads no publiccarriages or any inns we will give our readers from brydone who crossed the island in two or three places being well recommended he had the favor of those who could accommodate him with mules guards etc  when mr brydone proposed setting off from messina toward catania the prince of villa franca told him he would give orders for guards to attend him who should be answerable for every thing that whatever number of mules he had occasion for should be at the door of the inn at any hour he should appoint that the guards he should send were men of the most determined resolution as well as the most approved fidelity and would not fail to chastise on the spot any person who should presume to impose on him  these guards mr brydone discovered afterward to be some of the most daring and hardened villains perhaps that are to be met with upon earth who in any other country would have been broken on the wheel or hung in chains but are here publicly protected the princes secretary told him that in the east part of the island called val demoni from the devils that are supposed to inhabit mount aetna it has ever been found impracticable to extirpate the banditti there being numberless caverns and subterraneous passages in that mountain where no troops could possibly pursue them that besides as they are known to take a dreadful revenge on all who have offended them the prince of villa franca has embraced it not only as the safest but as the wisest and most political scheme to become their declared patron and protector and such of them as think proper to leave their recesses though only for a time are sure to meet with good encouragement and security in his service they enjoy the most unbounded confidence which in no instance they have ever yet been found to make an improper or a dishonest use of they are clothed in the princes livery yellow and green with silverlace and wear likewise a badge of their honorable order which entitles them to universal fear and respect from the people  in some circumstances these banditti are the most respectable people in the island and have by much the highest and most romantic notions of what they call their point of honor that however criminal they may be with regard to society in general yet with respect to one another and to every person to whom they have once professed it they have ever maintained the most unshaken fidelity the magistrates have often been obliged to protect them and even pay them court being known to be perfectly determined and desperate and so extremely vindictive that they will put any person to death who has ever given them just cause of provocation on the other hand brydone was wellinformed that it never was known that any person who had put himself under their protection and showed that he had confidence in them had cause to repent it or was injured by them in the most minute trifle but on the contrary they will protect him from impositions of every kind and scorn to go halves with the landlord like most other conductors and traveling servants and will defend them with their lives if there is occasion but those of their number who have enlisted themselves in the service of society are known and respected by the other banditti all over the island and the persons of those they accompany are ever held sacred for these reasons most travelers choose to hire a couple of them from town to town and may then travel over the island in safety two recent stories will serve to illustrate their character  a number of people were found digging in a place where some treasure was supposed to have been concealed during the plague this being forbidden under severe penalties they were immediately taken to prison and expected to have been treated without mercy but luckily for the rest one of these banditti happened to be of the number he wrote to the prince of villa franca and made use of such powerful arguments in their favor they were all immediately set at liberty this serves to show their consequence with the civil power the other story will give our readers a strong idea of their barbarous ferocity and the horrid mixture of stubborn vice and virtue if it may be called by that name that seems to direct their actions they have a practice of borrowing money from the country people who dare never refuse them and if they promise to pay it they have ever been found punctual and exact both as to the time and sum and would rather rob and murder an innocent person than fail of payment at the day appointed and this they have been often obliged to do in order as they say to fulfill their engagements and save their honor  it happened at the time mr brydone was at messina that the brother of one of these fellows having occasion for money and not knowing how to procure it determined to make use of his brothers name and authority an artifice which he thought would not easily be discovered he accordingly went to a country priest and told him his brother had occasion for twenty ducats which he desired he would immediately lend him the priest assured him he had not then so large a sum but that if he would return in a few days it should be ready for him the other replied that he was afraid to return to his brother with that answer and desired that he would by all means take care to keep out of his way at least till such time as he had pacified him otherwise he could not be answerable for the consequences as bad fortune would have it the priest and the robber met in a narrow road the former trembled as the latter approached and at last dropped on his knees to beg for mercy the robber astonished at his behavior desired to know the cause of it the trembling priest answered il denaro il denaro the money the money  but send your brother tomorrow and you shall have it the haughty robber assured him that he disdained taking money of a poor priest adding that if any of his brothers had been low enough to make such a demand he himself was ready to advance the sum the priest then acquainted him with the visit he had received the preceding night from his brother by his order assuring him that had he been master of the sum he should immediately have lent it well said the robber i will now convince you whether my brother or i are most to be believed you shall go with me to his house which is but a few miles off on their arrival at the door the robber called on his brother who never suspecting the discovery came immediately to the balcony but on perceiving the priest began to make excuses for his conduct the robber told him there was no excuse to be made that he only desired to know the fact whether he had gone to borrow money of that priest in his name on his saying he had the robber with deliberate coolness raised his blunderbuss to his shoulder and shot him dead and turning to the astonished priest you will now be persuaded said he that i have no intention of robbing you at least  this hero might have been one of the guards appointed to conduct mr brydone and his company on the road for the princes secretary told him that if any person should presume to impose upon him to the value of a single baioc which is a very small coin he would certainly put him to death he gave the secretary an ounce about eleven shillings on which he thanked his excellency for so he called him and declared bowing he was the most honorabilis signor he had ever met with and that if he pleased he himself would have the honor of attending him and would chastise any person who should presume to take the wall of him or affront him in the least  the guards sent with mr brydone were two of the most resolute and desperate of this gang two great drawcansir figures armed capapie with a broad hanger each two enormous pistols and a long arquebuse kept cocked and ready for action in all suspicious places where they recounted wonderful stories of robberies and murders in which they had been the principal actors they took great pains that the travelers under their escort should not pay too much taxing the bills as they thought proper so one days dinner for eleven men and feeding ten mules and horses did not amount to halfaguinea and though these guards are paid one ounce each per day they save at least onehalf of it in the bills they entertained their company with some of their feats and made no scruple of owning that they had put several people to death but added mas tutti tutti honorabilmente that is to say they did not do it in a dastardly manner nor without just provocation there possibly may be truth in their stories a number of gibbets being erected on the road in terrorem and every little baron has the power of life and death in his own domain fourandtwenty of these desperate banditti were lately seized after a strong resistance wherein several were killed on both sides and notwithstanding some were under the protection of the nobility and in their service they were all hanged  chap x on their government etc the feudal system was first introduced here by count rugiero about the middle of the eleventh century immediately after he had driven the saracens out of the island and has continued ever since he divided sicily into three parts the first by consent of his army was given to the church the second he bestowed on his officers and the third he reserved for himself  of these three branches or as they call them braccios arms he composed his parliament and the form still remains the braccio militare is composed of all the barons of the kingdom to the number of two hundred and fiftyone who are still obliged to military service their chief is the prince of butero who is hereditary president of the parliament for in conformity to the feudal government some of the great officers are still hereditary the three archbishops all the bishops abbes priors and dignified clergy amounting to near seventy form the braccio ecclesiastice the archbishop of palermo is their chief the braccio demaniale is formed by election like our house of commons there are fortythree royal cities styled demaniale that have a right to elect members every householder has a vote at this election their chief is the member for palermo who is also praeter or mayor of the city he is an officer of the highest rank and his power is very extensive inferior only to the viceroy in whose absence the greatest part of the authority devolves on him he has a company of grenadiers for his bodyguard and receives the title of excellency  the praeter with six senators who are styled patricians have the management of the civil government of the city he is appointed every year by the king or by the viceroy which is the same thing for the people do not even think of acting so that the very shadow of liberty has now disappeared as well as the substance in short all courts both civil and criminal are appointed by royal authority and all offices depend entirely on the caprice of the sovereign but they have no inquisition  the laws of sicily are scattered through a number of volumes these the king of sardinia intended to abridge and collect into one code but unfortunately was not long enough in possession of the island to accomplish this useful work but where there is an authority above law law can be of little use  the power of the viceroy is very absolute he has not only the command of all the military force in the kingdom but likewise presides with unbounded authority in all civil tribunals and being also invested with the legantine power his sway is equally great in matters of religion he has the right of nominating to all the great offices in the kingdom and confirming of all dignities both civil and ecclesiastical  in visiting the prisons a ceremony which he performs with great pomp twice a year he has the power of liberating whatever prisoners he pleases of reducing or altering their sentences their crimes and accusations having been first read over to him and that there may be some appearance of a regard to law and justice his counselor always attends him on these occasions to point out the limits of the law  the whole military force of sicily amounts at present to nine thousand five hundred men about twelve hundred of which are cavalry many of their cities and fortresses would require a very numerous garrison to defend them particularly messina syracuse or palermo but indeed the state of their fortifications is such as well as that of their artillery that were they inclined they could but make a small defense  if this island had a good navy or was in the hands of a good naval power it must command the whole trade of the levant there are several little ports at each end of it besides the great ones of trapani syracuse and messina which lie pretty near the three angles of the triangle whatever ships had passed either of these the others would be apprized of in the space of half an hour by means of signal towers which are erected all round the island to warn them against sudden invasions from the barbary coast these towers are built on every little promontory within sight of each other fires are always kept ready for lighting and a person is appointed to watch at each of them so that the whole island they say can be alarmed in the space of an hour  the sicilians have no other means says de non of borrowing on their land but of the farmers on the renewal of their leases the lands being ever entailed on the eldest son and subject to no other incumberance than annuities for the younger boys or portions for the girls the feudal laws being in as full force for the nobility in sicily as at the norman conquest which produces lawsuits for inheritances without end and enriches a swarm of lawyers who are found in crowds at palermo and who are all wealthy right being here put up to auction and justice become a branch of commerce all the money in the kingdom flows into this city through the channel of the tribunals and is again distributed among the public by the luxury of their presidents and counselors  remote from their king whom they know only by his representative the sicilians are accustomed to consider him as a pensioner whom they defraud of his due whilst they pride themselves in granting him free gifts and from time to time make experiments of disobedience with the sole view of performing an act that may assert their freedom  the sicilians have had so many sovereigns that they are accustomed to like none of them and to give the preference only to him with whom they can make the best conditions they are ever ready to receive the sovereign who establishes his authority by force or him who grants them the most favorable terms but always with the implied reserve of recurring in case of violence and tyranny to the wellknown methods of revolt sicilian vespers or others of the same nature their country furnishing them with all sorts of productions in abundance they are more difficult to reduce than any nation it being impossible to keep them in subjection by refusing them any kind of supplies they may be despoiled but can never be starved or ruined  errata vol xv page     line   for chian and valernian read chios and falernian vol xvi page   the last line but one should read thus pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas a description of the island of malta from de non brydone and others chap i of the history constitution etc malta was anciently called iberia afterward ogygia and by the greeks melite from which at last the saracens formed the appellation of malta mention is made of this island acts xxviii its length is computed at about twenty italian miles its greatest breadth twelve and its circumference sixty it is situated in the mediterranean sea eighty miles south of sicily lying in north latitude    and between    and    degrees west longitude  malta as well as sicily was long under the tyranny of the saracens from which they were both delivered about the middle of the eleventh century by the valor of the normans after which time the fate of malta commonly rested on that of sicily till the emperor charles v about    0 gave it together with the adjoining island of gozzo to the knights of st john of jerusalem who at that time had lost the island of rhodes in testimony of this concession the grand master is still obliged every year to send a falcon to the king of sicily or his viceroy and on every new succession to swear allegiance and to receive from the hands of the sicilian monarch the investiture of these two islands  unproductive in itself for it is one solid rock not covered five inches with soil the garrison and fortifications necessary for its defense were too burthensome for its successive sovereigns it became the emporium and place of refreshment for all european vessels trading in the mediterranean and fell successively under the power of every invader it required therefore a sovereignty which from its nature could only remain neuter too feeble to give umbrage to any other power and derives all it subsistence from without it was necessary also that its possessors wealthy in other countries should bring with them in specie what the island is obliged to expend in the purchase of articles of subsistence that they should be at once monks soldiers and bachelors composing one and the same family the economy of whose individual members should revert by inheritance to the accumulated mass which pays the labor and provides for the subsistence of the active inhabitants who had increased since the establishment of the order from  0000 to  0000 including the two adjoining isles of gozzo and cumino  could the sovereign then do a more politic thing than bestow it on the knights as he did by which it is become an epitome of all europe and an assemblage of the younger brothers who are commonly the best of its first families it is probably one of the best academies for politeness in this part of the globe besides where every one is entitled by law to demand satisfaction for the least breach of it people are under a necessity of being very exact and circumspect in their words and actions  all the knights and commanders have much the appearance of gentlemen and men of the world here are no characters in the extreme the ridicules and prejudices of every particular nation are by degrees softened and worn off by the familiar intercourse and collision of each other it is curious says brydone to observe the effect it produces upon various people that compose this little medley the french skip the german strut and the spanish stalk are mingled together in such small proportions that none are striking yet every one of these nations still retain something of their original chacteristic for though the parisian has in a great measure lost his assuming air the spaniard his taciturnity and solemnity the german his formality and his pride yet still you see the german the frenchman and the spaniard  this institution which is a strange compound of military and ecclesiastic has now subsisted for near seven hundred years and though one of the firstborn has long survived every other child of chivalry it possesses great riches in most of the catholic counties of europe and did so in england before the time of henry viii but that capricious tyrant seized on all their possessions when he plundered the church  the grand master who is the sovereign of this little country is chosen by a committee of twentyone nominated by seven nations three out of each nation the election must be over within three days after the death of the former grand master and during these three days scarce a soul sleeps at malta all is cabal and intrigue and most of the knights are masked to prevent their particular attachment and connexions from being known the moment the election is over every thing returns to its former channel  when we consider the credit of the work from which the following story is taken namely the wellwritten history of the order of malta by the abbe vertot our readers may possibly be pleased with a relation of it as it occurred under the grand master helion of villeneuve about the year       on this island according to the record of all the authors of that time was a crocodile of an enormous size this amphibious animal kept its abode in a hollow ground at the top of the mountain st ettienne two miles distant from the town from whence it made its appearance from time to time sheep cows and even shepherds were suddenly missed and became the prey of this monster several knights went forth to destroy it but none returned but at the commencement of the fourteenth century firearms were not invented and the skin of this animal being covered with scales was impregnable to arrows and javelins he fought to advantage and was conqueror in every combat this urged the grand master to forbid any further attempts of the knights to destroy it on pain of expulsion from the order  one only broke through this strict injunction dieudon de gozon with a heroism peculiar to the times determined once more to make the attempt notwithstanding the illfate of his brethren and the command of the grand master to the contrary choosing rather to lose his life in the conflict than suffer such a dangerous animal to exist  animated by the true spirit of chivalry gozon meditated on means to carry his design into execution and retired for that purpose to castle gozon in languedoc having observed that the crocodile had no scales upon its belly he regulated his measures accordingly  he ordered a figure of this beast to be made in wood which he carried in his mind and had it painted of the natural color this done he taught two dogs at his call to attack it about the belly whilst he stood by on horseback covered with a coat of mail and struck him often with his lance  after having practiced them in this for some months and taught his dogs perfectly gozon returned to rhodes immediately on his arrival without discovering his intent he sent his arms unnoticed to a church on the mountain of st ettienne and followed there himself attended by two servants whom gozon killing the crocodile he brought with him from france having offered up his prayers to god in the church he put on his armor mounted his horse and ordered his two servants to return to france in case he should perish in the combat and acquaint his countrymen with the disaster but in case he should fortunately wound the monster or kill him to come up to him with all expedition he then rode down the mountain accompanied by his dogs and approached the crocodiles abode with manly courage the monster appeared and ran at the knight with open mouth and eyes flaming with rage and fire gozon attempted to pierce it with his lance but without effect its scales were impenetrable he was on the point of giving him a second thrust but his horse took fright at the noise and stench of an animal he had never seen before it darted on one side he fell off and would have caused the death of his master had be not with wonderful coolness drawn his sword and assisted by his two dogs attacked the crocodile again the thrusts of his sword were as fruitless as those of his lance the monster threw him down with the stroke of his tail and the knight would inevitably have perished had not his dogs seized the crocodile by the belly and severely wounded it  this gave the knight time to rise again and to run his sword to the haft into the belly of the animal at a place where it was not covered with scales the blood ran rapidly from the wound and the monster fell mortally wounded on its back and this threw the knight on the ground again he would now have been pressed to death by the weight of the crocodile had his two servants not hastened up and drawn him from under it he was in a fit and they thought him dead but having taken the helmet from his head he opened his eyes and the first agreeable object that struck him was the death of the enemy the honor of having overcome a monster that had been the death of several of his brethren gave fresh motion to his blood and fresh elasticity to his nerves  the news of this victory and the death of the crocodile had scarce reached the town when multitudes came forth to the field of battle and the knights of malta conducted their brother in triumph to the palace of the grand master but how great was gozons astonishment when he saw the grand master approach him with anger had you forgot my order said villeneuve with the tone of a regent can you hope to escape with impunity in having offended against my commands gozon was instantly carried to prison without being suffered to say a word in his defense nor could all that the knights in general say soften villeneuves resentment the grand master called a council of war and represented to them that it was absolutely necessary to punish his disobedience which was far more injurious to the order than many such monsters like manlius the roman he insisted upon it that the conqueror should be punished for this victory  the unfortunate gozon was consequently adjudged to have forfeited the robe of the order a punishment more severe to him than death itself but the grand master after having satisfied the law so arranged matters that he was requested to grant a favor which he himself would have begged had he not been grand master at the request of the knights he restored the robe to the chevalier and loaded him with favors and the head of the monster was fixed up at one of the towngates as a monument of victory thevenot says in his travels which he published in      either that he saw it or a picture of it according to this author the jaw split to the ears his teeth and eyes were of an uncommon size the nostrils round and the color gray  we have given this account as we find it in vertot leaving it to the judgment of our readers to decide on its probability so much we find in cotemporary writers from inscriptions and other tokens of the same period that chevalier gozon had killed a great formidable animal and had acquired great honor among the people of rhodes in so doing who considered him as their deliverer this may easily be credited  the grand master gave him soon after several lucrative places to indemnify him and finding that gozon had as much prudence as valor appointed him his lieutenant convinced that a man who had so nobly ventured his life for the good of his countrymen would defend them in war against any enterpize of an enemy with equal if not still greater courage  of this renowned man we will give another anecdote still more characteristic the grand master villeneuve died in      many aspired to this important office the elder knights though resting in peace after the actions of their younger days wished for a grand master of a peaceful disposition the younger ones were of a contrary turn they coveted a keen and fiery chief who would lead them to war and give them an opportunity of acquiring glory and riches gozon was one of the competitors and on entering the council or conclave he said on my admission here i took a solemn oath to give my suffrage to the worthiest knight and propose to this exalted post the man who in my opinion has most the good of the order at heart having considered seriously on the state of christendom having taken into consideration the continual war we have to carry on against the infidels in a word having impartially considered that firmness of character which a grand master ought to be possessed of in order to support the laws with respect to counteract every disorder in the state and show an intrepidity in the most dangerous situations i having weighed all this in my mind i declare it to be my opinion that no one can fill this post better than  myself gozon then enlarged in a very eloquent speech on his own merits and virtues the combat with the monster was not forgotten but he particularly brought to mind his conduct whilst he was lieutenant to the grand master you already know continued he my manner of governing  you know what you have to expect from me  and you know also that you cannot without injustice deny me your votes the surprised assembly acknowledged his merits and chose him grand master unanimously  since this time it has been the custom to ask for the grand mastership of malta without having killed a monster  the grand master of malta is called serene highness and eminence he has the disposal of all lucrative places makes whom he pleases of his council and in all the councils that compose the jurisdiction of this little nation he presides himself and has two votes he has the disposal of twentyone commendaries worth upwards of l  000 a year and one priory every five years and as there are always a number of competitors and expectants he is very much crushed he is always a priest and esteems his situation the most eminent a private individual can obtain except the papacy in short says brydone he is more absolute and possesses more power than most sovereign princes his household attendance and court are all very princely and yet says de non he is only what a consul was at rome an archon at athens and what a landman now is in switzerland but he has a privy council where every matter to be discussed must be proposed by the grand master so that unless he sees he can carry his point he is silent and of course absolute notwithstanding this he may not be so happy surrounded by ambitious pretenders his court is a prey to intrigue and his territory is so limited that he can never remove far from his tomb toward which he will hasten though a thousand of his brotherhood regret that his approaches are so slow nay when within his palace under ties to all the sovereigns of europe who grant unmeaning honors to his flag and without a force sufficient to act the part of a neutral power he is continually reduced to the necessity of making apologies and to atone for every seeming offense to those princes who demand it and in his own country surrounded with fortifications with mortars and with cannon this unfortunate sovereign is perpetually on the defense against intestine cabals conspiracies and revolts and cannot have a moments ease  the landforce of malta is equal to the number of men in the island fit to bear arms they have about five hundred regulars belonging to the ships of war and one hundred and fifty compose the guard of the prince the two islands of malta and gozzo contain about one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants the men are exceedingly robust and hardy and will row standing shoving the handle of the oars from them for ten or twelve hours without intermission  their navy consists of four galleys three galliots four ships of sixty guns and a frigate of thirtysix besides a number of quick sailing little vessels called scampairas or runaways their ships galleys and fortifications are not only well supplied with excellent artillery but they have invented an ordnance of their own unknown to all the world besides their very rocks are cut into artillery being hollowed out in many places in the form of vast mortars the charge of which is said to be a barrel of gunpowder on which they place a lage piece of wood made exactly to fit the mouth of the chamber on this they heap a great quantity of cannon balls shells or other deadly materials and when an enemys ship approaches the harbor they fire the whole into the air making a shower for two or three hundred yards round that would sink any vessel  brydone has just seen the naval force of malta in its greatest gala it was the departure of a maltese squadron to assist the french against the bey of tunis who had offended the french king by refusing to deliver up without ransom the corsican slaves that were taken before the french were in possession of that island the squadron consisted of three galleys the largest with nine hundred men each of the others with seven hundred three galliots and several scampairas these immense bodies were all worked by oars and moved with great regularity the admiral went first and the rest in order according to their dignity the sea was crowded with boats it was a fine evening and the ramparts and fortifications were filled with company the port resounded on all sides with the discharge of heavy artillery announced by the galleys and galliots as they left the harbor and as the echo here is uncommonly great it had a very noble effect there were about thirty knights in each galley making signals all the way to their mistresses who were weeping for their departure upon the bastions  notwithstanding the supposed bigotry of the maltese the spirit of toleration is so strong that they have suffered the turks their sworn enemies to erect a mosque and punish any who disturb them  perhaps malta is the only country where duelling is permitted by law for as their establishment originated in chivalry they appear in some points to keep it up though they so restrict this toleration as greatly to lessen its danger the duelists are obliged to fight in one particular street of the city and are obliged under severe censure to put up their swords when ordered so to do by a woman a priest or a knight but even this does not prevent bloodshed a cross is always painted on the wall opposite to the spot where a knight has been killed in a duel and this is in commemoration of his fall brydone says he counted about twenty of such crosses  brydone says about three months before he was there two knights had a dispute at a billiard table one of them after a great deal of abusive language gave the other a blow and to the astonishment of all malta after so great an affront absolutely refused to fight his antagonist  the challenge was repeated he had time to reflect on the consequences and still refused for this he was condemned to make the amend honorable in the great church for fortyfive days successively then to be confined to a dark dungeon for five years and after this to remain a prisoner for life the unfortunate young man who received the blow was also in disgrace not having had an opportunity of wiping it out in the blood of his adversary  chap ii of the island its productions people etc mr brydone and his company approached malta by sea having passed from sicily in a sixoared shallow boat scarce able to hold six persons besides the rowers but the sea in the channel between the two islands being pretty calm at certain seasons it is the only vessel that passes it  the aspect of the country says he is far from pleasing the whole being as i observed on a rock of freestone thinly covered with earth yet their crops in general were abundant owing to the dews that fall during the spring and summer months and their corn and cotton looked well it was then in the beginning of the month of june their barley harvest was then over and they were just finishing that of wheat all the corn grown in the island will support the people but five months the crop they must depend on is the cotton they begin sowing in the middle of may finish in the middle of june and reap in october and beginning of november  the cottonplant rises to the height of eighteen inches and is covered with a number of nuts or pods full of cotton these when ripe they cut off every morning before the sun rises as the suns heat turns it yellow they manufacture this into a variety of stuffs and very fine stockings some have been sold for ten sequins a pair near seven pounds ten shillings english their worsteds and blankets are esteemed all over europe the chief manufactures are at gozzo small quantities of the sugarcane are here cultivated the maltese oranges are reckoned the finest in the world the trees are covered with fruit from november till the middle of june they are red oranges the juice is red as blood being the common orangebud grafted on the pomegranate stock the greatest part of this crop is sent as presents to crownedheads and to the relations of the knights  the industry of the maltese in cultivating their little island is inconceivable there is not an inch of ground lost in any part of it and where the soil failed they have covered the stone with earth brought from sicily in ships and boats the whole island is full of enclosures of freestone which in summer reflects so much light and heat as to be very troublesome to the eyes  the island is covered with countryhouses and villages besides the towns which they call cities though there are only two the valetta and the citta vecchia that deserve that name every little village has a noble church elegantly finished and adorned with marble statues rich tapestry and a profusion of silver plate they are says brydone by much the handsomest churches i ever saw  the city of valetta stands upon a peninsula between two of the finest ports in the world which are defended by almost impregnable fortifications that on the southwest side of the city is the largest is scarce a quarter of a mile broad at the mouth commanded on each side by batteries that would tear the strongest ship to pieces before she could enter besides a plan of the city of malta  references    o st    womens hospital   magis palace   st mary magdalen   the     prison   st  chapel    church and

carden a city valette b lower town c lasencle town d the bormola e victorause city   map of malta it is fronted by a quadruple battery one above another the largest of which is on a level with the water within the mouth the harbor widens into a beautiful basin running up two miles into the heart of the island divided into five distinct harbors all equally safe each capable of containing an immense number of shipping the soundings are here so very deep and surrounded by such high grounds and fortifications that the largest ships of war may ride here almost without a cable in the roughest weather these batteries are mounted with about eighty of their heaviest artillery and the harbor of course may be considered as impregnable the turks have ever found it so  the harbor on the north side of the city although only used for fishing and as a place of quarantine would in any other part of the world be considered as inestimable it is ably defended by very strong works and in the center of the basin is an island on which is built a castle and a lazaretto  the fortifications of malta are indeed a most stupenduous work all the boasted catacombs of rome and naples are a trifle to the immense excavations that have been made in this little island the ditches of a vast size are all cut out of a solid rock these extend for many miles and raise our astonishment to think that so small a state has been ever able to make them  one side of the island is so completely fortified by nature that there was nothing left for art the rock is of a great height and absolutely perpendicular from the sea for several miles yet even on this side there are still the vestiges of several ancient roads with the tracks of carriages worn deep in the rocks these roads are now terminated by the precipices with the sea beneath and clearly show that in former ages this island has been much larger than it is indeed it has often been observed to have been affected by the irruption of mount aetna which may be clearly seen from this they reckon the distance near two hundred italian miles and the people declare that during the irruption the whole island is illuminated and from the reflection in the water there appears a great track of fire in the sea all the way from malta to sicily the thundering of the mountain is also distinctly heard  the city of valetta is built upon a hill none of the streets except the key are level they are all paved with white freestone which creates a great dust and by its glare burts the eyes of the people there are two good inns in the town beautiful and spacious flights of stone steps conduct to large streets perfectly strait and well paved the houses are built of free stone and continue so beautifully white as to look like new in short on approaching the harbor the superb prospect within its innumerable forts and its two towns the old and the new built in an amphitheatre gives it an appearance and renders it more magnificent than any other city in the world every edifice public and private is remarkably well built and the whole seems founded on vast and noble bastions  the principal public buildings are the palace the infirmary the arsenal the hotels of the seven tongues of the great church of st john  the palace is a noble though plain structure and the grand master is more comfortably lodged than any prince in europe except the king of sardinia st johns is a magnificent church the pavement is reckoned the richest in the world it is entirely composed of sepulchral monuments of the finest marbles porphyry lapis lazuli and a variety of other valuable stones admirably joined together at an incredible expense representing in a kind of mosaic the arms insignia etc of the persons they commemorate there are but two inns as i have observed in this city the falcon and the three kings the accommodations are good the treatment civil and the entertainment of the best for halfacrown a day each  no spot on earth can be more fortunate and more fertile than sicily none can be more unfruitful more barren or more wretchedly situated says de non than malta in sicily crops of every kind are produced and though they rapidly succeed and press upon each other the peasant there is poor languid and disgustingly dirty at malta the farmer can force from the soil a little corn and cotton yet poverty there is so active so industrious and so neat that it has the air only of abstinence large breeches and a shirt of blue linen a broad sash and the arms and feet left naked form the whole description of the light dress and ornaments of the maltese their features and complexion are as arabian as their language interesting and artful in all their bargains they are scupulously faithful in fulfilling every contract which renders all commercial intercourse with them safe and easy the women are exempted from every kind of labor which is entirely performed by the men even to the most trivial housholdwork in imitation of the levantine and eastern customs it seems as if they limited the use of the sex to the sole department of pleasure though under a burning sky they possess the fair skin of the inhabitants of the north with the impassioned expression of the orientals their beauty is neither grecian nor majestic but is not on that account the less seducing with fine complexions which they carefully preserve they have almost all of them large eyes in which love seems to lie in ambush beneath their long eyelids that gives them a pleasing air of languor not a little resembling modesty those of the country are said to be faithful to their husbands but the women of the city know no more how to resist the gold of baillis than the amorous sighs of the youthful knights and we accordingly find at malta the utmost licentiousness of celibacy their cresses display more of coquetry than magnificence elegance and neatness constitute their luxury they have a custom of shaving themselves like the men but then it is with so much art that you must come very close to them to discover the voluptuous effect of this practice this operation they perform very dexterously with broken glass  the  th of june is held as a thanksgiving for their deliverance from a terrible conspiracy that was formed between thirty and forty years ago by the turkish slaves at one stroke to put an end to the whole order of malta all the fountains of the palace were to be poisoned and every slave had taken a solemn oath to put his master to death  it was discovered by a jew who kept a coffeehouse he understood the turkish language and overhearing some discourse he thought suspicious went and informed the grand master the suspected persons were instantly seized and put to the torture and soon confessed the whole the executions were shocking one hundred and twentyfive were put to death by various torments some were burned alive some were broken on the wheel and some torn to pieces by four galleys rowing different ways and each bringing off its limb since that time the slaves have been more narrowly watched and have less liberty than formerly  the horseraces of malta are of a very uncommon kind performed without either saddle bridle whip or spur and yet the horses run full speed and afford much diversion they are accustomed to the ground for some weeks before and though it is entirely over rock and pavement there are seldom any accidents they have races of asses and mules performed in the same manner four times a year the rider is only furnished with a weapon like a shoemakers awl to push on his courser if he is lazy  the ancient city of melita stands nearly in the center of the island and from its high situation commands a view of the whole and in clear weather they say of part of barbary and sicily it is strongly fortified and governed by an officer called the hahem the cathedral is a fine church exceedingly large and was hung when brydone was there with crimson damask richly laced with gold  not far from the old city is a small church dedicated to st paul and just by the church a miraculous statue of the saint with a viper in his hand supposed to be placed on the very spot on which the house stood where he was received after his shipwreck on this island and where he shook the viper off his hand into the fire without being hurt by it at which time the maltese say the saint cursed all the venomous animals of the island and banished them for ever as st peter healed those of his favorite isle whether this be the cause or not there are no venomous animals in malta and the people say that vipers have been brought from sicily and died almost immediately on their arrival  adjoining the church there is the celebrated grotto in which st paul was imprisoned it is very damp and produces a whitish kind of stone which they aver when reduced to powder is a sovereign remedy in many diseases boxes of it are sent annually to sicily italy the levant and the east indies and what is considered as a standing miracle notwithstanding this consumption it has never been exhausted nor ever sensibly diminished the saint always taking care to supply them with a fresh quantity the day following it is something like magnesia in look and taste they give a teaspoonful to children in fevers and the smallpox which produces a copious sweat about an hour after and never fails they say to be of service it is esteemed a certain remedy against the bite of all venomous animals there is a very fine statue of st paul in the middle of this grotto to which is ascribed great power st paul after his shipwreck continued in this island three months and preached the gospel  the catacombs not far from this city are a great work they are said to extend fifteen miles under ground many people they say have been lost in tracing them for branching out into so many parts they could not find their way back the passages or galleries are so very narrow that only one person can pass at a time but they are well finished and well preserved  the grand masters country palace is represented as an extensive place with fine hunting in the woods but in fact it only contains a few scattered trees and about halfadozen deers yet this being the only thing like a wood in the island it is esteemed a great curiosity the palace is as poor a thing and the furniture three or four hundred years old in the most gothic taste but the grand master never resides here  great source of water that supplies the city of valetta takes its rise near this place and is conveyed by an aqueduct of some thousand arches the carriages to pass from one part of the island to another are coaches drawn by one mule the only kind of vehicle they have  indeed you here go out of town without finding the country for what is so called is as much covered with buildings as the city and seems as strongly fortified by large continued walls which hold up or incase the little earth there is naturally in the island or what is brought or fabricated there for by breaking the soft soil and mixing it with earth and rolling it the indefatigable maltese compose a soil fit for cotton and they abandon almost every other species of culture for this which by its sale supplies the want of every other production  the grand master has lately laid the foundation of a museum to be the property of the order as is the library which is considerable they have found some marble basreliefs here roman works which appear says de non to be portraits among these is a head of ciceros daughter  the isle of gozzo has been imagined by many of our modern antiquaries to have been the island of calypso but this opinion has been some years out of fashion and though there is nothing at malta which in the least resembles the description of that island by homer and fenelon they have now transferred the residence of that amorous nymph there and placed her palace at the bottom of the harbor of la melleha here are a number of romantic characters cut out of the rock more like hermits cells than any other thing and yet they call one of these calypsos dressing room it is possible for imagination to destroy all that now exists and suppose things to exist which never could exist yet still it is imagination after all and nothing else  the greeks undoubtedly had settlements at gozzo for some coins of gozzo itself are found representing a head of diana with a crescent over it and on the other side a soldier armed with a sword and buckler in the action of attack    a map of the popes territories from monsr danville map of papal holdings  a description of the popes territories from busching keysler moore martyn grosley sherlock sharp millar piozzi barretti and others chap i situation extent and general view the dominions of the holy see compose what the italians call stato della chiesa and are bounded on the north by the territories of the states of venice by the adriatic sea on the northeast by naples on the southeast by the tuscan sea on the southwest by tuscany on the northwest and by the duchies of modena and mantua on the west which it encompasses on three sides  these dominions consist of the compagna of rome st peters patrimony the duchies of castro spoletto and urbino the marquisate of ancona the sabinese the romagna which comprehends the bolognese and duchy of ferrara the perrugin and the territory of orvieto besides these provinces the duchy of benevento in the kingdom of naples and the county of avignon in the south of france belong to the pope  the greatest length of this country may be about two hundred and forty italian miles as to the breadth from civita vecchia to ancona is about one hundred and thirty miles but in many other places it is not near so broad and in some parts is scarce twenty miles  on considering that the popes dominions generally consist of a very fertile and excellent soil that his harbors both on the adriatic and mediterranean seas are very advantageously situated for trade that he receives considerable sums from other parts that his country is visited by numbers of foreigners who spend a great deal of money in it and that on account of the supposed sanctity of his person and character his government should seem best calculated for the welfare of his subjects one would be apt to imagine that of all states this ought to be the most flourishing were not the reverse manifest  the country is but ill cultivated and very poor and thin of inhabitants the city of bologna alone excepted trade and manufactures are totally stagnant and did not the bounty of providence furnish the inhabitants with dates almonds figs olives fruits and such like products of the earth growing spontaneously and without any culture and deal out to them bread and wine at the expense of very little labor their sloth would absolutely starve them  their little inclination and spirit for work is not to be wondered at because they are conscious that if they have much much will be taken from them and in the end nothing will be left them the many holidays which are such an impediment to trade and business the great number of young sturdy beggars strolling about and burthening the inhabitants under the appearance of pilgrims the many hospitals which confirm the people in idleness the multitude of convents that hinder the increase of inhabitants the inconceivable wealth of churches and convents which lie dormant without the least advantage to the public the inquisition which will not permit the want of the inhabitants to be supplied by those of another religion are some great causes of the wretched condition of the papal dominions though there are others attended with still worse consequences  no government equals the papal in rigor the temporal sword being not the only one used but also on several occasions the spiritual or inquisition besides nothing is so monstrous as the passion by which popes cardinals and other great prelates have been carried away for enriching and promoting their nephews and relations and nothing is so vain as the ambition of gaining for themselves a great name by founding convents and churches the regulars vie with each other in the number splendour and riches of their churches and chapels but it is from the sweat of the poor inhabitants that the money is generally extracted for the support of this frivolous rivalship the legates governors and other inferior officers in the provinces knowing that the time of holding their charge is short and uncertain scruple no kind of rapaciousness by collating these causes it will no longer be a subject of surprise if in all parts of europe there is not a more wretched people than the popes temporal subjects  the campagna of rome

pope the others are governed by legates and vicegerents this territory anciently called latium is blessed with a very fruitful soil but for want of cultivation the inhabitants are wretchedly poor delicious plains are seen in it with scarce so much as a village so that the few inhabitants it contains in order to get in their harvest are under the necessity of employing the peasants of the adjoining districts it is said on a very moderate computation that there were more inhabitants in the campagna of old rome than are at present in all italy yet this spot is now accounted so unwholesome and so pestilential that no no traveller not even an italian will sleep there if he can avoid it  chap ii of the city of rome rome the metropolis of the dominions of the pope and anciently the whole roman empire derives its name according to some ancient writers from roma a trojan lady but according to others from romulus the founder there are some who affirm it was called roma before the days of romulus and that he only enlarged the city and it was called after his name as princes and great men are to this day named from the places of their residence others reject the story of romulus and remus as fabulous and indeed nothing satisfactory is to be met with on this subject any more than as to the era of its foundation some writers affirming it was founded in the year of the world   0  or     years before christ and others in the year       this city is situated on the river tyber about sixteen miles northeast of the tuscan sea in    degrees and    minutes of north latitude and thirtytwo degrees odd minutes to the eastward of london  the city of rome has suffered so much from the ancient gauls vandals heruli ostro and visigoths and lastly from the german troops especially in the year      under charles of bourbon that besides smaller damages it is computed to have been pillaged seven times others affirm that rome was plundered twelve times this however is certain that the surface of the ground the city stands upon must have been altered by such frequent ravages at present it is difficult to distinguish the seven hills on which rome was anciently built the low grounds having been filled up by the ruins of whole streets so that sometimes it is scarce observable that we are ascending an eminence celebrated by the ancients antiquity informs us that the ascent from the street into the pantheon or rotunda consisted of thirteen steps whereas now the whole area about it is on a level with the pavement of that temple it is very common by digging deep for the foundation of houses etc to find pillars statues and the fragments of ancient buildings and in some places parts of the pavement of the old city have been found to be twenty or thirty feet below the present surface of the ground it is probable that this must also have occasioned great alteration with regard to the salubrity of the air  the stupendous cloacoe or common shores and aqueducts by which the filth and dirt of the ancient city were conveyed into the cloaca maxima have indeed many openings remaining for the passage of the soil and water but most of the outlets are stopped and the cloaca maxima itself is in very bad order this must necessarily cause a putrefaction in the air which is sensibly perceived by those who dig deep into the earth and happen to light on the aperture of such obstructed sink or shore there being many instances of workmen losing their lives by those putrid effluviae the same alterations are likewise manifest in the country anciently several parts of italy near the sea were not only full of fine towns villas and palaces but resorted to as the most healthy places in time of pestilence but now it is quite the reverse for the greatest part of the seacoast is moist and marshy and the air so bad that during the summerheats many convents are uninhabited and the monks remove for some months to a healthier climate even in the neighborhood of rome the soil is but badly cultivated and in the nightime covered with fogs and igneous vapors these must have been very uncommon in the time of the ancient romans for livy frequently mentions such phoenomena as prodigies and omens which occasioned propitiatory sacrifice and offerings sulphur is usually dug up like white earth at rome and afterward purified by sublimation great quantities of vitriol are also made here and the green found in the copper mines is particularly called roman vitriol roch alum is also prepared within a small distance of rome and in some places arsenic is made these are works which necessarily produce very noxious effluvia from which ancient rome was free for these minerals were then either unknown or at least not dug up  it is probable a concurrence of all these causes may have occasioned that alteration of weather which has been observed with regard to the mildness of the winters in this climate some passages in homer show that in his time the snow often lay very deep in the streets of rome and it is plain from the sixth satyr of juvenal that it was far from being unusual to see the tyber frozen in winter but in the present age it must be a very sharp winter if the snow lays in rome but a day or two as for the tyber it has not been frozen in the memory of any man living  the river also has suffered by the alteration of the countries through which it takes its course its mouth where it disembogues itself into the sea is become very narrow and choked with sandbanks and its bed by the rubbish of houses on its banks very much contracted which in a strong south wind causes inundations that do great damage both in the city and the neighboring country  in regard to its present extent and number of inhabitants several cities may be found both in europe and other parts of the world superior to modern rome but if we consider its ancient power and its sovereignty over so many powerful nations for such a series of years the whole world never produced its equal the remains of the ancient walls and buildings of the city demonstrate that for its vast circumference it might justly be classed among the principal cities in the world according to pliny the city walls in vespasians time were thirteen thousand paces in circumference and vossius who wrote in aureliuss time magnifies them to fifty thousand this must either be a notorious error in the transcriber or such a circuit must have included the seats and gardens in the neigbourhood of rome what vossius in his varioe observationes endeavors to prove is very weak and absurd for he fain would persuade his readers that rome was twenty times as large as paris and london put together that neros palace alone occupied more ground than the greatest of our modern european cities that the number of slaves in rome amounted to eight millions and the inhabitants in general to fourteen millions whoever gives credit to these bare assertions should not dispute with him when he affirms the inhabitants of nanquin a single city in china to be above twenty millions these exaggerations are still far short of rolefincks who computes the inhabitants of rome in her highest prosperity at twentyseven millions  nay such is the infatuation of lipsius to magnifying the extent of rome and the number of its inhabitants says keysler that he does not scruple to alter and falsify such passages in ancient writers as make against his chimeras and blindly follows the most absurd and extravagant assertions of the greeks who were remarkable for their flattery to the romans was ever any thing more ridiculous than what the orator aristides says of rome in adrians time it is so large says this writer that in any part of it a person may always with some reason think himself in the center of it so that a whole year is not sufficient to enumerate other cities that are as it were included in this celestial city whole nations as capadocians scythians and others having in numberless multitudes at once settled in rome this boast however can relate only to the few quarters or wards where some individuals of those nations used chiefly to live vespasians amphitheatre was about one hundred and fifty feet in height yet ammianus marcelinus is pleased to say that its height is scarce discernable by human eyes  authors says moore differ very much in opinion with respect to the number of inhabitants which rome contained at the period when it was most populous some accounts make them seven millions he adds and others a much greater number these seem all to be incredible exaggerations it is not probable that what is properly called the city of rome ever extended beyond the wall built by bellisarius after he had defeated the goths this wall has been frequently repaired since and is still standing it is about thirteen or fourteen miles in circuit which is nearly the size that rome was of in the days of vespasian those who assert that the number of inhabitants in ancient rome when it was most populous could not exceed a million exclusive of slaves are thought moderate in their calculation but when we consider that the circumference of thirteen or fourteen miles is not equal to that of either paris or london that the campus martius which is the best built part of modern rome was a field without a house upon it anciently and that the rising ground where st peters church and the vatican stand was no part of old rome it will be difficult to conceive that ever rome could boast a million of inhabitants if the wall of bellisarius be admitted as the boundary of the ancient city it is not easy to imagine that it could have at any time contained above five or six hundred thousand without supposing the masters of the world to have been the worst lodged people in it  but if in the computations abovementioned the suburbs are included if those who lived without the walls are considered as inhabitants in that case there will be room enough for any number the limits of the suburbs not being ascertained  the buildings immediately without the walls of rome which were connectedly continued so as to merit the name of suburbs were certainly of vast extent and with the inhabitants of the town itself must have contained a prodigious number of people by a calculation made by mr byres the circus maximus was of sufficient size to accommodate three hundred and eighty thousand spectators and we are told by the latin poets that it was usually full now if allowance be made for the superannuated the sick and the infirm also for children and those employed in their private business and for slaves who were not permitted to remain in the circus during the games mr byres imagines that such a number could not be supplied by a city and suburbs the number of whose inhabitants were much under three millions  whatever may have been the extent of the suburbs of rome it is probable they were only formed of ordinary houses and inhabited by people of inferior rank there are no remains of palaces or magnificent buildings of any kind to be now seen near the walls or indeed over the whole campagna yet it it is asserted by some authors that this wide surface was peopled at one period like a continued village and we are told of strangers who viewing this immense plain covered with houses imagined they had already entered rome when they were thirty miles from the walls of that city  though this city is thought now not to contain above one hundred and sixty or seventy thousand inhabitants a number greatly inferior to what it contained in the days of its ancient power yet this number is greater than it has generally been able to boast since the fall of the empire there is good authority for believing that rome at particular periods since that time some of them not very remote has been reduced to between thirty and forty thousand inhabitants the numbers have gradually increased during the whole of this century as it was much less expensive to purchase new ground for building upon than to clear away ruins which by time had acquired the consistence of rock great part of the modern city is built upon what was the ancient campus martius  the river tyber divides the city properly so called from the transtevere or quarter in which is the church of st peter and the palace of the vatican this river is about three hundred and fifteen feet wide at the bridge of st angelo and is navigable for large barges the water is yellow and turbid  many are of opinion that by turning this river out of its channel for a time vast riches and valuable antiquities thrown into it at different times when the city has been sacked and pillaged would be found the water of this river says keysler is so thick and foul that it is not fit for horses to drink till it has stood two or three days for the filth to subside  there are now three bridges at rome that of st angelo anciently pons aelius leading to the castle of st angelo is the principal all the upper part of it is finished by bernini in a good taste but the statues on it are heavy and disagreeable ancient rome had six bridges there are some small remains of the sublician bridge which was only one when horatius cocles defended it so valiantly it was then of wood but afterward built of stone by lepidus  the ruins of the triumphal bridge near s angelo is an object that cannot but strike a man of letters this was the bridge over which every general marched into the city to whom a triumph was decreed either for the conquest of a province or any other signal victory from the time of romulus to that of the emperor probus there were about three hundred and twenty of these triumphs there are now only a few remains of the piers who can behold this scene without ruminating on the nature of the human heart and recollecting to what trials it must have been exposed in the course of so proud and so flattering a procession  a traveller says sharp on his arrival at rome is not much animated by its appearance the narrowness of many of the streets the thinness of inhabitants the prodigious quantity of monks and beggars give but a gloomy aspect to this renowned city there are no rich tradesmen in it who by their acquisitions either ennoble their sons or marry their daughters into the houses of princes all the shops seem empty and the shopkeepers poor not one hackneycoach in so large a town a proof that there is no middle station between those who always ride and those who always walk this is the first impression but let the eye be turned from that point of view to the magnificence of their churches to the venerable remains of ancient rome to the prodigious collection of pictures and antique statues to the very river and ground itself formerly the habitation of that people which from our cradles we have been taught to admire and with a very few grains of enthusiasm he will be more than delighted  the magnificence of the roman emperors in embellishing the city rose to such a height that they ransacked all the quarries of egypt for alabaster granite porphyry and every kind of marble that country afforded and though time and gothic rage must have destroyed great quantities yet such was the profusion brought to rome that besides the infinite number of columns statues vases and tables still preserved entire one may see the very posts in the streets all of them without exception made of granite alabaster or marble but the most stupendous sight of all are the monstrous obelisks which consist of only one piece of marble i meditate on these objects says sharp till i am lost in wonder and confusion we have no idea of the mechanical powers by which they are dug out of the quarry and brought from egypt we are astonished at the enormous size of the stones at stonehenge cannot comprehend by what contrivance they were carried and laid in that form but the biggest of them is small when compared to the largest obelisk at rome  in the beauty and magnificence of the religious buildings and palaces says busching modern rome by far surpasses the ancient having a multitude of splendid churches stately palaces and large houses the parish churches alone amount to eighty together with upwards of thirty almshouses most of the houses are of brick but those of the better sort have the doors windows and supporters of freestone above twothirds of the houses are the property of the churches and convents to which new purpurchases are continually annexed the streets are well paved and some of them with brick but neither kept clean nor carefully illuminated  london seems to be the only town in europe where that convenience is rightly understood and carried effectually into execution for at paris the candles in their brown glass lanterns give but little light whilst they burn and being small are soon extinguished it is astonishing this evil should not be reformed as every nights experience shows how much darkness invites to the perpetration of shameful and atrocious deeds the cardinals are allowed to take flambeaux behind their coaches all their princes and people of quality are forbidden to use any other light than small lanterns of which every footman behind the coach carries one  nothing can be more magnificent than the entrance into rome by the porta del popolo the road is fine the approach beautiful and the gate handsome the traveller immediately enters a large area from the farther side of which he sees the three principal streets of the city diverging and flanked by the fronts of two handsome churches in the middle is a noble egyptian obelisk and a fountain the numerous gates of the city are by no means handsome or ornamented the flaminean gate or porta del popolo is the best of them the outside by buonarotti and that next the city by bernini  some of the principal streets are of considerable length and perfectly straight that called the corso is most frequented it runs from the porto del popolo along the side of the campus martius here the nobility display their equipages during the carnival and take the air in the evenings in fine weather it is indeed the great scene of roman magnificence and amusement  the shops on each side are three or four feet higher than the street and there is a path for the convenience of footpassengers on a level with the shop the palaces of which there are several in this street range in a line with the houses having no court before them like the hotels of paris and are not shut up from the sight of the citizens by high and gloomy walls like devonshire and burlington houses in london such dismal barricades are more suitable to the unsociable character of a proud baron in the days of aristocratic tyranny than to the hospitable and benevolent disposition of their present proprietors  the corso commences at the fine area immediately within the porto del popolo this gate is built in a noble style of elegant simplicity from the design of michael angelo executed by bernini  the strada felice in the higher part of the city is about a mile and a half in length from the trinita del monte to the church of st john lateran on the pincean hill this street runs all in one line the view only interrupted by the fine church of st maria maggiora the strada felice is crossed by another straight street called the strada di porta pia considerably above a mile in length terminated at one end by that gate and at the other by four colossal statues in white marble of two horses led by two men supposed by some to be representations of alexander taming bucephalus and according to others of castor and pollux they are placed before the popes palace on the quirinal hill and have a noble effect  it would be more difficult to convey an idea of the smaller and less regular streets we shall therefore only observe in general that rome at present exhibits a strange mixture of magnificent and interesting and of common and beggarly objects the former consists of palaces churches and fountains and above all of the remains of antiquity the latter comprehends all the rest of the city  there are many squares in rome the principal ornaments of which are fountains that in the piazza novana is the most magnificent in the whole world it is a vast rock pierced through and through so as to be divided into four parts which unite at the top where the obelisk is placed toward the bottom of each part of the rock is seated a colossal figure representing the principal rivers with their attributes the fountain of paul v is in a very bad style but the water is so rapid as to turn several mills it was brought by augustus from the lake of bracciano thirtyfive miles from rome to supply his naumachia and there are now some remains of the aqueduct near the villa pamsili the fontana di trevi is a noble fountain this is the only water which now comes to rome by an ancient aqueduct it is chiefly under ground which is the reason that it has been so much better preserved than any other this is also the best water in rome and all the lower parts of the city being furnished from the fountain of trevi those who prefer good water to good air live in those parts it was brought from the sabina by agrippa to supply the campus martius  these fountains are the remains of the munificence and industry of the ancient romans who were extremely delicate in the article of water but great applause however is also due to the different popes who have been at the expense of restoring and repairing those noble channels of health pleasure and convenience this great plenty of water nevertheless has not induced the romans to be cleanly their streets and even their palaces are disgraced with filth the noble piazza novana though adorned with three or four fountains one of which the most magnificent perhaps that europe can produce is notwithstanding this provision almost as dirty as west smithfield where the cattle are sold in london the corridors arcades and even staircases belonging to their most elegant palaces are depositories of nastiness and indeed in summer smell as strong as spirits of hartshorn it is highly probable their ancestors were not much more cleanly if we consider that the cities and suburbs of rome in the reign of claudius contained about seven millions of inhabitants a number at least equal to the sum total of all the souls in england that great part of ancient rome was allotted to temples porticos basilicae theaters baths circuses public and private walks and gardens where very few if any of this great number lodged that by far the greater part of these inhabitants were slaves and did not enjoy the conveniences of life and that the use of linen was scarce known we must naturally conclude they were strangely crowded together and that in general they were a very frowzy generation that they were crowded together appears from the height of their houses which the poet rutilius compared to towers made for scaling heaven in order to remedy this inconvenience augustus caesar published a decree that for the future no houses should be built above seventy feet high which at a moderate computation might make six stories but what seems beyond all dispute to prove that the ancients were dirty creatures are these two particulars vespasian laid a tax upon urine and ordure on pretense of being at great expense in clearing the streets from such a nuisance an imposition which amounted to about fourteenpence a year for each individual and when heliogabalus ordered all the cobwebs of the city and suburbs to be collected they were found to weigh ten thousand pounds this was intended as a demonstration of the great number of inhabitants but it was proof of their dirt rather than of their popularity to this we may likewise add the delicate custom of taking vomits at each others houses when they were invited to dinner or supper that they might prepare their stomach for gormandizing a beastly proof of their nastiness as well as gluttony horace in his description of the banquet of nasidenus says that when the canopy under which they sat fell down it brought along with it as much dirt as is raised by a hard gale of wind in dry weather  i believe adds smollett the moderns retain more of the customs of the ancient romans than is generally imagined when i first saw the infants at the foundling hospital in paris so swathed with bandages that the very sight of them made my eyes water i little dreamed that the prescription of the ancients could be pleaded for this custom equally shocking and absurd but in the capital at rome i met with the antique statue of a child emaillote exactly in the same manner rolled up like an egyptian mummy from the feet the circulation of the blood in such a case must be obstructed on the whole surface of the body and nothing at liberty but the head which is the only part that ought to be confined is it not surprising that common sense should not point out even to the most ignorant that these bandages must heat the tender infant into a fever must hinder the return of the muscles and the play of the joints so necessary to health and nutrition and that while the refluent blood is obstructed in the veins which run on the surface of the body the arteries which lie deep without the reach of compression are continually pouring their contents into the head where the blood meets with no resistance the vessels of the brain are naturally lax and the very futures of the skull are yet open what are the consequences of this cruel swaddling the limbs are wasted the joints grow rickety the brain is compressed and a hydrocephalus with a great head and sore eyes ensues this abominable custom is perhaps one great cause of the bandy legs diminutive bodies and large heads so frequent in the south of france and italy  i was no less surprised to find the modern fashion of curling the hair borrowed in a great measure from the coxcombs and coquettes of antiquity i saw a bust of nero in the gallery at florence the hair represented in rows of buckles like that of a french petitmaitre conformable to the picture drawn of him by suetonius but there is a bust in the capital of julia pia the second wife of septimus severus with a moveable peruke dressed exactly in the fashionable mode with this difference that there is no part of it frizzed nor is there any appearance of pomatum and powder these improvements the beau monde have borrowed from the natives of the cape of good hope  in a part of the city across the tyber dwelt the transtyberini or transteveri the descendants as they call themselves of the ancient romans this people were once called other people of rome but intermarry among themselves their features are very different from the rest of the inhabitants of rome and they are as distinguishable by their common oaths as by their other customs a transtyberinian will swear by the head of bacchus and the body of jove when other inhabitants of rome will swear by the blood of christ and by the several saints there is a prince and several noblemen of this fraternity  modern rome does not cover more than one third of the space within the walls and those parts that were most frequented of old are now entirely abandoned from the capital to the column there is nothing entire but one or two churches built with the fragments of ancient edifices you descend from the capitol between the remaining pillars of two temples the pedestals and part of the shafts sunk in the rubbish then passing through the triumphal arch of septimus severus you proceed along the fort of mons palatinus quite covered with the ruins of the ancient palace belonging to the roman emperors and at the foot of it there are some beautiful detached pillars still standing on the left you see the remains of the templum pacis which seems to have been the largest and most magnificent of all the temples in rome it was built and dedicated by the emperor vespasian who brought into it all the treasures and precious vessels which he found in the temple of jerusalem this temple was likewise famous for its library mentioned by aulus gellius fronting you are the noble ruins of that vast amphitheatre called the colossaeum which has been dismantled and dilapidated by the gothic popes and princes of modern rome to build and adorn their paltry palaces behind the amphitheatre were with the thermae of the same emperor titus vespasian in the same quarter was the circus maximus and the whole space from hence on both sides to the walls of rome comprehending above twice as much ground as the modern city is almost covered with the monuments of antiquity the miserable houses and even garden walls of the peasants in this district are built with the precious materials of shafts and capitals of marble columns heads arms legs and mutilated trunks of statues what pity it is that among all the remains of antiquity there is not one of their private dwelling houses existing i should have been glad says smollet to have known how the senators of rome were lodged i want to be better informed touching the cava oedium focus the ara deorum penatum the conclavia trilinica and caenationes the atria where the women resided and employed themselves in the woollen manufacture and the hysta which were shady walks between two porticos where the men exercised themselves in winter i am disgusted by the modern taste of architecture though i am no judge of the art the churches and palaces of their days are crowded with petty ornaments which distract the eye and by breaking into a variety of little parts destroy the effect of the whole every door and window has its separate ornaments its moulding frize cornice and tympanum then there is such an assemblage of useless festoons pillars pilasters with their architraves entablatures and i know not what that nothing great or uniform remains to fill the view and we in vain look for that simplicity of grandeur those large masses of light and shadow and the inexpressible tout ensemble which characterizes the edifices of the ancients a great edifice to have its full effect ought to be isole that is detached from all other with a large space around it but the palaces of rome and indeed of all the other cities of italy are so hemmed in among other mean houses that their beauty and magnificence are in a great measure concealed even those which face open streets and piazzas are clean only in front the other apartments are darkened by the vicinity of ordinary houses and their views confined by dirty and disagreeable objects within the court there is generally a noble colonnade all around and an open corridor above but the stairs are usually narrow steep and high the want of sash windows the dullness of thin small glass lozenges the dirty brick floors and the crimson hangings laced with gold contribute to cast a gloom on their apartments i might add to these causes a number of pictures executed on melancholy subjects antique mutilated statues busts basreliefs and sepulchral stones with which their rooms are adorned it must be owned however that there are some objections to this general rule the villa of cardinal alexander albani is light gay airy yet the rooms are too small and too much decorated with carving and gilding which is a kind of gingerbread work the apartments of one of the princes borghese are furnished in the english taste and in the palace of the constable colonna there is a saloon or gallery which for the proportions lights furniture and ornaments is the most noble elegant and agreeable apartment i ever saw  it is diverting adds smollett to hear an italian expatiate on the greatness of modern rome he will tell you there are above three hundred palaces in the city that there is scarce a roman prince whose revenue does not exceed two hundred thousand crowns and that rome produces not only the most learned men but also the most refined politicians in the universe to one of them talking in this strain i replied that instead of three hundred palaces the number did not amount to more than fourscore that i had been informed on good authority there were not six individuals in rome who had so much as forty thousand crowns a year about l  0000 sterling and that to say their princes were so rich and their politicians so refined was in effect a severe satire upon them for not employing their wealth and their talents for the advantage of their country i asked why their cardinals and princes did not invite and encourage industrious people to settle and cultivate the campagna of rome which is a desert why they did not raise a subscription to drain the marshes in the vicinity of the city and thus meliorate the air why they did not contribute their wealth and even their political refinements in augmenting their forces by sea and land in introducing commerce and manufactures and in giving some consequence to their state which was no more than a mite in the political state of europe  the only appearance of a fortification in this city is the castle of s angelo situated on the further bank of the tyber but this castle which was formerly the moles adriani could not hold out halfaday against a battery of ten pieces of cannon properly directed it was an expedient lest to the invention of the modern romans to convert an ancient tomb into a citadel it could only serve as a temporary retreat for the pope in times of popular commotion and on other sudden emergencies as it happened in the case of pope clement vii when the troops of the emperor took the city by assault and this only while he resided at the vatican from whence there is a covered gallery continued to the castle the castle of s angelo how ridiculous soever as a fortress appears reputable as a noble monument of antiquity and though standing in a low situation is one of the finest objects that strike the eye for a stranger approaching rome  chap iii st peters  pantheon  and amphitheatre of vespasian the incomparable church of st peter is built in the form of a latin cross and the proportion is so exactly observed in the length height and breadth that the eye cannot perceive any thing extraordinary large in any of these dimensions although the whole taken together is of a very uncommon bulk and extent for largeness and beauty it may be called the metropolitan church not only of rome and italy but of the whole world in this place we see to what an amazing pitch the romish church which is so fond of external pomp and splendour has within two centuries carried its favorite scheme viz that of captivating the senses and inspiring the minds of the ignorant with awe and submission to the clergy fontana in his account of this church computes that in his time it had cost above eighty millions of roman crowns or about twenty millions sterling in the opinion of many it surpasses in size and magnificence the finest monuments of ancient architecture the grecian and roman temples were more distinguished for the elegance of their form than their magnitude the pantheon which was erected to all the gods is the most entire antique temple in rome it is said that michael angelo to confirm the triumph of modern over ancient architecture made the dome of st peters of the same diameter with the pantheon raising the immense fabric on four pilasters whereas the whole circle of the rotunda rests upon the ground this great artist was perhaps delighted with the idea of being thought as superior to the ancient architects as he was conscious of being inferior to some of the sculptors of antiquity  this church the most wonderful in the world has a thousand faults a thousand bad things in sculpture painting etc etc but i pity the man says sherlock who thinks of looking for them when a fault presents itself let him advance a step further  a sublime beauty expects him  these ideas struck me while i was walking in this church i went thither with a pole a frenchman and an englishman the englishman looked for beauties the frenchman for faults the pole for nothing when we were at the end of the church behold says the frenchman that charity of bernini how wretched it is the air of her head is affected her flesh is without bone and she makes frightful faces these remarks appear to me just enough replies the englishman but look on the other side of the altar you will see one of the finest pieces of modern sculpture the justice of guglielmo della porta you are in the right says the frenchman without looking at it but that child at the foot of the charity disgusts me more than its mother while the englishman continued to praise the justice and the frenchman to criticize the charity the pole looked at the door by which we entered and said to me that the church was much longer than he imagined  all who have seen st pauls in london may by an enlargement of its dimensions form some idea of the external appearance of st peters but the resemblance fails entirely on comparing them within st peters being lined in many parts with the most precious and beautiful marble adorned with valuable pictures and all the powers of sculpture  the approach to st peters church excells that to st pauls in a still greater proportion than the former surpasses the latter either in size or in the richness and beauty of the internal ornaments a magnificent portico advances on each side from the front by which means a square court is formed immediately before the steps which lead into the church the two porticos form two sides of the square the third is closed by the front of the church and the fourth is open a colonnade four columns deep commences at the extremities of the porticos and embracing in an oval direction a space far wider than the square forms the most magnificent area that perhaps was seen before any building this oval colonnade is crowned with a balustrade ornamented by a great number of statues and consists of above three hundred large pillars forming three separate walks which lead to the advanced portico and from that into the church in the middle of the immense area stands an egyptian obelisk of granite and to the right and left of this two very beautiful fountains refresh the atmosphere with streams of clear water the delighted eye glancing over these splendid objects would rest with complete satisfaction on the stupendous fabric to which they serve as embellishments if the facade of this celebrated church had been equal in beauty and elegance to the rest of the building but this is by no means the case and every impartial judge must acknowledge that the front of st peters is in those particulars inferior to that of our st pauls  the length of st peters taken on the outside is exactly seven hundred and thirty feet the breadth five hundred and twenty and the height from the pavement to the top of the cross which crowns the cupola four hundred and fifty the grand portico before the entrance is two hundred and sixteen feet in length and forty in breadth  it is usual to desire strangers on their first entering this church to guess at the size of the objects which on account of the distance seems less than they are in reality the statues of the angels in particular which support the founts of holy water when viewed from the door seem no bigger than children but when approached near they are found to be six feet high we make no mistakes on seeing a living man at the same distance or at a greater because the knowledge we have of mans real size precludes the possibility of our being mistaken and we make allowance for the diminution which distance occasions but angels and other figures in sculpture having no determined standard but being under the arbitrary will of the statuary who gives them the bulk of giants or dwarfs as best suits his purpose we do not know what allowance to make and the eye unused to such large masses is confounded and incapacitated from forming a right judgment of an object six feet high or any other dimensions with which it is not previously acquainted  it has been frequently remarked that the proportions of this church are so fine and the symmetry of its different parts so exquisite that the whole seems considerably smaller than it really is it was however certainly intended to appear a great and sublime object and to produce admiration from the vastness of its dimensions it should seem therefore that any thing which has a tendency to defeat this effect cannot with propriety be called an excellence  having noticed st peters church unquestionably the finest piece of modern architecture in rome we will mention some of the best specimens of the ancient and first the pantheon which though not the largest of the roman temples is the most perfect which now remains the temple of jupiter capitolinus and the temple of peace if we may trust to the accounts we have of the first and to the ruins of the second were both much larger than the pantheon in spite of the depredations which this last has sustained from goths vandals and popes it still remains a beautiful monument of roman taste the pavilion of the great altar which stands under the cupola of st peters and the four wreathed pillars of corinthian brass which support it were formed out of the spoils of the pantheon which after all and with the weight of eight hundred years upon its head has still a probability of outliving its proud rapacious rival from the round form of this temple it has obtained the name of rotunda its height is a hundred and fifty feet and its diameter nearly the same within it is divided into eight parts the gate at which you enter forming one the other seven compartments if they may be so called are each of them distinguished by two fluted corinthian pillars and as many pilastres of giallo antico the capitals and bases are of white marble these support a circular entablature the wall is perpendicular for half the height of the temple it then slopes forward as it ascends the circumference gradually diminishing till it terminates in an opening of about five and twenty feet in diameter there are no windows the central opening in the vault admitting a sufficiency of light has a much finer effect than windows could have had no great inconvenience can happen from this opening the conical form of the temple prevents the rain from falling near the walls where the altars now are and where the statues of the gods were formerly placed the rain which falls in the middle immediately drills through holes which perforate a large piece of porphyry that forms the center of the pavements the whole of which consists of various pieces of marble agate and other materials which have been picked up from the ruins and now compose a kind of mosaic work  the portico was added by marcus agrippa the soninlaw of augustus it is supported by sixteen pillows of granite five feet in diameter and of a single piece each upon the frieze in the front is an inscription in large capitals signifying that it was founded by marcus agrippa the son of lucius during his third consulship some are of opinion that the pantheon is much more ancient than the augustan age and that the porticos which is the only part those antiquarians admit to be the work of agrippa though beautiful in itself does not correspond with the simplicity of the temple  as the pantheon is the most entire the amphitheatre of vespasian is the most stupendous monument of antiquity in rome it was finished by his son titus and obtained the name of colosseum afterward corrupted into coliseum from a colossal statue of apollo which was placed before it this vast structure was built of tiburtine stone which is remarkably durable had the public buildings of the ancient romans met with no more inveterate enemy than time we might at this day contemplate the greater number in all their original perfection they were formed for the admiration of much later ages than the present this amphitheatre in particular might have stood entire for two thousand years to come for what are the slow corrosions of time in comparison with the rapid destruction from barbarians the zeal of bigots and the avarice of popes and cardinals the first depredation made on this stupendous building was by the inhabitants of rome themselves at that time greater goths than their conquerors we are told they applied to theodoric whose court was then at ravenna for liberty to take the stone of this amphitheatre for some public work they were carrying on the marble cornices the frieze and other ornaments of this building have been carried away at various times to adorn palaces and the stones have been taken to build churches and sometimes to repair the walls of rome the most useless work of all for of what importance are walls to a city without a garrison about one half of the external circuit still remains from which and the ruins of the other parts a pretty exact idea may be formed of the original structure by a computation made by mr byres it could contain eighty five thousand spectators making a convenient allowance for each fourteen chapels are now erected within this expedient has saved some of the finest remains of heathen magnificence from utter destruction  our admiration of the romans is tempered with horror when we reflect on the use formerly made of this immense building and the dreadful scenes which were acted in the arena when not only criminals condemned to death but also prisoners taken in war were obliged to butcher each other for the entertainment of an inhuman populace the combats of gladiators were at first used at rome at funerals only where prisoners were obliged to assume that profession and fight before the tombs of deceased generals or magistrates in imitation of the barbarous custom of the greeks of sacrificing captives at the tombs of their heroes  this horrid magnificence which at first was exhibited only on the death of consuls and men of the highest distinction came gradually to be claimed by every citizen who was sufficiently rich to defray the expense and as the peoples fondness for these combats increased every day they were no longer confined to funeral solemnities but became customary on days of public rejoicings and were exhibited at an amazing expense by some generals after victories in the progress of riches luxury and vice it became a profession in rome to deal in gladiators men called lanistee made it their business to purchase prisoners and slaves to have them instructed in the use of the various weapons and when any roman chose to amuse the people with their favorite show or to entertain a select company of his own friends upon any particular occasion he applied to the lanistee who for a small price furnished him with as many pair of these unhappy combatants as he required they had various names given to them according to the different manner in which they were armed toward the end of the republic some of the rich and powerful citizens had great numbers of gladiators of their own who were daily exercised by the lanistee and always kept ready for fighting when ordered by their proprietor those who were often victorious or had the good fortune to please their masters had their liberty granted them on which they generally quitted the profession though it sometimes happened that those who were remarkably skilful continued it either from vanity or poverty even after they had obtained their freedom and the applause bestowed on those gladiators had the effect of inducing men born free to choose this for a profession which they exercised for money till age impaired their strength and address they then hung up their arms in the temple of hercules and appeared no more on the arena  there were many amphitheatres at rome as well as in other towns of italy and in many provinces of the empire but this of vespasian was the largest that ever was built that of verma is the next in size in italy and the remains of the amphitheatre at nismes prove that it was the most magnificent structure of this kind in any of the roman provinces the romans were so excessively fond of these exhibitions that where colonies were established it was found necessary to give public shows of this kind to induce the emigrants to remain in their new country and in the provinces in which it was thought necessary that a considerable body of troops should remain constantly structures of this kind were erected at vast labor and expense and were found the best means of inducing the young officers to submit cheerfully to a long absence from the capital and preventing the common soldiers from desertion the profusion of human blood which was shed in the arena by the cruel prodigality of the emperors and the refinements which were invented to augment the barbarous pleasure of the spectators are proofs of the dreadful corruption and depravity to which human nature is capable of attaining even among a learned and enlightened people when unrestrained by the mild precepts of a benevolent religion we are told that the gladiators bred for the use of particular patricians as well as those kept for hire by the lanistee were for some weeks before they appeared in the arena fed upon such succulent diet as would soonest fill their veins that they might bleed freely at every wound they were instructed by the lanistee not only in the art of fighting but also in the most graceful manner of dying and when these wretched men felt themselves mortally wounded they assumed such attitudes as they knew pleased the beholders and they seemed to receive pleasure themselves from the applause bestowed upon them in their last moments  when a gladiator was thrown by his antagonist to the ground and directly laid down his arms it was a sign that he could resist no longer and declared himself vanquished but still his life depended on the spectators if they were pleased with his performance or in a merciful disposition they held up their hands with the thumb folded down and the life of the man was spared but if they were in the humor to see him die they held up the hand clenched with thumb only erect as soon as the prostrate victim beheld that fatal signal he knew all hopes of life were vain and immediately presented his breast to the sword of his adversary who whatever his own inclinations might be was obliged to put him to death instantly  as these combats formed the supreme pleasure of the inhabitants of rome the most cruel of their emperors were sometimes the most popular merely because they gratified the people without restraint in their favorite amusement when marcus aurelius thought it necessary for the public service to recruit his army from the gladiators of rome it raised more discontent among the populace than many of the wildest pranks of caligula in the times of some of the roman emperors the lower class of roman citizens were certainly as worthless a set of men as ever existed stained with all the vices which arise from idleness and dependence living upon the largesses of the great passing their whole time in the circus and amphitheatres where every sentiment of humanity was annihilated within their breasts and where the agonies and torments of their fellow creatures were their chief pastime that no occasion might be lost of indulging this savage taste of the populace criminals were condemned to sight with wild beasts in the arena or were exposed unarmed to be torn in pieces by them and other times they were blindfolded and in that condition obliged to cut and slaughter each other so that instead of victims solemnly sacrificed to public justice they seemed to be brought in as buffoons to raise the mirth of the spectators  whilst we express horror and indignation at the fondness which the romans displayed for the combats of the amphitheatres let us reflect whether this proceeded from any cruelty of disposition inherent in that people or belongs to mankind in general let us reflect whether it is probable that the people of any other nation would be gradually led by the same degrees to an equal passion for such horrid entertainments let us consider whether there is reason to suspect that those who arm cocks with steel and take pleasure in beholding the spirited little animals cut one another to death would not take the same or superior delight in obliging men to slaughter each other if they had the power it is not long since that boxing cudgelling and fighting with the broad sword was introduced into london and prizefighters were found who would cut and flash each other for the amusement of the spectators and what restrains the continuance but benevolent laws is there no reason to believe that the influence of a purer religion and brighter example than were known to the heathen world prevents mankind from those enormities at this time which were countenanced formerly as soon as the benevolent principles of christianity were received by the romans as the laws of the deity the prisoners and the slaves were treated with humanity and the bloody exhibitions in the amphitheatre were abolished  chap iv forum romanum  triumphal arches  tarpeian rock trajans pillar and other remains of antiquity from the back view of the capitol is beheld the forum romanum now exhibiting a melancholy but interesting view of the devastation wrought by the united force of time avarice and bigotry the first objects which meet the eye on this side of the hill are three fine pillars twothirds of them buried in the ruins of the old capitol they are said to be the remains of the temple of jupiter tonans built by augustus in gratitude for having escaped death from a stroke of lightning near these are the remains of jupiter stator consisting of three very elegant small corinthian pillars with their entablature the temple of concord where cicero assembled the senate on the discovery of catalines conspiracy the temple of romulus and remus and that of antoninus and faustina just by it both converted into modern churches the ruins of the magnificent temple of peace built immediately after the taking of jerusalem the roman empire being then in profound peace this is said to have been the finest temple in old rome part of the materials of neros golden horse which vespasian pulled down were used in erecting this grand edifice the only entire pillar remaining of this temple was placed by paul v before the church of santa maria maggiore it is a most beautiful fluted corinthian column and gives a very high idea of the temple to which it originally belonged his holiness has crowned it with an image of the virgin mary and in the inscription on the pedestal he gives his reason for choosing a column belonging to the temple of peace as an ornament to a church dedicated to the virgin  ex cujus visceribus princeps verae pacis genitus est ie from whose bowels the prince of true peace sprang of many triumphal arches which formerly stood in rome there are only three now remaining all near the capitol and forming entrances to the forum those of titus septimus severus and constantine the last is by much the finest of the three but its chief beauties are not genuine nor properly speaking its own they consist of some admirable basreliefs stolen from the forum of trajan and representing that emperors victories over the dacians this theft might perhaps not have been so notorious to posterity if the artists of constantines time had not added some figures which make the fraud apparent and by their great inferiority evince the degeneracy of the art in the interval between the reign of these two emperors  the basreliefs of the arch of titus represent the table of shewbread the trumpets the golden candlesticks with seven branches and other utensils brought from the temple of jerusalem the quarter which is allotted for the jews is not at a great distance from this arch there are about nine thousand of that unfortunate nation at present in rome the lineal descendants of those brought captive by titus from jerusalem a striking instance of sensibility in this people is that they ever cautiously avoid passing through this arch though it is directly in their way to the campo vaccino choosing rather to make a circuit and enter the forum at another place  there are many other interesting ruins in and about the campo vaccino but of some structures which we know formerly stood here no vestige is now to be seen this is the case with the arch which was erected in honor of the fabian family there is the strongest reason to believe that the ancient forum was entirely surrounded with temples basilicae and public buildings of various kinds and adorned with porticos and colonades in the time of the republic assemblies of the people were held there laws proposed and justice administered in it was the rostrum from whence the orators harangued the people all who aspired at dignities came hither to canvass suffrages the bankers had their office near the forum as well as those who received the revenues of the commonwealth and all kind of business was transacted in this place  the tarpeian rock is a continuation of that on which the capitol was built i went to that part says moore from which criminals condemned to death were thrown m byres has measured the height it is exactly fiftyeight feet perpendicular and he thinks the ground at the bottom from evident marks is twenty feet higher than it was originally so that before this accumulation of rubbish the precipice must have been eighty feet perpendicular in reading the history of the romans the vast idea we form of that people naturally extends to the city of rome the hills on which it was built and every thing belonging to it we imagine the tarpeian rock as a tremendous precipice and if afterward we ever have an opportunity of actually seeing it the height falls so short of our expectations that we are apt to believe it a great deal less than it is in reality a mistake of this kind says moore has led bishop burnet into the strange assertion that the tarpeian rock is so very low that a man would think it no great matter to leap down it for his diversion criminals thrown from this precipice were literally thrown out of the city of old rome into the campus martius which was a large plain of a triangular shape two sides of the triangle being formed by the tyber and the base by the capitol and by buildings extending three miles nearly in a parallel line with it the campus martius had its name from a small temple built in it at a very early period and dedicated to mars or it might have this name from the military exercises performed there in this field the great assemblies of the people called census or lustrum were held every fifth year the consuls censors and tribunes were elected the levies of troops were made and there the roman youth exercised themselves in riding driving the chariot shooting with the bow using the sling darting the javelin throwing the discus or quoit in wrestling or running and when covered with sweat and dust in consequence of these exercises they washed their bodies clean by swimming in the tiber  the dead bodies of the most illustrious citizens were also burnt in this field which was adorned gradually by statues and trophies erected to the memory of distinguished men but every feature of its ancient appearance is now hid by the streets and buildings of modern rome  the inhabitants of modern rome may be excused in choosing this situation for their houses though by so doing they have deprived us of a view of the campus martius but surely they ought to show more solicitude for preserving the antiquities than they do and they might without inconvenience find some place for a cowmarket of less importance than the ancient forum it is not in their power to restore it to its former splendour but they might at least have prevented its falling back to the state in which aeneas found it when he went to visit the poor evander  as rome increased in size and number of inhabitants one forum was found too small and many others were erected in process of time but when we speak of the forum without any distinguishing epithet the ancient one is understood in these basilicae were built justice administered and business likewise transacted the emperors were fond of having such places named after them the accounts we have of the forums of nerva and that of trajan give the highest idea of their grandeur and elegance three corinthian pillars with their entablature are all that remain of the former of the latter the noble column placed in the middle still preserves all its original beauty it consists of twentythree circular pieces of white marble horizontally placed one above the other it is about twelve feet diameter at the bottom and ten at the top the plinth of the base is a piece of marble twentyone feet square a staircase consisting of one hundred and eightythree steps and sufficiently wide to admit a person to ascend is cut out of the solid marble leaving a small pillar in the middle round which the stairs wind from the bottom to the top the stairs are lighted by fortyone windows exceedingly narrow on the outside that they might not interrupt the connection of the basreliefs but which gradually widen within and by that means give sufficient light the most remarkable events of trajans expedition against the dacians are admirably wrought in a continued spiral line from the bottom of the column to the top the figures toward the top are too far removed from the eye to be seen perfectly viewed from any considerable distance all the sculpture is lost and a plain fluted pillar of the same proportions would have had as fine an effect but such a frugal plan would not have been so glorious to the prince whose victories are engraven or so interesting to the legionary soldiers many of whom no doubt are here personally represented  exclusive of the statue this beautiful pillar is one hundred and twenty feet high the ashes of trajan were deposited in an urn at the bottom and his statue at the top pope sixtus v in the room of trajan has placed a statue of st peter upon this column i observed says moore to a gentleman with whom i visited this pillar that there did not seem to be much propriety in placing the figure of st peter upon a monument representing the victories and erected in honor of the emperor trajan there is some propriety however replied he in having made the statue of brass  amongst other ruins of this once imperial mistress of the world caracallas baths are in high estimation with all the lovers of antiquity they appear to occupy as much ground as a moderate sized town and not only afforded conveniences for near three thousand persons to bathe at one time without being seen by each other together with squares and courts for all kinds of sports and other public spectacles but even science found a place in the circumference of these baths there were porticos for philosophers to assemble in the whole adorned with a profusion of statues and the most precious ornaments luxury could find or invent what alas remains nothing but broken walls and naked bricks yet even these last ate fine in their way as none can be formed at this day of so large a size they are also of an extraordinary texture and color the pipes which conveyed the water to a prodigious height into the upper apartments are made of as fine clay as the old red china and equally smooth one part of this immense building remains sufficiently entire to strike awe into the spectator it consists of a prodigious dome which has no support but from the wall whence it springs and like an unfinished rainbow seems suspended in the air close to these baths stood caracallas magnificent palace but of this there is not the least vestige remaining  dioclesians baths were twelve hundred feet square and yet not so large as those of caracalla they occupied all the gardens of the carthusian convent the public granaries the great square before them and the church of st bernardo which is circular and antique a great part of these thermae is converted into a church the remains of those of titus are immense vaults and corridors under ground painted with arabesques from which it is said raphael took the idea of his paintings in the loggie of the vatican  the therma dioclesianoe says smollett might be termed an august academy for the use and instruction of the roman people the pinacotheca of this building was a complete museum of all the curiosities of art and nature and there were public schools for all the sciences they were adorned with all the charms of painting sculpture and architecture the pipes for conveying the water were of silver many of the lavaera were of precious marble illuminated by lamps of crystal among the statues were found the famous toro and hercules farnese  bathing was certainly necessary to health and cleanliness in a hot country like italy especially before the use of linen was known but these purposes would have been much better answered by plunging into the tyber than by using the warm bath in the thermae which became altogether a point of luxury borrowed from the effeminate asiatics and tended to debilitate the fibers already too much relaxed by the heat of the climate true it is they had baths of cold water for the summer but in general they used them milkwarm and often perfumed they likewise indulged in vapor baths in order to enjoy a pleasing relaxation which they improved with odoriferous ointments of these baths some were mercenary and some opened gratis when marcus agrippa was aedile he opened one hundred and twenty private baths for the use of the people in the public baths where money was taken each person paid a quadrans about the value of our halfpenny but after the hour of bathing was past centumque petuntur quadrantes says martial a hundred quadrans were demanded  though there was no distinction in the places between the first patrician and the lowest plebeian yet the nobility used their silver and gold plate for washing eating and drinking in the baths together with towels of the finest linen they likewise made use of the instrument called strigil a kind of fleshbrush  the circi and naumachia if considered as buildings and artificial basins are admirable but if examined as arcae intended for horse and chariot races and artificial seas for exhibiting naval engagements they seem to prove that the ancient romans were but indifferently skilled and exercised either in horsemanship or naval engagements the enclosure of the emperor caracallas circus is still standing and scarce affords breathing room for an english hunter the circus maximus by far the largest in rome was not so long as the mall and st jamess park would make a much more ample and convenient scene for those diversions this circus was but three hundred yards in breadth and a great part of it was taken up by spina or middle space adorned with temples and two great obelisks as well as by the canal made by the order of julius caesar to contain crocodiles and other aquatic animals which were killed occasionally this canal was so large that heliogabalus having filled it with excellent wine exhibited naval engagements in it for the amusement of the people it surrounded three sides of the square so that the whole extent of the race did not much exceed an english mile and when probus was at the expense of filling the plain of it with firtrees to form a wood for the chase of wild beasts this forest was scarce more extensive than the plantation in st jamess park on the south side of the canals  the roman emperors seemed more disposed to elevate and surprise than to conduct the public diversions according to the rules of reason and propriety one would imagine it was with that view they instituted their naumachia or naval engagements performed by half a dozen small galleys of a side in an artificial basin of fresh water these galleys were not so large as fishing smacks for they were moved by two three and four oars on a side according to their different rates biremes triremes and quadriremes some antiquarians indeed believe the roman galleys had different tires or decks of oars but this notion is quite contrary to all the figures of them preserved on ancient coins and medals suetonius in the reign of domitian speaks of this emperor giving a mock seaengagement in a lake formed on purpose in the tyber the vessels of which were nearly large enough for actual service yet this artificial lake was not larger than the piece of water in hydepark how would it sound in the ears of a british sailor that a mock engagement between two squadrons of men of war would be exhibited on such a day on the serpentine river or that the ships of the line taken from the enemy would be carried in procession from hydepark corner to tower wharf certain it is that lucallus in one of his triumphs had one hundred and ten ships of war carried through the streets of rome nothing can give a more contemptible idea of their naval power than this testimony of their historians that their seamen were formed by exercising small rowboats in an enclosed pool of fresh water halfadozen english frigates one may venture to affirm would have been able to defeat both the contending fleets at the battle of actium which has been so much celebrated in the annals of antiquity as an event that decided the fate of empire  the common sewers were first made by order of tarquinius priscus not so much with a view to cleanliness as for subterranean drains to the vilabrum which was marshy and in order to carry off the stagnant water which remained in the lower parts after heavy rains the different branches of their channels united at the forum from whence by the cloaca maxima their contents were conveyed into the tyber this great cloaca was the work of tarquinius superbus other sewers were added by m cato and v flaccus censors all these drains having been choked up and become ruinous were cleared and restored by m agrippa who likewise undermined the whole city with canals of the same kind for carrying off the filth he strengthened and enlarged the cloaca maxima so as to make it capable of receiving a large cart loaded with hay and directed seven streams of water into these subterraneous passages in order to keep them always clean and open if notwithstanding all their conveniences vespasian was put to great expenses in removing the ordure from the public streets we may fairly conclude that the ancient romans were not more cleanly than the modern italians  those who have real pleasure in contemplating the remains of antique and the noblest specimens of modern architecture and who have an unwearied admiration of the charms of painting may employ a full year with satisfaction in this city  what is called a regular course with an antiquarian generally takes up about six weeks employing three hours a day in that time every thing worth seeing in or near rome may be visited but after having made this course says moore however distinctly every thing may have been explained by the antiquarian if the traveller does not visit the most interesting again and again and reflect on them at more leisure his labor will be of little use for the objects are so various and those seen one day so apt to be effaced or confounded with those beheld on another that he must carry away a very faint and indistinct recollection of any many travelers have experienced the truth of this observation  one young gentleman says moore who happened not to be violently smitten with the charms of virtu and scorned to affect what he did not feel thought that two or three hours a day were rather too much time to bestow on a pursuit in which he felt no pleasure and saw little utility the only advantage which in his opinion the greatest part of us reaped from our six weeks tour was that we could say we had seen a great many fine things which he had not seen this was a superiority he could not brook and which he resolved we should not long enjoy being fully convinced the business might with a little exertion be dispatched in a short space of time he prevailed on a proper person to attend him ordered a post chaise and four horses to be ready early in the morning and driving through churches palaces villas and ruins with all possible expedition he fairly saw in two days all that we had beheld during our crawling course of six weeks i found afterward by the list he kept of what he had seen that we had not the advantage of him in a single picture or the most mutilated remnant of a statue  those travelers who cannot remain a considerable time at rome would do well to get a judicious list of the most interesting objects in architecture sculpture and painting these they ought to visit frequently and these only by which means they will acquire a strong and distinct impression of what they have seen instead of that transient and confused idea which a vast number of things viewed superficially leave in the mind  chap v papal and other palaces with their antique statues etc the pope has three superb palaces that of the campidaglio or ancient capitol the palace of the vatican and that of the monte cavallo  the approach to the modern campidaglio is very noble and worthy of the genius of michael angelo who was the architect this building is raised on part of the ruins of the ancient capitol and fronts st peters church with its back to the forum and old rome there are very little remains of the old capitol or temple of jupiter capitolinus yet enough to make a christian church it had the denomination of capitolinus says livy from the head of a man casually found here in digging for the foundations of the famous temple of jupiter the capitol was the effect of a vow made by tarquinius priscus in the sabine war the structure stood on a high ridge taking in four acres of ground this temple was first consumed by fire in the marian war and then rebuilt by scylla this too was demolished in the vitellian sedition vespasian undertook a third which was burnt down about the time of his death domitian raised the last and most glorious of them all in which the very gilding amounted to two millions and a quarter sterling which immense expenditure in that single article gave plutarch occasion to observe that he was like midas desirous of turning every thing into gold  the present building was erected in the pontificate of gregory xiii it is a large and magnificent palace with two spacious wings containing very grand apartments at the bottom of the stairs are two egyptian lions which form two fountains and at the top stand castor and pollux holding their horses both colossal in white marble and representing those heroes as they came express to rome with the news of the victory gained over the tarquins these two lions are by some writers called sphinxes so little is the dependence that can be put on the relation of travelers  the two sphinxes of basalte at the bottom of the ascent though excellent specimens of egyptian sculpture says moore engage little your attention warm with the glory of rome you cannot bestow a thought on the hieroglyphics of egypt on the other hand northall has an express note on this subject and quotes two other authors in support of his assertion that they are lions so very contradictory in their testimony in this particular  in the center of the area fronting the city stands the famous equestrian bronze statue of the roman emperor marcus aurelius antoninus pius which was erected to him by the senate and people of rome from this exalted station the emperor seems to take a survey of the city and with his hand extended to be now giving laws to rome it is esteemed the finest statue in the world and was anciently in very high repute the romans boast much of this statue at present and say the venetians offered as many sequins of gold for it as could be enclosed in the belly of the horse which was refused what carlo maratti is reported to have said to the horse may give some idea of the excellence of the sculpture why do thou not walk have thou forgot that thou art alive  at the upper end of the area says moore the eye is caught by a majestic female figure in a sitting attitude which we are told is a roma triumphans brought from cori one of the oldest towns of latium we view her says the above writer with all the warmth of fond enthusiasm but we recollect she is no longer triumphant we cast an indignant eye on st peters to which she also seems to look with indignation is there such another instance of the vicissitudes of human things the proud mistress of the world under the dominion of a priest  in the two wings of this modern palace called the campidaglio the conservators of the city have apartments their office is analagous to that of the ancient aediles in the main body an italian nobleman appointed by the pope has his residence with the title of senator of rome the miserable representation of that senate which gave laws to the world the most defaced ruin the most shapeless heap of antique rubbish in all rome cannot convey a feebler image of the building to which they belonged than this deputy of the pope does of that august assembly  the upper apartments and galleries of this place are filled with a surprising collection of antiquities all the curious statues and pieces of antiquity found in and throughout the neighborhood of the city having been brought here to the embellishment of the campidaglio an antiquarian cannot help being delighted with the chamber of the emperor where on two rows of steps is displayed a long range of alabaster and marble busts representing the ancient roman emperors and their consorts there is also a very fine collection of egyptian deities each of them quite perfect in the main building is the gaol for criminals near the capitol is still seen the statue of marforio this is a colossal figure lying down but without much merit and remarkable only that against it are pasted the answers to those satirical verses stuck upon another antique statue called pasquino from whence the term pasquinade arose so frequently given to scurrilous and abusive poems  among other curious antiques in the capitol says lady millar is a vase of fine bronze fluted and in shape somewhat like flowerpots intended to ornament gardens this was the favorite cup of mithridates king of pontus who always had it carried with his baggage to his encampments and constantly drank out of it pompey took a like fancy to it and had it brought to rome where it was borne in triumph it holds more than six gallons but seems of the most inconvenient shape imaginable for a drinking cup no modern mouth could easily take the brim the capacious jaws of a polypheme might indeed fill it well  here are also the feet and one hand of a mutilated colossal statue of apollo supposed to have been fortyone feet high the great toe measures thirtyseven inches round  the superb palace called the vatican is attached to st peters church and was for many years the residence of the pontiffs but they have of late preferred monte cavallo as a drier and healthier situation the vatican or mons vaticanus owes its name to the answers of the vates or prophets that used to be given here or from the god vaticanus but it seems not to have been enclosed within the walls till the time of aurelian this hill was formerly famous for the sepulcher of scipio africanus some remains of which are here still to be seen  the vatican is a palace extremely irregular very lofty and very spacious it contains eleven thousand and five hundred apartments no traveller can be supposed to have either opportunity or inclination to examine into the truth of this account so that we must depend on the veracity of the popes officers and domestics whose authority for what they advance is the wooden model of this palace which at present is not to be seen  this palace having been built and enlarged at different times there is no proportion or symmetry observed in its several parts and to avoid damaging the fine area before st peters church it has not so much as a portico in front  the best painters of italy have striven to display the utmost of their art in the beautiful pictures that are every where to be seen in these apartments and raphael especially has done wonders his masterpiece is a picture representing the history of attila  exclusive of the paintings the library and the antique statutes are the principal objects meriting the attention of a traveller  the vatican library is the finest and noblest in the world being full of manuscripts in hebrew greek and other languages pope sixtus v caused it to be built from the very foundation and spared no cost to enrich it with the best books but since his death it has been augmented by the heidelberg library and that of christina queen of sweden it is generally divided into two parts the public and private the one is three hundred feet long and sixty broad the other consists of two rooms into which admittance is not so easily obtained because of the very scarce manuscripts contained there  this library is so constructed as to afford a very agreeable coup daeil at the entrance but the books being enclosed in presses which are painted deprives it entirely of the appearance of a library  in this library stands a white and transparent column of oriental alabaster about ten feet high which is solid and beautifully fluted opposite to this pillar is a sarcophagus of white marble and in it a winding sheet made of linen which readily catches fire but does not consume thereby this linen is secured by ironwork and in order to prove that it stands the fire our ciceroni says lady millar pulled one end of it through the iron and set fire to it with a lighted bougie it burnt fast and presently extinguished of its own accord the corner which had endured the flame appeared rather cleaner and whiter than the rest of the sheet which was all the effect that the fire produced there are painted on large pilasters ranged in the middle of the library those persons who were reputed to have been the inventors of letters in the ancient languages with the letters which each are said to have invented written under their pictures  they told us says lady millar that the presses contained seventy thousand printed volumes and forty thousand manuscripts they show a greek testament written in capitals with the accents nine hundred years old several curious antique bibles in hebrew syriac arabic etc an elegant greek manuscript of the acts of the apostles in gold letters given by one of the popes to charlotte queen of cyprus and several others with curious and highfinished miniatures among these is a pliny with the pictures of all the animals a virgil of the  th century written entirely in capitals with the figures of the trojans and latins in their proper habits a beautiful manuscript of tasso and a dante with miniatures at the top of each page descriptive of the subjects here are also carefully preserved the original love letters from king henry viii to anne boleyn and his treatise on the seven sacraments written against luther with his dedication in his own handwriting to pope leo x  in the middle of this palace is a spacious square surrounded with orange trees and antique statues and therefore called says keysler il giardino delle statue antiche it is also called the belvidere on account of the glorious prospect seen from it here is that noble repository of antique sculpture called the clementine museum and the present pope has fitted up a set of apartments worthy them and him for their better reception it is said to be the most superb assemblage of the finest statues in the whole world there are eight in all  the first remarkable object we meet with is a large mutilated statue possibly of hercules without head hands or feet but for the exquisite representation of the muscles etc preferred by michael angelo to all the other remains of antiquity this piece which is commonly called il tronco di belvidere is enclosed with ironwork and according to lancivis account was dug up in the campo di fiori in the niche of a portico surrounding a small open court is the famous apollo belvidere and the no less famous laocoon the former incomparably the finest single figure and the latter the finest group in the world apollo is supposed to have just discharged his arrow at the python his attitude is beautiful natural and unaffected his countenance composed and elegant the workmanship of every part exquisite he is longer from the middle downwards than nature says martyn but this deviation from the proportion of the human figure adds greatly to his dignity and upon the whole he has an unspeakable sublimity that inspires admiration awe and reverence  when the folding doors were thrown open of the niche which conceals the statue of apollo says lady millar i started back with surprise never did i see any sculpture come so near the life nor animation express so much majesty and dignity i was struck with awe the beautiful proportions of the limbs the grandeur and noble air diffused over the whole figure his commanding aspect blended with angelic sweetness joined to the most perfect feature made me almost fancy he breathed and was about to speak  the point of view says sherlock from whence is seen the most perfect union of the sublime and beautiful in nature is from the top of vesuvius the point of view from whence is seen the most perfect union of the sublime and beautiful in art is in the court of the apollo of belvidere from the former we see the mouth of the volcano fields desolated by rivers of lava now frozen a country of vineyards of considerable extent diversified by the most beautiful mixture of plains and hills the city of naples the hill of paufilippo a number of islands scattered in a vast sea etc etc in the court we see the apollo the laocoon the antinous and the celebrated torso of hercules called the torso of michael angelo on account of the admiration which he had for this precious fragment here we see what the greek nation was let me not be told of prejudice for the ancients i have none i only do justice to the merit of things and it is very indifferent to me says sherlock where they are found or who are their authors to be just we must sometimes appear extravagant when an object is transcendently beautiful or great suitable encouragement ought to be given to it the pen of man cannot do justice to the poetry of shakspeare the genius of the king of prussia or the works of the greeks many i know will condemn me for this last expression but i deny them to be judges they will condemn me only because they know not my subjects  it is in the belvidere that we see the superiority of the greeks to all the nations of the world the distance that is between the apollo the laocoon and all the best works of the french and the italians is so great that it is almost ridiculous to name them together  let the young traveller when he views the apollo recollect that what he sees has been a rude block of marble the first step of the artist was to create the character of this god before therefore the marble was touched the sculptor had made an effort of genius and that effort of genius was so great that all the men who have succeeded him to this moment have never been able to make one like it this eulogium it may be said is too strong it is not an eulogium it is a fact if the fact be not true name me a statue equal in invention is it the susannah of fiamingo the justice of gulielmo della porta the santa bibiena of bernini or is it the moses of michael angelo no man of sense will ever compare them the moses is not inferior to any italian or french statue but had we not seen the torso from which it is evident that michael angelo took the original idea of his statue we should never be astonished at the invention of that production the invention of the apollo astonishes all men and astonishes them in proportion to the time and attention with which they examine it  the apollo of bernini is a fine statue it appears indifferent only because we compare it often imperceptibly with the apollo of belvidere neither is the apollo of bouchardon an indifferent production but compare the original french statue with the copy of the greek statue in the gardens of versailles the difference is incredible it is the difference between a man and a god we cannot say what a heathen deity was but we always feel on viewing this statue that it was something more than human  when genius is unaccompanied by taste it is often surprised at missing its effect the character created it remained for taste to choose a moment to show this divinity that moment ought to be animating and interesting it ought to be favorable to grace majesty and expression and it ought to be so chosen that the disposition of the whole and the distribution of each part of the statue should seem to flow from it with simplicity and ease the artist there has chosen the instant in which this god gives the sublimest proof of his divinity by an act of benevolence in destroying an enemy of mankind it is the instant after he has shot his arrow at the serpent python the arrow discharged he follows it with his eyes to observe its effect the expression of each part of the body corresponds to that of the face and from an idea so simple this grecian has been able to form a work which has obtained the applauses of all men and has made every artist despair  when a perfect execution is added to genius and taste man cannot then go farther the finish of this apollo is inconceivable even to the most minute particulars but the artist might almost have been excused the trouble of so perfectly completing his work his conception is so sublime and his distribution so happy that they alone would have commanded the admiration of all men in all countries and a proof of this is the homage every where paid to the casts of this breathing god  the best way to give an idea of the superiority of greek execution is to cite a fact the laocoon was found only with one arm they wished to have another several artists attempted it and all failed michael angelo the boldest genius that italy ever had who conceived the idea of placing the pantheon in the air and who made the dome of st peters on the same dimensions thought that he could succeed in it and after having worked at it for two years abashed and despairing be broke his work to pieces gulielmo della porta whose superb mausoleum in st peters shows that he was an artist of the first rank said that it was impossible to make it in marble but that he would make it in clay and he made the rightarm in clay as we see it at present an incontestible proof of the unattainable perfection of the greek execution  i allow it says sherlock to be a bad proof of our being in the right that a celebrated man is of our opinion but i think every reasonable being should well examine before he determines against a judgment so solid as that of poussin and a genius so bright as that of montesquieu the former studied incessantly the best works ancient and modern on which this was his decision  raphael compared with the moderns is an angel compared with the ancients he is an ass compare the most beautiful figure of raphael detached with the apollo and his finest group with the laocoon and judge for yourself  france has no man who does her more honor in foreign countries or who will do her more with posterity than montesquieu it is well known that he made some stay in italy and that he did not view objects like a superficial observer this was his idea with regard to the greeks taste and the arts have been carried by them to such a height that to think to surpass them will be always not to know them  the laocoon astonishes and terrifies there is not a feature or muscle which does not express the deepest anguish laocoon is represented in the greatest agony and with his eyes lifted up to heaven near him are his two sons with the serpents turned about them whom virgil represents at some distance from the father and expiring when he came to their relief the youngest son is fallen down in the agonies of death the other is not yet hurt and looking toward his father wishing to help him and at the same time wanting help himself the principle figure viz the father has lost the rightarm and that of plaster or clay which has been substituted in its room is not to be compared to the other parts of the statue either for color or workmanship even michael angelo himself being ordered to execute another arm for this statue is said designedly never to have put the finishing hand to it  for me says moore to attempt a description of the fine specimens of antique sculpture in the vatican which have been described a thousand times and imitated as often without once having justice done them would be equally vain and superfluous i shall therefore confine myself to a very few observations the most insensible of mankind must be struck with horror at sight of the laocoon on one of my visits to the vatican i was accompanied by two persons who had never been there before one of them was accused of being perfectly callous to every thing which did not immediately touch his own person the other is a worthy good man the first after staring for some time with marks of terror at the groupe at length recovered himself exclaiming with a laugh  egad i was afraid these d  d serpents would have left the fellows they are devouring and made a snap at me but i am happy to recollect they are of marble  i thank you sir most heartily said the other for putting me in mind of that circumstance till you mentioned it i was in agony for those two youths  nothing can be conceived more admirably executed than this affecting groupe in all probability it never would have entered into my imagination that it could have been in any respect improved but mr lock the famous sculptor it seems has observed after mentioning the execution of this piece in the highest terms of praise that had the figure of laocoon been alone it would have been perfect as a man suffering the most excruciating bodily pain with becoming fortitude it admits of no improvement his proportions his form his action his expression are exquisite but when his sons appear he is no longer an insulated suffering individual who when he has met pain and death with dignity has done all that could be expected from man he commences father and a much wider field is opened to the artist we expect the deepest pathos in the exhibition of the sublimest character that art can offer to the contemplation of the human mind a father forgetting pain and instant death to save his children this sublime and pathetic the artist did not see or despaired of attaining laocoons sufferings are merely corporal he is deaf to the cries of his agonizing children who are calling on him for assistance but had he been throwing a look of anguish on his sons had he seemed to have forgotten his own sufferings in theirs he would have commanded the sympathy of the spectator in a much higher degree on the whole mr lock is of opinion that the execution of this groupe is perfect but that the conception is not equal to the execution such are mr lockes sentiments we have only to remark whether a sudden and instantaneous unexpected pain of the most excruciating kind possible to be conceived for the human mind to suffer does not destroy every other sentiment  reflecting on the dreadful condition of three persons entangled in the horrid twinings of serpents and after contemplating the varied anguish so strongly expressed in their countenances it is a relief to turn the eye to the heavenly figure of the apollo to form an adequate idea of the beauty of this statue it is absolutely necessary to have seen it with all the advantages of color and life the human form never appeared so beautiful and we can never sufficiently admire the artist who has endowed marble with a finer expression of grace dignity and understanding than ever were seen in living figures  the admired statue of antinous is in the same court nothing can be more light elegant and easy the proportions are exact and the execution perfect it is an exquisite representation of the most beautiful youth that ever lived  the statue of the apollo represents something superior and the emotions it excites are all of the sublime cast  monte cavallo the popes summer palace on the quirinal hill has its name from two colossal statues with each a horse which they formerly held by the bridle they bear the name of phidias and praxiteles but whoever was the sculptor they are certainly grecian and much the most pleasing colossal statues in rome that which is ascribed to phidias is the best the horses have great spirit but their necks are too thick and their heads too little the bridles are lost constantine the great is said to have brought them out of greece and to have placed them in his baths on the quirinal mount the figures in both have been supposed to represent alexander and bucephalus  over the doors of the palace is a balcony supported by two ionic pillars from whence the pope on solemn occasions gives his benediction to the people this palace from the salubrity of the air and its fine prospect over a large part of the city of rome is preferred by the popes as a residence to the two former palaces the building is round a large court which is surrounded by a portico a wide double staircase conducts to the great hall  the gardens belonging to this palace are large and laid out in good taste but not taken care of as they deserve they are surrounded with very lofty cypresstrees and laurels with some hedges of myrtles and are about a mile in circuit a delightful laurelgrove leads from hence to a lower garden where the waterworks are very surprising some by the means of organs imitate the sound of trumpets and kettledrums others the explosion of grenades and rockets  at one angle of the large garden the pope has built two elegant apartments for his particular retirement and furnished them after the english taste even to the most minute articles this building is called the coffeehouse  the palaces of rome line the streets and squares which thus owe their greatest ornament to these vast edifices the architecture is good in very few but in many the prodigious extent united to a magnificence of decoration is striking such are the barberini borghese bracciano altieri and colonna palaces in the interior distribution magnificence is the leading feature to which convenience often gives place smollett says he was told there were above three hundred palaces in rome but that in fact their number did not exceed fourscore and so far from there being scarce a roman prince whose revenue did not exceed fifty thousand pounds that he scarce found six individuals who had ten thousand pounds  of the principal of these palaces we shall give a summary view the altieri palace is one of the largest in rome it is plain on the outside and a remarkably good piece of brickwork the staircase is grand the library of clement x in this palace is rich in manuscripts medals etc the princesss apartments consist of seven noble rooms well furnished in the bedchamber of the prince gasper altieri is the chariot of the sun in fresco by f chiari and the cieling of the room adjoining to it was painted by carlo maratti the cardinals bed of state is valued at thirty thousand crowns here is also shown an octangular speculum of rock crystal ten inches long and six broad in a frame of gold set with amethysts emeralds sapphires topazes and diamonds the whole weighs twelve pounds and is by some estimated at fifteen thousand pounds  the barberini palace is exceeded only by the vatican and contains four thousand rooms or apartments the two main staircases are extremely grand and on one of them is a very large antique lion much admired for the excellence of the workmanship this palace resembles two or three joined together and contiguous to it is a very large garden ornamented with fountains statues etc the collection of fine pictures antiques and other curiosities in this palace is prodigious the library is in the upper story one hundred and ninetyseven steps leading up to it they pretend that there are sixty thousand volumes of printed books and nine thousand manuscripts the great room is one hundred feet long thirtyfour broad and twenty high with a covered cieling there is a cabinet of medals antique gems bronzes etc the jewels of this family as is the custom with all the great and princely families in italy are kept in a large cabinet and form a kind of regalia here is an astonishing quantity of precious stones and pearls the jewels the duchess wears are magnificent the diamonds are of a much larger size than any in england except those belonging to the crown and there are a vast number of large pearls of the finest water and most exact formation  the celebrated borghese palace is very bad architecture both within and without a vast extent of front without any break order or elegance it is all of brick stuccoed the great court has double porticos supported by an hundred granite columns in this palace are seventeen hundred original pictures which are reckoned worth several millions of money  as this palace exceeds any other in rome for paintings etc it is surprising to see so much mean furniture especially the chairs and seats amidst so much splendour and magnificence  the palace of prince odiscalchi was formerly for paintings and statues one of the most remarkable in rome but at present the front of it by bernini is the only thing worth observing the finest pieces by corregio and paul veronese as likewise all that belonged to queen christinas collection were sold to the duke of orleans regent of france  the colonna palace fronting to the square of the twelve apostles is of great extent and the apartments are magnificent and handsomely fitted up they are full of pictures by the best masters the gallery is one of the finest and richest in europe one hundred and thirtynine feet long thirtyfour broad and seventy high and has some capital paintings here is a cabinet studded with precious stones which belonged to king charles i and was sold by cromwell to cardinal mazarine whose niece married into the colonna family among other expensive furniture is a clock showing the hour of the day the month year etc which is wound up but once a year here is also a bed finely gilt and made in the form of a shell drawn by four seahorses like neptunes triumphal car this was the bed in which maria marcini cardinal mazarines niece lay in of her first child this lady was famous for the passion which lewis xiv entertained for her the constable colonnas stables are inferior to none in rome and well stocked with spanish neapolitan and barbary horses  the corsini is a noble palace without architecture twentytwo windows in front a fine suite of rooms and a large garden part of which is in the janiculeum and commands one of the noblest views in rome the library is well disposed and public it consists of four rooms twentyfour feet square and sixteen high in one of which is a large collection of prints and drawings three others for new books and a gallery seventy feet by twenty  the farnese palace belonging to the king of the two sicilies is the most superb in rome it was chiefly built by michael angelo in the court are three orders doric ionic and corinthian with open arcades round it  in the apartments of this now deserted palace are some good statues and busts but its great ornament is the gallery painted in fresco by a caracci the beauty of this palace is not viewed without concern for not only the famous cube but several other ornaments have been brought here from vespasians theater to the great detriment of that incomparable structure in the court are several ancient statues of a large size viz a gladiator flora and two statues of hercules exactly resembling each other but not equally well cut that on the left hand is the farnesian hercules and is the work of glycon an athenian as appears from the inscription the statue of flora near it is mutilated but for the fineness of the drapery few of the ancient pieces can be compared with it the toro farnesian is also much admired the subject of this piece is amphion and zethus tying dirce by the hair to the tail of a bull in revenge for her having robbed her mother antiope of their fathers love though the figures are larger than life it is said to be one entire piece of marble according to marlyn these three statues have been very recently removed to naples  the farnesian hercules remarks moore has been long admired as an exquisite model of masculine strength yet admirable as it is it does not please all the world the women in particular find something unsatisfactory and even odious in this figure which however majestic is deficient in the charms most agreeable to them and which might have been expected in the son of jupiter and the beauteous alcmene a lady adds moore whom i accompanied to the farnese palace turned away from it with disgust i could not imagine what had shocked her she told me after recollection that she could not bear the stern severity of his countenance that his large brawny limbs and the club with which he was armed gave him more the appearance of one of those giants that according to the old romances carried away virgins and shut them up in gloomy castles than the gallant hercules the lover of omphale finally the lady declared that she was convinced this statue could not be a just representation of hercules for it was not in the nature of things that a man so formed could ever have been a reliever of distressed damsels  without such powerful supports as that of the fair sex i should not have exposed myself to the resentment of connoisseurs by venturing to assert that the farnese hercules is faulty both in form and attitude the former is too wieldy for active exertion and the latter exhibits vigor exhausted a resting attitude is not the most proper in which the allconquering god of strength could be represented rest implies fatigue and fatigue strength exhausted a reposing hercules is almost a contradiction invincible activity and inexhaustible strength are his characteristics  next to hercules is a most beautiful statue of flora the great advantage remarks moore which the ancient artists had in attending the exercises of the gymnasia has been repeatedly urged as the reason of their superiority over the moderns in sculpture we are told that besides the usual exercises of the gymnasia all those who proposed to contend at the olympic games were obliged by the regulations to prepare themselves by exercising publicly for a year and the statuaries and painters constantly attended on the arena where they beheld the most graceful of the grecian youths employed in these sports in which the power of every muscle was exerted and where the human form appeared in an infinite variety of attitudes by constant attendance at such a school the artists are supposed to have acquired a more animated true and graceful style than can possibly be caught from viewing the tame mercenary models exhibited in our academies  on the other hand it is asserted that the artist who formed the farnesian flora could not have improved his work or derived any of its excellencies from the circumstances above enumerated because the figure is in a standing posture and clothed in the light easy flow of the drapery the contour of the body being as distinctly perceptible as if the statue was naked the chief merit of this statue is thought to consist but this reasoning does not seem just for the daily opportunities which the ancient artists had of seeing naked figures in every variety of action and attitude must have given them advantages over the moderns in forming even drapery figures at sparta the women upon particular occasions danced naked in their own families they were seen every day clothed in light draperies and so secondary was every consideration even that of decency to art that the prettiest women of agrigentum it is recorded were called upon by the legislature without distinction to show themselves naked to a painter to enable him to paint a venus whilst the moderns therefore must acknowledge their inferiority to the ancients in the art of sculpture they may be allowed merit on account of the cause to which it seems in some measure at least to be owing  as prince giustinianis palace is one of the most remarkable for excellent paintings so it exceeds any in rome for fine statues the second story consists of a suite of eleven spacious apartments through all which is a noble vista superior to any of that kind in rome a particular description of the original paintings which are no less than seven hundred and the antique monuments which are nineteen hundred five hundred of which are statues occupy two volumes folio  on the spot where this palace stands were anciently the baths of nero and severus so that at laying the new foundation granates basalte and other kinds of fine marbles with a great number of statues busts and basreliefs were found there which are noble ornaments to the palace  some idea of the extent of the pamfili palace may be formed and which is equally large and magnificent when our readers are informed that upwards of four thousand persons were entertained in it when prince doria the present possessor received the archduke and archduchess of austria in the year    0 there are no less than eighteen palaces belonging to this family seven of which are in rome  chap vi churches colleges hospitals and general remarks if a city is entitled to the appellation of holy from the number of its churches rome unquestionably merits it they reckon up no less than three hundred and thirty churches and there are few of them in which the architecture does not merit commendation of these we shall only notice two or three of the principal which exclusive of the paintings and architecture have some other peculiarities to interest the reader it is not only the architecture but the prodigious number of paintings by the most capital masters which render so many of the churches in rome objects of curiosity to admirers of the arts in some of them a profusion of riches dazzle the beholder  who says abbe coyer without considering their architecture can calculate all the riches accumulated in their churches the chapel alone of s ignatius in the church dedicated to our savior would purchase a whole province i speak not of its pillars of verd antique its niches of oriental alabaster its columns of lapis lazuli and the gilded bronze which every where dazzles the eyes i consider only the silver the gold and the precious stones which are worked up with so much taste  the principal of these churches is that of st john de lateran which though inferior to st peters in dimensions and architecture is the metropolitan church in rome it was built by constantine and styled matter orbis and urbis the emperors formerly received their crowns in this church and here the pope still takes possession of his dignity and confers all ecclesiastical benefices the fabric of this church has been much enlarged since the time of constantine and is very beautiful it has five doors one of which is called the holy door being opened only in the jubilee year the number of its precious shrines and other valuable ornaments is very great but nothing is more valued than a plain tin chalice which is said to have been made use of by s peter the most valuable curiosity in this church is the coffin of helena mother to constantine the great made of a single piece of porphyry with large basreliefs representing horsemen and other figures this is even larger than the supposed shrine of bacchus in st constantins church but is damaged in several places it was dug up in the via labicana about three miles from rome  here are also the famous chairs or stools called stellae stercoratoriae or exploratoriae they are two in number and between them is a chair of white marble elevated something above them both are of porphyry before i had seen them says keysler i was assured they were only the common chairs used by the ancient romans in which a hole had been made and lined with wood but in viewing them they did not seem at all adapted for the purpose of night stools the aperture not being of a sufficient size and incommodiously placed it is certain however that the popes at their taking possession of the lateran were formerly placed on these stools or chairs this the popish writers cannot deny and mabillon makes it an act of humility perfectly agreeable to the words which are sung at this ceremony he raises the needy from the dust and the poor from the dunghill that he may sit with princes and possess a throne of glory hence this chair came to be called stella stercoraria  the indecent examination of the popes sex about which some writers have been very jocose may perhaps be justly exploded as fabulous but it is not a protestant fable roman catholic writers having first set it on foot and introduced it into their satyrs as for instance the following epigram among many others of the same kind by marcelli on the cibo family  quid quaeris testes sit mas an faemina cibo respice natorum pignora certa gregem why such the proofs of cibos sex see the number of his children  the whole history or fable of pope joan passed current before luther was born as is evident from the ancient manuscripts of anastasius m polonus and others in a history of modern rome written by one tentzell and very scarce is the following passage respecting that lady which was purloined from the vatican library in the papal succession it appears that john an englishman succeeded leo and held the pontificate two years five months and four days when there was a vacancy of a month in the papal chair this pope is affirmed to have been a woman who being disguised like a young man was carried by her gallant to athens and made such a progress in all the sciences that she publicly read lectures at rome for three years the greatest masters being among her auditors nor was there any equal to her for parts and learning in that city at length she rose to such a pitch of reputation as to be unanimously chosen pope but during her pontificate she unhappily conceived by her former gallant and being ignorant of the time of her delivery she fell in labor as she was returning from st peters to the lateran and was delivered between the colisaeum and st clements church where she is said to have expired the popes custom of turning aside when he passes this way is said to be done in order to express his detestation of this affair neither is she set down in the list of popes on account of her sex  the corsini chapel belonging to this church is probably the most elegant in europe both for its proportions and the disposition of the marbles  the scala santa is opposite to this church it consists of twentyeight marble steps said to be brought from pilates palace at jerusalem and in the spacious area stands a great egyptian obelisk  st maria maggiore is so called from being the largest of the thirty churches which are dedicated to the virgin mary in this city the nave of this church is supported by forty antique columns of greek marble they are ionic and belonged to the temple of juno lucina the roof is flat and gilt with the first gold which came from peru this church is also called st mary ad praesepe from its containing the manger in which our savior is said to have been laid together with the swaddling clothes he wore and some straw on which he was placed  in one of the chapels is a profusion of rich marbles opaque precious stones and other magnificent ornaments  under the church of st sebastian the portico of which is supported by antique granite columns are the catacombs they are very narrow in comparison with those at naples but are commonly said to extend forty miles they were originally quarries of puzzolana then served for burial places of the heathens and afterward of the christians  under the church of st giuseppe is an ancient roman prison built by tullus hostilius and enlarged by ancus martius it is called the prison of st peter who is said to have been here it has a fine spring which they tell you issued miraculously to enable the apostles to baptize the jailer and fortyseven other persons a staircase near leads down to the dungeon from the church and there is a hole into another dungeon where jugurtha ended his days  st maria degli angeli is the noblest church in rome next to st peters it was made out of dioclesians thermoe by michael angelo it was the room in which the youths performed their exercises in bad weather  st maria sopra minerva so called from being built where there was a temple decicated to minerva by pompey  in the church of st maria della pieta is an epitaph the thought of which has something uncommon in it  fleres si scires unum tua tempora mensem rides cum non fit forsitan una dies you would weep if you knew that one month would put a period to your existence and yet you laugh though not certain of a day  il fagro monte della pieta was instituted to prevent the extortions of usurers by which the distresses of the poor in other countries are so extremely aggravated here any one receives twothirds of the value of his pledge and if it does not exceed thirty crowns he pays no interest but if above that sum only two per cent are required in case eighteen months should elapse before the pledge be redeemed it is publicly sold and the overplus reserved for the owner of the pledge this sale however may be prevented by renewing the obligation  the church of st onofrio is not without some good paintings but what chiefly draws a foreigner hither is the fine view which this church affords all over the city of rome the remains of the celebrated poet torquato tasso lie interred here  those who are fond of horses may meet with great entertainment at st anthonys church on the   th of january that day being the festival of the saint when all the horses mules etc belonging to the pope cardinals prelates princes and other great men are drawn up before the church door where a priest sprinkles them with holy water if the horses and mules receive no benefit from this practice the monks at least find the sweets of it at sienna the horses which are to run the race on the assumption of the virgin mary are the day before blessed in the same manner with holy water at the door of the cathedral and the officiating priest has at least a wax candle as an offering for every horse this custom is supposed to have taken its rise from the sprinkling of the horses at the circensian games  on the altar of the church of st pietro in montorio is the most celebrated picture at present known in the whole world it is the transfiguration of christ on mount tabor and was the last work of raphaels admirable pencil no monumental inscription having been thought sufficient to express the praise of that great artist this picture was set up near his remains as the most affecting and strongest proof of the irreparable loss the world sustained by his premature exit for he died in the thirtyseventh year of his age  this transfiguration says sherlock is a school of painting if the art was lost and this picture remained it would be alone sufficient to form painters all the parts of painting are united in it the most exact drawing the most sensible and picturesque disposition a perfect harmony of coloring and a sublimity in the upper part of the picture which transports the spectator as much as the groupes below interest him raphael was commanded to paint this subject and it is in itself rather barren a god clothed in splendour and illuminated by the rays of his glory presents of itself so sublime an idea that the artist could not miss it but it is the only idea that the subject offers the painter was forced to create the rest it is the property of genius said leonardo di vinci to draw a grand production from a poor subject as it is that of mediocrity to form a trifling work upon a rich ground this sentence and the transfiguration determine the rank of raphael  the studies of the belleslettres and antiquities are more followed at rome than the sciences la sapienza is the principal of the colleges and as it were the center of the university there are eight professors of theology six of civil and canon law eight of medicine five of philosophy one of belleslettres and four of the eastern and greek languages  the college of la propaganda was founded by gregory xv there are several professors belonging to it who give lectures on theology philosophy the belleslettres and the oriental languages to the young ecclesiastics who are designed for foreign mission the roman college is a vast heavy edifice built by gregory xiii this is dedicated to the education of youth as are also the clementine and nazarene colleges  for the encouragement of learning there are also many public libraries in rome that of the vatican is universally known the other principal ones are in the altieri albani barberini borghese corsini ghizi imperiali and pamfili palaces at the sapienza propaganda and roman colleges in the convents of st agostino gesu st maria sopra minerva etc most religious houses of note have likewise considerable libraries which are easily accessible  it appears that there are very few students in these universities the jesuits having every where monopolized the education of youth in the ecclesiastical states  rome is full of those foundations for which religion lays opulence under contribution such are the conservatories some of which are for orphans some for children brought thither by their parents and not seldom taken from them when their poverty endangers their morals there are also hours of reformation for children who are disobedient or taking bad courses and other for wives under the misfortune of having bad husbands there are no less than thirty hospitals says keysler for the relief of the sick and poor in the city of rome but none of them equal the santo spirito in which there are generally above a thousand patients and all well taken care of  forty nurses are constantly kept in pay to take care of the infants which every night are put into the machines at the foundling hospitals besides these above two thousand nurses in the city and neighboring villages have wages for nursing the children till they are four or five years old and then the boys are brought to the hospital to be instructed in handicraft trades or polite arts according to their different genius when they are provided with all necessaries till they are able to maintain themselves the girls who generally exceed five hundred in number are educated under the inspection of a convent of nuns till they are fit for the convent or marriageable if the latter be their choice they have a portion of a hundred crowns this hospital though part of its revenues has been curtailed by some of the popes to endow other charities which stood in need of its assistance has still an annual income of five and twenty thousand pounds sterling besides the produce arising from the circulation of the money in the bank belonging to it  the hospital of st michael is another admirable foundation for bringing up poor orphans who are allowed to choose their trade and when they are twenty years old and able to maintain themselves they are dismissed from the house new clothed from head to foot with five and twenty crowns in their pockets into this hospital are also admitted old disabled servants and others incapable by age and infirmities of earning their bread in the chapel the two sexes are separated from each other by an iron grate it being lent says keysler when i visited this hospital their food consisted of a piece of dried fish some chestnuts and bread with a can of wine  every country in europe where the roman catholic religion is professed has likewise its hospital for pilgrims in rome but the hospital of the trinity receives all nations indiscriminately and has frequently entertained fifteen thousand pilgrims under its roof at once the manner of receiving them is as follows the pilgrims as soon as they arrive present themselves before the officers of the house and on producing their certificates their names are entered in the books of the hospital and each person receives a medal or ticket of admission they are then led into a large chamber where a priest having said prayers washes all their feet and dresses the wounds of those whose feet have been hurt or blistered by traveling this done they are led into the refectory and having supped are shown into the common dormitory where each individual has his bed assigned him  the pazzarella or hospital for lunatics very much resembles bedlam in its institution except that this charity is more extensive and provides for people of all nations who are disordered in their intellects as appears from two english quakers who were merchants in italy and had learnt the italian language these quakers it seems from an excess of zeal looked upon it as meritorious to endeavor to make a convert of the pope to quakerism they accordingly applied to his domestics for an audience nor did they make any secret of their business with his holiness which they told in their usual cant terms and jargon at first they were laughed at as people disposed to be merry but repeatedly continuing their solicitations with great earnestness they were looked upon as madmen and the popes officers out of charity sent them to the pazzarella as it is called the grvernor of the house thinking their zeal and transports to be certain indications of a disordered brain shut them in a dungeon and treated them with great rigor the physicians also purged them most violently repeating and strengthening their doses as they observed their ravings increase but all proving ineffectual they were neglected as persons incurable and permitted to walk about the hospital with the harmless lunatics where they were seen by some english gentlemen who being informed for what reason they were confined procured their release and had them shipped off for england  but to return to the charitable institutions almost every company of artisans have their hospital where they provide for such of their fraternity as are infirm or otherwise distressed in the church of the twelve apostles are annually chosen twelve noblemen and one prelate who make it their business to go into every corner of the city in search of poor men ashamed to beg and relieve their wants even the lawyers set apart one day in every week to defend the causes of the poor gratis  chap vii environs of rome the warmth of the climates necessarily makes the inhabitants fond of villas and gardens where in summer they may retire for the benefit of fresh air of these there are ten or twelve in the neighborhood of the city usually visited by strangers from this we may judge what a task they undertake who resolve to go through the whole and what kind of an idea they are likely to carry away who perform this task during a stay of a few months of these the villa borghese ranks first it is one of the finest spots in all italy and as st peters at rome is the most superb church in the world so this villa for beauty ornaments and curiosities may be said to exceed all other country seats in italy or elsewhere  in short remarks smollet these villas would make a complete academy for painting and sculpture especially for the study of ancient marbles for exclusive of the statues and busts in the garden and the vast collection in the different apartments almost the whole outside of the house is covered with curious pieces in basso and alto relievo  it stands at the distance of a quarter of a league from the porta pinciana and is enclosed within a wall of five italian miles in compass containing a variety of situations high and low which favor all the natural embellishments one would expect to meet with in a garden and exhibit a diversity of noble views of the city and adjacent country the part says lady millar is fine and with a few alterations would be esteemed such even in england the verdure is lively and the trees old and well grown to this part the english are permitted by the borghese family to repair twice a week and play at cricket and football we women adds lady millar go sometimes and see the sport as do the roman ladies attended by their abbes who form a brilliant body of spectators  in the gardens are at least twenty beautiful walks and all the vistas are terminated by statues and fountains the espaliers consist of jessamine or orange trees myrtle etc in other parts of the garden are separate little parks for deers and hares and a warren for rabbits here is also a large canal stocked with swans and all kinds of aquatic fowls in two large and lofty aviaries are to be seen all birds of the known feathered species and the flowergarden exhibits the most beautiful flowers and remarkable vegetables  at the entrance are the following curious regulations relating to the garden of the villa borghese i the keeper of the villa borghese give notice that whoever thou art if thou art free thou need not fear any shackles of the law should restrain thee here go where thou will gather what thou please and stay or go when it is agreeable to thee all thou see is rather for the entertainment of strangers than of the owner who mindful of the inestimable freedom of the golden age banishes from these tranquil mansions laws invented in the iron age let good manners be the only law to be observed here but should thou wantonly and deliberately break the golden rule that good breeding dictates beware left the provoked gardner should also break through the bounds of civility and friendship  of the curiosities contained in the palace we shall confine ourselves to a few remarks on some of the most esteemed the hermaphrodite of which there are so many prints and models is accounted by many one of the finest pieces of sculpture in the world the mattrass upon which this fine figure reclines is the work of bernini and nothing can be more admirably executed some critics say he has performed his task too well because the admiration of the spectator is divided between the statue and the mattrass this however ought not to be imputed as a fault to that great artist since he condescended to make it at all it was his business to make it as perfect as possible it is said there was an artist at versailles in a different line who attempted something of the same nature he had exerted all his abilities in making a periwig for a celebrated preacher who was to preach on a particular occasion before the court and he imagined he had succeeded to a miracle i will be hanged said he to one of his companions if his majesty or any man of taste will pay much attention to the sermon today  among the antiques there is a centaur in marble with a cupid mounted on his back the latter has the cestus of venus and the ivy crown of bacchus in allusion to beauty and wine he beats the centaur with his fist and seems to kick with violence to drive him along the centaur throws back his head and eyes with a look of remorse as if he were unwilling though forced to proceed the execution of this groupe is admired by those who look upon it merely as a jeu desprit but it acquires additional merit when considered as allegorical of men hurried on by the violence of their passions and lamenting their own weakness while they find themselves unable to resist  there is another figure which claims attention more on account of the allegory than the sculpture this is a small statue of venus cloacina trampling on an impregnated uterus and tearing the wings of cupid the allegory indicates that prostitution is equally destructive of generation and love  this villa is also enriched by one of the most animated statues in the world and which in the opinion many comes nearest and in the judgment of some equals the apollo of the vatican this is the statue of the fighting gladiator it is difficult however to compare two pieces whose merits are so different the apollo is full of grace majesty and conscious superiority he has shot his arrow and knows its success there is indeed a strong expression of indignation which opens his lips distends his nostrils and contrasts his brows but it is the indignation of a superior being who punishes whilst he scorns the efforts of his enemy the gladiator on the contrary full of fire and youthful courage opposes an enemy he does not fear but whom it is evident he thinks worthy of his utmost exertion every limb nerve and sinew is in action his ardent features indicate the strongest desire the highest expectation but not a perfect security of victory his shape is elegant as well as nervous expressive of agility as well as strength and equally distant from the brawny strength of the farnesian hercules and the effeminate softness of the belvidere antinous  though this fine figure generally goes by the name of the fighting gladiator some antiquarians cannot allow that ever it was intended to represent a person of that profession but a victor at the olympic games and assert that it is the identical statue made by order of the athenian state in honor of their countryman chabrias and that it is precisely in the attitude which according to cornelius nepos that hero assumed when he repulsed the army of agesilaus  there are eight or ten of these villas in the outskirts of rome highly celebrated for their delightful prospects their beautiful gardens their superb collection of antique statues and paintings by the greatest masters of the art but to enumerate them separately would be superfluous and tedious in the description  exclusive of these villas belonging to the roman princes within the precincts as it were of the capital there are several other places at some small distance from rome which have been illustrious in antiquity and therefore merit a more particular description the principal of these are frescati tivoli and albano  frescati is about twelve miles east of rome and situated on or near the same spot where the ancient tusculum stood and derives its name from the arbours or tabernacles built by the inhabitants of tusculum when their city was demolished in      this charming place is at present the summer residence of several persons of the first rank who have not only splendid palaces and gardens here but have taken advantage of this favorable situation among hills for making very grand waterworks such as would make a figure even at versailles tusculum is often marked in ancient history as the scene of many memorable events it was the birthplace of cato the censor the great grandfather of cato of utica it was rendered illustrious by the celebrated villa of cicero to which he frequently retired and where he composed those so justly admired philosophical dissertations this place boasts likewise of having given birth to metastatio unquestionably the first poet in italy the town is built on the declivity of a hill and commands a fine view of the country below and of the many villas and gardens which clothe and beautify the brow of the mountain  the principal villa belongs to the borghese family and is situated on monte dracone a mile from the town it is so called from the dragon borne by the family of borghese in their arms this house is reckoned one of the largest in europe and has a fine portico constructed by vignoles  the palace stands on an eminence and at the end of a very beautiful avenue at the entrance are the following ostentatious mottos  thessala quid tempe quid quaeris adonidis hortos haec tibi pro cunctis villa draconis erit that is thessalian tempe and adonis groves no more shall charm but yield to this recess   and farther on hesperidum nostris quantum viridaria cedunt custos est tanto mitior ore draco  hesperian groves are far surpassed by these no monster guards this rural calm retreat   some idea may be formed of the largeness of this palace from the number of its windows which are no less than three hundred and seventyfour and from one of them the noble owner has a prospect of part of his own estate to the amount of fifteen thousand pounds sterling a year  from the terrace is a most beautiful view of rome and the adjacent country till the sea bounds the prospect on that side villages ruins and the lago castilione with mountains from another beautiful prospect the tout ensemble is truly wonderful and delightful uniting all the advantages of a near with all the grandeur of an extensive prospect  here we cannot omit the story of an unfortunate mother and daughter of the family of cenci whose portraits are shown in one of these apartments the father of the latter was such an abandoned wretch that he could not refrain from acts of brutal and even unnatural lust with his wife in his daughters presence and made several violent attempts on her person also to put a period to such indignities she had recourse to a most desperate attempt to which her fathers horrid villainy prompted her she concealed two assassins in her chamber who were to murder her father in his sleep but when the dreadful moment came the two villains were seized with fear or sudden remorse and showed a reluctance to perpetrate the murder upon this the daughter in a transport of rage snatched a stiletto from the hands of one of the assassins and stabbed her father as he slept who expired amidst a deluge of blood this dreadful catastrophe happened in the time of paul v and the mother and brother being privy to the design they were all three beheaded before the castle of s angelo the pope showed them no other favor notwithstanding they were of a noble family than that of ordering some guns to be fired at the time of their execution from the castle of s angelo as a signal for his holiness to pronounce a benediction in their behalf the daughter died with great resolution and her youth and beauty drew a flood of tears from the spectators  the villa aldobrandini is also remarkable for its fine situation extensive gardens airy terraces its grottos and waterworks these form a kind of theater and a brass globe supported on the shoulders of atlas ejects water on all sides near this statue are a lion and a tiger fighting and the water issuing from the mouth and nostrils of the former exactly imitates the snarling of that animal when enraged the column of water in the center of the fountain rises to the height of seventyfour palmi and is attended with a noise like the whizzing of skyrockets here is also a francis or polypheme playing on one of the ancient pastoral pipes and a centaur blowing a horn which is said to be heard four italian miles in an arched hall is also to be seen mount parnassus with apollo the muses and pegasus the music of the choir proceeds from an artificial cuckoo and an organ with a variety of stops put in play by water as is another place before the theater the keys of these instruments are moved by brass pins fixed in a cylinder which turns on its axis by means of a watermill near mount parnassus stand the statues of corinna and sappho and on the walls apollos chief adventures are painted in fresco over the door is this distich  huc ego migravi musis comitatus apollo hic delphi hic helicon hic mihi delos erit hither resort with me apollo each tuneful muse this shall be delphos delos helicon and all our famous haunts so famed of old this curious saloon is paved with fine small stones curiously arranged and in the center of the pavement is a hole over which a light globe or ball is kept in a perfect equilibrium at the distance of a span from the floor only by the impetus of the air forced up by water through the hole the cascade consists of sixtyfive steps and on both sides are tortoises dolphins and other aquatic animals cut in stone and spouting water at each other in the garden not far from the cascade is a wilderness with several shady narrow walks in it  the villa conti is worth seeing on account of its garden and waterworks and particularly for the ancient remains of eighteen vaulted buildings said to have formed part of the menagerie of lucullus  the ruins of the ancient town of tusculum are to be traced above a villa belonging to the jesuits called the grottos of cicero but it is by no means certain that these vestiges made part of his villa  frescati is the sea of a bishop who is suffragan of rome and it is usually held by one of the six eldest cardinals at present it belongs to the cardinal of york who passes the greatest part of his time in the duties and ceremonies of a religion of whose truth he seems to have the fullest conviction  near the bottom of the eminence on which tivoli stands are the ruins of the vast and magnificent villa built by the emperor adrian these remains cover a large extent of ground several country houses have been built upon them and the greater number of the finest antiques in the roman collections have been found here various authors agree that this villa was in length three miles and in breadth a fifth of that space here still remain vestiges of colonades temples aqueducts etc on part of the gardens is built a religious house for the jesuits they are said to have been laid out formerly in the most beautiful representation of the elysian fields contrasted with the regions of pluto much more may be said of this villa even in its present ruined state but what it has been may be gathered from a variety of ancient authors suffice it to say that the utmost efforts of the arts and sciences were exhausted in the improvement of a spot kind and beautiful by nature  a wet and marshy piece of ground which was partly under water and had been an immense basin in front of this villa is rented by a m hamilton an ingenious english artist who keeps a great number of men at work upon it and has succeeded so far as he has gone in draining it with great expense and labor he very sensibly fixed on this spot concluding that many valuable antiques might have been thrown into the water to preserve them from the barbarous fury of those who demolished this superb edifice and has already found a great number of curious articles which will yield him an ample indemnification  tivoli is about fifteen miles distant from frescati and nearly the same distance from rome and situated on a hill it is the ancient tibur and said to have been built by the greeks the town itself is a wretched place and made more disagreeable by a great number of forges the inhabitants positively affirm this little town to have been built six hundred and small cascade at tivoli forty years before the city of rome and round its arms still retain the ancient motto superbum tibur proud tibur the cathedral is built upon the the ruins of the temple of hercules but the most remarkable antiquity here is the temple of the sibyl the beautiful architecture and fine proportions of this small edifice strike the eye at first view its form is most elegant its sculpture perfect and peculiary graceful the lines of beauty so insisted upon by hogarth are to be traced in all the ornaments of this building its situation is on the brow of a hill on one side appears the town and in front the great cascade this beautiful little temple has been so accurately described by palladio vitruvius and other architects that it is surprising it has not been copied in some of the fine gardens in england the hill on which this temple stands affords not only a charming prospect of the cascade but of the spots where the seats of horace and catullus are supposed to have stood the violence of the fall or cataract of the river teverone anciently the anio down the precipice turns the water entirely to foam and has considerably excavated the rocks beneath about half a league farther up the hill is another waterfall but neither of them is to be compared to the cascade formed by the rhine near schaffhausin or of the velino in the district of terni  the cascade of terni is formed by the fall of the river velino which virgil mentions in the seventh aeneid rosea rura velini the channel of this river lies very high and is shaded on all sides by a green forest made up of several kinds of trees that preserve their verdure all the year the neighboring mountains are served with them and by reason of their height are more exposed to the dews and drizzling rains than any of the adjacent parts which gives occasion to virgils rosea rura dewy countries the river runs extremely rapid before its fall and rushes down a precipice of a hundred yards high it throws itself into the hollow of a rock which probably has been worn by such a constant fall of water it is impossible to see the bottom on which it breaks for the thickness of the mist that rises from it which looks at a distance like clouds of smoke ascending from some vast furnace and distills in perpetual rains on all the places that lie near it the river velino after having found its way out from among the rocks runs into the river nera  see the plate the figures on the foreground are in the costume or dress of the country  after having passed these falls this river which takes its rise in the appenines fifty miles above tivoli loses itself in the tibur  the water fall of terni   besides the cascade and the sibyls temple tivoli has to boast of the villa estense which is said to have cost the family whose name it bears three millions of crowns yet this fine house is going to decay as fast as time can effect it this palace has been much admired for its architecture sculpture paintings gardens and waterworks most of the waterworks are still kept up for being easily supplied from the river anio they are not very chargeable the large basin before the palace furnishes a great quantity of water near this basin is a very long row of some hundreds of eagles pyramids bases and other figures cut in stone and fixed on pedestals with basreliefs of stories taken from ovids metamorphoses and water is ejected from all of them this row of figures being several hundred paces in length is a very elegant ornament and at the end stands a ship with its masts and rigging as it were engaged and vigorously defending itself by ejecting water from all parts on an adjoining eminence is a representation of ancient rome with its temples theaters obelisks baths columns triumphal arches and aqueducts the girondola or dragon fountain throws up a vast column of water to the height of twenty palmi the waterorgan is also a curious piece of work and the deep cascade is in a good taste upon the whole the waterworks at tivoli surpass those at frescati but the latter afford a more agreeable prospect for tivoli lies on the brow of a chain of hills by which great part of its prospect is intercepted on one side  this was a populous and flourishing town in remoter antiquity but it appears to have been thinly inhabited in the reign of augustus horace in an epistle to mecaenas says parvum parva decent mihi jam non regia roma sed vacuum tibur placet   that is little things are adapted to little men it is not royal rome that pleases me now but the empty tibur  though the town itself was not populous the beauty of the situation and wholesomeness of the air prompted great numbers of illustrious romans both before the final destruction of the republic and afterward in augustuss time to build countryhouses in the neighborhood julius caesar had a villa here which he was under the necessity of selling to defray the expense of the public shows and games he exhibited to the people during his aedileship plutarch says that his liberality and magnificence on this occasion obscured the glory of all who had preceded him in the office and gained the hearts of the people to such a degree that they were ready to invent new offices and new honors for him he then laid the foundation of that power and popularity which enabled him in the end to overturn the constitution of his country caius cassius had also a country house here where marcus brutus and he are said to have had frequent meetings and to have formed the plan which terminated the ambition of caesar and again offered rome that freedom which she had not the virtue to accept here also was the villa of augustus whose success in life arose at the field of philippi from which he fled was confirmed by the death of the most virtuous citizens of rome and who without the talents reaped the fruits of the labor and vast projects of julius caesar lepidus the triumvir cecilius metellus quintillius varus the poets catullus and propertius and other distinguished romans had villas in this town or its environs and the spots are shown on which they stood but nothing renders tibur so interesting as the frequent mention which horace makes of it in his writings his great patron and friend mecoenas had a villa here the ruins of which are to be seen on the south bank of the anio and it was pretty generally supposed that the poets own house and farm were very near it and immediately without the walls of tibur but it has been of late asserted with great probability that horaces farm was situated nine miles above that of mecoenass at the side of a stream called licenza formerly digentia near the hill of lucretilis in the country of the ancient sabines those who hold this opinion say that when horace talks of tibur he alludes to the villa of mecoenas but when he mentions digentia or lucretilis his own house and farm are to be understood  but whether the poets house and farm were near the town of tibur or at a distance from it his writings sufficiently show that he spent much of his time there and it is probable that he composed great part of his works in that favorable retreat this he in some measure declares in that fine ode addressed to julius antoninus the same whom augustus first pardoned and afterward put privately to death on account of an intrigue into which he was seduced by the abandoned julia the daughter of augustus if tivoli had nothing else to recommend it but its being so often sung by the most elegant of the poets and its having been the residence of so many illustrious men these circumstances alone would render it worthy the attention of travelers  on the road from rome to tivoli about three miles from the latter strangers are desired to visit a kind of lake called solfatara formerly lacus albulus and there shown certain substances to which they give the name of floating islands they are nothing more than bunches of bullrushes springing from a thin soil formed by dust and sand blown from the adjacent ground and glued together by the bitumen which swims on the surface of this lake and the sulphur with which its waters are impregnated some of these islands are twelve or fifteen yards in length the soil sufficiently strong to bear five or six people who by the means of a pole may move to different parts of the lake as if they were in a boat this lake empties itself by a whitish muddy stream in the teverone a vapor of a sulphurous smell arising from it as it flows the ground near this rivulet as also around the borders of the lake resounds as if it were hollow when a horse gallops over it the water of this lake has the singular quality of covering every substance which it touches with a hard stony matter on throwing a bundle of small sticks or shrubs into it they will in a few days be covered with a white crust but what seems still more extraordinary this encrusting quality is not so strong in the lake itself as in the canal or little rivulet that runs from it and the further the water has flowed from the lake till it is quite lost in the anio the stronger is this quality these small round encrustations which cover the sand and pebbles resembling sugarplumbs are called confetti di tivoli fishes are found in the anio both above and below tivoli till it receives the albula after which during the rest of the course to the tibur there are none the waters of this lake had a high medical reputation anciently but at present they are in no esteem  the road from frescati to rome by gensano marino la riccia and castle gondolfo is delightful all the villages and villas communicate with each other by fine walks and avenues of lofty trees whose intermingling branches form a continual shade for the traveller castle gondolfo is a little village near the lake of albano on one extremity of which is a castle belonging to his holiness from which the village takes its name there is nothing remarkably fine in this villa except its situation near the village is likewise the villa barberini within the gardens of which are the ruins of an immense palace built by the emperor domitian there is a charming walk about a mile in length along the side of the lake from castle gondolfo to the town of albano the lake of albano is an oval piece of water about seven or eight miles in circumference whose margin is finely adorned with groves and trees of various verdures beautifully reflected from the lake and which with the surrounding hills and the castle gondolfo which crowns one of them forms a fine picturesque appearance  the grand scale on which the beauties of nature appear in switzerland and the alps has been considered by some as too vast for the pencil but among the sweet hills and valleys of italy her features are brought nearer the eye are fully seen and understood and appear in all the bloom of rural loveliness tivoli albano and frescati therefore are the favorite abodes of the landscapepainters who travel into this country for improvement and in the opinion of some these delightful villages furnish studies better to the powers of their art than even switzerland itself nothing can surpass the admirable assemblage of hills meadows lakes cascades gardens ruins groves and terraces which charm the eye in wandering amid the shades of frescati and albano appearing in new beauty as they are viewed from different points and captivating the beholder with endless variety  the most commanding view is from the garden of a convent of capuchins at no great distance from albano directly in front is the lake with the mountains and woods which surround it and the castle of gondolfo on one hand is frescati with all its villas on the other the towns of albano la riccia and gensano beyond these an uninterrupted view of the campagna with st peters church and the city of rome in the middle the whole prospect being bounded by the hills of tivoli the appenines and the mediterranean  one of the scenes generally taken by most painters is a view near the fountain between lericci and albano about twentyfive miles on the road from rome to naples with a distant prospect of part of the campagnia and the mediterranean the figures are in the dress of the country n b the ancient via appia from rome to brundusium went close to this road of which there are now some remains see the plate  while we were contemplating says moore all these objects with pleasure and admiration an english gentleman observing that there was not a prospect equal to it in all france or germany and not many superior even in england gave occasion to the following humourous dialogue between this latter and a lively old gentleman from scotland a man of worth but no antiquarian and indeed no admirer of any thing ancient or modern which had not some relation to his native country that i well believe replied the caledonian but if i had you in scotland i could show you several with which this is by no means to be compared indeed pray in what part of scotland are they to be seen i presume you never was at the castle of edinburgh sir never did you ever see lock lomond sir i never did i suppose i need not ask whether you have ever been in aberdeenshire or the highlands or  i must confess once for all interrupted a view between loricci and albano the englishman that i have the misfortune never to have seen any part of scotland then i am not surprised said the scot taking a large pinch of snuff that you think this is the finest view you ever saw i presume you think those in scotland a great deal finer a very great deal indeed sir why that lake for example is a pretty thing enough i dare swear many an english nobleman would give a good deal to have such another before his house but loch lomond is thirty miles in length sir there are above twenty islands in it sir that is a lake for you as for their desert of a campagna as they call it no man who has eyes in his head sir will compare the campagna of rome to the fertile valley of sterling with the forth the most beautiful river in europe twining through it do you really in your conscience imagine said the englishman that the forth is a finer river than the thames the thames exclaimed the north briton why my dear sir the thames at london is a mere gutter in comparison of the frith of forth at edinburgh i suppose then said the englishman recovering himself you do not approve of the view from windsor castle i ask your pardon replied the other i approve of it very much it is an exceeding pretty kind of a prospect the country appears from it as agreeable to the sight as any plain flat country crowded by trees and intersected by enclosures can well do but i own i am of opinion that mere fertile woods rivers and meadows can never of themselves perfectly satisfy the eye you imagine no doubt said the englishman that a few heathcovered mountains and rocks embellish a country very much i am precisely of that opinion said the scot and you may as soon convince me that a woman may be completely beautiful with fine eyes good teeth and a fine complexion though she should not have a nose on her face as that a landscape or country can be completely beautiful without a mountain well but here are mountains enough resumed the other look around you mountains cried the caledonian very pretty mountains truly they call that castle gondolfo of theirs a castle too and a palace forsooth but does that make it a residence fit for a prince why upon my word i do not think it much amiss said the other it looks full as well as the palace of st jamess the palace of st james exclaimed the scot is a scandal to the nation it is both a shame and a sin that so great a monarch as the king of scotland england and ireland with his royal consort and their large family of small children should live in a shabby old cloister hardly good enough for monks the palace of holyroodhouse indeed is a residence meet for a king and the gardens pray what sort of gardens have you belonging to that palace said the englishman i have been told you do not excel in those but we excel in gardeners replied the other which are as much preferable as the creator is preferable to the created i am surprised however that in a country like yours rejoined the south briton where there are so many creators so very few fruitgardens should be created why sir it is not to be expected said the scotchman that any one country should excel in every thing some enjoy a climate more favorable for peaches vines and nectarines but by god sir no country on earth produces better men and women than scotland i dare say none does replied the other so as france excels in wine england in wool and oxen arabia in horses and other countries in animals you imagine scotland excels all others in the human species what i said sir was that the human species in no country excel those of scotland and that i assert again and will maintain sir to my last gasp i do not intend to deny it said the englishman but you will permit me to observe that men being its staple commodity it must be owned that scotland carries on a brisk trade for i know no country that has a greater exportation for you will find scotchmen in all countries of the world so much the better for all the countries of the world said the scotchman for every body knows that the scotch cultivate and improve the arts and sciences wherever they go they certainly improve their own fortune wherever they go rejoined the other like their gardeners though they can create little or nothing at home they often create very good fortunes in other countries and this is one reason of our having the pleasure of so much of their country in london whether it affords you pleasure or not sir nothing can be more certain replied the scot in the most serious tone than that you may improve very much by their company and example but there are various reasons continued he for so many of our country sojourning in london the seat of government is there the king of scotland as well as of england resides there the scotch nobility and gentry have as good a right to be near the person of their sovereign as the english and you must allow that if some scotchmen make fortunes in england many of our best estates are also spent there but you mean to say that the scotch in general are poor in comparison of the english this we do not deny and cannot possibly forget as your countrymen refresh our memories with it so often we all allow therefore that you have this advantage over us and the persians had the same over the macedonians at the battle of arbela but whether scotland be poor or rich those scots who settle in england must carry industry talents or wealth with them otherwise they will starve there as well as elsewhere and when one country draws citizens of this description from another i leave you to judge which has the most reason to complain and let me tell you sir upon the whole the advantages which england derives from the union are manifest and manifold i cannot say replied the englishman that i have thought much on the subject but i shall be obliged to you if you will enumerate a few of them in the first place resumed the scot has she not greatly increased in wealth since that time she has so replied the other smiling and i never knew the real cause before in the next place has she not acquired a million and a half of subjects who otherwise would have been her enemies for this and other reasons they are equivalent to three millions in the third place has she not acquired security without which riches are of no value there is no door open now sir by which the french can enter into your country they dare as soon be damned as attempt to invade scotland so if you can only defend your own coast there is no fear of you but without a perfect union with scotland england could not enjoy the principal benefit she derives from her insular situation not till scotland shall be subdued said the englishman subdued repeated the astonished scot let me tell you sir that is a very strange hypothesis the fruitless attempts of many centuries might have taught you that the thing is impossible and if you are conversant in history you will find that after the decline of the roman empire the course of conquest was from north to south you mean said the south briton that scotland would have conquered england sir replied the other i think the english as brave a nation as ever existed and therefore i will not say the scotch are braver far less shall i assert that they consisting of only a fifth part of the number could subdue the english but i am sure that rather than submit they would try and you will admit that the trial would be no advantage to either country although i am fully convinced said the englishman how the experiment would end i should be sorry to see it made particularly at this time yet sir rejoined the scot there are people of your country as i am told who even at this time endeavor to exasperate the minds of the inhabitants of one part of great britain against the natives of the other and to create dissensions between two countries whose mutual safety depends on their good agreement i do assure you sir said the english gentleman i am not of the number of those who wish to raise such dissensions i love the scotch i always thought them a sensible gallant people and some of the most valued friends i have on earth are of your country you are a man of honor and discernment said the caledonian seizing him eagerly by the hand and i protest without prejudice and partiality that i never knew a man of that character who was not of your way of thinking  chap viii amusements and religious functions there are no theatrical entertainments permitted in rome except during the carnival but they are then attended with a degree of ardour unknown in capitals whose inhabitants are under no such restraint every kind of amusement indeed in this gay season is followed with the greatest eagerness the natural gravity of the roman citizens is changed into a mirthful vivacity and the serious sombre city of rome exceeds paris itself in sprightliness and gaiety this spirit seems gradually to augment from its commencement and is at its height in the last of the six weeks which comprehend the carnival the citizens then appear in the streets masked in the characters of harlequins pantaloons punchinellos and all the fantastic variety of a masquerade this humor spreads to men women and children descends to the lowest ranks and becomes universal even those who put on no masks and have no desire to remain unknown reject their usual clothes and assume some whimsical dress the coachmen who are placed in a more conspicuous point of view than others of the same rank in life and who are perfectly known by the carriages they drive generally affect some ridiculous disguise many of them assume a womans dress and have their faces painted and adorned with patches however dull these fellows may be when in breeches they are in petticoats considered as the pleasantest men in the world and excite much laughter in every street in which they appear  the street called the corso is the great scene of all these masquerades it is crowded every night with people of all conditions those of rank come in coaches or in open carriages made on purpose a kind of civil war is carried on by the company as they pass each other the greatest mark of attention people can show their friends and acquaintance is to throw a handful of little white balls resembling sugarplumbs in their faces and if they are not deficient in politeness they will instantly return the compliment all who wish to make a figure in the corso come well provided with this kind of ammunition  sometimes two or three open carriages on a side with five or six persons of both sexes in each draw up opposite to each other and fight a pitched battle on these occasions the combatants are provided with whole bags full of the small shot abovementioned which they throw at each other with much apparent fury till their ammunition is exhausted and the field of battle is as white as snow  the peculiar dresses of every nation of the globe and of every profession besides all the fantastic characters usual at masquerades are to be seen on the corso those of harlequin and pantaloon are in great vogue among the men the citizens wives and daughters generally affect the pomp of women of quality while their brothers or other relations appear as trainbearers and attendants in general they seem to delight in characters the most remote from their own young people assume the long beard tottering step and other concomitants of old age the aged choose the bib and rattle of childhood and the women of quality and women of the town appear in the characters of country maidens nuns and vestal virgins all endeavor to support the assumed character to the best of their ability but none succeed so well as those who represent children  toward the dusk of the evening the horserace takes place as soon as this is announced the coaches cabriolets triumphal cars and carriages of every kind are drawn up and line the street leaving a space in the middle for the racers to pass these are five or six horses trained on purpose for this diversion they are drawn up abreast in the piazza del popolo exactly where the corso begins certain balls as at florence with little sharp spikes are hung along their sides which serve to spur them on as soon as they begin to run these animals by their impatience to be gone show that they understand what is required of them and that they take as much pleasure as the spectators in the sport a broad piece of canvas spread across the entrance of the street prevents them from starting too soon the dropping that canvas is the signal for the race to begin the horses fly off together and without riders exert themselves to the utmost impelled by emulation the shouts of the populace and the spurs abovementioned they run the whole length of the corso and the proprietor of the victor is rewarded by a certain quantity of fine scarlet or purple cloth which is always furnished by the jews  this diversion such as it is seems highly entertaining to the roman populace though it appears a a mighty foolish business in the eyes of englishmen  masking and horseraces are confined to the last eight days but there are theatrical entertainments of various kinds during the whole six weeks of the carnival the serious opera is most frequented by people of fashion who generally take boxes for the whole season the opera with which this theater opened was received with applause though the music only was new the italians do not always think it necessary to compose new works for what is called a new opera they often satisfy themselves with new music to the affecting dramas of metastasio the audience here seem to lend a more profound and continued attention to the music than at venice this is probably owing to the entertainment being a greater rarity in the one city than in the other for i could perceive says moore that people of fashion who came every night began after the opera had been repeated several times to abate in their attention to receive visitors in their boxes and to listen only when some favorite airs were singing whereas the audience in the pit uniformly preserved the most perfect silence which was only interrupted by gentle murmurs of pleasure from a few individuals or an universal burst of applause from the whole assembly the sensibility of some of the audience gave me an idea of the power of sounds which the dullness of my own auditory nerves could never have conveyed to my mind at certain airs silent enjoyment was expressed in every countenance at others the hands were clasped together the eyes half shut and the breath drawn in with a prolonged sigh as if the soul was expiring in a torrent of delight one young woman in the pit called out o dio dove sono che piacer via caccia lalma oh god where am i what pleasure ravishes my soul  on the first night of the opera after one of these favorite airs an universal shout of applause took place intermingled with demands that the composer of the music should appear il maestro il maestro resounded from every corner of the house he was present and led the band of music and was obliged to stand on the bench where he continued bowing to the spectators till they were tired of applauding him one person in the pit who had displayed great signs of satisfaction from the beginning of the performance cried out he deserves to be made chief musician to the virgin and to lead a choir of angels this expression would be thought strong in any country but it has peculiar energy here where it is a popular opinion that the virgin mary is very fond and an excellent judge of music i received this information on christmas morning when i was looking at two poor calabrian pipers says moore doing their utmost to please her and the infant in her arms they played for a full hour to one of her images which stands at the corner of a street all the other statues of the virgin placed in the streets are serenaded in the same manner every christmas morning on enquiry into the meaning of that ceremony i was told the abovementioned circumstance my informer was a pilgrim who stood listening with great devotion to the pipers he told me at the same time that the virgins taste was too refined to have much satisfaction in the performance of these poor calabrians which was chiefly intended for the infant and he desired me to remark that the tunes were plain simple and such as might naturally be supposed agreeable to the ear of a child at his time of life  though the serious opera is in the highest estimation and more regularly attended by people of the first fashion yet the opera buffon or burlettas are not entirely neglected even by them and are crowded every night by the middle and lower classes some admired singers have performed these during the carnival and the musical composers have rendered them highly pleasing to the general taste  the prohibition of female performers renders the amusement of the roman theater very insipid to foreigners the natural sweetness of the female voice is ill supplied by the artificial trills of wretched castratos and the awkward agility of robust sinewy fellows dressed in womens clothes is a most deplorable substitute for the graceful movements of elegant female dancers this horrid practice which is encouraged by their manner of supplying the place of female fingers is a greater outrage on religion and morality than can be produced by the evils which their prohibition is intended to prevent so far from its being possible to believe that purity of sentiment will be preserved by bringing eunuchs on the stage it is more than probable that it has a different effect  all civil and religious ceremonies attended with pomp and splendour at rome are distinguished by the appellation of functions and are no mean succedaneum to the shows for which the roman people had such a rage  of all these functions the most brilliant is that of the possesso or the popes cavalcade when he goes to take possession of the church of st john lateran the most ancient of the churches in rome and the mother of all the churches in christendom this ceremony is equivalent to our coronation and is performed by every pope as soon as convenience will permit after the conclave has declared in his favor from st johns lateran he proceeds to the capitol and receives the keys of that fortress this is the only ceremony in which the pope appears in all his spiritual and temporal grandeur he is preceded and followed by above two thousand horsemen divided into squadrons the variety of which makes a very entertaining show the cardinals the upper and lower dignitaries and all the popes household in ceremonial habits make a part in this cavalcade the least showy and at the same time the least convenient accoutrements are those of the cardinal their hats which are quite flat are fastened to their head only by strings tied under the chin their long mantles cover the horses whole body like a caparison and the two corners of the cloak being made fast between his ears the rider has no means of clearing himself in case of any accident which indeed is little to be apprehended several footmen going on each side of the horse and watching its steps all the finest horses from spain and sicily are produced on this occasion and their beauty and graceful stateliness of motion add no small addition to the spectacle  we had a full view of the cavalcade says moore on its return from the church as it ascended the capitol the officers of the popes horseguards were dressed in a style equally rich and becoming it was something between the hungarian and spanish dress the swiss guards were on this occasion dressed with less propriety their uniforms were real coats of mail with iron helmets on their heads as if they had been going to take the capitol by storm and expected a vigorous resistance their appearance was strongly contrasted with that of the roman barons who were on horseback without boots and in full dress each of them was preceded by four pages their hair hanging in ringlets to the middle of their backs they were followed by a number of servants in rich liveries bishops and other ecclesiastics succeeded the barons and then came the cardinals on horseback in their purple robes which covered every part of the horses except the head there is no doubt but that the horses employed at such ceremonies are the gentlest that can be found for if they were at all unruly they might not only injure the surrounding crowd but throw their eminences who are not celebrated for their skill in horsemanship last of all comes the pope himself mounted on a milkwhite mule distributing blessings with an unsparing hand among the multitude who follow him with acclamations of viva il santo padre i e long live the holy father and prostrating themselves on the ground before his mule benedizione santo padre i e your blessing holy father the pope took particular care to wave his hand in the form of a cross that the blessings he pronounced might have the greater efficacy as his holiness is employed in this manner during the whole procession he cannot be supposed to give the least attention to his mule the bridle of which is held by two persons who walk by his side with some others to catch him and prevent his being thrown to the ground in case the mule should stumble  at the entrance of the capitol he was met by the senator of rome who falling on his knees delivered the keys into the hands of his holiness who pronounced a blessing over him and restored them to him again proceeding from the capitol the pope was met by a deputation of jews soon after he had passed through the arch of titus they were headed by the chief rabbi who presented him with a long scroll of parchment on which was written the whole law of moses in hebrew his holiness received the parchment in a very gracious manner telling the rabbi at the same time that he accepted his present out of respect to the law itself but entirely rejected his interpretation for the ancient law having been fulfilled by the coming of the messiah was no longer in force as this was not a convenient time or place for the rabbi to enter into a controversy on this subject he bowed in silence and retired with his countrymen in full conviction that the falsehood of the popes assertion would be made manifest to the whole universe in due time his holiness meanwhile proceeded in triumph through the principal streets to the vatican  among the most remarkable functions during the santa settimana are first the ceremonies of palm sunday which commence in the chapel at monte cavallo where the pope blesses the palms and hears mass two sorts of cardinals are drawn up on each side the altar the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons their vestments violetcolour ornamented with ermine and lace just as the function is about to begin the cardinals take off their furs and outward drapery and put on vestments embroidered with gold they then rise and approach his holiness from whose hands they receive the palms when mass is sung the passion is recited by two ecclesiastics one narrates the words and accusation of jesus christ from the evangelists and the other answers for our blessed savior the clamor and uproar of the jews is imitated by the clergy a most curious procession makes part of this function the streets of rome through which it is to pass are strewed with sand and the pontiff accompanied by the cardinal makes a public entry in imitation of our savior into jerusalem all mounted upon mules and bearing branches of boxtree in their hands vain were the attempt to describe the horsemanship upon this occasion the obstinacy of the mules their kicking and curvetting and the embarrassments arising from the cardinals garments a litter covered with crimson velvet is provided for the popes use in case his holiness should come to the ground  the next principal ceremony is the tenebrae of the holy wednesday performed at five oclock in the afternoon in the chapel of st paulina in the vatican the tenebrae are chaunted as in other roman catholic churches but executed with more judgment and better voices the miserere dallegri concludes this function and is performed by vocal musicians only i own says lady millar i never heard music before i supposed i had formed some idea of the power and effects of the human voice but had i been conveyed blindfold into this chapel and no intimation given whence the sounds proceeded i should should have believed myself in paradise how then shall i attempt to convey the slightest idea of this celestial melody by any description i must say no more than that i have heard enough to make me dissatisfied with the finest opera and the most perfect performers that are to be found out of the chapel of st paulina  on maundy thursday the pope pronounces his benediction to the people from a balcony in st peters where an infinite crowd is collected on the occasion the manner and the form are more suitable to the holiness of his character says sharp than i was aware i understood he cursed all turks and heretics on the face of the earth whereas that part of the function is performed by two of the cardinal deacons who read the curse one in italian the other in latin and the words are no sooner out of their mouths than he pronounces the benediction and wipes off all its efficacy the pope is during this ceremony supported on the shoulders of twelve men in an armed chair holding in his hand a large lighted wax taper and in the very instant that the last words of the curse are uttered the bell tolls and he throws it down among the people which circumstance clearly explains the sense of a proverb well known in england of swearing or cursing by bell book and candle there are three or four exhortations delivered by his holiness previous to his reading the benediction these are that if the assembly would sincerely repent of their sins there was room for absolution and the benediction seemed to be as little arrogant as that pronounced by our ministers at the end of the liturgy in the moment that he speaks the benediction the bell tolls the drums beat and the cannon at the castle of st angelo fire which adds to the awfulness of the scene and renders the performance truly solemn  there is another curious ceremony performed this day that of the pope washing the pilgrims feet as it is expressed and serving them at the table these are thirteen poor priests of different nations the priest who sits in the middle represents our savior and the six on each side of him his apostles  on good friday and eastereve there are no extraordinary ceremonies the common miserere is chaunted but in the evening the church of st peter is crowded with people who walk about and converse it is remarkable that friday and saturday are not esteemed so sacred as the foregoing days of the holy week and that during the said week no shops are shut but trade and business go on as usual  on easter day the same function that was performed on thursday is repeated with this difference that there is no curse only the benediction the concourse of people is also greater as the peasants from the adjacent countries are more at leisure on sunday to come and partake of the blessing as it is a religious ceremony and the mob make all their religion consist in ceremony and due submission to the church and the priesthood there are no riots here as there would be with us the moment the cannon at the castle of st angelo fire the good people in the neighborhood who hear the report prostrate themselves and are supposed to have received the benefit of the benediction there are both days two squadrons of horse and a battalion of infantry which are no small ornament of the festival for though the troops of his holiness might possibly make no great figure in a field of battle they are well clothed and add much to the glory of the day and the beauty of st peters churchyard  another very important function in the church of rome is in the jubilee year the first jubilee was instituted by boniface the eighth in the year   00 many ceremonies and institutions of the roman catholic church are founded on those of the old heathens this is evidently in imitation of the roman secular games which were exhibited every hundredth year in honor of the gods they lasted three days and three nights they were attended with great pomp and drew vast numbers of people to rome from all parts of italy and the most distant provinces boniface recollecting this determined to institute something analogous which would immortalize his own name and promote the interest of the roman catholic religion in general and that of the city of rome in particular he embraced the favorable opportunity which the beginning of a century presented he invented a few extraordinary ceremonies and declared the year   00 the first jubilee year during which he assured mankind that heaven would be in a particular manner propitious in granting indulgences and remission of sins to all who should come to rome and attend the functions there to be performed at this fortunate period which was not to occur again for a hundred years this drew a great concourse of wealthy sinners to rome and the extraordinary circulation of money it occasioned was strongly felt all over the popes dominions clement the sixth regretting that these advantages should occur so seldom abridged the period and declared there would be a jubilee every fifty years the second was accordingly celebrated in the year    0 sixtus the fifth imagining that the interval was still too long once more retrenched the half and ever since there has been a jubilee every twentyfifth year it is not likely that any future pope will think of shortening this period if any alteration were again to place it most probably would be to restore the ancient period of fifty or a hundred years for instead of the wealthy pilgrims who flocked to rome from every quarter of christendom ninetynine in a hundred of those who come now are supported by alms during their journey or are barely able to defray their own expenses by the strictest economy and his holiness is supposed at present to derive no other advantage from the uncommon fatigue he is obliged to go through on the jubilee year except the satisfaction he feels in reflecting on the benefit his labors confer on the souls of beggars and other travelers who resort from all corners of italy to rome on this blessed occasion the states which border on the popes dominions suffer many temporal inconveniences from the zeal of the peasants and manufacturers the greater part of whom still make a point of visiting st peters on the jubilee year the loss sustained by the countries which such emigrants abandon is not balanced by any advantage transferred to that to which they resort by far the greater number of pilgrims come from the kingdom of naples whose inhabitants are said to be of a very devout and amorous disposition the first prompts them to go to rome in search of that absolution which the second renders necessary and on the year of the jubilee when indulgences are to be had at an easier rate than at any other time those who can afford it generally carry away such a stock as not only is sufficient to clear old scores but will also serve as an indemnifying fund for future transgressions  there is one door into the church of st peters which is called the holy door this is always walled up except on this distinguished year and even then no person is permitted to enter by it but in the humblest posture the pilgrims and many others prefer crawling into the church upon their knees by this door to walking in in the usual way by any other the shutting up of this door is performed with great ceremony the pope being seated on a raised seat or kind of throne surrounded by cardinals and other ecclesiastics an anthem is sung accompanied by all sorts of musical instruments during the performance his holiness descends from the throne with a golden trowel in his hand places the first brick and applies some mortar he then returns to his seat and the door is instantly built up by more expert workmen so to remain till the next jubilee when it is opened with the same solemnity that it is shut at the beginning of the last jubilee when the wall was thrown down men women and children scrambled and fought for the fragments with the same eagerness which less enlightened mobs display on days of public rejoicing when handfuls of money are thrown among them the catholics assert that these pieces of brick have the virtue of curing many of the most obstinate diseases and if newspapers were permitted at rome there is not the least reason to doubt that these cures would be attested publicly by the patients in a manner as satisfactory and convincing as are the cures performed daily by the pills powders drops and balsams advertised in the london newspapers after shutting the holy door mass is celebrated at midnight and the ceremony attended by vast multitudes of people  for my part says moore from whom we have taken the description of this ceremony i suspended my curiosity till next day which was christmas day when i went to st peters church and saw the pope perform mass on this solemn occasion  after mass the pope gave the benediction to the people assembled in the grand court before the church of st peter it was a remarkably fine day an immense multitude filled that spacious and magnificent area the horse and foot guards were drawn up in their most showy uniforms the pope seated in an open portable chair in all the splendour which his wardrobe could give with the tiara on his head was carried out of a large window which opens on a balcony in the front of st peters the silk hangings and gold trappings with which the chair was embellished concealed the men who carried it so that to those who viewed him from the area below his holiness seemed to sail forward from the window selfbalanced in the air like a celestial being the instant he appeared the music struck up the bells rang from every church and the cannon thundered from the castle of st angelo in repeated peals during the intervals the church of st peters the palace of the vatican and the banks of the tibur reechoed the acclamations of the populace at length his holiness arose from his seat and an immediate and awful silence ensued the multitude fell upon their knees with their hands and eyes raised toward his holiness as to a benign deity after a solemn pause he pronounced the benediction with great fervor elevating his outstretched arms as high as he could then closing them together and bringing them back to his breast with a slow motion as if he had got hold of the blessing and was drawing it gently from heaven finally he threw his arms open waving them for some time as if his intention had been to scatter the benediction with impartiality among the people  no ceremony can be better calculated for striking the senses and imposing on the understanding than this of the supreme pontiff giving the blessing from the balcony of st peters for my own part says moore and other writers have made similar remarks had i not in my early youth received impressions highly unfavourable to the chief actor in this magnificent interlude i should have been in danger of paying him a degree of respect very inconsistent with the religion in which i was educated  chap ix people their character customs and manners the condition of all the citizens of rome is as singular as the constitution under which they live and it is in this particular that modern rome is most like the ancient city in its most happy times that is to the year   0 from the foundation according to cicero there were scarce two thousand housekeepers who had any property qui rem haberent and it is much to be feared whether as many could be found among the hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand inhabitants which modern rome is supposed to contain  the great officers of state and eight or ten ancient families but eclipsed by four or five whom the triple crown has enriched and promoted these together with foreigners supply the public luxury but in this luxury alms bear a considerable part we have seen the richest roman prince not spending above one shilling per day on his table and the furniture of his house suitable to such parsimony yet distributing thousands of pounds in alms of various kinds this superabundance of charity which is to sloth as honey to hornets corresponds with the congiaria of the roman emperors and is productive of the same effect  the middle state every where else formed by citizens and tradespeople is unknown at rome there is no medium between opulence and poverty the rich are the richest of men and the poor the most indigent creatures in the world an excess never known in a wellgoverned state extremities touch each other every member of the state either gives or receives alms no small part of the wages of the numerous retinue of the cardinals and nobles consists in alms under the softening appellation of of buon mancie good festivals far agosto welcomes or good journies the eldest of every family under the respectable title of decano is in this respect the solicitor receiver and cashkeeper to his fellow servants in short it is a saying among the romans themselves that there is not a burgess of rome but would sell the very sun for a sixpence  persons of easy circumstances are not to be met with among the lower dignitaries of the church nor among the set of lawyers called curiales nor among those marquisses and counts who with the title of maestri di camera and scudieri are as profoundly versed in all matters of ceremony as the germans in civil law nor in short among the placemen belonging to the different officers of the court all these live more on hope than substance the demise of a pope and the vacancy occasioned thereby reduces them to alms the only class of people whose competence puts them on a footing with the other ranks are the consistorial counselors a fondness for ornament and parade is the hobbyhorse of the roman people to this all other inclinations give way it regulates and directs the expenses of the rich and great what they save in good cheer and on comfortable living they lavish on entertainments equipages liveries and external show equally ambitious of this are the people amid all their penury the shambles the butchers and their stalls are all set off with linen as white as snow the fruiterers shops are dispersed in curious designs as if for a fight the shoemaker and even the cobbler decorates his shop with scraps of gilded leather when some public festival approaches a whole family shall for a day or two in a week abate of their usual sustenance to furnish coachhire on these occasions this passion for glitter and parade opens the door to intrigues it is found with the lowest poverty all those of the lower class decked out so very fine at the public places have scarce a gown to their backs when at home one shift is their whole stock which good housewifery will not allow them to lie in and which every saturday after going through a slopwash is displayed at the windows till perfectly dry  magnificence hypocrisy and sadness reign here the number of fine palaces of beautiful churches of superb fountains of the treasures of art and venerable remains of antiquity give an air of grandeur to rome which is not to be found in any other country  the want of public entertainments the little population in proportion to the extent of the city and its situation surrounded by hills which prevent a free circulation of air added to the oppressive weight of the plumbeus auster of horace the scirocco wind seem to me the chief causes of its real sadness but what increases this apparent gloom is the air of sanctity which the romans affect and the general dress of the country which is black the habit of an abbe is the courtdress and as it is also the cheapest every one wears it every court is the abode of dissimulation at rome there are as many courts as cardinals every cardinal is a kind of prince and may become a sovereign this reason alone is sufficient to show that this country must have more hypocritical characters than any other  of all the sovereigns whom i have seen says sherlock the pope represents majesty the best the cardinals are like martials epigrams some good some bad but many more indifferent almost all derive honor from their rank  the women are reserved in public and in private extravagant to a degree the prelates effeminate the nobility with some few exceptions illiterate and the people wicked  the studies generally pursued are the law antiquities and divinity because these are the three principal roads that here lead to fortune a poet is considered as a dangerous or at best as an useless being and for this reason a poetic talent is rather oppressed than encouraged metastasio could not there find bread  we see here frequent occasion to admire the genius of corneille for the truth with which he has drawn the roman women the assurance of their eye the firmness of their step every feature of their face and every movement of their body declare the boldness of their souls they have a very noble air which is heightened by trailing robes and which they all wear down to the women of the third degree  the nation adds sherlock has something like pride which is not displeasing to me it is that sort of haughtiness we see in a man of ancient family fallen to decay but it has a desire of disguising itself which pleases no one the first proverb of the country is he who knows not how ta dissemble knows not how to live and they all know how to live they love obscurity in every thing  the roman has naturally a depth of understanding and strength of character he is easily moved and when he is moved he is violent to an excess if the dress of the country were military we should think ourselves as we walk the streets in ancient rome the faces we meet so much resemble the characters that history has transmitted to us this idea has often struck me among the men and it is still more striking in the women you will often say there is a woman who might well be the mother of gracchus and there is another who might produce a sylla the number of messalinas is small that of lucretias less and for sempronias qui soepius petunt viros quam petuntur i e who oftener seek for gallants than gallants for them they are to be found rather at naples than at rome  the following says sherlock is a mark of national distinction between a roman and a neapolitan woman a woman of naples is less modest than one of rome and more bashful neapolitan women have been often seen to blush but it is not possible to put a roman woman out of countenance  in their external deportment the italians remarks moore have a grave solemnity of manner which is sometimes thought to arise from a natural gloom of disposition the french above all other nations are apt to impute to melancholy the sedate serious air which accompanies reflection  though in a pulpit on the theater and even in common conversation the italians make use of a great deal of action yet italian vivacity is different from the french the former proceeds from sensibility the latter from animal spirits  the inhabitants of this country have not the brisk look and elastic trip which is universal in france they move rather with a flow composed pace and the people of the most finished fashion as well as the neglected vulgar seem to prefer the unconstrained attitude of the antinous and other antique statues to the artificial graces of a french dancing master or the erect strut of a german soldier  of all the countries in europe switzerland is that in which the beauties of nature appear in the greatest variety of forms and on the most magnificent scale in that country therefore the young landscape painter has the best chance of seizing the most sublime ideas but italy is the best school for the historic one not only from its being enriched with works of the greatest masters and the noblest models of antique sculpture but also on account of the fine expressive style of the italian countenance here are few or none of those fair flat glistening unmeaning faces so common in the more northern parts of europe i happened says moore once to sit by a foreigner of my acquaintance at the opera in london when a certain nobleman who was then a good deal talked of entered i whispered him  this is lord  not surely the famous lord  said he yes said i the very same it must then be acknowled continued he that the noble earl does infinite honor to those who had the care of his education how so rejoined i because replied the foreigner as a countenance so completely vacant strongly indicates a deficience of natural abilities it is to be presumed the respectable figure he makes in the senate is entirely owing to instruction  strangers on their arrival at rome form no high idea of the beauty of the roman women from the specimens they see in the fashionable circles to which they are first introduced there are some exceptions but in general it must be acknowledged that the present race of women of high rank are more distinguished by other ornaments than their beauty for brilliant red and white and all the charms of complexion no women can equal the english if a hundred english women were taken at random and compared with the same number at rome ninety of the english would be found handsomer than ninety of the romans but probably two or three in the hundred italians might have finer countenances than any of the english beauty in england is more remarkable in the country than in towns the peasantry of no country in europe can stand a competition in point of looks with those of england this race of people have the conveniences of life in no other country in such perfection they are no where so well fed so well defended from the injuries of the seasons and no where else do they keep themselves so perfectly clean and free from all vilifying effects of dirt in other countries the female peasants are so hard worked so ill sed so tanned and so dirty that it is difficult to know whether they have any beauty or not  with countenances so favorable for the pencil it will naturally be imagined that portraitpainting is in the highest perfection in rome the reverse however of this is true that branch of the art is in the lowest estimation all over italy in palaces the best furnished with pictures a portrait is seldom seen of the proprietor or of any of his family a quarterlength of the reigning pope is sometimes the only portrait of a living person to be seen in the whole palace several of the roman princes affect to have a room of state or audiencechamber in which is a raised seat like a throne with a canopy over it in those rooms the effigies of the pontiffs are hung they are the works of very inferior artists and seldom cost above three or four sequins as soon as his holiness departs this life the portrait disappears and the face of his successor is in due time hung up in its stead this it may be said is treating their old sovereign rather unkindly and paying no very expensive compliment to the new it is not so economical however as what was practiced by a certain person in another country he had a fulllength picture of his sovereign in the principal room of his house on his majestys death to save himself the expense of a fresh body and a new suit of ermine he employed a painter to brush out the face and perriwig and clap the new kings head on his grandfathers shoulders which he declared were in the utmost preservation and fully able to wear out three or four such heads as painters usually give in these degenerate days  the italians very seldom take the trouble of sitting for their pictures they consider a portrait as a piece of painting which engages the admiration of no one but the person it represents or the painter who drew it those who are in circumstances to pay the best artists generally employ them in subjects more universally interesting than the representation of human countenances staring out of a piece of canvas  the summers at rome are very tedious every one keeping close at home the whole day and taking their naps at rome so that it is a common saying there that none but dogs idiots and frenchmen walk the streets in the daytime the heat of the climate makes the romans passionately fond of spring water iced and cooling liquors and great quantities of snow and ice brought from the mountains and preserved in icehouses are consumed there  in regard to the unwholesomeness of the air the dog days and some weeks after are mostly dreaded at rome the precautions taken by the romans for the preservation of health during these heats would not be thought of by a foreigner one of their good rules is expressed in this sentence in june july and august a person must have no commerce with the ladies  but possibly this rule is but little observed it is farther affirmed that a person used to live at rome cannot without manifest danger keep within fifteen or twenty miles of that city and in traveling to rome they take care in the last days journey not to put up within that distance even within the city they seldom change their bedchamber though it be for another in the same house removals from one house to another between st peters and all saints days are supposed to be so dangerous at rome that a tenant or lodger cannot be compelled to leave a house within that term as mutual compliments pass between friends in other places at the beginning of the new year the like civility is paid here at the beginning of the month of august at this time of the year few people go abroad in the day time but after sunset divert themselves with taking the air on foot or in coaches and the first of august is a great day in rome for feasting and friendly entertainments  in england observes keysler suicides are most frequent in the beginning or toward the close of winter when the easterly winds most prevail but in rome the greatest enormities are perpetrated in the two hottest summer months this is imputed to the bloods being overheated at this season however the exertion of proper severity and the abolition of asylums in churches would soon cool this pretended ardour that prompts the romans to all manner of wickedness  that london should be more subject to fevers and fluxes when the northeast wind blows proceeds from the noxious effluvia which that wind brings from the fens and marshes of cambridgeshire lincolnshire and essex in rome the most sickly seasons are when the south or southeast wind blows which the italians call sirocco from the arabic word haloque its course being over the boggy uncultivated coasts of africa and the morasses that lie south of rome  after all the romans make too much ado about the danger of their summer heats foreigners who use very little precaution in this respect enjoy as good a state of health as the natives how many cardinals come from other countries to rome in summer when a conclave is to be held without so many timorous fears and return as well as they came but no one will pretend to say that heat has a respect to persons this chimerical danger seems to have been unknown in the time of cicero from whose epistles it appears that he frequently resided at rome during the summer months and took many journies to and from rome at that season of the year  there are few countries where a true judgment is so formed of strangers as at rome gens emunctae naris natura cui verba non potuit dare says a famous jesuit of the modern romans that is they are people of an acute discernment to whom nature has not given the power of unfolding their thoughts their custom of studying one another produces this habit of sagacity this is the polar star by which they steer their behavior toward those with whom they have any intercourse they cannot be long imposed upon either by a dull or promising physiognomy to them this is no more than the persona tragica the mask to the fox an appearance of frankness an air of gaiety entirely unhinges them and puzzles them the more as being less allied to that gravity in which they muffle themselves up that others may not see into them  this gravity never leaves them in public nor even in the parties of pleasure which seem contrived to shake it off in private however they make themselves amends nothing can be more cheerful than their clubs where a select party freely give themselves up to that tranquil gaiety suited to the natural seriousness of their character and in which consisted the urbanitas of the ancient romans there one may laugh even at persons who form part of the company there the spropositi of a foreigner esteemed so far as to be admitted among them and who is never reproved in public for not speaking the language correct are made matters of merriment there they laugh more and more heartily than in any other place and circulate a number of tales of which they have an inexorable fund and such excellent relaters are the romans that their manner always gives an air of novelty to their story let the following serve as a specimen  in the engagement between the devil and st michael the archangel finding his spear was rather an encumbrance than of any use to him darted up again to heaven and catching up a thunderbolt hurled it headlong at lucifer so that his body flew about in pieces his legs fell in france and hence the petulance of the french and their passion for rambling lucifers head went into spain and to this is owing the pride stiffness and overbearing carriage of the spaniards the hand with which the fiend used to pilfer naples got and that with which he squeezed people was genoas portion his stomach was picked up in germany and the least honorable parts of his body alighted in rome and this adds the romans has made all of us such whoremasters as we are  the italians have retained those words which other nations have cashiered as politeness and good manners began to prevail among them the objects expressed by these words are an ample field for the convivial muses in short italy swarms both with obscene and devout sonnets they are from their infancy accustomed to nudities as were the greeks and romans their ears are as little moved with the expression as their eyes with the representation of objects the indecency of which has been lessened by habit it was from a deeprooted custom that after benedict iv was exalted to the pontificate one of the most obscene words in the italian language equally escaped him both in his anger and mirth that is it was almost always on his tongue this word and its counterpart are the most common oaths or rather interjections among the romans per dio by god is seldom or ever heard on account of the penalties pronounced against persons guilty of blasphemy but per dio bacco is in every ones mouth  the merriment of private clubs never shows itself in public but during the carnival in no part of italy is that festival carried to such a pitch of extravagance and folly as at rome it is a perfect transcript of the ancient saturnalia in all its mad frolics  breach of chastity in females of low rank is not considered here in the same heinous light as in some parts of germany and great britain where it is deemed a crime of such magnitude as to require expiation by a public rebuke from the officiating minister in the middle of the church in these countries those who live in an open and avowed breach of chastity are generally more daringly wicked and devoid of principle than the italian women who take the same liberties in italy says moore women who never put any value on the virtue of chastity those who sell their favors for money display a goodness of character in other respects and continue their duty and attachment to their parents as long as they live foreigners who form a connection with a girl in this country find themselves very often obliged to maintain the father mother and whole family to which she belongs the lover generally considers this as a very troublesome circumstance and endeavors to inspire his italian mistress with that total neglect of her family which prevails among women of her stamp in other countries but he very seldom succeeds an italian woman is unwilling to quit her native city and her family even for a man she loves and seldom does till he makes some provision for her nearest relations they attend mass and the ceremonies of devotion with as much punctuality as if their lives were regular in all other respects  of their attending to the external functions of their religion with scrupulous exactness the above writer cites a remarkable trait in an italian woman of fashion who refused to have any farther connection with her cicisbeo or lover because her confessor had refused her absolution this lady was distinguished at rome for a punctilious observance of all the ceremonies appointed by the church she could not eat meat on a meagre day or deviate from the canonical regulation in any point of equal importance without remorse but in matters of gallantry she had the reputation of being infinitely more liberal both in her sentiments and practice she had been for some time provided with a very able and respectable lover of her own country this did not make her blind to the qualities of a young englishman with whom she formed a very intimate connection soon after his arrival at rome not that she preferred him to her last lover but merely from a strong sense of the truth and beauty of this arithmetical axiom that one and one make two the new arrangement with our countryman however pleasing to the lady gave offense to her father confessor the scrupulous ecclesiastic was of opinion that a connection of this nature with a heretic was more criminal than with a man of her own communion the englishman entered her apartments one day as the confessor went out she shut the door after him with a violence that shook the whole house muttering as she returned to her seat the devil go along with you for an old goose her lover expressed his concern on seeing her so much agitated no wonder said she that stubborn animalaccio who has just gone out has had the insolence to refuse me absolution as i expected you this morning i sent for him betimes that the matter might have been expedited before you should come but here have i been above an hour endeavoring to persuade him but all to no purpose nothing i could say was able to mollify the obstinate old greasy scoundrel the englishman joined in abusing the confessors perverseness hinting at the same time she ought to despise it as a matter of no importance that she was sure of receiving absolution sooner or later and that whenever it happened all the transactions of the internal would be comprehended in that one act of grace upon the strength of this reasoning he was proceeding to fulfill the purpose of his visit with as much alacrity as if the most complete discharge had been granted for all past proceedings  pian piano idol mio softly softly my love cried the lady bisogna rimettersi alla volunta di dio we must submit to the will of heaven she then told her lover that although she despised the confessor as much as he could do yet she must take care of her soul that not having settled her accounts with heaven for a long time she was determined not to begin a new score till the old was cleared off adding for her principal reason patto chiaro amico caro short accounts make long friends  end of vol xvi error in the writing to two plates of vol xvi for view of the lake of nerne called speculum diannae read view of the lake of nemi called speculum dianae celesten iii kicking the crown read celestin iii etc
