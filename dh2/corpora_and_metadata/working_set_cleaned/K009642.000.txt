the busy body a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by her majestys servants  written by mrs susanna centlivre  the second edition  quem tulit ad scenam ventoso gloria curru exanimat lentus spectator sedulus inflat sic leve sic parvum est animum quod laudis avarum subruit aut resicit  horat epist lib ii ep   london printed for bernard lintott at the crosskeys between the two templegates in fleet street  to the right honorable john lord summers lordpresident of her majestys most honorable privy council may it please your lordship as it is an established custom in these latter ages for all writers particularly the poetical to shelter their productions under the protection of the most distinguished whose approbation produces a kind of inspiration much superior to that which the heathenish poets pretended to derive from their fictitious apollo so it was my ambition to address one of my weak performances to your lordship who by universal consent are justly allowed to be the best judge of all kinds of writing  i was indeed at first deterred from my design by a thought that it might be accounted unpardonable rudeness to obtrude a trifle of this nature to a person whose sublime wisdom moderates that council which at this critical juncture overrules the fate of all europe but then i was encouraged by reflecting that lelius and scipio the two greatest men in their time among the romans both for political and military virtues in the height of their important affairs thought the perusal and improving of terences comedies the noblest way of unbinding their minds i own i were guilty of the highest vanity should i presume to put my composures in parallel with those of that celebrated dramatist but then again i hope that your lordships native goodness and generosity in condescension to the taste of the best and fairest part of the town who have been pleased to be diverted by the following scenes will excuse and overlook such faults as your nicer judgment might discern  and here my lord the occasion seems fair for me to engage in a panegyric upon those natural and acquired abilities which so brightly adorn your person but i shall resist that temptation being conscious of the inequality of a female pen to so masculine an attempt and having no other ambition than to subscribe my self  my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant susanna centlivre  prologue by the author of tunbridgewalks though modern prophets were exposed of late the author could not prophesy his fate if with such scenes an audience had been fired the poet must have really been inspired but these alas are melancholy days for modern prophets and for modern plays yet since prophetic lies please fools of fashion and women are so fond of agitation to men of sense i will prophesy anew and tell you wondrous things that will prove true undaunted colonels will to camps repair assured therell be no skirmishes this year on our own terms will flow the wished for peace all wars except twixt man and wife will cease the grand monarch may wish his son a throne but hardly will advance to lose his own this season most things bear a smiling face but playrs in summer have a dismal case since your appearance only is our act of grace court ladies will to country seats be gone my lord cannot all the year live great in town where wanting operas basset and a play they will sigh and stitch a gown to pass the time away gay citywives at tunbridge will appear whose husbands long have labored for an heir where many a courtier may their wants relieve but by the waters only they conceive the fleet street sempstress  toast of temple sparks that runs spruce neckcloths for attorneys clerks at cupids gardens will her hours regale sing fair dorinda and drink bottld ale at all assemblies rakes are up and down and gamesters where they think they are not known should i denounce our authors fate to day to cry down prophecies you would damn the play yet whims like these have sometimes made you laugh it is tattling all like isaac bickerstaff since war and places claim the bards that write be kind and bear a womans treat to night let your indulgence all her fears allay and none but womanhaters damn this play epilogue in me you see one busiebody more though you may have enough of one before with epilogues the busiebodys way we strive to help but sometimes mar a play at this mad sessions half condemned ever tried some in three days have been turned off and died in spite of parties their attempts are vain for like false prophets they never rise

george airy a birding thus early what forbidden game roused you so soon for no lawful occasion could invite a person of your figure abroad at such unfashionable hours   sir geo there are some men charles whom fortune has left free from inquietudes who are diligently studious to find out ways and means to make themselves uneasy   cha is it possible that any thing in nature can ruffle the temper of a man whom the four seasons of the year compliment with as many thousand pounds nay and a father at rest with his ancestors   sir geo why there it is now a man that wants money thinks none can be unhappy that has it but my affairs are in such a whimsical posture that it will require a calculation of my nativity to find if my gold will relieve me or not   cha ha ha ha never consult the stars about that gold has a power beyond them gold unlocks the midnight councils gold outdoes the wind becalms the ship or fills her sails gold is omnipotent below it makes whole armies fight or fly it buys even souls and bribes the wretches to betray their country then what can thy business be that gold will not serve thee in   sir geo why i am in love   cha in love  ha ha ha ha in love ha ha ha with what prithee a cherubin   sir geo no with a woman   cha a woman good ha ha ha and gold not help thee   sir geo but suppose i am in love with two    cha ay if you are in love with two hundred gold will fetch em i warrant thee boy but who are they who are they come   sir geo one is a lady whose face i never saw but witty as an angel the other beautiful as venus    cha and a fool    sir geo for ought i know for i never spoke to her but you can inform me i am charmed by the wit of one and dye for the beauty of the other   cha and pray which are you in quest of now   sir geo i prefer the sensual pleasure i am for her i have seen who is thy fathers ward miranda   cha nay then i pity you for the jew my father will no more part with her and  0000 pound than he would with a guinea to keep me from starving   sir geo now you see gold cannot do every thing charles   cha yes for it is her gold that bars my fathers gate against you   sir geo why if he is this avaricious wretch how came thou by such a liberal education   cha not a souse out of his pocket i assure you i had an uncle who defrayed that charge but for some little wildnesses of youth though he made me his heir left dad my guardian till i came to years of discretion which i presume the old gentleman will never think i am and now he has got the estate into his clutches it does me no more good than if it lay in prester johns dominions   sir geo what can thou find no stratagem to redeem it   cha i have made many essays to no purpose though want the mistress of invention still tempts me on yet still the old fox is too cunning for me  i am upon my last project which if it fails then for my last refuge a brown musket   sir geo what is it can i assist thee   cha not yet when you can i have confidence enough in you to ask it   sir geo i am always ready but what does he intend to do with miranda is she to be sold in private or will he put her up by way of auction at who bids most if so egad i am for him my gold as you say shall be subservient to my pleasure   cha to deal ingenuously with you sir george i know very little of her or home for since my uncles death and my return from travel i have never been well with my father he thinks my expenses too great and i his allowance too little he never sees me but he quarrels and to avoid that i shun his house as much as possible the report is he intends to marry her himself   sir geo can she consent to it   cha yes faith so they say but i tell you i am wholly ignorant of the matter miranda and i are like two violent members of a contrary party i can scarce allow her beauty though all the world does nor she me civility for that contempt i fancy she plays the motherinlaw already and sets the old gentleman on to do mischief   sir geo then i have your free consent to get her   cha ay and my helpinghand if occasion be   sir geo pugh yonder is a fool coming this way let us avoid him   cha what marplot no no he is my instrument there is a thousand conveniences in him he will lend me his money when he has any run of my errands and be proud on it in short he will pimp for me lie for me drink for me do any thing but fight for me and that i trust to my own arm for   sir geo nay then he is to be endured i never knew his qualifications before   enter marplot with a patch cross his face marpl dear charles yours  ha sir george airy the man in the world i have an ambition to be known to aside give me thy hand dear boy    cha a good assurance but hark ye how came your beautiful countenance clouded in the wrong place   marpl i must confess it is

when i have em pugh pox you cut the thread of my discourse  i would give ten guineas i say to be ranked in his acquaintance well it is a vast addition to a mans fortune according to the rout of the world to be seen in the company of leading men for then we are all thought to be politicians or whigs or jacks or highflyers or lowflyers or levellers  and so forth for you must know we all herd in parties now   cha then a fool for diversion is out of fashion i find   marpl yes without it be a mimicking fool and they are darlings every where but prithee introduce me   cha well on condition you will give us a true account how you came by that mourning nose i will   marpl i will do it   cha sir george here is a gentleman has a passionate desire to kiss your hand   sir geo oh i honor men of the sword and i presume this gentleman is lately come from spain or portugal  by his scars   marpl no really sir george mine sprung from civil fury happening last night into the groomporters  i had a strong inclination to go ten guineas with a sort of a sort of a  kind of a milk sop as i thought a pox of the dice he flung out and my pockets being empty as charles knows they sometimes are he proved a surly northbritain and broke my face for my deficiency   sir geo ha ha and did not you draw   marpl draw sir why i did but lay my hand upon my sword to make a swift retreat and he roared out now the deel a ma sol sir gin ye touch yer steel ise whip mine through yer wem   sir geo ha ha ha   cha ha ha ha ha safe was the word so you walked off i suppose   marpl yes for i avoid fighting purely to be serviceable to my friends you know    sir geo your friends are much obliged to you sir i hope you will rank me in that number   marpl sir george a bow from the side box or to be seen in your chariot

sufferers ah he is a covetous cheating sanctified curmudgeon that sir francis gripe is a damned old    cha i suppose friend you forget that he is my father    marpl i ask your pardon charles but it is for your sake i hate him well i say the world is mistaken in him his out side piety makes him every mans executor and his inside cunning makes him every heirs jailer egad charles i am half persuaded that you are some ward too and never of his getting for thou art as honest a debauchee as ever cuckolded man of quality   sir geo a pleasant fellow   cha the dog is diverting sometimes or there would be no enduring his impertinence he is pressing to be employed and willing to execute but some ill fate generally attends all he undertakes and he oftener spoils an intreague than helps it    marpl if i miscarry it is none of my fault i follow my instructions   cha yes witness the merchants wife   marpl pish pox that was an accident   sir geo what was it prithee   cha why you must know i had lent a certain merchant my hunting horses and was to have met his wife in his absence sending him alone with my groom to make the complement and to deliver a letter to the lady at the same time what does he do but gives the husband the letter and offers her the horses   marpl i remember you was even with me for you denied the letter to be yours and swore i had a design upon her which my bones paid for   cha come sir george let us walk round if you are not engaged for i have sent my man upon a little earnest business and i have ordered him to bring me the answer into the park   marpl business and i not know it egad i will watch him   sir geo i must beg your pardon charles i am to meet your father   cha my father   sir geo aye and about the oddest bargain perhaps you ever heard of but i will not

clothes for a disguise comes my old master into his closet which is right against her chamber door this struck us into a terrible fright  at length i put on a grave face and asked him if he was at leisure for his chocolate in hopes to draw him out of his hole but he snapd my nose off no i shall be busy here this two hours at which my poor mistress seeing no way of escape ordered me to wait on your ladyship with the sad relation   miran unhappy isabinda was ever any thing so unaccountable as the humor of sir jealousy traffic   patch oh madam it is his living so long in spain he vows he will spend half his estate but he will be a parliament man on purpose to bring in a bill for women to wear veils and the other odious spanish customs  he swears it is the height of impudence to have a woman seen barefaced even at church and scarce believes there is a true begotten child in the city   miran ha ha ha how the old fool torments himself suppose he could introduce his rigid rules  does he think we could not match them in contrivance no no let the tyrant man make what laws he will if there is a woman under the government i warrant she finds a way to break em is his mind set upon the spaniard for his soninlaw still   patch ay and he expects him by the next fleet which drives his daughter to melancholy and despair but madam i find you retain the same gay cheerful spirit you had when i waited on your ladyship  my lady is mighty good humored too and i have found a way to make sir jealousy believe i am wholly in his interest when my real design is to serve her he makes me her jailer and i set her at liberty   miran i knew thy prolifick brain would be of singular service to her or i had not parted with thee to her father   patch but madam the report is that you are going to marry your guardian   miran it is necessary such a report should be patch   patch but is it true madam   miran that is not absolutely necessary   patch i thought it was only the old strain coaxing him

wants what would she give now to be in this dissabilee in the  open air nay more in pursuit of the young fellow she likes for that is my case i assure thee   patch as for that madam she is even with you for though she cannot come abroad we have a way to bring him home in spite of old argus   miran now patch your opinion of my choice for here he comes  ha my guardian with him what can be the meaning of this i am sure sir francis cannot know me in this dress  let us observe em  they withdraw enter sir francis gripe and sir george airy sir fran verily sir george thou will repent throwing away thy money so for i tell thee sincerely miranda my charge does not love a young fellow they are all vicious and seldom make good husbands in sober sadness she cannot abide em   miran peeping in sober sadness you are mistaken  what can this mean   sir geo look ye sir francis whether she can or cannot abide young fellows is not the business will you take the fifty guineas   sir fran in good truth  i will not for i knew thy father he was a hearty wary man and i cannot consent that his son should squander away what he saved to no purpose   mirand peeping now in the name of wonder what bargain can he be driving about me for fifty guineas   patch i wish it bent for the first nights lodging madam   sir geo well sir francis since you are so conscientious for my fathers sake then permit me the favor gratis   miran peeping the favor of my life i believe it is as you said patch   sir fran no verily if thou do not buy thy experience thou will never be wise therefore give me a hundred and try fortune   sir geo the scruples arose i find from the scanty sum  let me see  a hundred guineas  takes em out of a purse and chinks em ha they have a very pretty sound and a very pleasing look

own peril be it   sir geo aye aye go on   sir fran imprimis you are to be admitted into my house in order to move your suit to miranda for the space of ten minutes without let or molestation provided

miranda and i shall laugh at him  well sir george ha ha ha take the last sound of your guineas ha ha ha chinks em  exit miran peeping sure he does not know i am miranda   sir geo a very extraordinary bargain i have made truly if she should be really in love with this old cuff now  psha that is morally impossible  but then what hopes have i to succeed i never spoke to her    miran peeping say you so then i am safe   sir geo what though my tongue never spoke my eyes said a thousand things and my hopes flattered me hers answered em if i am lucky  if not it is but a hundred guineas thrown away   miranda and patch come forwards miran upon what sir george   sir geo ha my incognito  upon a woman madam   miran they are the worst things you can deal in and damage the soonest your very breath

mistress of thy wit balances ten times the sum  prithee let me see thy face   miran by no means that may spoil your opinion of my sense    sir geo rather confirm it madam   patch so rob the lady of your gallantry sir   sir geo no child a dish of chocolate in the morning never spoils my dinner the other lady i design a set meal so there is no danger    miran matrimony ha ha ha what crimes have you committed against the god of love that he should revenge em so severely to stamp husband upon your forehead    sir geo for my folly in having so often met you here without pursuing the laws of nature and exercising her command  but i resolve ever we part now to know who you are where you live and what kind of flesh and blood your face is therefore unmask and dont put me to the trouble of doing it for you   miran my face is the same flesh and blood with my hand sir george which if you will be so rude to provoke   sir geo you will apply it to my cheek  the ladies favors are always welcome but i must have that cloud withdrawn taking hold of her remember you are in the park child and what a terrible thing would it be to lose this pretty white hand   miran and how will it sound in a chocolatehouse that sir george airy rudely pulled off a ladies mask when he had given her his honor that he never would directly or indirectly endeavor to know her till she gave him leave   patch i wish we were safe out   sir geo but if that lady thinks fit to pursue and meet me at every turn like some troubled spirit shall i be blamed if i inquire into the reality i would have nothing dissatisfied in a female shape   miran what shall i do pause   sir geo ay prithee consider for thou shall find me very much at thy service   batch suppose sir the lady should be in love with you   sir geo oh i will return the obligation in a moment   patch and marry her   sir geo ha ha ha that is not the way to love her child   miran if he discovers me i shall die  which way shall i escape  let me

night i loved you drawing back and when you left the place grief seized me so  no rest my heart no sleep my eyes could know   last i resolved a hazardous point to try and quit the place in search of liberty exit sir geo excellent  i hope she is handsome  well now madam to the other two things your name and where you live  i am a gentleman and this confession will not be lost upon me  nay prithee dont weep but go on  for i find my heart melts in thy behalf  speak quickly or i shall turn about  not yet  poor lady she expects i should comfort her and to do her justice she has said enough to encourage me turns about ha gone the devil jilted why what a tale has she invented  of paris balls and birthdays  egad i would give ten guineas to know who this gypsy is  a curse of my folly  i
